Part THE SHADOW BEFORE They begin The perfections are sharpened The flower spreads its colored petals wide in the sun But the tongue of the bee misses them They sink back into the loam crying out you may call it a cry that creeps over them a shiver as they wilt and disappear William Carlos Williams Paterson Born down in a dead mans town Bruce Springsteen Chapter  AFTER THE FLOOD   The terror which would not end for another twentyeight yearsif it ever did endbegan so far as I know or can tell with a boat made from a sheet of newspaper floating down a gutter swollen with rain The boat bobbed listed righted itself again dived bravely through treacherous whirlpools and continued on its way down Witcham Street toward the traffic light which marked the intersection of Witcham and Jackson The three vertical lenses on all sides of the traffic light were dark this afternoon in the fall of  and the houses were all dark too There had been steady rain for a week now and two days ago the winds had come as well Most sections of Derry had lost their power then and it was not back on yet A small boy in a yellow slicker and red galoshes ran cheerfully along beside the newspaper boat The rain had not stopped but it was finally slackening It tapped on the yellow hood of the boys slicker sounding to his ears like rain on a shed roof a comfortable almost cozy sound The boy in the yellow slicker was George Denbrough He was six His brother William known to most of the kids at Derry Elementary School and even to the teachers who would never have used the nickname to his face as Stuttering Bill was at home hacking out the last of a nasty case of influenza In that autumn of  eight months before the real horrors began and twentyeight years before the final showdown Stuttering Bill was ten years old Bill had made the boat beside which George now ran He had made it sitting up in bed his back propped against a pile of pillows while their mother played Fur Elise on the piano in the parlor and rain swept restlessly against his bedroom window About threequarters of the way down the block as one headed toward the intersection and the dead traffic light Witcham Street was blocked to motor traffic by smudgepots and four orange sawhorses Stencilled across each of the horses was DERRY DEPT OF PUBLIC WORKS Beyond them the rain had spilled out of gutters clogged with branches and rocks and big sticky piles of autumn leaves The water had first pried fingerholds in the paving and then snatched whole greedy handfulsall of this by the third day of the rains By noon of the fourth day big chunks of the streets surface were boating through the intersection of Jackson and Witcham like miniature whitewater rafts By that time many people in Derry had begun to make nervous jokes about arks The Public Works Department had managed to keep Jackson Street open but Witcham was impassable from the sawhorses all the way to the center of town But everyone agreed the worst was over The Kenduskeag Stream had crested just below its banks in the Barrens and bare inches below the concrete sides of the Canal which channelled it tightly as it passed through downtown Right now a gang of menZack Denbrough Georges and Bills father among themwere removing the sandbags they had thrown up the day before with such panicky haste Yesterday overflow and expensive flood damage had seemed almost inevitable God knew it had happened beforethe flooding in  had been a disaster which had cost millions of dollars and almost two dozen lives That was a long time ago but there were still enough people around who remembered it to scare the rest One of the flood victims had been found twentyfive miles east in Bucksport The fish had eaten this unfortunate gentlemans eyes three of his fingers his penis and most of his left foot Clutched in what remained of his hands had been a Ford steering wheel Now though the river was receding and when the new Bangor Hydro dam went in upstream the river would cease to be a threat Or so said Zack Denbrough who worked for Bangor Hydroelectric As for the restwell future floods could take care of themselves The thing was to get through this one to get the power back on and then to forget it In Derry such forgetting of tragedy and disaster was almost an art as Bill Denbrough would come to discover in the course of time George paused just beyond the sawhorses at the edge of a deep ravine that had been cut through the tar surface of Witcham Street This ravine ran on an almost exact diagonal It ended on the far side of the street roughly forty feet farther down the hill from where he now stood on the right He laughed aloudthe sound of solitary childish glee a bright runner in that gray afternoonas a vagary of the flowing water took his paper boat into a scalemodel rapids which had been formed by the break in the tar The urgent water had cut a channel which ran along the diagonal and so his boat travelled from one side of Witcham Street to the other the current carrying it so fast that George had to sprint to keep up with it Water sprayed out from beneath his galoshes in muddy sheets Their buckles made a jolly jingling as George Denbrough ran toward his strange death And the feeling which filled him at that moment was clear and simple love for his brother Bill love and a touch of regret that Bill couldnt be here to see this and be a part of it Of course he would try to describe it to Bill when he got home but he knew he wouldnt be able to make Bill see it the way Bill would have been able to make him see it if their positions had been reversed Bill was good at reading and writing but even at his age George was wise enough to know that wasnt the only reason why Bill got all As on his report cards or why his teachers liked his compositions so well Telling was only part of it Bill was good at seeing The boat nearly whistled along the diagonal channel just a page torn from the Classified section of the Derry News but now George imagined it as a FT boat in a war movie like the ones he sometimes saw down at the Derry Theater with Bill at Saturday matinees A war picture with John Wayne fighting the Japs The prow of the newspaper boat threw sprays of water to either side as it rushed along and then it reached the gutter on the left side of Witcham Street A fresh streamlet rushed over the break in the tar at this point creating a fairly large whirlpool and it seemed to him that the boat must be swamped and capsize It leaned alarmingly and then George cheered as it righted itself turned and went racing on down toward the intersection George sprinted to catch up Over his head a grim gust of October wind rattled the trees now almost completely unburdened of their freight of colored leaves by the storm which had been this year a reaper of the most ruthless sort  Sitting up in bed his cheeks still flushed with heat but his fever like the Kenduskeag finally receding Bill had finished the boatbut when George reached for it Bill held it out of reach NNow get me the ppparaffin Whats that Where is it Its on the cellar shuhshuhshelf as you go ddownstairs Bill said In a box that says GuhGuhhulf Gulf Bring that to me and a knife and a bbowl And a puhpack of muhmuhmatches George had gone obediently to get these things He could hear his mother playing the piano not Fur Elise now but something else he didnt like so wellsomething that sounded dry and fussy he could hear rain flicking steadily against the kitchen windows These were comfortable sounds but the thought of the cellar was not a bit comfortable He did not like the cellar and he did not like going down the cellar stairs because he always imagined there was something down there in the dark That was silly of course his father said so and his mother said so and even more important Bill said so but still  He did not even like opening the door to flick on the light because he always had the ideathis was so exquisitely stupid he didnt dare tell anyonethat while he was feeling for the light switch some horrible clawed paw would settle lightly over his wrist and then jerk him down into the darkness that smelled of dirt and wet and dim rotted vegetables Stupid There were no things with claws all hairy and full of killing spite Every now and then someone went crazy and killed a lot of peoplesometimes Chet Huntley told about such things on the evening newsand of course there were Commies but there was no weirdo monster living down in their cellar Still this idea lingered In those interminable moments while he was groping for the switch with his right hand his left arm curled around the doorjamb in a deathgrip that cellar smell seemed to intensify until it filled the world Smells of dirt and wet and longgone vegetables would merge into one unmistakable ineluctable smell the smell of the monster the apotheosis of all monsters It was the smell of something for which he had no name the smell of It crouched and lurking and ready to spring A creature which would eat anything but which was especially hungry for boymeat He had opened the door that morning and had groped interminably for the switch holding the jamb in his usual deathgrip his eyes squinched shut the tip of his tongue poked from the corner of his mouth like an agonized rootlet searching for water in a place of drought Funny Sure You betcha Lookit you Georgie Georgies scared of the dark What a baby The sound of the piano came from what his father called the living room and what his mother called the parlor It sounded like music from another world far away the way talk and laughter on a summercrowded beach must sound to an exhausted swimmer who struggles with the undertow His fingers found the switch Ah They snapped itand nothing No light Oh cripes The power George snatched his arm back as if from a basket filled with snakes He stepped back from the open cellar door his heart hurrying in his chest The power was out of coursehe had forgotten the power was out Jeezlycrow What now Go back and tell Bill he couldnt get the box of paraffin because the power was out and he was afraid that something might get him as he stood on the cellar stairs something that wasnt a Commie or a mass murderer but a creature much worse than either That it would simply slither part of its rotted self up between the stair risers and grab his ankle That would go over big wouldnt it Others might laugh at such a fancy but Bill wouldnt laugh Bill would be mad Bill would say Grow up Georgie do you want this boat or not As if this thought were his cue Bill called from his bedroom did you dddie out there JuhGeorgie No Im gettin it Bill George called back at once He rubbed at his arms trying to make the guilty gooseflesh disappear and be smooth skin again I just stopped to get a drink of water Well hhurry up So he walked down the four steps to the cellar shelf his heart a warm beating hammer in his throat the hair on the nape of his neck standing at attention his eyes hot his hands cold sure that at any moment the cellar door would swing shut on its own closing off the white light falling through the kitchen windows and then he would hear It something worse than all the Commies and murderers in the world worse than the Japs worse than Attila the Hun worse than the somethings in a hundred horror movies It growling deeplyhe would hear the growl in those lunatic seconds before it pounced on him and unzipped his guts The cellarsmell was worse than ever today because of the flood Their house was high on Witcham Street near the crest of the hill and they had escaped the worst of it but there was still standing water down there that had seeped in through the old rock foundations The smell was low and unpleasant making you want to take only the shallowest breaths George sifted through the junk on the shelf as fast as he couldold cans of Kiwi shoepolish and shoepolish rags a broken kerosene lamp two mostly empty bottles of Windex an old flat can of Turtle wax For some reason this can struck him and he spent nearly thirty seconds looking at the turtle on the lid with a kind of hypnotic wonder Then he tossed it back and here it was at last a square box with the word GULF on it George snatched it and ran up the stairs as fast as he could suddenly aware that his shirttail was out and suddenly sure that his shirttail would be his undoing the thing in the cellar would allow him to get almost all the way out and then it would grab the tail of his shirt and snatch him back and  He reached the kitchen and swept the door shut behind him It banged gustily He leaned back against it with his eyes closed sweat popped out on his arms and forehead the box of paraffin gripped tightly in one hand The piano had come to a stop and his moms voice floated to him Georgie cant you slam that door a little harder next time Maybe you could break some of the plates in the Welsh dresser if you really tried Sorry Mom he called back Georgie you waste Bill said from his bedroom He pitched his voice low so their mother would not hear George snickered a little His fear was already gone it had slipped away from him as easily as a nightmare slips away from a man who awakes coldskinned and gasping from its grip who feels his body and stares at his surroundings to make sure that none of it ever happened and who then begins at once to forget it Half is gone by the time his feet hit the floor threequarters of it by the time he emerges from the shower and begins to towel off all of it by the time he finishes his breakfast All gone until the next time when in the grip of the nightmare all fears will be remembered That turtle George thought going to the counter drawer where the matches were kept Where did I see a turtle like that before But no answer came and he dismissed the question He got a pack of matches from the drawer a knife from the rack holding the sharp edge studiously away from his body as his dad had taught him and a small bowl from the Welsh dresser in the dining room Then he went back into Bills room WWhat an ahole you are JuhGeorgie Bill said amiably enough and pushed back some of the sickstuff on his nighttable an empty glass a pitcher of water Kleenex books a bottle of Vicks VapoRubthe smell of which Bill would associate all his life with thick phlegmy chests and snotty noses The old Philco radio was there too playing not Chopin or Bach but a Little Richard tune very softly however so softly that Little Richard was robbed of all his raw and elemental power Their mother who had studied classical piano at Juilliard hated rock and roll She did not merely dislike it she abominated it Im no ahole George said sitting on the edge of Bills bed and putting the things he had gathered on the nighttable Yes you are Bill said Nothing but a great big brown ahole thats you George tried to imagine a kid who was nothing but a great big ahole on legs and began to giggle Your ahole is bigger than Augusta Bill said beginning to giggle too Four ahole is bigger than the whole state George replied This broke both boys up for nearly two minutes There followed a whispered conversation of the sort which means very little to anyone save small boys accusations of who was the biggest ahole who had the biggest ahole which ahole was the brownest and so on Finally Bill said one of the forbidden wordshe accused George of being a big brown shitty aholeand they both got laughing hard Bills laughter turned into a coughing fit As it finally began to taper off by then Bills face had gone a plummy shade which George regarded with some alarm the piano stopped again They both looked in the direction of the parlor listening for the pianobench to scrape back listening for their mothers impatient footsteps Bill buried his mouth in the crook of his elbow stifling the last of the coughs pointing at the pitcher at the same time George poured him a glass of water which he drank off The piano began once moreFur Elise again Stuttering Bill never forgot that piece and even many years later it never failed to bring gooseflesh to his arms and back his heart would drop and he would remember My mother was playing that the day Georgie died Bill pulled a Kleenex from the box made a rumbling sound in his chest spat phlegm into the tissue screwed it up and tossed it into the wastebasket by his bed which was filled with similar twists of tissue Then he opened the box of paraffin and dropped a waxy cube of the stuff into his palm George watched him closely but without speaking or questioning Bill didnt like George talking to him while he did stuff but George had learned that if he just kept his mouth shut Bill would usually explain what he was doing Bill used the knife to cut off a small piece of the paraffin cube He put the piece in the bowl then struck a match and put it on top of the paraffin The two boys watched the small yellow flame as the dying wind drove rain against the window in occasional spatters Got to waterproof the boat or itll just get wet and sink Bill said When he was with George his stutter was lightsometimes he didnt stutter at all In school however it could become so bad that talking became impossible for him Communication would cease and Bills schoolmates would look somewhere else while Bill clutched the sides of his desk his face growing almost as red as his hair his eyes squeezed into slits as he tried to winch some word out of his stubborn throat Sometimesmost timesthe word would come Other times it simply refused He had been hit by a car when he was three and knocked into the side of a building he had remained unconscious for seven hours Mom said it was that accident which had caused the stutter George sometimes got the feeling that his dadand Bill himselfwas not so sure The piece of paraffin in the bowl was almost entirely melted The matchflame guttered lower growing blue as it hugged the cardboard stick and then it went out Bill dipped his finger into the liquid jerked it out with a faint hiss He smiled apologetically at George Hot he said After a few seconds he dipped his finger in again and began to smear the wax along the sides of the boat where it quickly dried to a milky haze Okay Just dont get any on the blankets or Momll kill you George dipped his finger into the paraffin which was now very warm but no longer hot and began to spread it along the other side of the boat Dont put on so much you ahole Bill said You want to sink it on its mmaiden cruise George finished the other side then held the boat in his hands It felt a little heavier but not much Too cool he said Im gonna go out and sail it Yeah you do that Bill said He suddenly looked tiredtired and still not very well I wish you could come George said He really did Bill sometimes got bossy after awhile but he always had the coolest ideas and he hardly ever hit Its your boat really Well George shifted from one foot to the other the boat in his hands You put on your rainstuff Bill said or youll wind up with the fluhhu like me Probably catch it anyway from my juhgerms Thanks Bill Its a neat boat And he did something he hadnt done for a long time something Bill never forgot he leaned over and kissed his brothers cheek Youll catch it for sure now you ahole Bill said but he seemed cheered up all the same He smiled at George Put all this stuff back too Or Momll have a bbird Sure He gathered up the waterproofing equipment and crossed the room the boat perched precariously on top of the paraffin box which was sitting askew in the little bowl Sure His brow creased a little That was something your mom said not your big brother It was as strange as him giving Bill a kiss sure I will Now here he was chasing his boat down the left side of Witcham Street He was running fast but the water was running faster and his boat was pulling ahead He heard a deepening roar and saw that fifty yards farther down the hill the water in the gutter was cascading into a stormdrain that was still open Ii was a long dark semicircle cut into the curbing and as George watched a stripped branch its bark as dark and glistening as sealskin shot into the stormdrains maw It hung up there for a moment and then slipped down inside That was where his boat was headed He put on speed and for a moment he thought he would catch the boat Then one of his feet slipped and he went sprawling skinning one knee and crying out in pain From his new pavementlevel perspective he watched his boat swing around twice momentarily caught in another whirlpool and then disappear Shit and Shinola he yelled again and slammed his fist down on the pavement That hurt too and he began to cry a little What a stupid way to lose the boat He got up and walked over to the stormdrain He dropped to his knees and peered in The water made a dank hollow sound as it fell into the darkness It was a spooky sound It reminded him ofHuh The sound was jerked out of him as if on a string and he recoiled There were yellow eyes in there the sort of eyes he had always imagined but never actually seen down in the basement Its an animal he thought incoherently thats all it is some animal maybe a housecat that got stuck down in there Still he was ready to runwould run in a second or two when his mental switchboard had dealt with the shock those two shiny yellow eyes had given him He felt the rough surface of the macadam under his fingers and the thin sheet of cold water flowing around them He saw himself getting up and backing away and that was when a voicea perfectly reasonable and rather pleasant voicespoke to him from inside the stormdrain George blinked and looked again He could barely credit what he saw it was like something from a madeup story or a movie where you know the animals will talk and dance If he had been ten years older he would not have believed what he was seeing but he was not sixteen He was six There was a clown in the stormdrain The light in there was far from good but it was good enough so that George Denbrough was sure of what he was seeing It was a clown like in the circus or on TV In fact he looked like a cross between Bozo and Clarabell who talked by honking his or was it herGeorge was never really sure of the gender horn on Howdy Doody Saturday morningsBuffalo Bob was just about the only one who could understand Clarabell and that always cracked George up The face of the clown in the stormdrain was white there were funny tufts of red hair on either side of his bald head and there was a big clownsmile painted over his mouth If George had been inhabiting a later year he would have surely thought of Ronald McDonald before Bozo or Clarabell The clown held a bunch of balloons all colors like gorgeous ripe fruit in one hand George smiled back He couldnt help it it was the kind of smile you just had to answer I sure do he said The clown laughed I sure do Thats good Thats very good And how about a balloon Well sure He reached forward and then drew his hand reluctantly back Im not supposed to take stuff from strangers My dad said so Very wise of your dad the clown in the stormdrain said smiling How George wondered could I have thought his eyes were yellow They were a bright dancing blue the color of his moms eyes and Bills Very wise indeed Therefore I will introduce myself I Georgie am Mr Bob Gray also known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown Pennywise meet George Denbrough George meet Pennywise And now we know each other Im not a stranger to you and youre not a stranger to me Keerect George giggled I guess so He reached forward again and drew his hand back again How did you get down there Storm just bleeeew me away Pennywise the Dancing Clown said It blew the whole circus away Can you smell the circus Georgie George leaned forward Suddenly he could smell peanuts Hot roasted peanuts And vinegar The white kind you put on your french fries through a hole in the cap He could smell cotton candy and frying doughboys and the faint but thunderous odor of wildanimal shit He could smell the cheery aroma of midway sawdust And yet And yet under it all was the smell of flood and decomposing leaves and dark stormdrain shadows That smell was wet and rotten The cellarsmell Want your boat Georgie Pennywise asked I only repeat myself because you really do not seem that eager He held it up smiling He was wearing a baggy silk suit with great big orange buttons A bright tie electricblue flopped down his front and on his hands were big white gloves like the kind Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck always wore And a balloon Ive got red and green and yellow and blue Float The clowns grin widened Oh yes indeed they do They float And theres cotton candy What he saw then was terrible enough to make his worst imaginings of the thing in the cellar look like sweet dreams what he saw destroyed his sanity in one clawing stroke They float the thing in the drain crooned in a clotted chuckling voice It held Georges arm in its thick and wormy grip it pulled George toward that terrible darkness where the water rushed and roared and bellowed as it bore its cargo of storm debris toward the sea George craned his neck away from that final blackness and began to scream into the rain to scream mindlessly into the white autumn sky which curved above Derry on that day in the fall of His screams were shrill and piercing and all up and down Witcham Street people came to thenwindows or boiled out onto their porches They float it growled they float Georgie and when youre down here with me youll float too Georges shoulder socked against the cement of the curb and Dave Gardener who had stayed home from his job at The Shoeboat that day because of the flood saw only a small boy in a yellow rainslicker a small boy who was screaming and writhing in the gutter with muddy water surfing over his face and making his screams sound bubbly Everything down here floats that chuckling rotten voice whispered and suddenly there was a ripping noise and a flaring sheet of agony and George Denbrough knew no more Dave Gardener was the first to get there and although he arrived only fortyfive seconds after the first scream George Denbrough was already dead Gardener grabbed him by the back of the slicker pulled him into the street and began to scream himself as Georges body turned over in his hands The left side of Georges slicker was now bright red Blood flowed into the stormdrain from the tattered hole where the left arm had been A knob of bone horribly bright peeked through the torn cloth The boys eyes stared up into the white sky and as Dave staggered away toward the others already running pellmell down the street they began to fill up with rain Somewhere below in the stormdrain that was already filled nearly to capacity with runoff there could have been no one down there the County Sheriff would later exclaim to a Derry News reporter with a frustrated fury so great it was almost agony Hercules himself would have been swept away in that driving current Georges newspaper boat shot onward through nighted chambers and long concrete hallways that roared and chimed with water For awhile it ran neckandneck with a dead chicken that floated with its yellowy reptilian toes pointed at the dripping ceiling then at some junction east of town the chicken was swept off to the left while Georges boat went straight An hour later while Georges mother was being sedated in the Emergency Room at Derry Home Hospital and while Stuttering Bill sat stunned and white and silent in his bed listening to his father sob hoarsely in the parlor where his mother had been playing Fur Elise when George went out the boat shot out through a concrete loophole like a bullet exiting the muzzle of a gun and ran at speed down a sluiceway and into an unnamed stream When it joined the boiling swollen Penobscot River twenty minutes later the first rifts of blue had begun to show in the sky overhead The storm was over The boat dipped and swayed and sometimes took on water but it did not sink the two brothers had waterproofed it well I do not know where it finally fetched up if ever it did perhaps it reached the sea and sails there forever like a magic boat in a fairytale All I know is that it was still afloat and still running on the breast of the flood when it passed the incorporated town limits of Derry Maine and there it passes out of this tale forever The reason Adrian was wearing the hat his sobbing boyfriend would later tell the police was because he had won it at the Pitch Til U Win stall on the Bassey Park fairgrounds just six days before his death He was proud of it He was wearing it because he loved this shitty little town the boyfriend Don Hagarty screamed at the cops Now nowtheres no need for that sort of language Officer Harold Gardener told Hagarty Harold Gardener was one of Dave Gardeners our sons On the day his father had discovered the lifeless onearmed body of George Denbrough Harold Gardener had been five On this day almost twentyseven years later he was thirtytwo and balding Harold Gardener recognized the reality of Don Hagartys grief and pain and at the same time found it impossible to take seriously This manif you want to call him a manwas wearing lipstick and satin pants so tight you could almost read the wrinkles in his cock Grief or no grief pain or no pain he was after all just a queer Like his friend the late Adrian Mellon Lets go through it again Harolds partner Jeffrey Reeves said The two of you came out of the Falcon and turned toward the Canal Then what How many times do I have to tell you idiots Hagarty was still screaming They killed him They pushed him over the side Just another day in Macho City for them Don Hagarty began to cry One more time Reeves repeated patiently You came out of the Falcon Then what In an interrogation room just down the hall two Derry cops were speaking with Steve Dubay seventeen in the Clerk of Probates office upstairs two more were questioning John Webby Garton eighteen and in the Chief of Polices office on the fifth floor Chief Andrew Rademacher and Assistant District Attorney Tom Boutillier were questioning fifteenyearold Christopher Unwin Unwin who wore faded jeans a greasesmeared teeshirt and blocky engineer boots was weeping Rademacher and Boutillier had taken him because they had quite accurately assessed him as the weak link in the chain Lets go through it again Boutillier said in this office just as Jeffrey Reeves was saying the same thing two floors down We didnt mean to kill him Unwin blubbered It was the hat We couldnt believe he was still wearing the hat after you know after what Webby said the first time And I guess we wanted to scare him Yes to Webby Unwin burst into fresh tears But we tried to save him when we saw he was in trouble at least me and Stevie Dubay did we didnt mean to kill him Come on Chris dont shit us Boutillier said You threw the little queer into the Canal And the three of you came in to make a clean breast of things Chief Rademacher and I appreciate that dont we Andy You bet It takes a man to own up to what he did Chris So dont fuck yourself up by lying now You meant to throw him over the minute you saw him and his fag buddy coming out of the Falcon didnt you Boutillier took a pack of Marlboros from his shirt pocket and stuck one in his mouth He offered the pack to Unwin Cigarette Unwin took one Boutillier had to chase the tip with a match in order to give him a light because of the way Unwins mouth was trembling But when you saw he was wearing the hat Rademacher asked Unwin dragged deep lowered his head so that his greasy hair fell in his eyes and jetted smoke from his nose which was littered with blackheads Boutillier leaned forward brown eyes gleaming His face was predatory but his voice was gentle What Chris I said yes I guess so To throw him in But not to kill him He looked up at them face frantic and miserable and still unable to comprehend the stupendous changes which had taken place in his life since he left the house to take in the last night of Derrys Canal Days Festival with two of his buddies at seventhirty the previous evening Not to kill him he repeated And that guy under the bridge I still dont know who he was What guy was that Rademacher asked but without much interest They had heard this part before as well and neither of them believed itsooner or later men accused of murder almost always drag out that mysterious other guy Boutillier even had a name for it he called it the OneArmed Man Syndrome after that old TV series The Fugitive The guy in the clown suit Chris Unwin said and shivered The guy with the balloons The Canal Days Festival which ran from July th to July st had been a rousing success most Derry residents agreed a great thing for the citys morale image and pocketbook The weeklong festival was pegged to mark the centenary of the opening of the Canal which ran through the middle of downtown It had been the Canal which had fully opened Derry to the lumber trade in the years to  it had been the Canal which had birthed Derrys boom years The town was spruced up from east to west and north to south Potholes which some residents swore hadnt been patched for ten years or more were neatly filled with hottop and rolled smooth The town buildings were refurbished on the inside repainted on the outside The worst of the graffiti in Bassey Parkmuch of it coolly logical antigay statements such as KILL ALL QUEERS and AIDS FROM GOD YOU HELLHOUND HOMOSwas sanded off the benches and wooden walls of the little covered walkway over the Canal known as the Kissing Bridge A Canal Days Museum was installed in three empty storefronts downtown and filled with exhibits by Michael Hanlon a local librarian and amateur historian The towns oldest families loaned freely of their almost priceless treasures and during the week of the festival nearly forty thousand visitors paid a quarter each to look at eatinghouse menus from the s loggers bitts axes and peaveys from the s childrens toys from the s and over two thousand photographs and nine reels of movie film of life as it had been in Derry over the last hundred years The museum was sponsored by the Derry Ladies Society which vetoed some of Hanlons proposed exhibits such as the notorious trampchair from the s and photographs such as those of the Bradley Gang after the notorious shootout But all agreed it was a great success and no one really wanted to see those gory old things anyway It was so much better to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative as the old song said There was a huge striped refreshment tent in Derry Park and band concerts there every night In Bassey Park there was a carnival with rides by Smokeys Greater Shows and games run by local townfolk A special tramcar circled the historic sections of the town every hour on the hour and ended up at this gaudy and amiable moneymachine It was here that Adrian Mellon won the hat which would get him killed the paper tophat with the flower and the band which said I DERRY Im tired John Webby Garton said Like his two friends he was dressed in unconscious imitation of Bruce Springsteen although if asked he would probably call Springsteen a wimp or a fagola and would instead profess admiration for such bitchin heavymetal groups as Def Leppard Twisted Sister or Judas Priest The sleeves of his plain blue teeshirt were torn off showing his heavily muscled arms His thick brown hair fell over one eyethis touch was more John Cougar Mellencamp than Springsteen There were blue tattoos on his armsarcane symbols which looked as if they had been drawn by a child I dont want to talk no more Just tell us about Tuesday afternoon at the fair Paul Hughes said Hughes was tired and shocked and dismayed by this whole sordid business He thought again and again that it was as if Derry Canal Days ended with one final event which everyone had somehow known about but which no one had quite dared to put down on the Daily Program of Events If they had it would have looked like this Saturday PM Final band concert featuring the Derry High School Band and the Barber Shop MelloMen Saturday PM Ritual sacrifice of Adrian Mellon officially ends Canal Days Just what you said to Mellon and what he said to you Garton saw the two of them Mellon and Hagarty mincing along with their arms about each others waists and giggling like a couple of girls At first he actually thought they were a couple of girls Then he recognized Mellon who had been pointed out to him before As he looked he saw Mellon turn to Hagarty and they kissed briefly Chris Unwin and Steve Dubay were with him When Webby pointed out Mellon Steve Dubay said he thought the other fag was named Don somebody and that hed picked up a kid from Derry High hitching and then tried to put a few moves on him Mellon and Hagarty began to move toward the three boys again walking away from the Pitch Til U Win and toward the carnys exit Webby Garton would later tell Officers Hughes and Conley that his civic pride had been wounded by seeing a fucking faggot wearing a hat which said I LOVE DERRY It was a silly thing that hata paper imitation of a top hat with a great big flower sticking up from the top and nodding about in every direction The silliness of the hat apparently wounded Webbys civic pride even more As Mellon and Hagarty passed each with his arm linked about the others waist Webby Garton yelled out I ought to make you eat that hat you fucking assbandit Mellon turned toward Garton fluttered his eyes flirtatiously and said If you want something to eat hon I can find something much tastier than my hat At this point Webby Garton decided he was going to rearrange the faggots face In the geography of Mellons face mountains would rise and continents would drift Nobody suggested he sucked the root Nobody He started toward Mellon Mellons friend Hagarty alarmed attempted to pull Mellon away but Mellon stood his ground smiling Garton would later tell Officers Hughes and Conley that he was pretty sure Mellon was high on something So he was Hagarty would agree when this idea was passed on to him by Officers Gardener and Reeves He was high on two fried doughboys smeared with honey on the carnival on the whole day He had been consequently unable to recognize the real menace which Webby Garton represented But that was Adrian Don said using a tissue to wipe his eyes and smearing the spangled eyeshadow he was wearing He didnt have much in the way of protective coloration He was one of those fools who think things really are going to turn out all right He might have been badly hurt there and then if Garton hadnt felt something tap his elbow It was a nightstick He turned his head to see Officer Frank Machen another member of Derrys Finest Never mind little buddy Machen told Garton Mind your business and leave those little gay boyos alone Have some fun Did you hear what he called me Garton asked body He was now joined by Unwin and Dubaythe two of them smelling trouble tried to urge Garton on up the midway but Garton shrugged them away would have turned on them with his fists if they had persisted His masculinity had borne an insult which he felt must be avenged Nobody suggested he sucked the root Nobody I dont believe he called you anything Machen replied And you spoke to him first I believe Now move on sonny I dont want to have to tell you again Are you worried you might be then Machen asked seeming to be honestly interested and Garton flushed a deep ugly red During this exchange Hagarty was trying with increasing desperation to pull Adrian Mellon away from the scene Now at last Mellon was going I can run you in my friend Machen said and the way youre acting it might not be such a bad idea Next time I see you Im gonna hurt you Garton bellowed after the departing pair and heads turned to stare at him And if youre wearing that hat Im gonna kill you This town dont need no faggots like you Without turning Mellon waggled the fingers of his left handthe nails were painted ceriseand put an extra little wiggle in his walk Garton lunged again One more word or one more move and in you go Machen said mildly Trust me my boy for I mean exactly what I say You like guys like that Webby asked Machen ignoring Chris and Steve completely Huh About the bumpunchers Im neutral Machen said What Im really in favor of is peace and quiet and you are upsetting what I like pizza face Now do you want to go a round with me or what Come on Webby Steve Dubay said quietly Lets go get some hot dogs Webby went straightening his shirt with exaggerated moves and brushing the hair out of his eyes Machen who also gave a statement on the morning following Adrian Mellons death said The last thing I heard him say as him and his buddies walked off was Next time I see him hes going to be in serious hurt Please I got to talk to my mother Steve Dubay said for the third time Ive got to get her to mellow out my stepfather or there is going to be one hell of a punchingmatch when I get home In a little while Officer Charles Avarino told him Both Avarino and his partner Barney Morrison knew that Steve Dubay would not be going home tonight and maybe not for many nights to come The boy did not seem to realize just how heavy this particular bust was and Avarino would not be surprised when he learned later on that Dubay had left school at age sixteen At that time he had still been in Water Street Junior High His IQ was according to the Wechsler he had taken during one of his three trips through the seventh grade Tell us what happened when you saw Mellon coming out of the Falcon Morrison invited Listen Morrison said warmly sitting down next to Dubay and shooting him a cigarette You think me and Chick here like fags Were your friends Steveo Morrison said solemnly And believe me you and Chris and Webby need all the friends you can get just about now Because tomorrow every bleeding heart in this town is going to be screaming for you guyss blood Steve Dubay looked dimly alarmed Avarino who could almost read this hairbags pussy little mind suspected he was thinking about his stepfather again And although Avarino had no liking for Derrys small gay communitylike every other cop on the force he would enjoy seeing the Falcon shut up foreverhe would have been delighted to drive Dubay home himself He would in fact have been delighted to hold Dubays arms while Dubays stepfather beat the creep to oatmeal Avarino did not like gays but this did not mean he believed they should be tortured and murdered Mellon had been savaged When they brought him up from under the Canal bridge his eyes had been open bulging with terror And this guy here had absolutely no idea of what he had helped do We didnt mean to hurt im Steve repeated This was his fallback position when he became even slightly confused Thats why you want to get out front with us Avarino said earnestly Get the true facts of the matter out in front and this maybe wont amount to a pisshole in the snow Isnt that right Barney When the Falcon was opened in Elmer Curtie thought his clientele would consist mostly of busridersthe terminal next door serviced three different lines Trailways Greyhound and Aroostook County What he failed to realize was how many of the passengers who ride buses are women or families with small children in tow Many of the others kept their bottles in brown bags and never got off the bus at all Those who did were usually soldiers or sailors who wanted no more than a quick beer or twoyou couldnt very well go on a bender during a tenminute reststop Curtie had begun to realize some of these home truths by but by then it was too late he was up to his tits in bills and there was no way that he could see out of the red ink The idea of burning the place down for the insurance occurred to him but unless he hired a professional to torch it he supposed he would be caught and he had no idea where professional arsonists hung out anyway He decided in February of that year that he would give it until July th if things didnt look as if they were turning around by then he would simply walk next door get on a hound and see how things looked down in Florida But in the next five months an amazing quiet sort of prosperity came to the bar which was painted black and gold inside and decorated with stuffed birds Elmer Curties brother had been an amateur taxidermist who specialized in birds and Elmer had inherited the stuff when he died Suddenly instead of drawing sixty beers and pouring maybe twenty drinks a night Elmer was drawing eighty beers and pouring a hundred drinks a hundred and twenty sometimes a hundred and sixty His clientele was young polite almost exclusively male Many of them dressed outrageously but those were years when outrageous dress was still almost the norm and Elmer Curtie did not realize that his patrons were just about almost exclusively gay until or so If Derry residents had heard him say this they would have laughed and said that Elmer Curtie must think they had all been born yesterdaybut his claim was perfectly true Like the man with the cheating wife he was practically the last to know and by the time he did he didnt care The bar was making money and while there were four other bars in Derry which turned a profit the Falcon was the only one where rambunctious patrons did not regularly demolish the whole place There were no women to fight over for one thing and these men fags or not seemed to have learned a secret of getting along with each other which their heterosexual counterparts did not know Once he became aware of the sexual preference of his regulars he seemed to hear lurid stories about the Falcon everywherethese stories had been circulating for years but until Curtie simply hadnt heard them The most enthusiastic tellers of these tales he came to realize were men who wouldnt be dragged into the Falcon with a chainfall for fear all the muscles would go out of their wrists or something Yet they seemed privy to all sorts of information According to the stories you could go in there any night and see men closedancing rubbing their cocks together right out on the dancefloor men frenchkissing at the bar men getting blow jobs in the bathrooms There was supposedly a room out back where you went if you wanted to spend a little time on the Tower of Powerthere was a big old fellow in a Nazi uniform back there who kept his arm greased most of the way to the shoulder and who would be happy to take care of you In fact none of these things was true When folks with a thirst did come in from the bus station for a beer or a highball they sensed nothing out of the ordinary in the Falcon at allthere were a lot of guys sure but that was no different from thousands of workingmens bars all across the country The clientele was gay but gay was not a synonym for stupid If they wanted a little outrageousness they went to Portland If they wanted a lot of outrageousnessRamrodstyle outrageousness or Pecks Big Boystyle outrageousnessthey went down to New York or Boston Derry was small Derry was provincial and Derrys small gay community understood the shadow under which it existed quite well Don Hagarty had been coming into the Falcon for two or three years on the night in March of when he first showed up with Adrian Mellon Before then Hagarty had been the sort who plays the field rarely showing up with the same escort half a dozen times But by late April it had become obvious even to Elmer Curtie who cared very little about such things that Hagarty and Mellon had a steady thing going Hagarty was a draftsman with an engineering firm in Bangor Adrian Mellon was a freelance writer who published anywhere and everywhere he couldairline magazines confession magazines regional magazines Sunday supplements sexletter magazines He had been working on a novel but maybe that wasnt serioushe had been working on it since his third year of college and that had been twelve years ago He had come to Derry to write a piece about the Canalhe was on assignment from New England Byways a glossy bimonthly that was published in Concord Adrian Mellon had taken the assignment because he could squeeze Byways for three weeks worth of expense money including a nice room at the Derry Town House and gather all the material he needed for the piece in maybe five days During the other two weeks he could gather enough material for maybe four other regional pieces But during that threeweek period he met Don Hagarty and instead of going back to Portland when his three weeks on the cuff were over he found himself a small apartment on Kossuth Lane He lived there for only six weeks Then he moved in with Don Hagarty That summer Hagarty told Harold Gardener and Jeff Reeves was the happiest summer of his lifehe should have been on the lookout he said he should have known that God only puts a rug under guys like him in order to jerk it out from under their feet The only shadow he said was Adrians extravagantly partisan reaction to Derry He had a teeshirt which said MAINE AINT BAD BUT DERRYs GREAT He had a Derry Tigers highschool jacket And of course there was the hat He claimed to find the atmosphere vital and creatively invigorating Perhaps there was something to this he had taken his languishing novel out of the trunk for the first time in nearly a year Was he really working on it then Gardener asked Hagarty not really caring but wanting to keep Hagarty primed Yeshe was busting pages He said it might be a terrible novel but it was no longer going to be a terrible unfinished novel He expected to finish it by his birthday in October Of course he didnt know what Derry was really like He thought he did but he hadnt been here long enough to get a whiff of the real Derry I kept trying to tell him but he wouldnt listen Its a lot like a dead strumpet with maggots squirming out of her cooze Don Hagarty said Its a bad place Hagarty said Its a sewer You mean you two guys dont know that You two guys have lived here all of your lives and you dont know that Neither of them answered After a little while Hagarty went on Until Adrian Mellon entered his life Don had been planning to leave Derry He had been there for three years mostly because he had agreed to a longterm lease on an apartment with the worlds most fantastic riverview but now the lease was almost up and Don was glad No more long commute back and forth to Bangor No more weird vibesin Derry he once told Adrian it always felt like thirteen oclock Adrian might think Derry was a great place but it scared Don It was not just the towns tightly homophobic attitude an attitude as clearly expressed by the towns preachers as by the graffiti in Bassey Park but that was one thing he had been able to put his finger on Adrian had laughed Don every town in America has a contingent that hates the gayfolk he said dont tell me you dont know that This is after all the era of Ronnie Moron and Phyllis Housefly Come down to Bassey Park with me Don had replied after seeing that Adrian really meant what he was sayingand what he was really saying was that Derry was no worse than any other fairsized town in the hinterlands I want to show you something my love They drove to Bassey Parkthis had been in midJune about a month before Adrians murder Hagarty told the cops He took Adrian into the dark vaguely unpleasantsmelling shadows of the Kissing Bridge He pointed out one of the graffiti Adrian had to strike a match and hold it below the writing in order to read it SHOW ME YOUR COCK QUEER AND Ill CUT IT OFF YOU I know how people feel about gays Don said quietly I got beaten up at a truckstop in Dayton when I was a teenager some fellows in Portland set my shoes on fire outside of a sandwich shop while this fatassed old cop sat inside his cruiser and laughed Ive seen a lot but Ive never seen anything quite like this Look over here Check it out Another match revealed STICK NAILS IN EYES OF ALL FAGOTS FOR GOD Whoever writes these little homilies has got a case of the deepdown crazies Id feel better if I thought it was just one person one isolated sickie but Don swept his arm vaguely down the length of the Kissing Bridge Theres a lot of this stuff and I just dont think one person did it all Thats why I want to leave Derry Ade Too many places and too many people seem to have the deepdown crazies Well wait until I finish my novel okay Please October I promise no later The airs better here He didnt know it was the water he was going to have to watch out for Don Hagarty said bitterly Tom Boutillier and Chief Rademacher leaned forward neither of them speaking Chris Unwin sat with his head down talking monotonously to the floor This was the part they wanted to hear this was the part that was going to send at least two of these assholes to Thomaston The fair wasnt no good Unwin said They was already takin down all the bitchin rides you know like the Devil Dish and the Parachute Drop They already had a sign on the Bumper Cars that said closed Wasnt nothing open but baby rides So we went down by the games and Webby saw the Pitch Til U Win and he paid fifty cents and he seen that hat the queer was wearing and he pitched at that but he kept missing it and every time he missed he got more in a bad mood you know And Stevehes the guy who usually goes around saying mellow out like mellow out this and mellow out that and why dont you fuckin mellow out you know Only he was in a real pissuparope mood because he took this pill you know I dont know what kind of a pill A red pill Maybe it was even legal But he keeps after Webby until I thought Webby was gonna hit him you know He goes You cant even win that queers hat You must be really wasted if you cant even win that queers hat So finally the lady gives im a prize even though the ring wasnt over it cause I think she wanted to get rid of us I dont know Maybe she didnt But I think she did It was this noisemaker thing you know You blow it and it puffs up and unrolls and makes a noise like a fart you know I used to have one of those I got it for Halloween or New Years or some fuckin holiday I thought it was pretty good only I lost it Or maybe somebody hawked it out of my pocket in the fuckin playyard at school you know So then the fairs closin and were walkin out and Steves still on Webby about not bein able to win that queers hat you know and Webby aint sayin much and I know thats a bad sign but I was pretty faced you know So I knew I ought to like change the subject only I couldnt think of no subject you know So when we get into the parkin lot Steve says Where you want to go Home And Webby goes Lets cruise by the Falcon first and see if that queers around Boutillier and Rademacher exchanged a glance Boutillier raised a single finger and tapped it against his cheek although this doofus in the engineer boots didnt know it he was now talking about firstdegree murder So I goes no I gotta get home and Webby goes You scared to go by that queerbar And I go Fuck no And Steves still high or something and he says Lets go grease some queermeat Lets go grease some queermeat Lets go grease The timing was just right enough so that things worked out wrong for everyone Adrian Mellon and Don Hagarty came out of the Falcon after two beers walked up past the bus station and then linked hands Neither of them thought about it it was just something they did It was tentwenty They reached the corner and turned left The Kissing Bridge was almost half a mile upriver from here they meant to cross Main Street Bridge which was much less picturesque The Kenduskeag was summerlow no more than four feet of water sliding listlessly around the concrete pilings When the Duster drew abreast of them Steve Dubay had spotted the two of them coming out of the Falcon and gleefully pointed them out they were on the edge of the span Cut in Cut in Webby Garton screamed The two men had just passed under a streetlight and he had spotted the fact that they were holding hands This infuriated him but not as much as the hat infuriated him The big paper flower was nodding crazily this way and that Cut in goddammit Chris Unwin would deny active participation in what followed but Don Hagarty told a different story He said that Garton was out of the car almost before it stopped and that the other two quickly followed There was talk Not good talk There was no attempt at flippancy or false coquetry on Adrians part this night he recognized that they were in a lot of trouble Give me that hat Garton said Give it to me queer If I do will you leave us alone Adrian was wheezing with fright almost crying looking from Unwin to Dubay to Garton with terrified eyes Adrian handed it over Garton produced a switchknife from the left front pocket of his jeans and cut it into two pieces He rubbed the pieces against the seat of his jeans Then he dropped them to his feet and stomped them Don Hagarty backed away a little while their attention was divided between Adrian and the hathe was looking he said for a cop Now will you let us al Adrian Mellon began and that was when Garton punched him in the face driving him back against the waisthigh pedestrian railing of the bridge Adrian screamed clapping his hands to his mouth Blood poured through his fingers Ade Hagarty cried and ran forward again Dubay tripped him Garton booted him in the stomach knocking him off the sidewalk and into the roadway A car passed Hagarty rose to his knees and screamed at it It didnt slow The driver he told Gardener and Reeves never even looked around Shut up queer Dubay said and kicked him in the side of the face Hagarty fell on his side in the gutter semiconscious A few moments later he heard a voiceChris Unwinstelling him to get away before he got what his friend was getting In his own statement Unwin verified giving this warning Hagarty could hear thudding blows and the sound of his lover screaming Adrian sounded like a rabbit in a snare he told the police Hagarty crawled back toward the intersection and the bright lights of the bus station and when he was a distance away he turned back to look Adrian Mellon who stood about fivefive and might have weighed a hundred and thirtyfive pounds soaking wet was being pushed from Garton to Dubay to Unwin in a kind of triple play His body jittered and flopped like the body of a rag doll They were punching him pummelling him ripping at his clothes As he watched he said Garton punched Adrian in the crotch Adrians hair hung in his face Blood poured out of his mouth and soaked his shirt Webby Garton wore two heavy rings on his right hand one was a Derry High School ring the other one he had made in shop classan intertwined brass DB stood out three inches from this latter The letters stood for the Dead Bugs a metal band he particularly admired The rings had torn Adrians upper lip open and shattered three of his upper teeth at the gum line The buildings of Main Street loomed dark and secret No one came to helpnot even from the one white island of light which marked the bus station and Hagarty did not see how that could be there were people in there He had seen them when he and Ade walked past Would none of them come to help None at all Help a very small voice whispered from Don Hagartys left and then there was a giggle Bums rush Garton was yelling now yelling and laughing All three of them Hagarty told Gardener and Reeves had been laughing while they beat Adrian up Bums rush Over the side Help the small voice said again and although the voice was grave that little giggle followed againit was like the voice of a child who cannot help itself Hagarty looked down and saw the clownand it was at this point that Gardener and Reeves began to discount everything that Hagarty said because the rest was the raving of a lunatic Later however Harold Gardener found himself wondering Later when he found that the Unwin boy had also seen a clownor said he hadhe began to have second thoughts His partner either never had them or would never admit to them The clown Hagarty said looked like a cross between Ronald McDonald and that old TV clown Bozoor so he thought at first It was the wild tufts of orange hair that brought such comparisons to mind But later consideration had caused him to think the clown really looked like neither The smile painted over the white pancake was red not orange and the eyes were a weird shiny silver Contact lenses perhaps but a part of him thought then and continued to think that maybe that silver had been the real color of those eyes He wore a baggy suit with big orangepompom buttons on his hands were cartoon gloves If you need help Don the clown said help yourself to a balloon They float the clown said down here we all float pretty soon your friend will float too This clown called you by name Jeff Reeves said in a totally expressionless voice He looked over Hagartys bent head at Harold Gardener and one eye drew down in a wink Yes Hagarty said not looking up I know how it sounds So then you threw him over Boutillier said Bums rush Not me Unwin said looking up He flicked the hair out of his eyes with one hand and stared at them urgently When I saw they really meant to do it I tried to pull Steve away because I knew the guy might get banged up It was like ten feet to the water It was twentythree One of Chief Rademachers patrolmen had already measured But it was like he was crazy The two of them kept yelling Bums rush Bums rush and they picked him up Webby had him under the arms and Steve had him by the seat of the pants and and When Hagarty saw what they were doing he rushed back toward them screaming No No No at the top of his voice Chris Unwin pushed him backward and Hagarty landed in a teethrattling heap on the sidewalk do you want to go over too he whispered You run baby They threw Adrian Mellon over the bridge and into the water then Hagarty heard the splash Lets get out of here Steve Dubay said He and Webby were backing toward the car Chris Unwin went to the railing and looked over He saw Hagarty first sliding and clawing his way down the weedy trashlittered embankment to the water Then he saw the clown The clown was dragging Adrian out on the far side with one arm its balloons were in its other hand Adrian was dripping wet choking moaning The clown twisted its head and grinned up at Chris Chris said he saw its shining silver eyes and its bared teethgreat big teeth he said Like the lion in the circus man he said I mean they were that big Then he said he saw the clown shove one of Adrian Mellons arms back so it lay over his head Then what Chris Boutillier said He was bored with this part Fairy tales had bored him since the age of eight on I dunno Chris said That was when Steve grabbed me and hauled me into the car But I think it bit into his armpit He looked up at them again uncertain now I think thats what it did Bit into his armpit Like it wanted to eat him man Like it wanted to eat his heart No Hagarty said when he was presented with Chris Unwins story in the form of questions The clown did not drag Ade up on the far bank at least not that he sawand he would grant that he had been something less than a disinterested observer by that point by that point he had been out of his fucking mind The clown he said was standing near the far bank with Adrians dripping body clutched in its arms Ades right arm was stuck stiffly out behind the clowns head and the clowns face was indeed in Ades right armpit but it was not biting it was smiling Hagarty could see it looking out from beneath Ades arm and smiling Float with us Don the clown said out of its grinning red mouth and then pointed with one of its whitegloved hands under the bridge Balloons floated against the underside of the bridgenot a dozen or a dozen dozens but thousands red and blue and green and yellow and printed on the side of each was I LOVE DERRY Well now that surely does sound like a lot of balloons Reeves said and tipped Harold Gardener another wink I know how it sounds Hagarty reiterated in the same dreary voice Don Hagarty slowly held his hands up in front of his face I saw them as clearly as I can see my own fingers at this moment Thousands of them You couldnt even see the underside of the bridgethere were too many of them They were rippling a little and sort of bouncing up and down There was a sound A funny low squealing noise That was their sides rubbing together And strings There was a forest of white strings hanging down They looked like white strands of spiderweb The clown took Ade under there I could see its suit brushing through those strings Ade was making awful choking sounds I started after him and the clown looked back I saw its eyes and all at once I understood who it was I ran you dumb shit Hagarty said and burst into tears Harold Gardener kept his peace until November th the day before John Garton and Steven Dubay were to go on trial in Derry District Court for the murder of Adrian Mellon Then he went to see Tom Boutillier He wanted to talk about the clown Boutillier didntbut when he saw Gardener might do something stupid without a little guidance he did There was no clown Harold The only clowns out that night were those three kids You know that as well as I do Oh thats crap Unwin decided to bring on the OneArmed Man as in We didnt kill the poor little faggot it was the onearmed man as soon as he understood hed really gotten his buns into some hot water this time Hagarty was hysterical He stood by and watched those kids murder his best friend It wouldnt have surprised me if hed seen flying saucers But Boutillier knew better Gardener could see it in his eyes and the Assistant DAs ducking and dodging irritated him Come on he said Were talking about independent witnesses here Dont bullshit me Oh you want to talk bullshit Are you telling me you believe there was a vampire clown under the Main Street Bridge Because thats my idea of bullshit Or that Hagarty saw a billion balloons under there each imprinted with exactly the same thing as what was written on his lovers hat Because that is also my idea of bullshit Stop crossexamining me Gardener roared They both described it the same and neither knew what the other one was saying Boutillier had been sitting at his desk playing with a pencil Now he put the pencil down got up and walked over to Harold Gardener Boutillier was five inches shorter but Gardener retreated a step before the mans anger Okay Good Since we both agree on the basics Ill tell you exactly what I think Yes there was probably a man under the bridge that night Maybe he was even wearing a clown suit although Ive dealt with enough witnesses to guess maybe it was just a stewbum or a transient wearing a bunch of castoff clothes I think he was probably down there scrounging for dropped change or roadmeathalf a burger someone chucked over the side or maybe the crumbs from the bottom of a Frito bag Their eyes did the rest Harold Now is that possible I dont know Harold said He wanted to be convinced but given the exact tally of the two descriptions no He didnt think it was possible Heres the bottom line I dont care if it was Kinko the Klown or a guy in an Uncle Sam suit on stilts or Hubert the Happy Homo If we introduce this fellow into the case their lawyer is going to be on it before you can say Jack Robinson Hes going to say those two little innocent lambs out there with their fresh haircuts and new suits didnt do anything but toss that gay fellow Mellon over the side of the bridge for a joke Hell point out that Mellon was still alive after he took the fall they have Hagartys testimony as well as Unwins for that His clients didnt commit murder oh no It was a psycho in a clown suit If we introduce this thats going to happen and you know it But Hagarty isnt Boutillier said Because he understands Without Hagarty whos going to believe Unwin Well theres us Harold Gardener said with a bitterness that surprised even himself but I guess were not telling Oh give me a break Boutillier roared throwing up his hands They killed him They didnt just throw him over the sideGarton had a switchblade Mellon was stabbed seven times including once in the left lung and twice in the testicles The wounds match the blade Four of his ribs were brokenDubay did that bearhugging him He was bitten all right There were bites on his arms his left cheek his neck I think that was Unwin and Garton although weve only got one clear match and that ones probably not clear enough to stand up in court And so all right there was a big chunk of meat gone from his right armpit so what One of them really liked to bite Probably even got himself a pretty good boneon while he was doing it Im betting Garton although well never prove it And Mellons earlobe was gone If we let in this clown story well never bring it home to them Do you want that The guy was a fruit but he wasnt hurting anyone Boutillier said so hihothedairyo along come these three pusholes in their engineer boots and they steal his life Im going to put them in the slam my friend and if I hear they got their puckery little assholes cored down there at Thomaston Im gonna send them cards saying I hope whoever did it had AIDS Very fiery Gardener thought And the convictions will also look very good on your record when you run for the top spot in two years But he left without saying more because he also wanted to see them put away John Webber Garton was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter and sentenced to ten to twenty years in Thomaston State Prison Steven Bishoff Dubay was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years in Shawshank State Prison Christopher Philip Unwin was tried separately as a juvenile and convicted of seconddegree manslaughter He was sentenced to six months at the South Windham Boys Training Facility sentence suspended At the time of this writing all three sentences are under appeal Garton and Dubay may be seen on any given day girlwatching or playing Penny Pitch in Bassey Park not far from where Mellons torn body was found floating against one of the pilings of the Main Street Bridge At the major trialthat of Garton and Dubayno one mentioned a clown Patricia Uris later told her mother she should have known something was wrong She should have known it she said because Stanley never took baths in the early evening He showered early each morning and sometimes soaked late at night with a magazine in one hand and a cold beer in the other but baths at PM were not his style And then there was the thing about the books It should have delighted him instead in some obscure way she did not understand it seemed to have upset and depressed him About three months before that terrible night Stanley had discovered that a childhood friend of his had turned out to be a writernot a real writer Patricia told her mother but a novelist The name on the books was William Denbrough but Stanley had sometimes called him Stuttering Bill He had worked his way through almost all of the mans books had in fact been reading the last on the night of the baththe night of May th Patty herself had picked up one of the earlier ones out of curiosity She had put it down after just three chapters It had not just been a novel she told her mother later it had been a horrorbook She said it just that way all one word the way she would have said sexbook Patty was a sweet kind woman but not terribly articulateshe had wanted to tell her mother how much that book had frightened her and why it had upset her but had not been able It was full of monsters she said Full of monsters chasing after little children There were killings and I dont know bad feelings and hurt Stuff like that It had in fact struck her as almost pornographic that was the word which kept eluding her probably because she had never in her life spoken it although she knew what it meant But Stan felt as if hed rediscovered one of his childhood chums He talked about writing to him but I knew he wouldnt I knew those stories made him feel bad too and and That night lacking roughly six months of being twentyeight years from the day in when George Denbrough had met Pennywise the Clown Stanley and Patty had been sitting in the den of their home in a suburb of Atlanta The TV was on Patty was sitting in the loveseat in front of it dividing her attention between a pile of sewing and her favorite gameshow Family Feud She simply adored Richard Dawson and thought the watchchain he always wore was terribly sexy although wild horses would not have drawn this admission out of her She also liked the show because she almost always got the most popular answers there were no right answers on Family Feud exactly only the most popular ones She had once asked Stan why the questions that seemed so easy to her usually seemed so hard to the families on the show Its probably a lot tougher when youre up there under those lights Stanley had replied and it seemed to her that a shadow had drifted over his face Everythings a lot tougher when its for real Thats when you choke When its for real That was probably very true she decided Stanley had really fine insights into human nature sometimes Much finer she considered than his old friend William Denbrough who had gotten rich writing a bunch of horrorbooks which appealed to peoples baser natures Not that the Urises were doing so badly themselves The suburb where they lived was a fine one and the home which they had purchased for in  would probably now sell quickly and painlessly for not that she wanted to sell but such things were good to know She sometimes drove back from the Fox Run Mall in her Volvo Stanley drove a Mercedes dieselteasing him she called it Sedanley and saw her house set tastefully back behind low yew hedges and thought Who lives there Why I do Mrs Stanley Uris does This was not an entirely happy thought mixed with it was a pride so fierce that it sometimes made her feel a bit ill Once upon a time you see there had been a lonely eighteenyearold girl named Patricia Blum who had been refused entry to the afterprom party that was held at the country club in the upstate town of Glointon New York She had been refused admission of course because her last name rhymed with plum That was her just a skinny little kike plum  that had been and such discrimination was against the law of course hardeharharhar and besides it was all over now Except that for part of her it was never going to be over Part of her would always be walking back to the car with Michael Rosenblatt listening to the crushed gravel under her pumps and his rented formal shoes back to his fathers car which Michael had borrowed for the evening and which he had spent the afternoon waxing Part of her would always be walking next to Michael in his rented white dinner jackethow it had glimmered in the soft spring night She had been in a pale green evening gown which her mother declared made her look like a mermaid and the idea of a kike mermaid was pretty funny hardeharharhar They had walked with their heads up and she had not weptnot thenbut she had understood they werent walking back no not really what they had been doing was slinking back slinking rhymes with stinking both of them feeling more Jewish than they had ever felt in their lives feeling like pawnbrokers feeling like cattlecar riders feeling oily longnosed sallowskinned feeling like mockies sheenies kikes wanting to feel angry and not being able to feel angry the anger came only later when it didnt matter At that moment she had only been able to feel ashamed had only been able to ache And then someone had laughed A high shrill tittering laugh like a fast run of notes on a piano and in the car she had been able to weep oh you bet here is the kike mermaid whose name rhymes with plum just weeping away like crazy Mike Rosenblatt had put a clumsy comforting hand on the back of her neck and she had twisted away from it feeling ashamed feeling dirty feeling Jewish The house set so tastefully back behind the yew hedges made that better but not all better The hurt and shame were still there and not even being accepted in this quiet sleekly welltodo neighborhood could quite make that endless walk with the sound of grating stones beneath their shoes stop happening Not even being members of this country club where the maitre d always greeted them with a quietly respectful Good evening Mr and Mrs Uris She would come home cradled in her Volvo and she would look at her house sitting on its expanse of green lawn and she would oftenall too often she supposedthink of that shrill titter And she would hope that the girl who had tittered was living in a shitty tract house with a goy husband who beat her that she had been pregnant three times and had miscarried each time that her husband cheated on her with diseased women that she had slipped discs and fallen arches and cysts on her dirty tittering tongue She would hate herself for these thoughts these uncharitable thoughts and promise to do betterto stop drinking these bitter gallandwormwood cocktails Months would go by when she did not think such thoughts She would think Maybe all of that is finally past me I am not that girl of eighteen anymore I am a woman of thirtysix the girl who heard the endless click and grate of those driveway stones the girl who twisted away from Mike Rosenblatts hand when he tried to comfort her because it was a Jewish hand was half a life ago That silly little mermaid is dead I can forget her now and just be myself Okay Good Great But then she would be somewhereat the supermarket maybeand she would hear sudden tittering laughter from the next aisle and her back would prickle her nipples would go hard and hurtful her hands would tighten on the bar of the shopping cart or just on each other and she would think Someone just told someone else that Im Jewish that Im nothing but a bignose mockie kike that Stanleys nothing but a bignose mockie kike hes an accountant sure Jews are good with numbers we let them into the country club we had to back in when that bignose mockie gynecologist won his suit but we laugh at them we laugh and laugh and laugh Or she would simply hear the phantom click and grate of stones and think Mermaid Mermaid Then the hate and shame would come flooding back like a migraine headache and she would despair not only for herself but for the whole human race Werewolves The book by Denbroughthe one she had tried to read and then put asidewas about werewolves Werewolves shit What did a man like that know about werewolves Most of the time however she felt better than thatfelt she was better than that She loved her man she loved her house and she was usually able to love her life and herself Things were good They had not always been that way of coursewere things ever When she accepted Stanleys engagement ring her parents had been both angry and unhappy She had met him at a sorority party He had come over to her school from New York State University where he was a scholarship student They had been introduced by a mutual friend and by the time the evening was over she suspected that she loved him By the midterm break she was sure When spring came around and Stanley offered her a small diamond ring with a daisy pushed through it she had accepted it In the end in spite of their qualms her parents had accepted it as well There was little else they could do although Stanley Uris would soon be sallying forth into a jobmarket glutted with young accountantsand when he went into that jungle he would do so with no family finances to backstop him and with their only daughter as his hostage to fortune But Patty was twentytwo a woman now and would herself soon graduate with a BA Ill be supporting that foureyed son of a bitch for the rest of my life Patty had heard her father say one night Her mother and father had gone out for dinner and her father had drunk a little too much Patty had lain awake that night until long after midnight dryeyed alternately hot and cold hating them both She had spent the next two years trying to get rid of that hate there was too much hate inside her already Sometimes when she looked into the mirror she could see the things it was doing to her face the fine lines it was drawing there That was a battle she won Stanley had helped her His own parents had been equally concerned about the marriage They did not of course believe their Stanley was destined for a life of squalor and poverty but they thought the kids were being hasty Donald Uris and Andrea Bertoly had themselves married in their early twenties but they seemed to have forgotten the fact Only Stanley had seemed sure of himself confident of the future unconcerned with the pitfalls their parents saw strewn all about the kids And in the end it was his confidence rather than their fears which had been justified In July of with the ink barely dry on her diploma Patty had landed a job teaching shorthand and business English in Traynor a small town forty miles south of Atlanta When she thought of how she had come by that job it always struck her as a littlewell eerie She had made a list of forty possibles from the ads in the teachers journals then had written forty letters over five nightseight each eveningrequesting further information on the job and an application for each Twentytwo replies indicated that the positions had been filled In other cases a more detailed explanation of the skills needed made it clear she wasnt in the running applying would only be a waste of her time and theirs She had finished with a dozen possibles Each looked as likely as any other Stanley had come in while she was puzzling over them and wondering if she could possibly manage to fill out a dozen teaching applications without going totally bonkers He looked at the strew of papers on the table and then tapped the letter from the Traynor Superintendent of Schools a letter which to her looked no more or less encouraging than any of the others She looked up at him startled by the simple certainty in his voice do you know something about Georgia that I dont Nope Only time I was ever there was at the movies Gone with the Wind Vivien Leigh Clark Gable I will think about it tomorrow for tomorrow is anothah day Do I sound like I come from the South Patty Yes South Bronx If you dont know anything about Georgia and youve never been there then why Sure I can he said simply I do Looking at him she had seen he wasnt joking he really meant it She had felt a ripple of unease go up her back He had been smiling a little Now the smile faltered and for a moment he had seemed puzzled His eyes had darkened as if he looked inward consulting some interior device which ticked and whirred correctly but which ultimately he understood no more than the average man understands the workings of the watch on his wrist The turtle couldnt help us he said suddenly He said that quite clearly She heard it That inward lookthat look of surprised musingwas still on his face and it was starting to scare her He jerked She had been eating peaches as she went over the applications and his hand struck the dish It fell on the floor and broke His eyes seemed to clear I forget he said But I think we ought to think Georgia babylove Her interview had gone smashingly She had known she had the job when she got on the train back to New York The head of the Business Department had taken an instant liking to Patty and she to him she had almost heard the click The confirming letter had come a week later The Traynor Consolidated School Department could offer her and a probationary contract You are going to starve Herbert Blum said when his daughter told him she intended to take the job And you will be hot while you starve Fiddledeedee Scarlett Stanley said when she told him what her father had said She had been furious near tears but now she began to giggle and Stanley swept her into his arms Hot they had been starved they had not They were married on August th Patty Uris had gone to her marriage bed a virgin She had slipped naked between cool sheets at a resort hotel in the Poconos her mood turbulent and stormylightningflares of wanting and delicious lust dark clouds of fright When Stanley slid into bed beside her ropy with muscle his penis an exclamation point rising from gingery pubic hair she had whispered dont hurt me dear I will never hurt you he said as he took her in his arms and it was a promise he had kept faithfully until May th the night of the bath Her teaching had gone well Stanley got a job driving a bakery truck for one hundred dollars a week In November of that year when the Traynor Flats Shopping Center opened he got a job with the H amp R Block office out there for a hundred and fifty Their combined income was then a yearthis seemed a kings ransom to them in those days when gas sold for thirtyfive cents a gallon and a loaf of white bread could be had for a nickel less than that In March  with no fuss and no fanfare Patty Uris had thrown away her birthcontrol pills In Stanley quit H amp R Block and opened his own business All four inlaws agreed that this was a foolhardy move Not that Stanley should not have his own businessGod forbid he should not have his own business But it was too early all of them agreed and it put too much of the financial burden on Patty At least until the pisher knocks her up Herbert Blum told his brother morosely after a night of drinking in the kitchen and then Ill be expected to carry them The consensus of inlaw opinion on the matter was that a man should not even think about going into business for himself until he had reached a more serene and mature ageseventyeight say Again Stanley seemed almost preternaturally confident He was young personable bright apt He had made contacts working for Block All of these things were givens But he could not have known that Corridor Video a pioneer in the nascent videotape business was about to settle on a huge patch of farmedout land less than ten miles from the suburb to which the Urises had eventually moved in nor could he have known that Corridor would be in the market for an independent marketing survey less than a year after its move to Traynor Even if Stan had been privy to some of this information he surely could not have believed they would give the job to a young bespectacled Jew who also happened to be a damyankeea Jew with an easy grin a hipshot way of walking a taste for bellbottomed jeans on his days off and the last ghosts of his adolescent acne still on his face Yet they had They had And it seemed that Stan had known it all along His work for CV led to an offer of a fulltime position with the companystarting salary a year And that really is only the start Stanley told Patty in bed that night They are going to grow like corn in August my dear If no one blows up the world in the next ten years or so they are going to be right up there on the big board along with Kodak and Sony and RCA So what are you going to do she asked already knowing I am going to tell them what a pleasure it was to do business with them he said and laughed and drew her close and kissed her Moments later he mounted her and there were climaxesone two and three like bright rockets going off in a night sky but there was no baby His work with Corridor Video had brought him into contact with some of Atlantas richest and most powerful menand they were both astonished to find that these men were mostly okay In them they found a degree of acceptance and broadminded kindliness that was almost unknown in the North Patty remembered Stanley once writing home to his mother and father The best rich men in America live in Atlanta Georgia I am going to help make some of them richer and they are going to make me richer and no one is going to own me except my wife Patricia and since I already own her I guess that is safe enough By the time they moved from Traynor Stanley was incorporated and employed six people In their income had entered unknown territoryterritory of which Patty had heard only the dimmest rumors This was the fabled land of six FIGURES And it had all happened with the casual ease of slipping into a pair of sneakers on Saturday morning This sometimes frightened her Once she had made an uneasy joke about deals with the devil Stanley had laughed until he almost choked but to her it hadnt seemed that funny and she supposed it never would Sometimes for no reason at all she would wake up with this thought in her mind like the last fragment of an otherwise forgotten dream and she would turn to Stanley needing to touch him needing to make sure he was still there It was a good lifethere was no wild drinking no outside sex no drugs no boredom no bitter arguments about what to do next There was only a single cloud It was her mother who first mentioned the presence of this cloud That her mother would be the one to finally do so seemed in retrospect preordained It finally came out as a question in one of Ruth Slums letters She wrote Patty once a week and that particular letter had arrived in the early fall of It came forwarded from the old Traynor address and Patty read it in a living room filled with cardboard liquorstore cartons from which spilled their possessions looking forlorn and uprooted and dispossessed In most ways it was the usual Ruth Blum Letter from Home four closely written blue pages each one headed JUST A NOTE FROM RUTH Her scrawl was nearly illegible and Stanley had once complained he could not read a single word his motherinlaw wrote Why would you want to Patty had responded This one was full of Moms usual brand of news for Ruth Blum recollection was a broad delta spreading out from the moving point of the now in an everwidening fan of interlocking relationships Many of the people of whom her mother wrote were beginning to fade in Pattys memory like photographs in an old album but to Ruth all of them remained fresh Her concerns for their health and her curiosity about their various doings never seemed to wane and her prognoses were unfailingly dire Her father was still having too many stomachaches He was sure it was just dyspepsia the idea that he might have an ulcer she wrote would not cross his mind until he actually began coughing up blood and probably not even then You know your father dearhe works like a mule and he also thinks like one sometimes God should forgive me for saying so Randi Harlengen had gotten her tubes tied they took cysts as big as golfballs out of her ovaries no malignancy thank God but twentyseven ovarian cysts could you die It was the water in New York City she was quite sure of thatthe city air was dirty too but she was convinced it was the water that really got to you after awhile It built up deposits inside a person She doubted if Patty knew how often she had thanked God that you kids were out in the country where both air and waterbut particularly the waterwere healthier to Ruth all of the South including Atlanta and Birmingham was the country Aunt Margaret was feuding with the power company again Stella Flanagan had gotten married again some people never learned Richie Huber had been fired again And in the middle of this chattyand often cattyoutpouring in the middle of a paragraph a propos of nothing which had gone before or which came after Ruth Blum had casually asked the Dreaded Question so when are you and Stan going to make us grandparents Were all ready to start spoiling him or her rotten And in case you hadnt noticed Patsy were not getting any younger And then on to the Bruckner girl from down the block who had been sent home from school because she was wearing no bra and a blouse that you could see right through Feeling low and homesick for their old place in Traynor feeling unsure and more than a little afraid of what might be ahead Patty had gone into what was to become their bedroom and had lain down upon the mattress the box spring was still out in the garage and the mattress lying all by itself on the big carpetless floor looked like an artifact cast up on a strange yellow beach She put her head in her arms and lay there weeping for nearly twenty minutes She supposed that cry had been coming anyway Her mothers letter had just brought it on sooner the way dust hurries the tickle in your nose into a sneeze Stanley wanted kids She wanted kids They were as compatible on that subject as they were on their enjoyment of Woody Aliens films their more or less regular attendance at synagogue their political leanings their dislike of marijuana a hundred other things both great and small There had been an extra room in the Traynor house which they had split evenly down the middle On the left he had a desk for working and a chair for reading on the right she had a sewing machine and a cardtable where she did jigsaw puzzles There had been an agreement between them about that room so strong they rarely spoke of itit was simply there like their noses or the wedding rings on their left hands Someday that room would belong to Andy or to Jenny But where was that child The sewing machine and the baskets of fabric and the cardtable and the desk and the LaZBoy all kept their places seeming each month to solidify their holds on their respective positions in the room and to further establish their legitimacy So she thought although she never could quite crystallize the thought like the word pornographic it was a concept that danced just beyond her ability to quantify But she did remember one time when she got her period sliding open the cupboard under the bathroom sink to get a sanitary napkin she remembered looking at the box of Stayfree pads and thinking that the box looked almost smug seemed almost to be saying Hello Patty We are your children We are the only children you will ever have and we are hungry Nurse us Nurse us on blood In three years after she had thrown away the last cycle of Ovral tablets they saw a doctor named Harkavay in Atlanta We want to know if there is something wrong Stanley said and we want to know if we can do anything about it if there is They took the tests They showed that Stanleys sperm was perky that Pattys eggs were fertile that all the channels that were supposed to be open were open Harkavay who wore no wedding ring and who had the open pleasant ruddy face of a college grad student just back from a midterm skiing vacation in Colorado told them that maybe it was just nerves He told them that such a problem was by no means uncommon He told them that there seemed to be a psychological correlative in such cases that was in some ways similar to sexual impotencythe more you wanted to the less you could They would have to relax They ought if they could to forget all about procreation when they had sex Stan was grumpy on the way home Patty asked him why She began to giggle even though she was by then feeling a bit lonesome and frightened And that night lying in bed long after she believed that Stanley must be asleep he had frightened her by speaking out of the dark His voice was flat but nevertheless choked with tears Its me he said Its my fault Dont be a stupid she said But her heart was beating fastmuch too fast It wasnt just that he had startled her it was as if he had looked into her mind and read a secret conviction she held there but of which she had not known until this minute With no rhyme no reason she feltknewthat he was right There was something wrong and it wasnt her It was him Something in him Dont be such a klutz she whispered fiercely against his shoulder He was sweating lightly and she became suddenly aware that he was afraid The fear was coming off him in cold waves lying naked with him was suddenly like lying naked in front of an open refrigerator Im not a klutz and Im not being stupid he said in that same voice which was simultaneously flat and choked with emotion and you know it Its me But I dont know why You cant know any such thing Her voice was harsh scoldingher mothers voice when her mother was afraid And even as she scolded him a shudder ran through her body twisting it like a whip Stanley felt it and his arms tightened around her Sometimes he said sometimes I think I know why Sometimes I have a dream a bad dream and I wake up and I think I know now I know whats wrong Not just you not catching pregnanteverything Everything thats wrong with my life I dont mean from inside he said From inside is fine Im talking about outside Something that should be over and isnt I wake up from these dreams and think My whole pleasant life has been nothing but the eye of some storm I dont understand Im afraid But then it just fades The way dreams do She knew that he sometimes dreamed uneasily On half a dozen occasions he had awakened her thrashing and moaning Probably there had been other times when she had slept through his dark interludes Whenever she reached for him asked him he said the same thing I cant remember Then he would reach for his cigarettes and smoke sitting up in bed waiting for the residue of the dream to pass through his pores like bad sweat No kids On the night of May th the night of the baththeir assorted inlaws were still waiting to be grandparents The extra room was still an extra room the Stayfree Maxis and Stayfree Minis still occupied their accustomed places in the cupboard under the bathroom sink the cardinal still paid its monthly visit Her mother who was much occupied with her own affairs but not entirely oblivious to her daughters pain had stopped asking in her letters and when Stanley and Patty made their twiceyearly trips back to New York There were no more humorous remarks about whether or not they were taking their vitamin E Stanley had also stopped mentioning babies but sometimes when he didnt know she was looking she saw a shadow on his face Some shadow As if he were trying desperately to remember something Other than that one cloud their lives were pleasant enough until the phone rang during the middle of Family Feud on the night of May th Patty had six of Stans shirts two of her blouses her sewing kit and her oddbutton box Stan had the new William Denbrough novel not even out in paperback yet in his hands There was a snarling beast on the front of this book On the back was a bald man wearing glasses Stan was sitting nearer the phone He picked it up and said HelloUris residence He listened and a frown line delved between his eyebrows Who did you say Patty felt an instant of fright Later shame would cause her to lie and tell her parents that she had known something was wrong from the instant the telephone had rung but in reality there had only been that one instant that one quick look up from her sewing But maybe that was all right Maybe they had both suspected that something was coming long before that phone call something that didnt fit with the nice house set tastefully back behind the low yew hedges something so much a given that it really didnt need much of an acknowledgment that one sharp instant of fright like the stab of a quickly withdrawn icepick was enough Is it Mom she mouthed at him in that instant thinking that perhaps her father twenty pounds overweight and prone to what he called the bellyache since his early forties had had a heart attack Stan shook his head at her and then smiled a bit at something the voice on the phone was saying You you Well Ill be goddamned Mike How did y He fell silent again listening As his smile faded she recognizedor thought she didhis analytic expression the one which said someone was unfolding a problem or explaining a sudden change in an ongoing situation or telling him something strange and interesting This last was probably the case she gathered A new client An old friend Perhaps She turned her attention back to the TV where a woman was flinging her arms around Richard Dawson and kissing him madly She thought that Richard Dawson must get kissed even more than the Blarney stone She also thought she wouldnt mind kissing him herself As she began searching for a black button to match the ones on Stanleys blue denim shirt Patty was vaguely aware that the conversation was settling into a smoother grooveStanley grunted occasionally and once he asked Are you sure Mike Finally after a very long pause he said All right I understand Yes I Yes Yes everything I have the picture I what No I cant absolutely promise that but Ill consider it carefully You know that oh He did Well you bet Of course I do Yes sure thank you yes Byebye He hung up Patty glanced at him and saw him staring blankly into space over the TV set On her show the audience was applauding the Ryan family which had just scored two hundred and eighty points most of them by guessing that the audience survey would answer math in response to the question What class will people say Junior hates most in school The Ryans were jumping up and down and screaming joyfully Stanley however was frowning She would later tell her parents she thought Stanleys face had looked a little offcolor and so she did but she neglected to tell them she had dismissed it at the time as only a trick of the tablelamp with its green glass shade Hmmmm He looked around at her She thought the look on his face was one of gentle abstraction perhaps mixed with minor annoyance It was only later replaying the scene in her mind again and again that she began to believe it was the expression of a man who was methodically unplugging himself from reality one cord at a time The face of a man who was heading out of the blue and into the black No one he said No one really I think Ill take a bath He stood up He didnt answer only left the room She might have asked him if something was wrong might even have gone after him and asked him if he was sick to his stomachhe was sexually uninhibited but he could be oddly prim about other things and it wouldnt be at all unlike him to say he was going to take a bath when what he really had to do was whoops something which hadnt agreed with him But now a new family the Piscapos were being introduced and Patty just knew Richard Dawson would find something funny to say about that name and besides she was having the devils own time finding a black button although she knew there were loads of them in the button box They hid of course that was the only explanation So she let him go and did not think of him again until the creditcrawl when she looked up and saw his empty chair She had heard the water running into the tub upstairs and had heard it stop five or ten minutes later but now she realized she had never heard the fridge door open and close and that meant he was up there without a can of beer Someone had called him up and dropped a big fat problem in his lap and had she offered him a single word of commiseration No Tried to draw him out a little about it No Even noticed that something was wrong For the third time no All because of that stupid TV showshe couldnt even really blame the buttons they were only an excuse Okayshed take him up a can of Dixie and sit beside him on the edge of the tub scrub his back play Geisha and wash his hair if he wanted her to and find out just what the problem was or who it was She got a can of beer out of the fridge and went upstairs with it The first real disquiet stirred in her when she saw that the bathroom door was shut Not just partway closed but shut tight Stanley never closed the door when he was taking a bath It was something of a joke between themthe closed door meant he was doing something his mother had taught him the open door meant he would not be averse to doing something the teaching of which his mother had quite properly left to others Patty tapped on the door with her nails suddenly aware too aware of the reptilian clicking sound they made on the wood And surely tapping on the bathroom door knocking like a guest was something she had never done before in her married lifenot here not on any other door in the house The disquiet suddenly grew strong in her and she thought of Carson Lake where she had gone swimming often as a girl By the first of August the lake was as warm as a tub but then youd hit a cold pocket that would shiver you with surprise and delight One minute you were warm the next moment it felt as if the temperature had plummeted twenty degrees below your hips Minus the delight that was how she felt nowas if she had just struck a cold pocket Only this cold pocket was not below her hips chilling her long teenagers legs in the black depths of Carson Lake This time she did more than tap with her nails She rapped on the door When there was still no answer she hammered on it Her heart Her heart wasnt in her chest anymore It was beating in her throat making it hard to breathe In the silence following her shout and just the sound of herself shouting up here less than thirty feet from the place where she laid her head down and went to sleep each night frightened her even more she heard a sound which brought panic up from the belowstairs part of her mind like an unwelcome guest Such a small sound really It was only the sound of dripping water Plink pause Plink pause Plink pause Plink She could see the drops forming on the snout of the faucet growing heavy and fat there growing pregnant there and then falling off plink Just that sound No other And she was suddenly terribly sure that it had been Stanley not her father who had been stricken with a heart attack tonight With a moan she gripped the cutglass doorknob and turned it Yet still the door would not move it was locked And suddenly three nevers occurred to Patty Uris in rapid succession Stanley never took a bath in the early evening Stanley never closed the door unless he was using the toilet and Stanley had never locked the door against her at all Was it possible she wondered crazily to prepare for a heart attack Patty ran her tongue over her lipsit produced a sound in her head like fine sandpaper sliding along a boardand called his name again There was still no answer except the steady deliberate drip of the faucet She looked down and saw she still held the can of Dixie beer in one hand She gazed at it stupidly her heart running like a rabbit in her throat she gazed at it as if she had never seen a can of beer in her whole life before this minute And indeed it seemed she never had or at least never one like this because when she blinked her eyes it turned into a telephone handset as black and as threatening as a snake May I help you maam Do you have a problem the snake spat at her Patty slammed it down in its cradle and stepped away rubbing the hand which had held it She looked around and saw she was back in the TV room and understood that the panic which had come into the front of her mind like a prowler walking quietly up a flight of stairs had had its way with her Now she could remember dropping the beer can outside the bathroom door and pelting headlong back down the stairs thinking vaguely This is all a mistake of some kind and well laugh about it later He filled up the tub and then remembered he didnt have cigarettes and went out to get them before he took his clothes off Yes Only he had already locked the bathroom door from the inside and because it was too much of a bother to unlock it again he had simply opened the window over the tub and gone down the side of the house like a fly crawling down a wall Sure of course sure Panic was rising in her mind againit was like bitter black coffee threatening to overflow the rim of a cup She closed her eyes and fought against it She stood there perfectly still a pale statue with a pulse beating in its throat Now she could remember running back down here feet stuttering on the stairlevels running for the phone oh yes oh sure but who had she meant to call Crazily she thought I would call the turtle but the turtle couldnt help us It didnt matter anyway She had gotten as far as zero and she must have said something not quite standard because the operator had asked if she had a problem She had one all right but how did you tell that faceless voice that Stanley had locked himself in the bathroom and didnt answer her that the steady sound of the water dripping into the tub was killing her heart Someone had to help her Someone She put the back of her hand into her mouth and deliberately bit down on it She tried to think tried to force herself to think She got going and one slippered foot kicked the bag of buttons resting beside her chair Some of the buttons spilled out glittering like glazed eyes in the lamplight She saw at least half a dozen black ones Mounted inside the door of the cupboard over the doublebasin sink was a large varnished board in the shape of a keyone of Stans clients had made it in his workshop and given it to him two Christmases ago The keyboard was studded with small hooks and swinging on these were all the keys the house took two duplicates of each to a hook Beneath each hook was a strip of Mystik tape each strip lettered in Stans small neat printing GARAGE ATTIC DSTAIRS BATH UPSTAIRS BATH FRONT DOOR BACK DOOR Off to one side were ignitionkey dupes labelled MB and VOLVO Patty snatched the key marked UPSTAIRS BATH began to run for the stairs and then made herself walk Running made the panic want to come back and the panic was too close to the surface as it was Also if she just walked maybe nothing would be wrong Or if there was something wrong God could look down see she was just walking and think Oh goodI pulled a hell of a boner but Ive got time to take it all back Walking as sedately as a woman on her way to a Ladies Book Circle meeting she went up the stairs and down to the closed bathroom door Stanley she called trying the door again at the same time suddenly more afraid than ever not wanting to use the key because having to use the key was somehow too final If God hadnt taken it back by the time she used the key then He never would The age of miracles after all was past But the door was still locked the deliberate plink pause of dripping water was her only answer Her hand was shaking and the key chattered all the way around the plate before finding its way into the keyhole and socking itself home She turned it and heard the lock snap back She fumbled for the cutglass knob It tried to slide through her hand againnot because the door was locked this tune but because her palm was wet with sweat She firmed her grip and made it turn She pushed the door open She looked at the tub with its blue shower curtain bunched at the far end of the stainless steel rod and forgot how to finish her husbands name She simply stared at the tub her face as solemn as the face of a child on her first day at school In a moment she would begin to scream and Anita MacKenzie next door would hear her and it would be Anita MacKenzie who would call the police convinced that someone had broken into the Uris house and that people were being killed over there But for now this one moment Patty Uris simply stood silent with her hands clasped in front of her against her dark cotton skirt her face solemn her eyes huge And now the look of almost holy solemnity began to transform itself into something else The huge eyes began to bulge Her mouth pulled back into a dreadful grin of horror She wanted to scream and couldnt The screams were too big to come out The bathroom was lit by fluorescent tubes It was very bright There were no shadows You could see everything whether you wanted to or not The water in the tub was bright pink Stanley lay with his back propped against the rear of the tub His head had rolled so far back on his neck that strands of his short black hair brushed the skin between his shoulderblades If his staring eyes had still been capable of seeing she would have looked upside down to him His mouth hung open like a sprung door His expression was one of abysmal frozen horror A package of Gillette Platinum Plus razor blades lay on the rim of the tub He had slit his inner forearms open from wrist to the crook of the elbow and then had crossed each of these cuts just below the Bracelets of Fortune making a pair of bloody capital Ts The gashes glared redpurple in the harsh white light She thought the exposed tendons and ligaments looked like cuts of cheap beef A drop of water gathered at the lip of the shiny chromium faucet It grew fat Grew pregnant you might say It sparkled It dropped Plink He had dipped his right forefinger in his own blood and had written a single word on the blue tiles above the tub written it in two huge staggering letters A zigzagging bloody fingermark fell away from the second letter of this wordhis finger had made that mark she saw as his hand fell into the tub where it now floated She thought Stanley must have made that markhis final impression on the worldas he lost consciousness It seemed to cry out at her That did it Patty Uris at last found her voice Staring into her husbands dead and sparkling eyes she began to scream Rich felt like he was doing pretty good until the vomiting started He had listened to everything Mike Hanlon told him said all the right things answered Mikes questions even asked a few of his own He was vaguely aware that he was doing one of his Voicesnot a strange and outrageous one like those he sometimes did on the radio Kinky Briefcase Sexual Accountant was his own personal favorite at least for the tune being and positive listener response on Kinky was almost as high as for his listeners alltime favorite Colonel Buford Kissdrivel but a warm rich confident Voice An ImAllRight Voice It sounded great but it was a lie Just like all the other Voices were lies He sat in his study for a moment leaning back in the chair behind his desk looking out at the Pacific Ocean A couple of kids were down on the left horsing around on their surfboards not really riding them There wasnt much surf to ride The clock on the deskan expensive LED quartz that had been a gift from a record company repsaid that it was PM on May th  It would of course be three hours later where Mike was calling from Dark already He felt a prickle of gooseflesh at that and he began to move to do things First of course he put on a recordnot hunting just grabbing blindly among the thousands racked on the shelves Rock and roll was almost as much a part of his life as the Voices and it was hard for him to do anything without music playingand the louder the better The record he grabbed turned out to be a Motown retrospective Marvin Gaye one of the newer members of what Rich sometimes called The AllDead Band came on singing I Heard It Through the Grapevine Not bad Rich said He even smiled a little This was bad and it had admittedly knocked him for a loop but he felt that he was going to be able to handle it No sweat He began getting ready to go back home And at some point during the next hour it occurred to him that it was as if he had died and had yet been allowed to make all of his own final business dispositions not to mention his own funeral arrangements And he felt as if he was doing pretty good He tried the travel agent he used thinking she would probably be on the freeway and headed home by now but taking a shot on the offchance For a wonder he caught her in He told her what he needed and she asked him for fifteen minutes I owe you one Carol he said They had progressed from Mr Tozier and Ms Feeny to Rich and Carol over the last three yearspretty chummy considering they had never met face to face All right pay off she said Can you do Kinky Briefcase for me Without even pausingif you had to pause to find your Voice there was usually no Voice there to be foundRich said Kinky Briefcase Sexual Accountant hereI had a fellow come in the other day who wanted to know what the worst thing was about getting AIDS His voice had dropped slightly at the same time its rhythm had speeded up and become jauntyit was clearly an American voice and yet it somehow conjured up images of a wealthy British colonial chappie who was as charming in his muddled way as he was addled Rich hadnt the slightest idea who Kinky Briefcase really was but he was sure he always wore white suits read Esquire and drank things which came in tall glasses and smelled like coconutscented shampoo I told him right awaytrying to explain to your mother how you picked it up from a Haitian girl Until next time this is Kinky Briefcase Sexual Accountant saying You need my card if you cant get hard Carol Feeny screamed with laughter Thats perfect Perfect My boyfriend says he doesnt believe you can just do those voices he says its got to be a voicefilter gadget or something Just talent my dear Rich said Kinky Briefcase was gone W C Fields top hat red nose golfbags and all was here Im so stuffed with talent I have to plug up all my bodily orifices to keep it from just running out like well just running out She went off into another screamy gale of laughter and Rich closed his eyes He could feel the beginnings of a headache Be a dear and see what you can do would you he asked still being W C Fields and hung up on her laughter Now he had to go back to being himself and that was hardit got harder to do that every year It was easier to be brave when you were someone else He was trying to pick out a pair of good loafers and had about decided to stick with sneakers when the phone rang again It was Carol Feeny back in record time He felt an instant urge to fall into the Buford Kissdrivel Voice and fought it off She had been able to get him a firstclass seat on the American Airlines redeye nonstop from LAX to Boston He would leave LA at PM and arrive at Logan about five oclock tomorrow morning Delta would fly him out of Boston at  AM and into Bangor Maine at  She had gotten him a fullsized sedan from Avis and it was only twentysix miles from the Avis counter at Bangor International Airport to the Derry town line Only twentysix miles Rich thought Is that all Carol Well maybe it isin miles anyway But you dont have the slightest idea how far it really is to Derry and I dont either But oh God oh dear God I am going to find out I didnt try for a room because you didnt tell me how long youd be there she said do you Nolet me take care of that Rich said and then Buford Kissdrivel took over Youve been a peach my deah A Jawja peach a cawse He hung up gently on heralways leave em laughingand then dialed for State of Maine Directory Assistance He wanted a number for the Derry Town House God there was a name from the past He hadnt thought of the Derry Town House inwhatten years twenty twentyfive years even Crazy as it seemed he guessed it had been at least twentyfive years and if Mike hadnt called he supposed he might never have thought of it again in his life And yet there had been a time in his life when he had walked past that great red brick pile every dayand on more than one occasion he had run past it with Henry Bowers and Belch Huggins and that other big boy Victor SomebodyorOther in hot pursuit all of them yelling little pleasantries like Were gonna getcha fuckface Gonna getcha you little smartass Gonna getcha you foureyed faggot Had they ever gotten him Before Rich could remember an operator was asking him what city please Derry God Even the word felt strange and forgotten in his mouth saying it was like kissing an antique No way Itll be gone Razed in an urbanrenewal program Changed into an Elks Hall or a BowlaDrome or an Electric Dreamscape Video Arcade Or maybe burned down one night when the odds finally ran out on some drunk shoe salesman smoking in bed All gone Richiejust like the glasses Henry Bowers always used to rag you about Whats that Springsteen song say Glory days gone in the wink of a young girls eye What young girl Why Bev of course Bev Changed the Town House might be but gone it apparently was not because a blank robotic voice now came on the line and said The number is       Repeat the number is But Rich had gotten it the first time It was a pleasure to hang up on that droning voiceit was too easy to imagine some great globular Directory Assistance monster buried somewhere in the earth sweating rivets and holding thousands of telephones in thousands of jointed chromium tentaclesthe Ma Bell version of Spideys nemesis Dr Octopus Each year the world Rich lived in felt more and more like a huge electronic haunted house in which digital ghosts and frightened human beings lived in uneasy coexistence Still standing To paraphrase Paul Simon still standing after all these years He dialed the hotel he had last seen through the hornrimmed spectacles of his childhood Dialing that number was fatally easy He held the telephone to his ear looking out his studys wide picture window The surfers were gone a couple were walking slowly up the beach hand in hand where they had been The couple could have been a poster on the wall of the travel agency where Carol Feeny worked that was how perfect they were Except that was for the fact they were both wearing glasses Criss his mind sent up abruptly His last name was Criss Victor Criss Oh Christ that was nothing he wanted to know not at this late date but it didnt seem to matter in the slightest Something was happening down there in the vaults down there where Rich Tozier kept his own personal collection of Golden Oldies Doors were opening Only theyre not records down there are they Down there youre not Rich records Tozier hotshot KLAD deejay and the Man of a Thousand Voices are you And those things that are opening they arent exactly doors are they Thing to remember is that Im okay Im okay youre okay Rich Toziers okay Could use a cigarette is all He had quit four years ago but he could use one now all right Theyre not records but dead bodies You buried them deep but now theres some kind of crazy earthquake going on and the ground is spitting them up to the surface Youre not Rich records Tozier down there down there youre just Richie FourEyes Tozier and youre with your buddies and youre so scared it feels like your balls are turning into Welchs grape jelly Those arent doors and theyre not opening Those are crypts Richie Theyre cracking open and the vampires you thought were dead are all flying out again A cigarette just one Even a Carlton would do for Christs sweet sake Town House a male voice with a Yankee tang said it had travelled all the way across New England the Midwest and under the casinos of Las Vegas to reach his ear Rich asked the voice if he could reserve a suite of rooms at the Town House beginning tomorrow The voice told him he could and then asked him for how long What did he have exactly In his minds eye he saw a boy with a tartan bookbag running from the tough guys he saw a boy who wore glasses a thin boy with a pale face that had somehow seemed to scream Hit me Go on and hit me in some mysterious way to every passing bully Heres my lips Mash them back against my teeth Heres my nose Bloody it for sure and break it if you can Box an ear so it swells up like a cauliflower Split an eyebrow Heres my chin go for the knockout button Here are my eyes so blue and so magnified behind these hateful hateful glasses these hornrimmed specs one bow of which is held on with adhesive tape Break the specs Drive a shard of glass into one of these eyes and close it forever What the hell He closed his eyes and said Ive got business in Derry you see I dont know how long the transaction will take How about three days with an option to renew An option to renew the deskclerk asked doubtfully and Rich waited patiently for the fellow to work it over in his mind Oh I get you Thats very good Thank you and I ah hope you can vote for us in Novembah John F Kennedy said Jackie wants to ah do ovuh the ah Oval Office and Ive got a job all lined up for my ah brothah Bobby Okay somebody else got on the line there for a few seconds Just an old pol from the DOP Rich thought Thats Dead Old Party in case you should wonder Dont worry about it A shudder worked through him and he told himself again almost desperately Youre okay Rich I heard it too Rich said Must have been a line crossover How we looking on that room Oh theres no problem with that the clerk said We do business here in Derry but it really never booms Oh ayuh the clerk agreed and Rich shuddered again He had forgotten that toothat simple northern New Englandism for yes Oh ayuh Gonna getcha creep the ghostly voice of Henry Bowers screamed and he felt more crypts cracking open inside of him the stench he smelled was not decayed bodies but decayed memories and that was somehow worse He gave the Town House clerk his American Express number and hung up Then he called Steve Covall the KLAD program director Whats up Rich Steve asked The last Arbitron ratings had shown KLAD at the top of the cannibalistic Los Angeles FMrock market and ever since then Steve had been in an excellent moodthank God for small favors Well you might be sorry you asked he told Steve Im taking a powder Taking He could hear the frown in Steves voice I dont think I get you Rich I have to put on my boogie shoes Im going away What do you mean going away According to the log I have right here in front of me youre on the air tomorrow from two in the afternoon until six PM just like always In fact youre interviewing Clarence demons in the studio at four You know Clarence Clemons Rich As in Come on and blow Big Man Clemons can talk to Mike OHara as well as he can to me Clarence doesnt want to talk to Mike Rich Clarence doesnt want to talk to Bobby Russell He doesnt want to talk to me Clarence is a big fan of Buford Kissdrivel and Wyatt the Homicidal BagBoy He wants to talk to you my friend And I have no interest in having a pissedoff twohundredandfiftypound saxophone player who was once almost drafted by a pro football team running amok in my studio I dont think he has a history of running amok Rich said I mean were talking Clarence Clemons here not Keith Moon Youre not serious are you Steve finally asked He sounded plaintive I mean unless your mother just died or youve got to have a brain tumor out or something this is called crapping out Someone called me Someone I used to know a long time ago In another place Back then something happened I made a promise We all promised that we would go back if the something started happening again And I guess it has Id just as soon not say Also youll think Im crazy if I tell you the truth I dont remember There was another long pause and he knew Steve Covall was trying to decide if Rich records Tozier aka Buford Kissdrivel aka Wyatt the Homicidal BagBoy etc etc was having him on or was having some kind of mental breakdown All right Steve said Ill shift the rotationput Mike in for you I can call Chuck Foster to pull a few shifts I guess if I can find what Chinese restaurant hes currently holed up in Ill do it because we go back a long way together But Im never going to forget you bushed out on me Rich Oh get down off it Rich said but the headache was getting worse He knew what he was doing did Steve really think he didnt I need a few days off is all Youre acting like I took a shit on our FCC charter A few days off for what The reunion of your Cub Scout pack in Shithouse Falls North Dakota or Pussyhump City West Virginia Actually I think Shithouse Falls in Arkansas bo Buford Kissdrivel said in his big hollowbarrel Voice but Steve was not to be diverted Because you made a promise when you were eleven Kids dont make serious promises when theyre eleven for Christs sake And its not even that Rich and you know it This is not an insurance company this is not a law office This is showbusiness be it ever so humble and you fucking well know it If you had given me a weeks notice I wouldnt be holding this phone in one hand and a bottle of Mylanta in the other You are putting my balls to the wall and you know it so dont you insult my intelligence Steve was nearly screaming now and Rich closed his eyes Im never going to forget it Steve had said and Rich supposed he never would But Steve had also said kids didnt make serious promises when they were eleven and that wasnt true at all Rich couldnt remember what the promise had beenwasnt sure he wanted to rememberbut it had been plenty serious Yeah And I told you I could handle it So go ahead Go ahead you busher But Steve had already hung up Rich put the phone down He had barely started away from it when it began to ring again and he knew without picking it up that it was Steve again madder than ever Talking to him at this point would do no good things would just get uglier He slid the switch on the side of the phone to the right cutting it off in midring He went upstairs pulled two suitcases out of the closet and filled them with a barely glancedat conglomeration of clothesjeans shins underwear socks It would not occur to him until later that he had taken nothing but kidclothes He carried the suitcases back downstairs On the den wall was a blackandwhite Ansel Adams photograph of Big Sur Rich swung it back on hidden hinges exposing a barrel safe He opened it pawed his way past the paperworkthe house here poised cozily between the faultline and the brushfire zone twenty acres of timberland in Idaho a bunch of stocks He had bought the stocks seemingly at randomwhen his broker saw Rich coming he immediately clutched his headbut the stocks had all risen steadily over the years He was sometimes surprised by the thought that he was almostnot quite but almosta rich man All courtesy of rockandroll music and the Voices of course House acres stocks insurance policy even a copy of his last will and testament The strings that bind you tight to the map of your life he thought There was a sudden wild impulse to whip out his Zippo and light it up the whole whores combine of wherefores and knowyeallmenbythesepresents and thebearerofthiscertificateisentitleds And he could do it too The papers in his safe had suddenly ceased to signify anything The first real terror struck him then and there was nothing at all supernatural about it It was only a realization of how easy it was to trash your life That was what was so scary You just dragged the fan up to everything you had spent the years raking together and turned the motherfucker on Easy Burn it up or blow it away then just take a powder Behind the papers which were only currencys second cousins was the real stuff The cash Four thousand dollars in tens twenties and fifties Taking it now stuffing it into the pocket of his jeans he wondered if he hadnt somehow known what he was doing when he put the money in herefifty bucks one month a hundred and twenty the next maybe only ten the month after that Rathole money Takingapowder money Man thats scary he said barely aware he had spoken He was looking blankly out the big window at the beach It was deserted now the surfers gone the honeymooners if that was what they had been gone too Ah yes docit all comes back to me now Remember Stanley Uris for instance Bet your fur I do Remember how we used to say that and think it was so cool Stanley Urine the big kids called him Hey Urine Hey you fuckin Christkiller Where ya goin One of ya fag friends gonna give you a bee jay He slammed the safe door shut and swung the picture back into place When had he last thought of Stan Uris Five years ago Ten Twenty Rich and his family had moved away from Derry in the spring of and how fast all of their faces faded his gang that pitiful bunch of losers with their little clubhouse in what had been known then as the Barrensfunny name for an area as lush with growth as that place had been Kidding themselves that they were jungle explorers or Seabees carving out a landing strip on a Pacific atoll while they held off the Japs kidding themselves that they were dambuilders cowboys spacemen on a jungle world you name it but whatever you name it dont lets forget what it really was it was hiding Hiding from the big kids Hiding from Henry Bowers and Victor Criss and Belch Huggins and the rest of them What a bunch of losers they had beenStan Uris with his big Jewboy nose Bill Denbrough who could say nothing but Hiyo Silver without stuttering so badly that it drove you almost dogshit Beverly Marsh with her bruises and her cigarettes rolled into the sleeve of her blouse Ben Hanscom who had been so big he looked like a human version of Moby Dick and Richie Tozier with his thick glasses and his A averages and his wise mouth and his face which just begged to be pounded into new and exciting shapes Was there a word for what they had been Oh yes There always was Le mot juste In this case le mot juste was wimps How it came back how all of it came back and now he stood here in his den shivering as helplessly as a homeless mutt caught in a thunderstorm shivering because the guys he had run with werent all he remembered There were other things things he hadnt thought of in years trembling just below the surface The house on Neibolt Street and Bill screaming You kkitted my brother you fuhfuhfucker Did he remember Just enough not to want to remember any more and you could bet your fur on that A smell of garbage a smell of shit and a smell of something else Something worse than either It was the stink of the beast the stink of It down there in the darkness under Derry where the machines thundered on and on He remembered George But that was too much and he ran for the bathroom blundering into his Eames chair on his way and almost falling He made it barely He slid across the slick tiles to the toilet on his knees like some weird breakdancer gripped the edges and vomited everything in his guts Even then it wouldnt stop suddenly he could see Georgie Denbrough as if he had last seen him yesterday Georgie who had been the start of it all Georgie who had been murdered in the fall of Georgie had died right after the flood one of his arms had been ripped from its socket and Rich had blocked all of that out of his memory But sometimes those things come back oh yes indeedy they come back sometimes they come back The spasm passed and Rich groped blindly for the flush Water roared His early supper regurgitated in hot chunks vanished tastefully down the drain He closed the lid laid his forehead against it and began to cry It was the first time he had cried since his mother died in Without even thinking of what he was doing he cupped his hands under his eyes and the contact lenses he wore slipped out and lay glistening in his palms Forty minutes later feeling huskedout and somehow cleansed he threw his suitcases into the trunk of his MG and backed it out of the garage The light was fading He looked at his house with the new plantings he looked at the beach at the water which had taken on the cast of pale emeralds broken by a narrow track of beaten gold And a conviction stole over him that he would never see any of this again that he was a dead man walking Going home now Rich Tozier whispered to himself Going home God help me going home He put the car in gear and went feeling again how easy it had been to slip through an unsuspected fissure in what he had considered a solid lifehow easy it was to get over onto the dark side to sail out of the blue and into the black Out of the blue and into the black yes that was it Where anything might be waiting If on that night of May th you had wanted to find the man Time magazine had called perhaps the most promising young architect in America Urban Energy Conservation and the Young Turks Time October  you would have had to drive west out of Omaha on Interstate  to do it Youd have taken the Swedholm exit and then Highway  to downtown Swedholm of which there isnt much There youd turn off on Highway  at Buckys HiHat EatEmUp Chicken Fried Steak Our Specialty and once out in the country again youd hang a right on Highway  which runs straight as a string through the deserted little town of Gatlin and finally into Hemingford Home Downtown Hemingford Home made downtown Swedholm look like New York City the business district consisted of eight buildings five on one side and three on the other There was the Kleen Kut barber shop propped in the window a yellowing handlettered sign fully fifteen years old read IF YOUR A HIPPY GET YOUR HAIR CUT SOMEWHERE ELSE the secondrun movie house the fiveanddime There was a branch of the Nebraska Homeowners Bank a  gas station a Rexall Drug and the National Farmstead amp Hardware Supplywhich was the only business in town which looked halfway prosperous And near the end of the main drag set off a little way from the other buildings like a pariah and resting on the edge of the big empty you had your basic roadhousethe Red Wheel If you had gotten that far you would have seen in the potholed dirt parking lot an aging Cadillac convertible with double CB antennas on the back The vanity plate on the front read simply BENS CADDY And inside walking toward the bar you would have found your manlanky sunburned dressed in a chambray shirt faded jeans and a pair of scuffed engineer boots There were faint squintlines around the corners of his eyes but nowhere else He looked perhaps ten years younger than his actual age which was thirtyeight Hello Mr Hanscom Ricky Lee said putting a paper napkin on the bar as Ben sat down Ricky Lee sounded a trifle surprised and he was He had never seen Hanscom in the Wheel on a weeknight before He came in regularly every Friday night for two beers and every Saturday night for four or five he always asked after Ricky Lees three boys he always left the same fivedollar tip under his beer stein when he took off In terms of both professional conversation and personal regard he was far and away Ricky Lees favorite customer The ten dollars a week and the fifty left under the stem at each Christmastime over the last five years was fine enough but the mans company was worth far more Worthwhile company was always a rarity but in a honkytonk like this where talk always came cheap it was scarcer than hens teeth Although Hanscoms roots were in New England and he had gone to college in California there was more than a touch of the extravagant Texan about him Ricky Lee counted on Ben Hanscoms FridaySaturdaynight stops because he had learned over the years that he could count on them Mr Hanscom might be building a skyscraper in New York where he already had three of the most talkedabout buildings in the city a new art gallery in Redondo Beach or a business building in Salt Lake City but come Friday night the door leading to the parking lot would open sometime between eight oclock and ninethirty and in he would stroll as if he lived no farther than the other side of town and had decided to drop in because there was nothing good on TV He had his own Learjet and a private landing strip on his farm in Junkins Two years ago he had been in London first designing and then overseeing the construction of the new BBC communications centera building that was still hotly debated pro and con in the British press the Guardian Perhaps the most beautiful building to be constructed in London over the last twenty years the Mirror Other than the face of my motherinlaw after a pubcrawl the ugliest thing I have ever seen When Mr Hanscom took that job Ricky Lee had thought Well Ill see him again sometime Or maybe hell just forget all about us And indeed the Friday night after Ben Hanscom left for England had come and gone with no sign of him although Ricky Lee found himself looking up quickly every tune the door opened between eight and ninethirty Well Ill see him again sometime Maybe Sometime turned out to be the next night The door had opened at quarter past nine and in he had ambled wearing jeans and a GO BAMA teeshirt and his old engineer boots looking like hed come from no farther away than crosstown And when Ricky Lee cried almost joyfully Hey Mr Hanscom Christ What are you doin here Mr Hanscom had looked mildly surprised as if there was nothing in the least unusual about his being here Nor had that been a oneshot he had showed up every Saturday during the twoyear course of his active involvement in the BBC job He left London each Saturday morning at AM on the Concorde he told a fascinated Ricky Lee and arrived at Kennedy in New York at  AMfortyfive minutes before he left London at least by the clock God its like time travel aint it an impressed Ricky Lee had said A limousine was standing by to take him over to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey a trip which usually took no more than an hour on Saturday morning He could be in the cockpit of his Lear before noon with no trouble at all and touching down in Junkins by twothirty If you head west fast enough he told Ricky the day just seems to go on forever He would take a twohour nap spend an hour with his foreman and half an hour with his secretary He would eat supper and then come on over to the Red Wheel for an hour and a half or so He always came in alone he always sat at the bar and he always left the way he had come in although God knew there were plenty of women in this part of Nebraska who would have been happy to screw the socks off him Back at the farm he would catch six hours of sleep and then the whole process would reverse itself Ricky had never had a customer who failed to be impressed with this story Maybe hes gay a woman had told him once Ricky Lee glanced at her briefly taking in the carefully styled hair the carefully tailored clothes which undoubtedly had designer labels the diamond chips at her ears the look in her eyes and knew she was from somewhere back east probably New York out here on a brief duty visit to a relative or maybe an old school chum and couldnt wait to get out again No he had replied Mr Hanscom aint no sissy She had taken a pack of Doral cigarettes from her purse and held one between her red glistening lips until he lit it for her How do you know she had asked smiling a little I just do he said And he did He thought of saying to her I think hes the most Godawful lonely man I ever met in my life But he wasnt going to say any such thing to this New York woman who was looking at him like he was some new and amusing type of life Hello Ricky Lee he said sitting down and then fell to studying his hands Ricky Lee knew he was slated to spend the next six or eight months in Colorado Springs overseeing the start of the Mountain States Cultural Center a sprawling sixbuilding complex which would be cut into the side of a mountain When its done people are going to say it looks like a giantkid left his toy blocks all over a flight of stairs Ben had told Ricky Lee Some will anyway and theyll be at least halfright But I think its going to work Its the biggest thing Ive ever tried and putting it up is going to be scary as hell but I think its going to work Ricky Lee supposed it was possible that Mr Hanscom had a little touch of stage fright Nothing surprising about that and nothing wrong about it either When you got big enough to be noticed you got big enough to come gunning for Or maybe he just had a touch of the bug There was a hell of a lively one going around Ricky Lee got a beer stein from the backbar and reached for the Olympia tap Ricky Lee turned back surprisedand when Ben Hanscom looked up from his hands he was suddenly frightened Because Mr Hanscom didnt look like he had stage fright or the virus that was going around or anything like that He looked like he had just taken a terrible blow and was still trying to understand whatever it was that had hit him Someone died He aint married but every mans got a fambly and someone in his just bit the dust Thats what happened just as sure as shit rolls downhill front a privy Someone dropped a quarter into the jukebox and Barbara Mandrell started to sing about a drunk man and a lonely woman Ben Hanscom looked at Ricky Lee out of eyes that suddenly looked tenno twentyyears older than the rest of his face arid Ricky Lee was astonished to observe that Mr Hanscoms hair was graying He had never noticed any gray in his hair before Hanscom smiled The smile was ghastly horrible It was like watching a corpse smile I dont think I am Ricky Lee No sir Not tonight Not at all Ricky Lee set the stein down and walked back over to where Hanscom sat The bar was as empty as a Mondaynight bar far outside of football season can get There were fewer than twenty paying customers in the place Annie was sitting by the door into the kitchen playing cribbage with the shortorder cook Bad news thats right Bad news from home He looked at Ricky Lee He looked through Ricky Lee He fell silent and Ricky Lee was about to ask him if there was anything he could do when Hanscom said For everyone else in this dump its Four Roses Ricky Lee said But for you I think its Wild Turkey Hanscom smiled a little at that Thats good of you Ricky Lee I think you better grab that stein after all What you do is fill it up with Wild Turkey Fill it Ricky Lee asked frankly astonished Christ Ill have to roll you out of here Or call an ambulance he thought Ricky Lee looked carefully into Mr Hanscoms eyes to see if he could possibly be joking and it took less than a second to see that he wasnt So he got the stein from the backbar and the bottle of Wild Turkey from one of the shelves below The neck of the bottle chattered against the rim of the stein as he began to pour He watched the whiskey gurgle out fascinated in spite of himself Ricky Lee decided it was more than just a touch of the Texan that Mr Hanscom had in him this had to be the biggest goddamned shot of whiskey he ever had poured or ever would pour in his life Call an ambulance my ass He drinks this baby and Ill be calling Parker and Waters in Swedholm for their funeral hack Nevertheless he brought it back and set it down in front of Hanscom Ricky Lees father had once told him that if a man was in his right mind you brought him what he paid for be it piss or poison Ricky Lee didnt know if that was good advice or bad but he knew that if you tended bar for a living it went a fair piece toward saving you from being chomped into gatorbait by your own conscience Hanscom looked at the monster drink thoughtfully for a moment and then asked What do I owe you for a shot like that Ricky Lee Ricky Lee shook his head slowly eyes still on the steinful of whiskey not wanting to look up and meet those socketed staring eyes No he said This one is on the house Hanscom smiled again this time more naturally Why I thank you Ricky Lee Now I am going to show you something I learned about in Peru in I was working with a guy named Frank Billingsunderstudying with him I guess youd say Frank Billings was the best damned architect in the world I think He caught a fever and the doctors injected about a billion different antibiotics into him and not a single one of them touched it He burned for two weeks and then he died What Im going to show you I learned from the Indians who worked on the project The local popskull is pretty potent You take a slug and you think its going down pretty mellow no problem and then all at once its like someone lit a blowtorch in your mouth and aimed it down your throat But the Indians drink it like CocaCola and I rarely saw one drunk and I never saw one with a hangover Never had the sack to try it their way myself But I think Ill give it a go tonight Bring me some of those lemon wedges there Ricky Lee brought him four and laid them out neatly on a fresh napkin next to the stein of whiskey Hanscom picked one of them up tilted his head back like a man about to administer eyedrops to himself and then began to squeeze raw lemonjuice into his right nostril Hanscoms throat worked His face flushed and then Ricky Lee saw tears running down the flat planes of his face toward his ears Now the Spinners were on the juke singing about the rubberbandman Oh Lord I just dont know how much of this I can stand the Spinners sang Hanscom groped blindly on the bar found another slice of lemon and squeezed the juice into his other nostril Hanscom tossed both of the wrungout lemon wedges onto the bar His eyes were fiery red and he was breathing in hitching wincing gasps Clear lemonjuice dripped from both of his nostrils and trickled down to the corners of his mouth He groped for the stein raised it and drank a third of it Frozen Ricky Lee watched his adams apple go up and down Hanscom set the stein aside shuddered twice then nodded He looked at Ricky Lee and smiled a little His eyes were no longer red Works about like they said it did You are so fucking concerned about your nose that you never feel whats going down your throat at all You bet your fur Mr Hanscom said You remember that one Ricky Lee We used to say that when we were kids You bet your fur Did I ever tell you I used to be fat No sir you never did Ricky Lee whispered He was now convinced that Mr Hanscom had received some intelligence so dreadful that the man really had gone crazy or at least taken temporary leave of his senses I was a regular butterball Never played baseball or basketball always got caught first when we played tag couldnt keep out of my own way I was fat all right And there were these fellows in my home town who used to take after me pretty regularly There was a fellow named Reginald Huggins only everyone called him Belch A kid named Victor Criss A few other guys But the real brains of the combination was a fellow named Henry Bowers If there has ever been a genuinely evil kid strutting across the skin of the world Ricky Lee Henry Bowers was that kid I wasnt the only kid he used to take after my problem was I couldnt run as fast as some of the others Hanscom unbuttoned his shirt and opened it Leaning forward Ricky Lee saw a funny twisted scar on Mr Hanscoms stomach just above his navel Puckered white and old It was a letter he saw Someone had carved the letter H into the mans stomach probably long before Mr Hanscom had been a man Henry Bowers did that to me About a thousand years ago Im lucky Im not wearing his whole damned name down there Hanscom took the other two lemonslices one in each hand tilted his head back and took them like nosedrops He shuddered wrackingly put them aside and took two big swallows from the stein He shuddered again took another gulp and then groped for the padded edge of the bar with his eyes closed For a moment he held on like a man on a sailboat clinging to the rail for support in a heavy sea Then he opened his eyes again and smiled at Ricky Lee Mr Hanscom I wish you wouldnt do that anymore Ricky Lee said nervously Annie came over to the waitresses stand with her tray and called for a couple of Millers Ricky Lee drew them and took them down to her His legs felt rubbery Is Mr Hanscom all right Ricky Lee Annie asked She was looking past Ricky Lee and he turned to follow her gaze Mr Hanscom was leaning over the bar carefully picking lemonslices out of the caddy where Ricky Lee kept the drink garnishes Well get your thumb out of your ass and do something about it Annie was like most other women partial to Ben Hanscom I dunno My daddy always said that if a mans in his right mind Your daddy didnt have the brains God gave a gopher Annie said Never mind your daddy You got to put a stop to that Ricky Lee Hes going to kill himself Thus given his marching orders Ricky Lee went back down to where Ben Hanscom sat Mr Hanscom I really think youve had en Hanscom tilted his head back Squeezed Actually sniffed the lemonjuice back this time as if it were cocaine He gulped whiskey as if it were water He looked at Ricky Lee solemnly Bingbang I saw the whole gang dancing on my livingroom rug he said and then laughed There was maybe two inches of whiskey left in the stem That is enough Ricky Lee said and reached for the stein Hanscom moved it gently out of his reach damage has been done Ricky Lee he said The damage has been done boy Ive got something for your kids Ricky Lee Damn if I didnt almost forget He was wearing a faded denim vest and now he reached something out of one of its pockets Ricky Lee heard a muted clink My dad died when I was four Hanscom said There was no slur at all in his voice Left us a bunch of debts and these I want your kiddos to have them Ricky Lee He put three cartwheel silver dollars on the bar where they gleamed under the soft lights Ricky Lee caught his breath There used to be four but I gave one of them to Stuttering Bill and the others Bill Denbrough that was his real name Stuttering Bills just what we used to call him just a thing we used to say like You bet your fur He was one of the best friends I ever hadI did have a few you know even a fat kid like me had a few Stuttering Bills a writer now Ricky Lee barely heard him He was looking at the cartwheels fascinated  and  God knew what they were worth now just in terms of the pure silver they contained But I insist Mr Hanscom took hold of the stein and drained it He should have been flat on his keister but his eyes never left Ricky Lees Those eyes were watery and very bloodshot but Ricky Lee would have sworn on a stack of Bibles that they were also the eyes of a sober man Youre scaring me a little Mr Hanscom Ricky Lee said Two years ago Gresham Arnold a rumdum of some local repute had come into the Red Wheel with a roll of quarters in his hand and a twenty dollar bill stuck into the band of his hat He handed the roll to Annie with instructions to feed the quarters into the jukebox by fours He put the twenty on the bar and instructed Ricky Lee to set up drinks for the house This rumdum this Gresham Arnold had long ago been a star basketball player for the Hemingford Rams leading them to their first and most likely last highschool team championship In that had been An almost unlimited future seemed to lie ahead of the young man But he had flunked out of LSU his first semester a victim of drink drugs and allnight parties He came home cracked up the yellow convertible his folks had given him as a graduation present and got a job as head salesman in his daddys John Deere dealership Five years passed His father could not bear to fire him and so he finally sold the dealership and retired to Arizona a man haunted and made old before his tune by the inexplicable and apparently irreversible degeneration of his son While the dealership still belonged to his daddy and he was at least pretending to work Arnold had made some effort to keep the booze at arms length afterward it got him completely He could get mean but he had been just as sweet as horehound candy the night he brought in the quarters and set up drinks for the house and everyone had thanked him kindly and Annie kept playing Moe Bandy songs because Gresham Arnold liked ole Moe Bandy He sat there at the baron the very stool where Mr Hanscom was sitting now Ricky Lee realized with steadily deepening uneaseand drank three or four bourbonandbitters and sang along with the juke and caused no trouble and went home when Ricky Lee closed the Wheel up and hanged himself with his belt in an upstairs closet Gresham Arnolds eyes that night had looked a little bit like Ben Hanscoms eyes looked right now Scaring you a bit am I Hanscom asked his eyes never leaving Ricky Lees He pushed the stein away and then folded his hands neatly in front of those three silver cartwheels I probably am But youre not as scared as I am Ricky Lee Pray to Jesus you never are Well whats the matter Ricky Lee asked Maybe He wet his lips Maybe I can give you a help The matter Ben Hanscom laughed Why not too much I had a call from an old friend tonight Guy named Mike Hanlon Id forgotten all about him Ricky Lee but that didnt scare me much After all I was just a kid when I knew him and kids forget things dont they Sure they do You bet your fur What scared me was getting about halfway over here and realizing that it wasnt just Mike Id forgotten aboutId forgotten everything about being a kid Ricky Lee only looked at him He had no idea what Mr Hanscom was talking aboutbut the man was scared all right No question about that It sat funny on Ben Hanscom but it was real I mean Id forgotten all about it he said and rapped his knuckles lightly on the bar for emphasis did you ever hear Ricky Lee of having an amnesia so complete you didnt even know you had amnesia Me either But there I was tooling along in the Caddy tonight and all of a sudden it hit me I remembered Mike Hanlon but only because he called me on the phone I remembered Derry but only because that was where he was calling from But that was all It hit me that I hadnt even thought about being a kid since since I dont even know when And then just like that it all started to flood back in Like what we did with the fourth silver dollar Hanscom looked at his watch and suddenly slipped down from his stool He staggered a bitthe slightest bit That was all Cant let the time get away from me he said Im flying tonight Flying but not driving the plane Not this time United Airlines Ricky Lee Oh He supposed his relief showed on his face but he didnt care Where are you going Hanscoms shirt was still open He looked thoughtfully down at the puckered white lines of the old scar on his belly and then began to button the shirt over it Thought I told you that Ricky Lee Home Im going home Give those cartwheels to your kids He started toward the door and something about the way he walked even the way he hitched at the sides of his pants terrified Ricky Lee The resemblance to the late and mostly unlamented Gresham Arnold was suddenly so acute it was nearly like seeing a ghost Hanscom turned back and Ricky Lee stepped quickly backward His ass hit the backbar and glassware gossiped briefly as the bottles knocked together He stepped back because he was suddenly convinced that Ben Hanscom was dead Yes Ben Hanscom was lying dead someplace in a ditch or an attic or possibly in a closet with a belt noosed around his neck and the toes of his fourhundreddollar cowboy boots dangling an inch or two above the floor and this thing standing near the juke and staring back at him was a ghost For a momentjust a moment but it was plenty long enough to cover his working heart with a rime of icehe was convinced he could see tables and chairs right through the man Ben Hanscom looked out at Ricky Lee from eyes which had darkpurple crescents beneath them His cheeks burned with liquor his nose looked red and sore Nothin Ricky Lee whispered again but he couldnt take his eyes from that face the face of a man who has died deep in sin and now stands hard by hells smoking side door I was fat and we were poor Ben Hanscom said I remember that now And I remember that either a girl named Beverly or Stuttering Bill saved my life with a silver dollar Im scared almost insane by whatever else I may remember before tonights over but how scared I am doesnt matter because its going to come anyway Its all there like a great big bubble thats growing in my mind But Im going because all Ive ever gotten and all I have now is somehow due to what we did then and you pay for what you get in this world Maybe thats why God made us kids first and built us close to the ground because He knows you got to fall down a lot and bleed a lot before you learn that one simple lesson You pay for what you get you own what you pay for and sooner or later whatever you own comes back home to you You gonna be back this weekend though aint you Ricky Lee asked through numbed lips In his increasing distress this was all he could find to hold on to You gonna be back this weekend just like always aint you I dont know Mr Hanscom said and smiled a terrible smile Im going a lot farther than London this time Ricky Lee You give those cartwheels to your kids he repeated and slipped out into the night What the blue hell Annie asked but Ricky Lee ignored her He flipped up the bars partition and ran over to one of the windows which looked out on the parking lot He saw the headlights of Mr Hanscoms Caddy come on heard the engine rev It pulled out of the dirt lot kicking up a roostertail of dust behind it The taillights dwindled away to red points down Highway and the Nebraska nightwind began to pull the hanging dust apart He took on a boxcar full of booze and you let him get in that big car of his and drive away Annie said Way to go Ricky Lee And although this had been Ricky Lees own thought less than five minutes ago he turned to her when the taillights winked out of sight and shook his head I dont think so he said Although the way he looked tonight it might be better for him if he did He shook his head It was all confused in his mind and the sum total of it seemed to mean nothing It doesnt matter But I dont think were ever going to see that old boy again If you would know all there is to know about an American man or woman of the middle class as the millennium nears its end you would need only to look in his or her medicine cabinetor so it has been said But dear Lord get a look into this one as Eddie Kaspbrak slides it open mercifully sliding aside his white face and wide staring eyes On the top shelf theres Anacin Excedrin Excedrin PM Contac Gelusil Tylenol and a large blue jar of Vicks looking like a bit of brooding deep twilight under glass There is a bottle of Vivarin a bottle of Serutan Thats Natures spelled backwards the ads on Lawrence Welk used to say when Eddie Kaspbrak was but a wee slip of a lad and two bottles of Phillips Milk of Magnesiathe regular which tastes like liquid chalk and the new mint flavor which tastes like mintflavored liquid chalk Here is a large bottle of Rolaids standing chummily close to a large bottle of Turns The Turns are standing next to a large bottle of orangeflavored DiGel tablets The three of them look like a trio of strange piggybanks stuffed with pills instead of dimes Second shelf and dig the vites you got your E your C your C with rosehips You got Bsimple and Bcomplex and B Theres LLysine which is supposed to do something about those embarrassing skin problems and lecithin which is supposed to do something about that embarrassing cholesterol buildup in and around the Big Pump Theres iron calcium and cod liver oil Theres OneADay multiples Myadec multiples Centrum multiples And sitting up on top of the cabinet itself is a gigantic bottle of Geritol just for good measure Moving right along to Eddies third shelf we find the utility infielders of the patentmedicine world ExLax Carters Little Pills Those two keep Eddie Kaspbrak moving the mail Here nearby is Kaopectate PeptoBismol and Preparation H in case the mail moves too fast or too painfully Also some Tucks in a screwtop jar just to keep everything tidy after the mail has gone through be it just an advertising circular or two addressed to OCCUPANT or a big old specialdelivery package Here is Formula for coughs Nyquil and Dristan for colds and a big bottle of castor oil Theres a tin of Sucrets in case Eddies throat gets sore and theres a quartet of mouthwashes Chloraseptic Cepacol Cepestat in the spray bottle and of course good old Listerine often imitated but never duplicated Visine and Murine for the eyes Cortaid and Neosporin ointment for the skin the second line of defense if the LLysine doesnt live up to expectations a tube of Oxy and a plastic bottle of OxyWash because Eddie would definitely rather have a few less cents than a few more zits and some tetracyline pills And off to one side clustered like bitter conspirators are three bottles of coaltar shampoo The bottom shelf is almost deserted but the stuff which is here means serious businessyou could cruise on this stuff okay On this stuff you could fly higher than Ben Hanscoms jet and crash harder than Thurman Munsons Theres Valium Percodan Elavil and Darvon Complex There is also another Sucrets box on this low shelf but there are no Sucrets in it If you opened that one you would find six Quaaludes He was swinging a blue totebag as he came into the bathroom He set it on the sink unzipped it and then with trembling hands he began to spill bottles and jars and tubes and squeezebottles and spraybottles into it Under other circumstances he would have taken them out handful by careful handful but there was no time for such niceties now The choice as Eddie saw it was as simple as it was brutal get moving and keep moving or stand in one place long enough to start thinking about what all of this meant and simply die of fright Eddie Myra called up from downstairs Eddie what are you dooooing Eddie dropped the Sucrets box containing the ludes into the bag The medicine cabinet was now entirely empty except for Myras Midol and a small almost usedup tube of Blistex He paused for a moment and then grabbed the Blistex He started to zip the bag closed debated and then threw in the Midol as well She could always buy more Eddie zipped the bag the rest of the way closed and then left the bathroom swinging it by his side He was a short man with a timid rabbity sort of face Much of his hair was gone what was left grew in listless piebald patches The weight of the bag pulled him noticeably to one side An extremely large woman was climbing slowly to the second floor Eddie could hear the stairs creak protestingly under her Eddie did not need a shrink to tell him that he had in a sense married his mother Myra Kaspbrak was huge She had only been big when Eddie married her five years ago but he sometimes thought his subconscious had seen the potential for hugeness in her God knew his own mother had been a whopper And she looked somehow more huge than ever as she reached the secondfloor landing She was wearing a white nightgown which swelled comberlike at bosom and hip Her face devoid of makeup was white and shiny She looked badly frightened What do you mean you have to go away What was that telephone call Nothing he said fleeing abruptly down the hallway to their walkin closet He put the totebag down opened the closets foldback door and raked aside the halfdozen identical black suits which hung there as conspicuous as a thundercloud among the other more brightly colored clothes He always wore one of the black suits when he was working He bent into the closet smelling mothballs and wool and pulled out one of the suitcases from the back He opened it and began throwing clothes in Whats this about Eddie Where are you going You tell me She stood there watching him trying to decide what to say next or what to do The thought of simply bundling him into the closet and then standing with her back against the door until this madness had passed crossed her mind but she was unable to bring herself to do it although she certainly could have she was three inches taller than Eddie and outweighed him by a hundred pounds She couldnt think of what to do or say because this was so utterly unlike him She could not have been any more dismayed and frightened if she had walked into the television room and found their new bigscreen TV floating in the air You cant go she heard herself saying You promised youd get me Al Pacinos autograph It was an absurdityGod knew it wasbut at this point even an absurdity was better than nothing Youll still get it Eddie said Youll have to drive him yourself Oh here was a new terror to join those already circling in her poor dazzled head She uttered a small scream I cantI never Youll have to he said He was examining his shoes now Theres no one else Neither of my uniforms fit anymore Theyre too tight in the tits Have Delores let one of them out he said implacably He threw two pairs of shoes back found an empty shoebox and popped a third pair into it Good black shoes plenty of use left in them still but looking just a bit too worn to wear on the job When you drove rich people around New York for a living many of them famous rich people everything had to look just right These shoes no longer looked just right but he supposed they would do for where he was going And for whatever he might have to do when he got there Maybe Richie Tozier would But then the blackness threatened and he felt his throat beginning to close up Eddie realized with real panic that he had packed the whole damned drugstore and had left the most important thing of allhis aspiratordownstairs on top of the stereo cabinet He banged the suitcase closed and latched it He looked around at Myra who was standing there in the hallway with her hand pressed against the short thick column of her neck as if she were the one with the asthma She was staring at him her face full of perplexity and terror and he might have felt sorry for her if his heart had not already been so filled with terror for himself Whats happened Eddie Who was that on the telephone Are you in trouble You are arent you What kind of trouble are you in He walked toward her zipperbag in one hand and suitcase in the other standing more or less straight now that he was more evenly weighted She moved in front of him blocking off the stairway and at first he thought she would not give way Then when his face was about to crash into the soft roadblock of her breasts she did give way fearfully As he walked past never slowing she burst into miserable tears I cant drive Al Pacino she bawled Ill smash into a stopsign or something I know I will Eddie Im scaaarrred He looked at the Seth Thomas clock on the table by the stairs Twenty past nine The cannedsounding Delta clerk had told him he had already missed the last flight north to Mainethat one had left La Guardia at eighttwentyfive He had called Amtrak and discovered there was a late train to Boston departing Perm Station at eleventhirty It would drop him off at South Station where he could take a cab to the offices of Cape Cod Limousine on Arlington Street Cape Cod and Eddies company Royal Crest had worked out a useful and friendly reciprocal arrangement over the years A quick call to Butch Carrington in Boston had taken care of his transportation northButch said he would have a Cadillac limo gassed and ready for him So he would go in style and with no painintheass client sitting in the back seat stinking the air up with a big cigar and asking if Eddie knew where he could score a broad or a few grams of coke or both Going in style all right he thought Only way you could go in more style would be if you were going in a hearse But dont worry Eddiethats probably how youll come back If theres enough of you left to pick up that is Ninetwenty Plenty of time to talk to her plenty of time to be kind Ah but it would have been so much better if this had been her whist night if he could have just slipped out leaving a note under one of the magnets on the refrigerator door the refrigerator door was where he left all his notes for Myra because there she never missed them Leaving that waylike a fugitivewould not have been good but this was even worse This was like having to leave home all over again and that had been so hard hed had to do it three times Sometimes home is where the heart is Eddie thought randomly I believe that Old Bobby Frost said homes the place where when you have to go there they have to take you in Unfortunately its also the place where once youre in there they dont ever want to let you out He stood at the head of the stairs forward motion temporarily spent filled with fear breath wheezing noisily in and out of the pinhole his throat had become and regarded his weeping wife Come on downstairs with me and Ill tell you what I can he said Eddie put his two bagsclothes in one medicine in the otherby the door in the front hall He remembered something else then or rather the ghost of his mother who had been dead many years but who still spoke frequently in his mind remembered for him You know when your feet get wet you always get a cold Eddieyoure not like other people you have a very weak system you have to be careful Thats why you must always wear your rubbers when it rains Eddie opened the fronthall closet got his rubbers off the hook where they hung neatly in a plastic bag and put them in his clothes suitcase He and Myra had been watching TV when the shit hit the fan Eddie went into the television room and pushed the button which lowered the screen of the MuralVision TVits screen was so big that it made Freeman McNeil look like a visitor from Brobdingnag on Sunday afternoons He picked up the telephone and called a taxi The dispatcher told him it would probably be fifteen minutes Eddie said that was no problem He hung up and grabbed his aspirator off the top of their expensive Sony compactdisc player I spent fifteen hundred bucks on a stateoftheart sound system so that Myra wouldnt miss a single golden note on her Barry Manilow records and her supremes Greatest Hits he thought and then felt a flush of guilt That wasnt fair and he damn well knew it Myra would have been just as happy with her old scratchy records as she was with the new rpmsized laser discs just as she would have been happy to keep on living in the little fourroom house in Queens until they were both old and gray and if the truth were told there was a little snow on Eddie Kaspbraks mountain already He had bought the luxury sound system for the same reasons that he had bought this low fieldstone house on Long Island where the two of them often rattled around like the last two peas in a can because he had been able to and because they were ways of appeasing the soft frightened often bewildered always implacable voice of his mother they were ways of saying I made it Ma Look at all this I made it Now will you please for Christs sake shut up awhile Eddie stuffed the aspirator into his mouth and like a man miming suicide pulled the trigger A cloud of awful licorice taste roiled and boiled its way down his throat and Eddie breathed deeply He could feel breathing passages which had almost closed start to open up again The tightness in his chest started to ease and suddenly he heard voices in his mind ghostvoices Well in case you cant read Coach Black let me tell you in person Are you ready Good Here it comes from my lips to your ears Ready My Eddie cannot take physical education I repeat he canNOT take phys ed Eddie is very delicate and if he runs or jumps Mrs Kaspbrak I have the results of Eddies last physical on file in my officethats a state requirement It says that Eddie is a little small for his age but otherwise hes absolutely normal So I called your family physician just to be sure and he confirmed Are you saying Im a liar Coach Black Is that it Well here he is Heres Eddie standing right beside me Can you hear the way hes breathing CAN you Eddie you know better than that I taught you better than that Dont interrupt your elders Do you Good I thought maybe you were deaf He sounds like a truck going uphill in low gear doesnt he And if that isnt asthma Be quiet Eddie dont interrupt me again If that isnt asthma Coach Black then Im Queen Elizabeth Mrs Kaspbrak Eddie often seems very well and happy in his physicaleducation classes He loves to play games and he runs quite fast In my conversation with Dr Baynes the word psychosomatic came up I wonder if youve considered the possibility that that my son is crazy Is that what youre trying to say ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT MY SON IS CRAZY Mrs Kaspbrak Dr Baynes confirmed that he could find nothing at allphysically wrong Eddie finished The memory of that humiliating encounter his mother screaming at Coach Black in the Derry Elementary School gymnasium while he gasped and cringed at her side and the other kids huddled around one of the baskets and watched had recurred to him tonight for the first time in years Nor was that the only memory which Mike Hanlons call was going to bring back he knew He could feel many others as bad or even worse crowding and jostling like salemad shoppers bottlenecked in a departmentstore doorway But soon the bottleneck would break and they would be along He was quite sure of that And what would they find on sale His sanity Could be HalfPrice Smoke and Water Damage Everything Must Go Nothing physically wrong he repeated took a deep shuddery breath and stuffed the aspirator into his pocket Eddie Myra said Please tell me what all of this is about Teartracks shone on her chubby cheeks Her hands twisted restlessly together like a pair of pink and hairless animals at play Once shortly before actually proposing marriage he had taken a picture of Myra which she had given him and had put it next to one of his mother who had died of congestive heartfailure at the age of sixtyfour At the time of her death Eddies mother had topped the scales at over four hundred poundsfour hundred and six to be exact She had become something nearly monstrous by thenher body had seemed nothing more than boobs and butt and belly all overtopped by her pasty perpetually dismayed face But the picture of her which he put next to Myras picture had been taken in two years before he had been born You were a very sickly baby the ghostmom now whispered in his ear Many times we despaired of your life In  his mother had been a relatively svelte one hundred and eighty pounds He had made that comparison he supposed in a lastditch effort to stop himself from committing psychological incest He looked from Mother to Myra and back again to Mother Eddie looked at the two nearly identical pictures and promised himself he would not do this crazy thing He knew that the boys at work were already making jokes about Jack Sprat and his wife but they didnt know the half of it The jokes and snide remarks he could take but did he really want to be a clown in such a Freudian circus as this No He did not He would break it off with Myra He would let her down gently because she was really very sweet and had had even less experience with men than hed had with women And then after she had finally sailed over the horizon of his life he could maybe take those tennis lessons hed been thinking of for such a long time Eddie often seems very well and happy in his physicaleducation classes or there were the pool memberships they were selling at the UN Plaza Hotel not to mention that health club which had opened up on Third Avenue across from the garage Eddie runs quite fast he runs quite fast when youre not here runs quite fast when theres nobody around to remind him of how delicate he is and I see in his face Mrs Kaspbrak that he knows even now at the age of nine he knows that the biggest favor in the world he could do himself would be to run fast in any direction youre not going let him go Mrs Kaspbrak let him RUN But in the end he had married Myra anyway In the end the old ways and the old habits had simply been too strong Home was the place where when you have to go there they have to chain you up Oh he might have beaten his mothers ghost It would have been hard but he was quite sure he could have done that much if that had been all which needed doing It was Myra herself who had ended up tipping the scales away from independence Myra had condemned him with solicitude had nailed him with concern had chained him with sweetness Myra like his mother had reached the final fatal insight into his character Eddie was all the more delicate because he sometimes suspected he was not delicate at all Eddie needed to be protected from his own dim intimations of possible bravery On rainy days Myra always took his rubbers out of the plastic bag in the closet and put them by the coatrack next to the door Beside his plate of unbuttered wheat toast each morning was a dish of what might have been taken at a casual glance for a multicolored presweetened childrens cereal but which a closer look would have revealed to be a whole spectrum of vitamins most of which Eddie had in his medicinebag right now Myra like Mother under stood and there had really been no chance for him As a young unmarried man he had left his mother three times and returned home to her three times Then four years after his mother had died in the front hall of her Queens apartment blocking the front door so completely with her bulk that the Medcu guys called by the people downstairs when they heard the monstrous thud of Mrs Kaspbrak going down for the final count had had to break in through the locked door between the apartments kitchen and the service stairwell he had returned home for a fourth and final time At least he had believed then it was for the final timehome again home again jiggetyjog home again home again with Myra the hog A hog she was but she was a sweet hog and he loved her and there had really been no chance for him at all She had drawn him to her with the fatal hypnotizing snakes eye of understanding Home again forever he had thought then But maybe I was wrong he thought Maybe this isnt home nor ever wasmaybe home is where I have to go tonight Home is the place where when you go there you have to finally face the thing in the dark He shuddered helplessly as if he had gone outside without his rubbers and caught a terrible chill She was beginning to weep again Tears were her final defense just as they had always been his mothers the soft weapon which paralyzes which turns kindness and tenderness into fatal chinks in ones armor Not that hed ever worn much armor anywaysuits of armor did not seem to fit him very well Tears had been more than a defense for his mother they had been a weapon Myra had rarely used her own tears so cynically but cynically or not he realized she was trying to use them that way now and she was succeeding He couldnt let her It would be too easy to think of how lonely it was going to be sitting in a seat on that train as it barrelled north toward Boston through the darkness his suitcase overhead and his totebag full of nostrums between his feet the fear sitting on his chest like a rancid Vickspack Too easy to let Myra take him upstairs and make love to him with aspirins and an alcoholrub And put him to bed where they might or might not make a franker sort of love Myra listen to me he said making his voice purposely dry purposely matteroffact He thought he would try now to explainas best he could he would tell her atibut how Mike Hanlon had called and told him that it had started again and yes he thought most of the others were coming But what came out of his mouth was much saner stuff Go down to the office first thing in the morning Talk to Phil Tell him I had to take off and that youll drive Pacino Eddie I just cant she wailed Hes a big star If I get lost hell shout at me I know he will hell shout they all do when the driver gets lost and and Ill cry there could be an accident there probably will be an accident Eddie Eddie you have to stay home She recoiled from his voice hurt although Eddie gripped his aspirator he would not use it She would see that as a weakness one she could use against him Dear God if You are there please believe me when I say I dont want to hurt Myra I dont want to cut her dont even want to bruise her But I promised we all promised we swore in blood please help me God because I have to do this I hate it when you shout at me Eddie she whispered Myra I hate it when I have to he said and she winced There you go Eddieyou hurt her again Why dont you just punch her around the room a few times That would probably be kinder And quicker Suddenlyprobably it was the thought of punching someone around the room which caused the image to comehe saw the face of Henry Bowers It was the first time he had thought of Bowers in years and it did nothing for his peace of mind Nothing at all He closed his eyes briefly then opened them and said You wont get lost and he wont shout at you Mr Pacino is very nice very understanding He had never driven Pacino before in his life but contented himself with knowing that at least the law of averages was on the side of this lieaccording to popular myth most celebrities were shitheels but Eddie had driven enough of them to know it usually wasnt true There were of course exceptions to the ruleand in most cases the exceptions were real monstrosities He hoped fervently for Myras sake that Pacino wasnt one of these Demetrios drove him two or three times when he worked at Manhattan Limousine Eddie said glibly He said Mr Pacino always tipped at least fifty dollars I wouldnt care if he only tipped me fifty cents as long as he didnt shout at me Myra its all as easy as onetwothree One you make the pickup at the Saint Regis tomorrow at seven PM and take him over to the ABC Building Theyre retaping the last act of this play Pacinos inAmerican Buffalo I think its called Two you take him back to the Saint Regis around eleven Three you go back to the garage turn in the car and sign the greensheet Thats all You can do it standing on your head Marty She usually giggled at this pet name but now she only looked at him with a painful childlike solemnity What if he wants to go out to dinner instead of back to the hotel Or for drinks Or for dancing I dont think he will but if he does you take him If it looks like hes going to party all night you can call Phil Thomas on the radiophone after midnight By then hell have a driver free to relieve you Id never stick you with something like this in the first place if I had a driver who was free but I got two guys out sick Demetrios on vacation and everyone else booked up solid Youll be snug in your own bed by one in the morning Martyone in the morning at the very very latest I applesolutely guarantee it He cleared his throat and leaned forward elbows on his knees Instantly the ghostmom whispered Dont sit that way Eddie Its bad for your posture and it cramps your lungs You have very delicate lungs He sat up straight again hardly aware he was doing it This better be the only time I have to drive she nearly moaned Ive turned into such a horse in the last two years and my uniforms look so bad now As if on cue lights swept across the wall a horn honked once as the cab turned into the driveway He felt a surge of relief They had spent the fifteen minutes talking about Pacino instead of Derry and Mike Hanlon and Henry Bowers and that was good Good for Myra and good for him as well He did not want to spend any time thinking or talking about those things until he had to She got up so fast she tripped over the hem of her own nightgown and fell forward Eddie caught her but for a moment the issue was in grave doubt she outweighed him by a hundred pounds And Im not now Not really I dont remember it all At least not yet The man who tailed wasisan old friend He Youll get sick she said desperately following him as he walked toward the front hall again I know you will Let me come Eddie please Ill take care of you Pacino can get a cab or something it wont kill him what do you say okay Her voice was rising becoming frantic and to Eddies horror she began to look more and more like his mother his mother as she had looked in the last months before she died old and fat and crazy Ill rub your back and see that you get your pills I Ill help you I wont talk if you dont want me to but you can tell me everything Eddie Eddie please dont go Eddie please Pleeeeeease He was striding down the hall to the front door now walking blind head down moving as a man moves against a high wind He was wheezing again When he picked up the bags each of them seemed to weigh a hundred pounds He could feel her plump pink hands on him touching exploring pulling with helpless desire but no real strength trying to seduce him with her sweet tears of concern trying to draw him back Im not going to make it he thought desperately The asthma was worse now worse than it had been since he was a kid He reached for the doorknob but it seemed to be receding from him receding into the blackness of outer space If you stay Ill make you a sourcream coffeecake she babbled Well have popcorn Ill make your favorite turkey dinner Ill make it for breakfast tomorrow morning if you want Ill start right now and giblet gravy Eddie please Im scared youre scaring me so bad She grabbed his collar and pulled him backward like a beefy cop putting the grab on a suspicious fellow who is trying to flee With a final fading effort Eddie kept going and when he was at the absolute end of his strength and ability to resist he felt her grip trail away His fingers closed around the doorknobhow blessedly cool it was He pulled the door open and saw a Checker cab sitting out there an ambassador from the land of sanity The night was clear The stars were bright and lucid He turned back to Myra whistling and wheezing You need to understand that this isnt something I want to do he said If I had a choiceany choice at allI wouldnt go Please understand that Marty Im going but Ill be coming back A week Or maybe ten days Surely no longer than that A week she screamed clutching at her bosom like a diva in a bad opera A week Ten days Please Eddie Pleeeeeee For a wonder she did stopped and stood looking at him with her wet bruised eyes not angry at him only terrified for him and coincidentally for herself And for perhaps the first time in all the years he had known her he felt that he could love her safely Was that part of the going away He supposed it was No you could flush the supposed He knew it was Already he felt like something living in the wrong end of a telescope But it was maybe all right Was that what he meant That he had finally decided it was all right to love her That it was all right even though she looked like his mother when his mother had been younger and even though she ate brownies in bed while watching Hardcastle and McCormick or Falcon Crest and the crumbs always got on his side and even though she wasnt all that bright and even though she understood and condoned his remedies in the medicine cabinet because she kept her own in the refrigerator These other ideas were all things he had considered in one way or another at one tune or another during his oddly entwined lives as a son and a lover and a husband now on the point of leaving home for what felt like the absolutely last time a new possibility came to him and startled wonder brushed him like the wing of some large bird Could it be that Myra was even more frightened than he was Another Derry memory came shooting up from his subconscious like a balefully fizzing firework There had been a shoe store downtown on Center Street The Shoeboat His mother had taken him there one dayhe thought he could have been no more than five or sixand told him to sit still and be good while she got a pair of white pumps for a wedding So he sat still and was good while his mother talked with Mr Gardener who was one of the shoeclerks but he was only five or maybe six and after his mother had rejected the third pair of white pumps Mr Gardener showed her Eddie got bored and walked over to the far corner to look at something he had spotted there At first he thought it was just a big crate standing on end When he got closer he decided it was some kind of desk But it sure was the kookiest desk he had ever seen It was so narrow It was made of bright polished wood with lots of curvy inlaid lines and carved doojiggers in it Also there was a little flight of three stairs leading up to it and he had never seen a desk with stairs When he got right up to it he saw that there was a slot at the bottom of the deskthing a button on one side and on top of itentrancingwas something that looked exactly like Captain Videos Spacescope Eddie walked around to the other side and there was a sign He must have been at least six because he had been able to read it softly whispering each word aloud He went back around climbed the three steps to the little platform and then stuck his foot into the slot at the bottom of the shoechecker Did his shoes fit right Eddie didnt know but he was wild to check and see He socked his face into the rubber faceguard and thumbed the button Green light flooded his eyes Eddie gasped He could see a foot floating inside a shoe filled with green smoke He wiggled his toes and the toes he was looking at wiggled right backthey were his all right just as he had suspected And then he realized it was not just his toes he could see he could see his bones too The bones in his foot He crossed his great toe over his second toe as if sneakily warding off the consequences of telling a lie and the eldritch bones in the scope made an X that was not white but goblingreen He could see Then his mother shrieked a rising sound of panic that cut through the quiet shoe store like a runaway reaperblade like a firebell like doom on horseback He jerked his startled dismayed face out of the viewer and saw her pelting toward him across the store in her stocking feet her dress flying out behind her She knocked a chair over and one of those shoemeasuring things that always tickled his feet went flying Her bosom heaved Her mouth was a scarlet O of horror Faces turned to follow her progress Eddie get off there she screamed Get off there Those machines give you cancer Get off there Eddie Eddieeeeeee He backed away as if the machine had suddenly grown redhot In his startled panic he forgot the little flight of stairs behind him His heels dropped over the top one and he stood there slowly falling backward his arms pinwheeling wildly in a losing battle to retain his departing balance And hadnt he thought with a kind of mad joy Im going to fall Im going to find out what it feels like to fall and bump my head Goody for me Hadnt he thought that Or was it only the man imposing his own selfserving adult ideas over whatever his childs mind always roaring with confused surmises and halfperceived images images which lost their sense in their very brightness had thought or tried to think Either way it was a moot question He had not fallen His mother had gotten there in time His mother had caught him He had burst into tears but he had not fallen Everyone had been looking at them He remembered that He remembered Mr Gardener picking up the shoemeasuring thing and checking the little sliding gadgets on it to make sure they were still okay while another clerk righted the fallen chair and then flapped his arms once in amused disgust before putting on his pleasantly neutral salesmans face again Mostly he remembered his mothers wet cheek and her hot sour breath He remembered her whispering over and over in his ear dont you ever do that again dont you ever do that again dont you ever It was what his mother chanted to ward off trouble She had chanted the same thing a year earlier when she discovered the babysitter had taken Eddie to the public pool in Derry Park one stiflingly hot summer daythis had been when the polio scare of the early fifties was just beginning to wind down She had dragged him out of the pool telling him he must never do that never never and all the kids had looked as all the clerks and customers were looking now and her breath had had that same sour tang She dragged him out of The Shoeboat shouting at the clerks that she would see them all in court if there was anything wrong with her boy Eddies terrified tears had continued off and on for the rest of the morning and his asthma had been particularly bad all day That night he had lain awake for hours past the time he was usually asleep wondering exactly what cancer was if it was worse than polio if it killed you how long it took if it did and how bad it hurt before you died He also wondered if he would go to hell afterward Marty he said across this gulf of years would you give me a kiss She kissed him and hugged him so tightly while she was doing it that the bones in his back groaned If we were in water he thought shed drown us both I know he said and realized that even though she was hugging him with ribbreaking tightness his asthma had eased That whistling note in his breathing was gone I know Marty And suppose he did How far would it go toward setting her mind at rest Many I got a call from Mike Hanlon tonight and we talked for awhile but everything we said boiled down to two things Its started again Mike said Will you come Mike said And now Ive got a fever Marty only its a fever you cant damp down with aspirin and Ive got a shortness of breath the goddamned aspirator wont touch because that shortness of breath isnt in my throat or my lungsit is around my heart Ill come back to you if I can Marty but I feel like a man standing at the mouth of an old mineshaft that is full of caveins waiting to happen standing there and saying goodbye to the daylight No he said I guess I cant tell you what it is And before she could say more before she could begin again Eddie get out of that taxi They give you cancer he was striding away from her faster and faster By the time he got to the cab he was almost running She was still standing in the doorway when the cab backed into the street still standing there when they started for the citya big black womanshadow cut out of the light spilling from their house He waved and thought she raised her hand in return Penn Station Eddie said and his hand relaxed on the aspirator His asthma had gone to wherever it went to brood between its assaults on his bronchial tubes He felt almost well But he needed the aspirator worse than ever four hours later coming out of a light doze all in a single spasmodic jerk that caused the fellow in the business suit across the way to lower his paper and look at him with faintly apprehensive curiosity Im back Eddie the asthma yelled gleefully Im back and oh I dunno this time I just might killya Why not Gotta do it sometime you know Cant fuck around with you forever Eddies chest surged and pulled He groped for the aspirator found it pointed it down his throat and pulled the trigger Then he sat back in the tall Amtrak seat shivering waiting for relief thinking of the dream from which he had just awakened Dream Christ if that was all He was afraid it was more memory than dream In it there had been a green light like the light inside a shoestore Xray machine and a rotting leper had pursued a screaming boy named Eddie Kaspbrak through tunnels under the earth He ran and ran he runs quite fast Coach Black had told his mother and he ran plenty fast with that rotting thing after him oh yes you better believe it you bet your fur in this dream where he was eleven years old and then he had smelled something like the death of time and someone lit a match and he had looked down and seen the decomposing face of a boy named Patrick Hockstetter a boy who had disappeared in July of and there were worms crawling in and out of Patrick Hockstetters cheeks and that gassy awful smell was coming from inside of Patrick Hockstetter and in that dream that was more memory than dream he had looked to one side and had seen two schoolbooks that were fat with moisture and overgrown with green mold Roads to Everywhere and Understanding Our America They were in their current condition because it was a foul wetness down here How I Spent My Summer Vacation a theme by Patrick HockstetterI spent it dead in a tunnel Moss grew on my books and they swelled up to the size of Sears catalogues Eddie opened his mouth to scream and that was when the scabrous fingers of the leper clittered around his cheek and plunged themselves into his mouth and that was when he woke up with that backsnapping jerk to find himself not in the sewers under Derry Maine but in an Amtrak clubcar near the head of a train speeding across Rhode Island under a big white moon The man across the aisle hesitated almost thought better of speaking and then did Are you all right sir Oh yes Eddie said I fell asleep and had a bad dream It got my asthma going I see The paper went up again Eddie saw it was the paper his mother had sometimes referred to as The Jew York Times Eddie looked out the window at a sleeping landscape litten only by the fairy moon Here and there were houses or sometimes clusters of them most dark a few showing lights But the lights seemed little and falsely mocking compared to the moons ghostglow He thought the moon talked to him he thought suddenly Henry Bowers God he was so crazy He wondered where Henry Bowers was now Dead In prison Drifting across empty plains somewhere in the middle of the country like an incurable virus sticking up SevenElevens in the deep slumbrous hours between one and four in the morning or maybe killing some of the people stupid enough to slow down for his cocked thumb in order to transfer the dollars in their wallets to his own In a state asylum somewhere Looking up at this moon which was approaching the full Talking to it listening to answers which only he could hear Eddie considered this somehow even more possible He shivered I am remembering my boyhood at last he thought I am remembering how I spent my own summer vacation in that dim dead year of He sensed that now he could fix upon almost any scene from that summer he wanted to but he did not want to Oh God if I could only forget it all again He leaned his forehead against the dirty glass of the window his aspirator clasped loosely in one hand like a religious artifact watching as the night flew apart around the train Not going north Because its not a train its a time machine Not north back Back in time Eddie Kaspbrak held his aspirator tightly and closed his eyes against sudden vertigo Tom was nearly asleep when the phone rang He struggled halfway up leaning toward it and then felt one of Beverlys breasts press against his shoulder as she reached over him to get it He flopped back on his pillow wondering dully who was calling on their unlisted home phone number at this hour of the night He heard Beverly say hello and then he drifted off again He had put away nearly three sixpacks during the baseball game and he was shagged Then Beverlys voice sharp and curiousWhaaatdrilled into his ear like an icepick and he opened his eyes again He tried to sit up and the phone cord dug into his thick neck Get that fucking thing off me Beverly he said and she got up quickly and walked around the bed holding the phone cord up with tented fingers Her hair was a deep red and it flowed over her nightgown in natural waves almost to her waist Whores hair Her eyes did not stutter to his face to read the emotional weather there and Tom Rogan didnt like that He sat up His head was starting to ache Shit it had probably already been aching but when you were asleep you didnt know it He went into the bathroom urinated for what felt like three hours and then decided that as long as he was up he ought to get another beer and try to take the curse off the impending hangover Passing back through the bedroom on his way to the stairs a man in white boxer shorts that flapped like sails below his considerable belly his arms like slabs he looked more like a dockwalloper than the president and general manager of Beverly Fashions Inc he looked over his shoulder and yelled crossly If its that bull dyke Lesley tell her to go eat out some model and let us sleep Beverly glanced up briefly shook her head to indicate it wasnt Lesley and then looked back at the phone Tom felt the muscles at the back of his neck tighten up It felt like a dismissal Dismissed by Milady Mifuckinlady This was starting to look like it might turn into a situation It might be that Beverly needed a short refresher course on who was in charge around here It was possible Sometimes she did She was a slow learner He went downstairs and padded along the hall to the kitchen absently picking the seat of his shorts out of the crack of his ass and opened the refrigerator His reaching hand closed on nothing more alcoholic than a blue Tupperware dish of leftover noodles Romanoff All the beer was gone Even the can he kept way in the back much as he kept a twentydollar bill folded up behind his drivers license for emergencies was gone The game had gone fourteen innings and all for nothing The White Sox had lost Bunch of candyasses this year His eyes drifted to the bottles of hard stuff on the glassedin shelf over the kitchen bar and for a moment he saw himself pouring a splash of Beam over a single icecube Then he walked back toward the stairs knowing that was asking for even more trouble than his head was currently in He glanced at the face of the antique pendulum clock at the foot of the stairs and saw it was past midnight This intelligence did nothing to improve his temper which was never very good even at the best of times He climbed the stairs with slow deliberation awaretoo awareof how hard his heart was working Kaboom kathud Kaboom kathud Kaboom kathud It made him nervous when he could feel his heart beating in his ears and wrists as well as in his chest Sometimes when that happened he would imagine it not as a squeezing and loosening organ but as a big dial on the left side of his chest with the needle edging ominously into the red zone He did not like that shit he did not need that shit What he needed was a good nights sleep But the numb cunt he was married to was still on the phone I understand that Mike yes yes I am I know but Bill Denbrough she exclaimed and that icepick drilled into his ear again He stood outside the bedroom door until he got his breath back Now it was kathud kathud kathud again the booming had stopped He briefly imagined the needle edging out of the red and then willed the picture away He was a man for Christs sake and a damned good one not a furnace with a bad thermostat He was in great shape He was iron And if she needed to relearn that he would be happy to teach her He started in then thought better of it and stood where he was a moment longer listening to her not particularly caring about who she was talking to or what she said only listening to the risingfalling tones of her voice And what he felt was the old familiar dull rage He had met her in a downtown Chicago singles bar four years ago Conversation had been easy enough because they both worked in the Standard Brands Building and knew a few of the same people Tom worked for King amp Landry Public Relations on fortytwo Beverly Marshso she had been thenwas an assistant designer at Delia Fashions on twelve Delia which would later enjoy a modest vogue in the Midwest catered to young peopleDelia skirts and blouses and shawls and slacks were sold largely to what Delia Castleman called youthstores and what Tom called headshops Tom Rogan knew two things about Beverly Marsh almost at once she was desirable and she was vulnerable In less than a month he knew a third as well she was talented Very talented In her drawings of casual dresses and blouses he saw a moneymachine of almost scary potential Not in the headshops though he thought but did not say at least not then No more bad lighting no more knockdown prices no more shitty displays somewhere in the back of the store between the dope paraphernalia and the rockgroup teeshins Leave that shit for the smalltimers He had known a great deal about her before she knew he had any real interest in her and that was just the way Tom wanted it He had been looking for someone like Beverly Marsh all his life and he moved in with the speed of a lion making a run at a slow antelope Not that her vulnerability showed on the surfaceyou looked and saw a gorgeous woman slim but abundantly stacked Hips werent so great maybe but she had a great ass and the best set of tits he had ever seen Tom Rogan was a titman always had been and tall girls almost always had disappointing tits They wore thin shirts and their nipples drove you crazy but when you got those thin shirts off you discovered that nipples were really all they had The tits themselves looked like the pullknobs on a bureau drawer More than a handfuls wasted his college roommate had been fond of saying but as far as Tom was concerned his college roommate had been so full of shit he squeaked going into a turn Oh she had been some kind of finelooking all right with that dynamite body and that gorgeous fall of red wavy hair But she was weak weak somehow It was as if she was sending out radio signals which only he could receive You could point to certain thingshow much she smoked but he had almost cured her of that the restless way her eyes moved never quite meeting the eyes of whoever was talking to her only touching them from time to time and then leaping nimbly away her habit of lightly rubbing her elbows when she was nervous the look of her fingernails which were kept neat but brutally short Tom noticed this latter the first time he met her She picked up her glass of white wine he saw her nails and thought She keeps them short like that because she bites them Lions may not think at least not the way people think but they see And when antelopes start away from a waterhole alerted by that dustyrug scent of approaching death the cats can observe which one falls to the rear of the pack maybe because it has a lame leg maybe because it is just naturally slower or maybe because its sense of danger is less developed And it might even be possible that some antelopesand some womenwant to be brought down Suddenly he heard a sound that jerked him rudely out of these memoriesthe snap of her cigarette lighter The dull rage came again His stomach filled with a heat which was not entirely unpleasant Smoking She was smoking They had had a few of Tom Rogans Special Seminars on the subject And here she was doing it again She was a slow learner all right but a good teacher is at his best with slow learners Yes she said now Uhhuh All right Yes She listened then uttered a strange jagged laugh he had never heard before Two things since you askreserve me a room and say me a prayer Yes okay uhhuh me too Goodnight She was hanging up as he came in He meant to come in hard yelling at her to put it out put it out now RIGHT NOW but when he saw her the words died in his throat He had seen her like this before but only two or three times Once before their first big show once before the first private preview showing for national buyers and once when they had gone to New York for the International Design Awards She was moving across the bedroom in long strides the white lace nightgown molded to her body the cigarette clamped between her front teeth God he hated the way she looked with a butt in her mouth sending back a little white riband over her left shoulder like smoke from a locomotives stack But it was her face that really gave him pause that caused the planned shout to die in his throat His heart lurchedkaBAMPand he winced telling himself that what he felt was not fear but only surprise at finding her this way She was a woman who really came alive all the way only when the rhythm of her work spiked toward a climax Each of those remembered occasions had of course been careerrelated At those tunes he had seen a different woman from the one he knew so wella woman who fucked up his sensitive fearradar with wild bursts of static The woman who came out in times of stress was strong but highstrung fearless but unpredictable There was lots of color in her cheeks now a natural blush high on her cheekbones Her eyes were wide and sparkly not a trace of sleep left in them Her hair flowed and streamed And oh looky here friends and neighbors Oh you just looky right here Is she taking a suitcase out of the closet A suitcase By God she is Well she wasnt going to need a room in any hotel not in the foreseeable future because little Beverly Rogan was going to be staying right here at home thank you very much and taking her meals standing up for the next three or four days But she very well might need a prayer or two before he was through with her She tossed the suitcase on the foot of the bed and then went to her bureau She opened the top drawer and pulled out two pairs of jeans and a pair of cords Tossed them into the suitcase Back to the bureau cigarette streaming smoke over her shoulder She grabbed a sweater a couple of teeshirts one of the old Ship n Shore blouses that she looked so stupid in but refused to give up Whoever had called her sure hadnt been a jetsetter This was dull stuff strictly JackieKennedyHyannisportweekend stuff Not that he cared about who had called her or where she thought she was going since she wasnt going anywhere Those were not the things which pecked steadily at his mind dull and achy from too much beer and not enough sleep Supposedly she had thrown them all out But she had held out on himthe proof was clamped between her teeth right now And because she still had not noticed him standing in the doorway he allowed himself the pleasure of remembering the two nights which had assured him of his complete control over her I dont want you to smoke around me anymore he told her as they headed home from a party in Lake Forest October that had been I have to choke that shit down at parties and at the office but I dont have to choke it down when Im with you You know what its like Im going to tell you the truthits unpleasant but its the truth Ifs like having to eat someone elses snot He thought this would bring some faint spark of protest but she had only looked at him in her shy wantingtoplease way Her voice had been low and meek and obedient All tight Tom She pitched it Tom had been in a good humor for the rest of that night A few weeks later coming out of a movie she unthinkingly lit a cigarette in the lobby and puffed it as they walked across the parking lot to the car It had been a bitter November night the wind chopping like a maniac at any exposed square inch of flesh it could find Tom remembered he had been able to smell the lake as you sometimes could on cold nightsa flat smell that was both fishy and somehow empty He let her smoke the cigarette He even opened her door for her when they got to the car He got in behind the wheel closed his own door and then said Bev She took the cigarette out of her mouth turned toward him inquiring and he unloaded on her pretty good his hard open hand stroking across her cheek hard enough to make his palm tingle hard enough to rock her head back against the headrest Her eyes widened with surprise and pain and something else as well Her own hand flew to her cheek to investigate the warmth and tingling numbness there She cried out Owww Tom He looked at her eyes narrowed mouth smiling casually completely alive ready to see what would come next how she would react His cock was stiffening in his pants but he barely noticed That was for later For now school was in session He replayed what had just happened Her face What had that third expression been there for a bare instant and then gone First the surprise Then the pain Then the look of a memory of some memory It had only been for a moment He didnt think she even knew it had been there on her face or in her mind Now now It would all be in the first thing she didnt say He knew that as well as his own name She only looked at him with her wounded brimming hazel eyes and said Why did you do that Then she tried to say something else and burst into tears instead What What Tom Her makeup was running down her face in muddy tracks He didnt mind that He kind of liked seeing her that way It was messy but there was something sexy about it too Slutty Kind of exciting Throw it out Bev or youre going to get another shot She rolled the window down and pitched the cigarette Then she turned back to him her face pale and scared and somehow serene You cant you arent supposed to hit me Thats a bad basis for a a a lasting relationship She was trying to find a tone an adult rhythm of speech and failing He had regressed her He was in this car with a child Voluptuous and sexy as hell but a child Cant and arent are two different things keed he said He kept his voice calm but inside he was jittering and jiving And Ill be the one to decide what constitutes a lasting relationship and what doesnt If you can live with that fine If you cant you can take a walk I wont stop you I might kick you once in the ass as a goingaway present but I wont stop you Its a free country What more can I say Maybe youve already said enough she whispered and he hit her again harder than the first time because no broad was ever going to smart off to Tom Rogan He would pop the Queen of England if she cracked smart to him Her cheek banged the padded dashboard Her hand groped for the doorhandle and then fell away She only crouched in the corner like a rabbit one hand over her mouth her eyes large and wet and frightened Tom looked at her for a moment and then he got out and walked around the back of the car He opened her door His breath was smoke in the black windy November air and the smell of the lake was very clear You want to get out Bev I saw you reaching for the doorhandle so I guess you must want to get out Okay Thats all right I asked you to do something and you said you would Then you didnt So you want to get out Come on Get out What the fuck right Get out You want to get out No I dont want to get out she said a little louder Whatthose cigarettes giving you emphysema If you cant talk Ill get you a fucking megaphone This is your last chance Beverly You speak up so I can hear you do you want to get out of this car or do you want to come back with me Want to come back with you she said and clasped her hands on her skirt like a little girl She wouldnt look at him Tears slipped down her cheeks All right he said Fine But first you say this for me Bev You say I forgot about smoking in front of you Tom Now she looked at him her eyes wounded pleading inarticulate You can make me do this her eyes said but please dont Dont I love you cant it be over Noit could not Because that was not the bottom of her wanting and both of them knew it The cigarette lay smoking on the pavement like a cut piece of fuse People leaving the theater glanced over at them the man standing by the open passenger door of a latemodel fadeintothewoodwork Vega the woman sitting inside her hands clasped primly in her lap her head down the domelight outlining the soft fall of her hair in gold He crushed the cigarette out He smeared it against the blacktop So he had slammed the door and gone back around to the drivers seat He got behind the wheel and drove them back to his downtown apartment Neither of them said a word Hah the relationship had been set in the parking lot the second half was set forty minutes later in Toms bed She didnt want to make love she said He saw a different truth in her eyes and the strutty cock of her legs however and when he got her blouse off her nipples had been rock hard She moaned when he brushed them and cried out softly when he suckled first one and then the other kneading them restlessly as he did so She grabbed his hand and thrust it between her legs I thought you didnt want to he said and she had turned her face away but she did not let go of his hand and the rocking motion of her hips actually speeded up He pushed her back on the bed and now he was gentle not ripping her underwear but removing it with a careful consideration that was almost prissy He moved with her using her but letting her use him as well and she came the first time almost at once crying out and digging her nails into his back Then they rocked together in long slow strokes and somewhere in there he thought she came again Tom would get close and then he would think of White Sox batting averages or who was trying to undercut him for the Chesley account at work and he would be okay again Then she began to speed up her rhythm finally dissolving into an excited bucking He looked at her face the raccoon ringlets of mascara the smeared lipstick and he felt himself suddenly shooting deliriously toward the edge She jerked her hips up harder and harderthere had been no beergut between them in those days and their bellies clapped hands in a quickening beat Near the end she screamed and then bit his shoulder with her small even teeth How many times did you come he asked her after they had showered She turned her face away and when she spoke her voice was so low he almost couldnt hear her That isnt something youre supposed to ask He took her face in one hand thumb pressing deep into one cheek fingers pressing into the other palm cupping her chin in between You talk to Tom he said You hear me Bev Talk to Papa She looked at him distrustfully her red hair spread over the pillows wearing nothing but a pair of hiphugger panties Just looking at her that way got his motor turning over again He nodded They had been married in a civil ceremony three months later Two of his friends had come the only friend of hers to attend had been Kay McCall whom Tom called that titsy womenslib bitch All of these memories went through Toms mind in a space of seconds like a speededup piece of film as he stood in the doorway watching her She had gone on to the bottom drawer of what she sometimes called her weekend bureau and now she was tossing underwear into the suitcasenot the sort of stuff he liked the slippery satins and smooth silks this was cotton stuff littlegirl stuff most of it faded and with little puffs of popped elastic on the waistbands A cotton nightie that looked like something out of Little House on the Prairie She poked in the back of this bottom drawer to see what else might be lurking in there Tom Rogan meanwhile moved across the shag rug toward his wardrobe His feet were bare and his passage noiseless as a puff of breeze It was the cigarette That was what had really gotten him mad It had been a long time since she had forgotten that first lesson There had been other lessons to learn since a great many and there had been hot days when she had worn longsleeved blouses or even cardigan sweaters buttoned all the way to the neck Gray days when she had worn sunglasses But that first lesson had been so sudden and fundamental He had forgotten the telephone call that had wakened him out of his deepening sleep It was the cigarette If she was smoking now then she had forgotten Tom Rogan Temporarily of course only temporarily but even temporarily was too damned long What might have caused her to forget didnt matter Such things were not to happen in his house for any reason There was a wide black strip of leather hanging from a hook inside the closet door There was no buckle on it he had removed that long ago It was doubled over at one end where a buckle would have gone and this doubledover section formed a loop into which Tom Rogan now slipped his hand Tom you been bad his mother had sometimes saidwell sometimes was maybe not such a good word maybe often would have been a better one You come here Tommy I got to give you a whuppin His life as a child had been punctuated by whuppins He had finally escaped to Wichita State College but apparently there was no such thing as a complete escape because he continued to hear her voice in dreams Come here Tommy I got to give you a whuppin Whuppin He had been the eldest of four Three months after the youngest had been born Ralph Rogan had diedwell died was maybe not such a good word maybe committed suicide would have been a better way to put it since he had poured a generous quantity of lye into a tumbler of gin and quaffed this devils brew while sitting on the bathroom hopper Mrs Rogan had found work at the Ford plant Tom although only eleven became the man of the family And if he screwed upif the baby shat her didies after the sitter went home and the mess was still in them when Mom got home if he forgot to cross Megan on the Broad Street corner after her nursery school got out and that nosy Mrs Gant saw if he happened to be watching American Bandstand while Joey made a mess in the kitchen if any of those things or a thousand others happened then after the smaller children were in bed the spanking stick would come out and she would call the invocation Come here Tommy I got to give you a whuppin If he had learned nothing else on the great tollroad of life he had learned that So he flipped the loose end of the belt over once and pulled the loop snug Then he closed his fist over it It felt good It made him feel like a grownup The strip of leather hung from his clenched fist like a dead blacksnake His headache was gone She had found that one last thing in the back of the drawer an old white cotton bra with gunshell cups The thought that this earlymorning call might have been from a lover surfaced briefly in his mind and then sank again That was ridiculous A woman going away to meet her lover did not pack her faded Ship n Shore blouses and her cotton KMart undies with the pops and snarls in the elastic Also she wouldnt dare Beverly he said softly and she turned at once startled her eyes wide her long hair swinging The belt hesitated dropped a little He stared at her feeling that little bloom of uneasiness again Yes she had looked this way before the big shows and then he hadnt gotten in her way understanding that she was so filled with a mixture of fear and competitive aggressiveness that it was as if her head was full of illuminating gas a single spark and she would explode She had seen the shows not as a chance to split off from Delia Fashions to make a livingor even a fortuneon her own If that had been all she would have been fine But if that were all she also would not have been so ungodly talented She had seen those shows as a kind of superexam on which she would be graded by fierce teachers What she saw on those occasions was some creature without a face It had no face but it did have a nameAuthority All of that wideeyed nerviness was on her face now But not just there it was all around her an aura that seemed almost visible a hightension charge which made her suddenly both more alluring and more dangerous than she had seemed to him in years He was afraid because she was here all here the essential she as apart from the she Tom Rogan wanted her to be the she he had made Beverly looked shocked and frightened She also looked almost madly exhilarated Her cheeks glowed with hectic color yet there were stark white patches below her lower lids which looked almost like a second pair of eyes Her forehead glowed with a creamy resonance And the cigarette was still jutting out of her mouth now at a slight upangle as if she thought she was goddam Franklin Delano Roosevelt The cigarette Just looking at it caused dull fury to wash over him again in a green wave Faintly far back in his mind he remembered her saying something to him one night out of the dark speaking in a dull and listless voice Someday youre going to kill me Tom Do you know that Someday youre just going to go too far and that will be the end Youll snap He had answered You do it my way Bev and that day will never come Now before the rage blotted out everything he wondered if that day hadnt come after all The cigarette Never mind the call the packing the weird look on her face They would deal with the cigarette Then he would fuck her Then they could discuss the rest By then it might even seem important Youre smoking he said His voice seemed to come from a distance as if over a pretty good radio Looks like you forgot babe Where you been hiding them Look Ill put it out she said and went to the bathroom door She flipped the cigaretteeven from here he could see the teethmarks driven deep into the filterinto the bowl of the John Fsssss She came back out Tom that was an old friend An old old friend I have to Shut up thats what you have to do he shouted at her Just shut up But the fear he wanted to seethe fear of himwas not on her face There was fear but it had come out of the telephone and fear was not supposed to come to Beverly from that direction It was almost as if she didnt see the belt didnt see him and Tom felt a trickle of unease Was he here It was a stupid question but was he This question was so terrible and so elemental that for a moment he felt in danger of coming completely unwrapped from the root of himself and just floating off like a tumbleweed in a high breeze Then he caught hold of himself He was here all right and that was quite enough fucking psychobabble for one night He was here he was Tom Rogan Tom byGod Rogan and if this dippy cunt didnt straighten up and fly right in the next thirty seconds or so she was going to look like she got pushed out of a fastmoving boxcar by a mean railroad dick Got to give you a whuppin he said sorry about that babe He had seen that mixture of fear and aggressiveness before yes Now for the first time ever it flashed out at him Put that thing down she said I have to get out to OHare as fast as I can He pushed the thought away The strip of leather which had once been a belt swung slowly before him like a pendulum His eyes flickered and then held fast to her face Listen to me Tom Theres been some trouble back in my home town Very bad trouble I had a friend in those days I guess he would have been my boyfriend except we werent quite old enough for that He was only an elevenyearold kid with a bad stutter back then Hes a novelist now You even read one of his books I think The Black Rapids She searched his face but his face gave no sign There was only the belt penduluming back and forth back and forth He stood with his head lowered and his stocky legs slightly apart Then she ran her hand restlessly through her hairdistractedlyas if she had many important things to think of and hadnt seen the belt at all and that haunting awful question resurfaced in his head again Are you there Are you sure That book laid around here for weeks and I never made the connection Maybe I should have but were all older and I havent even thought about Derry in a long long time Anyway Bill had a brother George and George was killed before I really knew Bill He was murdered And then the next summer But Tom had listened to enough craziness from within and from without He moved in on her fast cocking his right arm back over his shoulder like a man about to throw a javelin The belt hissed a path through the air Beverly saw it coming and tried to duck away but her right shoulder struck the bathroom doorway and there was a meaty whapl as the belt struck her left forearm leaving a red weal Gonna whup you Tom repeated His voice was sane even regretful but his teeth showed in a white and frozen smile He wanted to see that look in her eyes that look of fear and terror and shame that look that said Yes youre right I deserved it that look that said Yes youre there all right I feel your presence Then love could come back and that was right and good because he did love her They could even have a discussion if she wanted it of exactly who had called and what all this was about But that must come later For now school was in session The old onetwo First the whuppin then the fuckin He swung the belt sidearm and saw it lick around her hip There was a satisfying snap as it finished on her buttock And And Jesus she was grabbing at it She was grabbing at the belt For a moment Tom Rogan was so astounded by this unexpected act of insubordination that he almost lost his punisher would have lost it except for the loop which was tucked securely into his fist Dont you ever try to grab something away from me he said hoarsely You hear me You ever do that again and youll spend a month pissing raspberry juice Tom stop it she said and her very tone infuriated himshe sounded like a playground monitor talking down to a tantrumy sixyearold I have to go This is no joke People are dead and I made a promise a long time ago Tom heard little of this He bellowed and ran at her with his head down the belt swinging blindly He hit her with it driving her away from the doorway and along the bedroom wall He cocked his arm back hit her cocked his arm back hit her cocked his arm back hit her Later that morning he would not be able to raise the arm above eye level until he had swallowed three codeine tablets but for now he was aware of nothing but the fact that she was defying him She had not only been smoking she had tried to grab the belt away from him and oh folks oh friends and neighbors she had asked for it and he would testify before the throne of God Almighty that she was going to get it He drove her along the wall swinging the belt raining blows on her Her hands were up to protect her face but he had a clear shot at the rest of her The belt made thick bull whip cracks in the quiet room But she did not scream as she sometimes did and she did not beg him to stop as she usually did Worst of all she did not cry as she always did The only sounds were the belt and their breathing his heavy and hoarse hers quick and light She broke for the bed and the vanity table on her side of it Her shoulders were red from the belts blows Her hair streamed fire He lumbered after her slower but big very bighe had played squash until he had popped an Achilles tendon two years ago and since then his weight had gotten out of hand a little bit or maybe a lot would have been a better way to put it but the muscle was still there firm cordage sheathed in the fat Still he was a little alarmed at how out of breath he was She reached the vanity and he thought she would crouch there or maybe try to crawl under it Instead she groped turned and suddenly the air was full of flying missiles She was throwing cosmetics at him A bottle of Chantilly struck him squarely between the nipples fell to his feet shattered He was suddenly enveloped in the gagging scent of flowers Instead of quitting it her hands flew along the vanitys littered glass top grabbing whatever they found throwing it He groped at his chest where the bottle of Chantilly had struck him unable to believe she had hit him with something even as other objects flew around him The bottles glass stopper had cut him It was not much of a cut little more than a triangular scratch but was there a certain redhaired lady who was going to see the sun come up from a hospital bed Oh yes there was A certain lady who A jar of cream struck him above the right eyebrow with sudden cracking force He heard a dull thud seemingly inside his head White light exploded over that eyes field of vision and he fell back a step mouth dropping open Now a tube of Nivea cream struck his belly with a small slapping sound and she waswas she was it possibleyes She was yelling at him Im going to the airport you son of a bitch Do you hear me I have business and Im going You want to get out of my way because IM GOING Blood ran into his right eye stinging and hot He knuckled it away He stood there for a moment staring at her as if he had never seen her before In a way he never had Her breasts heaved rapidly Her face all flush and livid pallor blazed Her lips were drawn back from her teeth in a snarl She had however denuded the top of the vanity table The missile silo was empty He could still read the fear in her eyes but it was still not fear of him You put those clothes back he said struggling not to pant as he spoke That would not sound good That would sound weak Then you put the suitcase back and get into bed And if you do those things maybe I wont beat you up too bad Maybe youll be able to go out of the house in two days instead of two weeks Tom listen to me She spoke slowly Her gaze was very clear If you come near me again Ill kill you Do you understand that you tub of guts Ill kill you And suddenlymaybe it was because of the utter loathing on her face the contempt maybe because she had called him a tub of guts or maybe only because of the rebellious way her breasts rose and fellthe fear was suffocating him It was not a bud or a bloom but a whole goddam garden the fear the horrible fear that he was not here Tom Rogan rushed at his wife not bellowing this time He came as silently as a torpedo cutting through the water His intent now was probably not merely to beat and subjugate but to do to her what she had so rashly said she would do to him He thought she would run Probably for the bathroom Maybe for the stairs Instead she stood her ground Her hip whacked the wall as she threw her weight against the vanity table pushing it up and toward him ripping two fingernails down to the quick when the sweat on her palms caused her hands to slip For a moment the table tottered on an angle and then she shoved herself forward again The vanity waltzed on one leg mirror catching the light and reflecting a brief swimmy aquarium shadow across the ceiling and then it tilted forward and outward Its leading edge slammed into Toms upper thighs and knocked him over There was a musical jingle as bottles tipped over and shattered inside He saw the mirror strike the floor on his left and threw an arm up to shield his eyes losing the belt Glass coughed across the floor silver on the back He felt some of it sting him drawing blood Now she was crying her breath coming in high screamy sobs Time after time she had seen herself leaving him leaving Toms tyranny as she had left that of her father stealing away in the night bags piled in the trunk of her Cutlass She was not a stupid woman certainly not stupid enough even now standing on the rim of this incredible shambles to believe that she had not loved Tom and did not in some way love him still But that did not preclude her fear of him her hate of him and her contempt of herself for choosing him for dim reasons buried in the times that should be over Her heart was not breaking it seemed rather to be broiling in her chest melting She was afraid the heat from her heart might soon destroy her sanity in fire But above all this yammering steadily in the back of her mind she could hear Mike Hanlons dry steady voice Its come back Beverly its come back and you promised The vanity heaved up and down Once Twice A third time It looked as if it were breathing Moving with careful agility her mouth turned down at the corners and jerking as if in prelude to some sort of convulsion she skirted the vanity toestepping through the broken glass and grabbed the belt just as Tom heaved the vanity off to one side Then she backed up sliding her hand into the loop She shook her hair out of her eyes and watched to see what he would do Tom got up Some of the mirrorglass had cut one of his cheeks A diagonal cut traced a line as fine as thread across his brow He squinted at her as he rose slowly to his feet and she saw drops of blood on his boxer shorts Instead she took two turns of it around her hand and looked at him defiantly If you come for me Im going to strap the shit out of you The words were coming out of her mouth but she couldnt believe it was her saying them And just who was this caveman in the bloody undershorts anyway Her husband Her father The lover she had taken in college who had broken her nose one night apparently on a whim Oh God help me she thought God help me now And still her mouth went on I can do it too Youre fat and slow Tom Im going and I think maybe Ill stay gone I think maybe its over She realized almost too late that the question had been a distraction He was coming for her before the last word was out of his mouth She whickered the belt through the air in an arc and the sound it made when it smashed across his mouth was the sound of a stubborn cork coming out of a bottle He squealed and clapped his hands to his mouth his eyes huge hurt and shocked Blood began to pour between his fingers and over the backs of his hands You broke my mouth you bitch he screamed muffled Ah God you broke my mouth He came at her again hands reaching his mouth a wet red smear His lips appeared to have burst in two places The crown had been knocked from one of his front teeth As she watched he spit it to one side Part of her was backing away from this scene sick and moaning wanting to shut her eyes But that other Beverly felt the exultation of a deathrow convict freed in a freak earthquake That Beverly liked all of this just fine I wish youd swallowed it that one thought Wish youd choked on it It was this latter Beverly who swung the belt for the last timethe belt he had used on her buttocks her legs her breasts The belt he had used on her times without number over the last four years How many strokes you got depended on how badly youd screwed up Tom comes home and dinner is cold Two with the belt Bevs working late at the studio and forgets to call home Three with the belt Oh hey look at thisBeverly got another parking ticket One with the belt across the breasts He was good He rarely bruised It didnt even hurt that much Except for the humiliation That hurt And what hurt worse was knowing that part of her craved the hurt Craved the humiliation She brought the belt in low brought it in sidearm and it whacked across his balls with a brisk yet heavy sound the sound of a woman striking a rug with a carpetbeater That was all it took All the fight promptly went out of Tom Rogan He uttered a thin strengthless shriek and fell on his knees as if to pray His hands were between his legs His head was thrown back Cords stood out on his neck His mouth was a tragedygrimace of pain His left knee came down squarely on a heavy pointed hook of shattered perfume bottle and he rolled silently over on one side like a whale One hand left his balls to grab his squirting knee Hell live this new Beverlythe Beverly who seemed to have surfaced at Mike Hanlons phone callreplied coldly Guys like him always live You just get the hell out of here before he decides he wants to tango some more Or before he decides to go down cellar and get his Winchester She backed away and felt pain stab her foot as she stepped on a chunk of glass from the broken vanity mirror She bent down to grab the handle of her suitcase She never took her eyes off him She backed out the door and she backed down the hall She was holding the suitcase in front of her in both hands and it banged her shins as she backed Her cut foot printed bloody heelprints When she reached the stairs she turned around and went down quickly not letting herself think She suspected she had no coherent thoughts left inside anyway at least for the time being She looked down and saw it was the end of the belt It was still wrapped around her hand In this dim light it looked more like a dead snake than ever She threw it over the bannister her face a wince of disgust and saw it land in an S on the rug of the downstairs hallway At the foot of the stairs she grasped the hem of her white lace nightgown crosshanded and pulled it over her head It was bloody and she would not wear it one second longer no matter what She tossed it aside and it billowed onto the rubberplant by the doorway to the living room like a lacy parachute She bent naked to the suitcase Her nipples were cold hard as bullets She gasped jerked then bent back to the suitcase If he was strong enough to scream that loud her time was a good deal shorter than she had thought She opened the case and pawed out panties a blouse an old pair of Levis She jerked these on standing by the door her eyes never leaving the stairs But Tom did not appear at the top of them He bawled her name twice more and each time she flinched away from that sound her eyes hunted her lips pulling back from her teeth in an unconscious snarl She jabbed the buttons of the blouse through the holes as fast as she could The top two buttons were gone it was ironic how little of her own sewing ever got done and she supposed she looked quite a bit like a parttime hooker looking for one last quickie before calling it a nightbut it would have to do She slammed the suitcase closed and latched it The arm of a blouse poked out like a tongue She looked around once quickly suspecting that she would never see this house again She discovered only relief in the idea and so opened the door and let herself out She was three blocks away walking with no clear sense of where she was going when she realized her feet were still bare The one she had cutthe leftthrobbed dully She had to get something on her feet and it was nearly two oclock in the morning Her wallet and creditcards were at home She felt in the pockets of the jeans and came up with nothing but a few puffs of lint She didnt have a dime not so much as a red penny She looked around at the residential neighborhood she was innice homes manicured lawns and plantings dark windows Beverly Rogan sat on a low stone wall her suitcase between her dirty feet and laughed The stars were out and how bright they were She tilted her head back and laughed at them that wild exhilaration washing through her again like a tidal wave that lifted and carried and cleansed a force so powerful that any conscious thought was lost only her blood thought and its one powerful voice spoke to her in some inarticulate way of desire although what it was it desired she neither knew nor cared It was enough to feel that warmth filling her up with its insistence Desire she thought and inside her that tidal wave of exhilaration seemed to gather speed rushing her onward toward some inevitable crash She laughed at the stars frightened but free her terror as sharp as pain and as sweet as a ripe October apple and when a light came on in an upstairs bedroom of the house this stone wall belonged to she grabbed the handle of her suitcase and fled off into the night still laughing Leave Audra repeated She looked at him puzzled a bit afraid and then tucked her bare feet up and under her The floor was cold The whole cottage was cold come to that The south of England had been experiencing an exceptionally dank spring and more than once on his regular morning and evening walks Bill Denbrough had found himself thinking of Maine thinking in a surprised vague way of Derry The cottage was supposed to have central heatingthe ad had said so and there certainly was a furnace down there in the tidy little basement tucked away in what had once been a coalbinbut he and Audra had discovered early on in the shoot that the British idea of central heating was not at all the same as the American one It seemed the Brits believed you had central heating as long as you didnt have to piss away a scrim of ice in the toilet bowl when you got up in the morning It was morning nowjust quarter of eight Bill had hung the phone up five minutes ago I have to he said There was a hutch on the far side of the room He went to it took a bottle of Glenfiddich from the top shelf and poured himself a drink Some of it slopped over the side of the glass Tuck he muttered Who was that on the telephone What are you scared of Bill Oh Your hands always shake like that You always have your first drink before breakfast He came back to his chair robe flapping around his ankles and sat down He tried to smile but it was a poor effort and he gave it up On the telly the BBC announcer was wrapping up this mornings batch of bad news before going on to last evenings football scores When they had arrived in the small suburban village of Fleet a month before the shoot was scheduled to begin they had both marvelled over the technical quality of British televisionon a good Pye color set it really did look as though you could climb right inside More lines or something Bill had said I dont know what it is but its great Audra had replied That was before they discovered that much of the programming consisted of American shows such as Dallas and endless British sports events ranging from the arcane and boring champion dartsthrowing in which all the participants looked like hypertensive sumo wrestlers to the simply boring British football was bad cricket was even worse Ive been thinking about home a lot lately Bill said and sipped his drink Home she said and looked so honestly puzzled that he laughed Poor Audra Married almost eleven years to the guy and you dont know doodleysquat about him What do you know about that He laughed again and swallowed the rest of his drink His laughter had a quality she cared for as little as seeing him with a glass of Scotch in his hand at this hour of the morning The laugh sounded like something that really wanted to be a howl of pain I wonder if any of the others have got husbands and wives who are just finding out how little they know I suppose they must Billy I know that I love you she said For eleven years thats been enough I know He smiled at herthe smile was sweet tired and scared She looked at him with her lovely gray eyes sitting there in a tatty leasedhouse chair with her feet curled beneath the hem of her nightgown a woman he had loved married and still loved He tried to see through her eyes to see what she knew He tried to see it as a story He could but he knew it would never sell Here is a poor boy from the state of Maine who goes to the University on a scholarship All his life he has wanted to be a writer but when he enrolls in the writing courses he finds himself lost without a compass in a strange and frightening land Theres one guy who wants to be Updike Theres another one who wants to be a New England version of Faulkneronly he wants to write novels about the grim lives of the poor in blank verse Theres a girl who admires Joyce Carol Gates but feels that because Oates was nurtured in a sexist society she is radioactive in a literary sense Oates is unable to be clean this girl says She will be cleaner Theres the short fat grad student who cant or wont speak above a mutter This guy has written a play in which there are nine characters Each of them says only a single word Little by little the playgoers realize that when you put the single words together you come out with War is the tool of the sexist death merchants This fellows play receives an A from the man who teaches Eh Creative Writing Honors Seminar This instructor has published four books of poetry and his masters thesis all with the University Press He smokes pot and wears a peace medallion The fat mutterers play is produced by a guerrilla theater group during the strike to end the war which shuts down the campus in May of The instructor plays one of the characters Bill Denbrough meanwhile has written one lockedroom mystery tale three sciencefiction stories and several horror tales which owe a great deal to Edgar Allan Poe H P Lovecraft and Richard Mathesonin later years he will say those stories resembled a mids funeral hack equipped with a supercharger and painted DayGlo red This is better the instructor writes on the title page In the alien counterstrike we see the vicious circle in which violence begets violence I particularly liked the needlenosed spacecraft as a symbol of sociosexual incursion While this remains a slightly confused undertone throughout it is interesting Finally he stands up in class one day after the discussion of a sallow young womans vignette about a cows examination of a discarded engine block in a deserted field this may or may not be after a nuclear war has gone on for seventy minutes or so The sallow girl who smokes one Winston after another and picks occasionally at the pimples which nestle in the hollows of her temples insists that the vignette is a sociopolitical statement in the manner of the early Orwell Most of the classand the instructoragree but still the discussion drones on When Bill stands up the class looks at him He is tail and has a certain presence Speaking carefully not stuttering he has not stuttered in better than five years he says I dont understand this at all I dont understand any of this Why does a story have to be socioanything Politics culture history arent those natural ingredients in any story if its told well I mean He looks around sees hostile eyes and realizes dimly that they see this as some sort of attack Maybe it even is They are thinking he realizes that maybe there is a sexist death merchant in their midst I mean cant you guys just let a story be a story No one replies Silence spins out He stands there looking from one cool set of eyes to the next The sallow girl chuffs out smoke and snubs her cigarette in an ashtray she has brought along in her backpack Finally the instructor says softly as if to a child having an inexplicable tantrum do you believe William Faulkner was just telling stories Do you believe Shakespeare was just interested in making a buck Come now Bill Tell us what you think I think thats pretty close to the truth Bill says after a long moment in which he honestly considers the question and in their eyes he reads a kind of damnation I suggest the instructor says toying with his pen and smiling at Bill with halflidded eyes that you have a great deal to learn Bill leaves but returns the next week determined to stick with it In the time between he has written a story called The Dark a tale about a small boy who discovers a monster in the cellar of his house The little boy faces it battles it finally kills it He feels a land of holy exaltation as he goes about the business of writing this story he even feels that he is not so much telling the story as he is allowing the story to flow through him At one point he puts his pen down and takes his hot and aching hand out into tendegree December cold where it nearly smokes from the temperature change He walks around green cutoff boots squeaking in the snow like tiny shutterhinges which need oil and his head seems to bulge with the story it is a little scary the way it needs to get out He feels that if it cannot escape by way of his racing hand that it will pop his eyes out in its urgency to escape and be concrete Going to knock the shit out of it he confides to the blowing winter dark and laughs a littlea shaky laugh He is aware that he has finally discovered how to do just thatafter ten years of trying he has suddenly found the starter button on the vast dead bulldozer taking up so much space inside his head It has started up It is revving revving It is nothing pretty this big machine It was not made for taking pretty girls to proms It is not a status symbol It means business It can knock things down If he isnt careful it will knock him down He rushes inside and finishes The Dark at white heat writing until four oclock in the morning and finally falling asleep over his ringbinder If someone had suggested to him that he was really writing about his brother George he would have been surprised He has not thought about George in yearsor so he honestly believes The story comes back from the instructor with an F slashed into the tide page Two words are scrawled beneath in capital letters PULP screams one CRAP screams the other Bill takes the fifteenpage sheaf of manuscript over to the woodstove and opens the door He is within a bare inch of tossing it in when the absurdity of what he is doing strikes him He sits down in his rocking chair looks at a Grateful Dead poster and starts to laugh Pulp Fine Let it be pulp The woods were full of it Let them fucking trees fall Bill exclaims and laughs until tears spurt from his eyes and roll down his face He retypes the title page the one with the instructors judgment on it and sends it off to a mens magazine named White Tie although from what Bill can see it really should be titled Naked Girls Who Look Like Drug Users Yet his battered Writers Market says they buy horror stories and the two issues he has bought down at the local momandpop store have indeed contained four horror stories sandwiched between the naked girls and the ads for dirty movies and potency pills One of them by a man named Dennis Etchison is actually quite good He sends The Dark off with no real hopeshe has submitted a good many stories to magazines before with nothing to show for it but rejection slipsand is flabbergasted and delighted when the fiction editor of White Tie buys it for two hundred dollars payment on publication The assistant editor adds a short note which calls it the best damned horror story since Ray Bradburys The Jar He adds Too bad only about seventy people coast to coast will read it but Bill Denbrough does not care Two hundred dollars He goes to his advisor with a drop card for Eh His advisor initials it Bill Denbrough staples the drop card to the assistant fiction editors congratulatory note and tacks both to the bulletin board on the creativewriting instructors door In the corner of the bulletin board he sees an antiwar cartoon And suddenly as if moving of its own accord his fingers pluck his pen from his breast pocket and across the cartoon he writes this If fiction and politics ever really do become interchangeable Im going to kill myself because I wont know what else to do You see politics always change Stories never do He pauses and then feeling a bit small but unable to help himself he adds I suggest you have a lot to learn His drop card comes back to him in the campus mail three days later The instructor has initialed it On the space marked GRADE AT TIME OF DROP the instructor has not given him an incomplete or the low C to which his run of grades at that time would have entitled him instead another F is slashed angrily across the grade line Below it the instructor has written Do you think money proves anything about anything Denbrough Well actually yes Bill Denbrough says to his empty apartment and once more begins to laugh crazily In his senior year of college he dares to write a novel because he has no idea what hes getting into He escapes the experience scratched and frightened but alive and with a manuscript nearly five hundred pages long He sends it out to The Viking Press knowing that it will be the first of many stops for his book which is about ghosts but he likes Vikings ship logo and that makes it as good a place to start as any As it turns out the first stop is also the last stop Viking purchases the book and for Bill Denbrough the fairytale begins The man who was once known as Stuttering Bill has become a success at the age of twentythree Three years later and three thousand miles from northern New England he attains a queer kind of celebrity by marrying a woman who is a moviestar and five years his senior at Hollywoods Church in the Pines The gossip columnists give it seven months The only bet they say is whether the end will come in a divorce or an annulment Friends and enemies on both sides of the match feel about the same The age difference apart the disparities are startling He is tall already balding already inclining a bit toward fat He speaks slowly in company and at times seems nearly inarticulate Audra on the other hand is auburnhaired statuesque and gorgeousshe is less like an earthly woman than a creature from some semidivine superrace He has been hired to do the screenplay of his second novel The Black Rapids mostly because the right to do at least the first draft of the screenplay was an immutable condition of sale in spite of his agents moans that he was insane and his draft has actually turned out pretty well He has been invited out to Universal City for further rewrites and production meetings His agent is a small woman named Susan Browne She is exactly five feet tall She is violently energetic and even more violently emphatic dont do it Billy she tells him Kiss it off Theyve got a lot of money tied up in it and theyll get someone good to do the screenplay Maybe even Goldman William Goldman The only good writer who ever went out there and did both He stayed there and he stayed good she said The odds on both are like the odds on beating lung cancerit can be done but who wants to try Youll burn out on sex and booze Or some of the nifty new drugs Susans crazily fascinating brown eyes sparkle vehemently up at him And if it turns out to be some meatball who gets the assignment instead of someone like Goldman so what The books on the shelf there They cant change a word Listen to me Billy Take the money and run Youre young and strong Thats what they like You go out there and they will first separate you from your selfrespect and then from your ability to write a straight line from point A to point B Last but not least they will take your testes You write like a grownup but youre just a kid with a very high forehead Did someone just fart in here she returns Must have because something sure stinks I have to get away from New England He is afraid to say what comes nextits like mouthing a cursebut he owes it to her I have to get away from Maine Are you telling me something real Billy or just talking like a writer They are in bed together during this conversation Her breasts are small like peaches sweet like peaches He loves her a lot although not the way they both know would be a really good way to love She sits up with a pool of sheet in her lap and lights a cigarette Shes crying but he doubts if she knows he knows Its just this shine in her eyes It would be tactful not to mention it so he doesnt He doesnt love her in that really good way but he cares a mountain for her Go on then she says in a dry businesslike voice as she turns back to him Give me a call when youre ready and if you still have the strength Ill come and pick up the pieces If there are any left The film version of The Black Rapids is called Pit of the Black Demon and Audra Phillips is cast as the lead The title is horrible but the movie turns out to be quite good And the only part of him he loses in Hollywood is his heart Bill Audra said again bringing him out of these memories He saw she had snapped off the TV He glanced out the window and saw fog nuzzling against the panes Ill explain as much as I can he said You deserve that But first do two things for me Fix yourself another cup of tea and tell me what you know about me Or what you think you know She looked at him puzzled and then went to the highboy I know youre from Maine she said making herself tea from the breakfast pot She was not British but just a touch of clipped British had crept into her voicea holdover from the part she played in Attic Room the movie they had come over here to do It was Bills first original screenplay He had been offered the directorial shot as well Thank God he had declined that his leaving now would have completed the job of bitching things up He knew what they would all say the whole crew Billy Denbrough finally shows his true colors Just another fucking writer crazier than a shithouse rat I know you had a brother and that you loved him very much and that he died Audra went on I know that you grew up in a town called Derry moved to Bangor about two years after your brother died and moved to Portland when you were fourteen I know your dad died of lung cancer when you were seventeen And you wrote a bestseller while you were still in college paying your way with a scholarship and a parttime job in a textile mill That must have seemed very strange to you the change in income In prospects She returned to his side of the room and he saw it in her face then the realization of the hidden spaces between them I know that you wrote The Black Rapids a year later and came out to Hollywood And the week before shooting started on the movie you met a very mixedup woman named Audra Phillips who knew a little bit about what you must have been throughthe crazy decompressionbecause she had been plain old Audrey Philpott five years before And this woman was drowning Her eyes were steady holding his Oh why not Let us tell the truth and shame the devil I was drowning I discovered poppers two years before I met you and then a year later I discovered coke and that was even better A popper in the morning coke in the afternoon wine at night a Valium at bedtime Audras vitamins Too many important interviews too many good parts I was so much like a character in a Jacqueline Susann novel it was hilarious Do you know how I think about that time now Bill She sipped her tea her eyes never leaving his and grinned It was like running on the walkway at LA International You get it Its a moving belt she said About a quarter of a mile long I know the walkway he said but I dont see what youre You just stand there and it carries you all the way to the baggageclaim area But if you want you dont have to just stand there You can walk on it Or run And it seems like youre just doing your normal walk or your normal jog or your normal run or your normal allout sprintwhateverbecause your body forgets that what youre really doing is topping the speed the walkways already making Thats why they have those signs that say SLOW DOWN MOVING RAMPWAY near the end When I met you I felt as if Id run right off the end of that thing onto a floor that didnt move anymore There I was my body nine miles ahead of my feet You cant keep your balance Sooner or later you fall right on your face Except I didnt Because you caught me She put her tea aside and lit a cigarette her eyes never leaving him He could only see that her hands were shaking in the minute jitter of the lighterflame which darted first to the right of the cigaretteend and then to the left before finding it What do I know about you I know you seemed to have it all under control I know that You never seemed to be in a hurry to get to the next drink or the next meeting or the next party You seemed confident that all those things would be there if you wanted them You talked slow Part of it was the Maine drawl I guess but most of it was just you You were the first man I ever met out there who dared to talk slow I had to slow down to listen I looked at you Bill and I saw someone who never ran on the walkway because he knew it would get him there You seemed utterly untouched by the hype and hysteria You didnt lease a Rolls so you could drive down Rodeo Drive on Saturday afternoon with your own vanity plates on some glitzy rental companys car You didnt have a press agent to plant items in Variety or The Hollywood Reporter Youd never done the Carson show Writers cant unless they also do cardtricks or bend spoons he said smiling Its like a national law He thought she would smile but she didnt I know you were there when I needed you When I came flying off the end of the walkway like O J Simpson in that old Hertz ad Maybe you saved me from eating the wrong pill on top of too much booze Or maybe I would have made it out the other side on my own and its all a big dramatization on my part But it doesnt feel like that Not inside where I am I know youve been there ever since And Ive been there for you Were good in bed That used to seem like a big deal to me But were also good out of it and now that seems like a bigger deal I feel as if I could grow old with you and still be brave I know you drink too much beer and dont get enough exercise I know that some nights you dream badly She smiled so you tell the interviewers when they ask where you get your ideas But its not true Unless its just indigestion when you start groaning in the night And I dont believe that Billy Do I talk he asked cautiously He could remember no dreams No dreams at all good or bad Audra nodded sometimes But I can never make out what it is you say And on a couple of occasions you have wept He looked at her blankly There was a bad taste in his mouth it trailed back along his tongue and down his throat like the taste of melted aspirin So now you know how fear tastes he thought Time you found out considering all youve written on the subject He supposed it was a taste he would get used to If he lived long enough Memories were suddenly trying to crowd in It was as if a black sac in his mind were bulging threatening to spew noxious images up from his subconscious and into the mental field of vision commanded by his rational waking mindand if that happened all at once it would drive him mad He tried to push them back and succeeded but not before he heard a voiceit was as if someone buried alive had cried out from the ground It was Eddie Kaspbraks voice You saved my life Bill Those big boys they drive me bugshit Sometimes I think they really want to kill me Bill looked down at them The flesh there had humped into gooseflesh Not little bumps but huge white knobs like insect eggs They both stared saying nothing as if looking at an interesting museum exhibit The goosebumps slowly melted away In the silence that followed Audra said And I know one other thing Someone called you this morning from the States and said you have to leave me He got up looked briefly at the liquor bottles then went into the kitchen and came back with a glass of orange juice He said You know I had a brother and you know he died but you dont know he was murdered Tell you He laughed that barking sound again I dont know We were living in Derry then There had been a flood but it was mostly over and George was bored I was sick in bed with the flu He wanted me to make him a boat out of a sheet of newspaper I knew how from daycamp the year before He said he was going to sail it down the gutters on Witcham Street and Jackson Street because they were still full of water So I made him the boat and he thanked me and he went out and that was the last time I ever saw my brother George alive If I hadnt had the flu maybe I could have saved him He paused right palm rubbing at his left cheek as if testing for beardstubble His eyes magnified by the lenses of his glasses looked thoughtful but he was not looking at her It happened right there on Witcham Street not too far from the intersection with Jackson Whoever killed him pulled his left arm off the way a secondgrader would pull a wing off a fly Medical examiner said he either died of shock or bloodloss Far as I could ever see it didnt make a dimes worth of difference which it was I imagine you wonder why I never told you The truth is I wonder myself Here weve been married eleven years and until today you never knew what happened to Georgie I know about your whole familyeven your aunts and uncles I know your grandfather died in his garage in Iowa City frigging around with his chainsaw while he was drunk I know those things because married people no matter how busy they are get to know almost everything after awhile And if they get really bored and stop listening they pick it up anywayby osmosis Or do you think Im wrong And weve always been able to talk to each other havent we I mean neither of us got so bored it ever had to be osmosis right Come on Audra You know everything thats happened to me over the last eleven years of my life Every deal every idea every cold every friend every guy that ever did me wrong or tried to You know I slept with Susan Browne You know that sometimes I get maudlin when I drink and play the records too loud Especially the Grateful Dead she said and he laughed This time she smiled back You know the most important stuff toothe things I hope for Yes I think so But this She paused shook her head thought for a moment How much does this call have to do with your brother Bill Let me get to it ia my own way Dont try to rush me into the center of it or youll have me committed Its so big and so so quaintly awful that Im trying to sort of creep up on it You see it never occurred to me to tell you about Georgie She looked at him frowned shook her head faintlyI dont understand What Im trying to tell you Audra is that I havent even thought of George in twenty years or more I repeated a fact he said That was all His name was a word It cast no shadow at all in my mind But I think maybe it cast a shadow over your dreams Audra said Her voice was very quiet I suppose you could be right he said In fact youre almost surely right But dreams you dont remember dont really count do they Are you really telling me you never thought of him at all She shook her head frankly disbelieving Not even the horrible way he died You asked me before we were married if I had any brothers or sisters and I said I had a brother who died when I was a kid You knew my parents were gone and youve got so much family that it took up your entire field of attention But thats not all It isnt just George thats been in that black hole I havent thought of Derry itself in twenty years Not the people I chummed withEddie Kaspbrak and Richie the Mouth Stan Uris Bev Marsh He ran his hands through his hair and laughed shakily Its like having a case of amnesia so bad you dont know youve got it And when Mike Hanlon called Another kid that we chummed withthat I chummed with after Georgie died Of course hes no kid anymore None of us are That was Mike on the phone transatlantic cable He said Hellohave I reached the Denbrough residence and I said yes and he said Bill Is that you and I said yes and he said This is Mike Hanlon It meant nothing to me Audra He might as well have been selling encyclopedias or Burl Ives records Then he said From Derry And when he said that it was like a door opened inside me and some horrible light shined out and I remembered who he was I remembered Georgie I remembered all the others All this happened Like that And I knew he was going to ask me to come Yeah He took his glasses off rubbed his eyes looked at her Never in her life had she seen a man who looked so frightened Back to Derry Because we promised he said and we did We did All of us Us kids We stood in the creek that ran through the Barrens and we held hands in a circle and we had cut our palms with a piece of glass so it was like a bunch of kids playing blood brothers only it was real He held his palms out to her and in the center of each she could see a closeset ladder of white lines that could have been scartissue She had held his handboth his handscountless times but she had never noticed these scars across his palms before They were faint yes but she would have believed Not the one where they had met although this second one formed a perfect bookend to that first one because it had been the wrap party at the end of the Pit of the Black Demon shoot It had been loud and drunk every inch the Topanga Canyon do Perhaps a little less bitchy than some of the other LA parties she had been to because the shoot had gone better than they had any right to expect and they all knew it For Audra Phillips it had gone even better because she had fallen in love with William Denbrough What was the name of the selfproclaimed palmist She couldnt remember now only that she had been one of the makeup mans two assistants She remembered the girl whipping off her blouse at some point in the party revealing a very filmy bra beneath and tying it over her head like a gypsys scarf High on pot and wine she had read palms for the rest of the evening or at least until she had passed out Audra could not remember now if the girls readings had been good or bad witty or stupid she had been pretty high herself that night What she did remember was that at one point the girl had grabbed Bills palm and her own and had declared them perfectly matched They were lifetwins she said She could remember watching more than a little jealous as the girl traced the lines on his palm with her exquisitely lacquered fingernailhow stupid that was in the weird LA film subculture where men patted womens fannies as routinely as New York men pecked their cheeks But there had been something intimate and lingering about that tracery There had been no little white scars on Bills palms then She had been watching the charade with a jealous lovers eye and she was sure of the memory Sure of the fact He nodded Youre right They werent there then And although I cant absolutely swear to it I dont think they were there last night down at the Plow and Barrow Ralph and I were handwrestling for beers again and I think I would have noticed He grinned at her The grin was dry humorless and scared I think they came back when Mike Hanlon called Thats what I think Bill was looking at his hands stan did it he said Cut our palms with a sliver of Coke bottle I can remember it so clearly now He looked up at Audra and behind his glasses his eyes were hurt and puzzled I remember how that piece of glass flashed in the sun It was one of the new clear ones Before that Coke bottles used to be green you remember that She shook her head but he didnt see her He was still studying his palms I can remember Stan doing his own hands last pretending he was going to slash his wrists instead of just cut his palms a little I guess it was just some goof but I almost made a move on him to stop him Because for a second or two there he looked serious Bill dont she said in a low voice This time she had to steady the lighter in her right hand by grasping its wrist in her left like a policeman holding a gun on a shooting range scars cant come back They either are or arent You saw them before huh Is that what youre telling me Theyre very faint Audra said more sharply than she had intended We were all bleeding he said We were standing in the water not far from where Eddie Kaspbrak and Ben Hanscom and I built the dam that time God Bill he built the new BBC communications center Theyre still arguing whether its a dream or an abortion Well I dont know if its the same guy or not It doesnt seem likely but I guess it could be The Ben I knew was great at building stuff We all stood there and I was holding Bev Marshs left hand in my right and Richie Toziers right hand in my left We stood out there in the water like something out of a Southern baptism after a tent meeting and I remember I could see the Derry Standpipe on the horizon It looked as white as you imagine the robes of the archangels must be and we promised we swore that if it wasnt over that if it ever started to happen again wed go back And wed do it again And stop it Forever Stop what she cried suddenly furious with him stop what What the fuck are you talking about I wish you wouldnt aaask Bill began and then stopped She saw an expression of bemused horror spread over his face like a stain Give me a cigarette She passed him the pack He lit one She had never seen him smoke a cigarette Yes Back then You said I was the only man in LA you ever knew who dared to speak slowly The truth is I didnt dare talk fast It wasnt reflection It wasnt deliberation It wasnt wisdom All reformed stutterers speak very slowly Its one of the tricks you learn like thinking of your middle name just before you introduce yourself because stutterers have more trouble with nouns than with any other words and the one word in all the world that gives them the most trouble is their own first name Stuttered She smiled a small smile as if he had told a joke and she had missed the point Until Georgie died I stuttered moderately Bill said and already he had begun to hear words double in his mind as if they were infinitesimally separated in time the words came out smoothly in his ordinary slow and cadenced way but in his mind he heard words like Georgie and moderately overlap becoming JuhJuhGeorgie and mmoderately I mean I had some really bad momentsusually when I was called on in class and especially if I really knew the answer and wanted to give itbut mostly I got by After George died it got a lot worse Then around the age of fourteen or fifteen things started to get better again I went to Chevrus High in Portland and there was a speech therapist there Mrs Thomas who was really great She taught me some good tricks Like thinking of my middle name just before I said Hi Im Bill Denbrough out loud I was taking French and she taught me to switch to French if I got badly stuck on a word So if youre standing there feeling like the worlds grandest asshole saying thththis buhbuhbuhbuh over and over like a broken record you switched over to French and ce livre would come flowing off your tongue Worked every time And as soon as you said it in French you could come back to English and say this book with no problem at all If you got stuck on an sword like ship or skate or slum you could lisp it thip thkate thlum No stutter All of that helped but mostly it was just forgetting Derry and everything that happened there Because thats when the forgetting happened When we were living in Portland and I was going to Chevrus I didnt forget everything at once but looking back now Id have to say it happened over a remarkably short period of time Maybe no more than four months My stutter and my memories faded out together Someone washed the blackboard and all the old equations went away He drank what was left of his juice When I stuttered on ask a few seconds ago that was the first time in maybe twentyone years No I guess theres no way to convince a person of that but its true Stutterings funny Audra Spooky On one level youre not even aware its happening But its also something you can hear in your mind Its like part of your head is working an instant ahead of the rest Or one of those reverb systems kids used to put in their jalopies back in the fifties when the sound in the rear speaker would come just a split second aafter the sound in the front sspeaker He got up and walked restlessly around the room He looked tired and she thought with some unease of how hard he had worked over the last thirteen years or so as if it might be possible to justify the moderateness of his talent by working furiously almost nonstop She found herself having a very uneasy thought and tried to push it away but it wouldnt go Suppose Bills call had really been from Ralph Foster inviting him down to the Plow and Barrow for an hour of armwrestling or backgammon or maybe from Freddie Firestone the producer of Attic Room on some problem or other Perhaps even a wrongring as the veddy British doctors wife down the lane put it Why to the idea that all this DerryMike Hanlon business was nothing but a hallucination A hallucination brought on by an incipient nervous breakdown But the scars Audrahow do you explain the scars Hes right They werent there and now they are Thats the truth and you know it Tell me the rest she said Who killed your brother George What did you and these other children do What did you promise He went to her knelt before her like an oldfashioned suitor about to propose marriage and took her hands I think I could tell you he said softly I think that if I really wanted to I could Most of it I dont remember even now but once I started talking it would come I can sense those memories waiting to be born Theyre like clouds filled with rain Only this rain would be very dirty The plants that grew after a rain like that would be monsters Maybe I can face that with the others Mike said he called them all He thinks theyll all come except maybe for Stan He said Stan sounded strange It all sounds strange to me Youre frightening me very badly Bill Im sorry he said and kissed her It was like getting a kiss from an utter stranger She found herself hating this man Mike Hanlon I thought I ought to explain as much as I could I thought that would be better than just creeping off into the night I suppose some of them may do just that But I have to go And I think Stan will be there no matter how strange he sounded Or maybe thats just because I cant imagine not going myself Bill shook his head slowly I could tell you that but it would be a lie I loved him I know how strange that must sound after telling you I havent thought of him in twenty years or so but I loved the hell out of that kid He smiled a little He was a spasmoid but I loved him You know But it isnt George I cant explain what it is I I feel like a bird must feel when fall comes and it knows somehow it just knows it has to fly home Its instinct babe and I guess I believe instincts the iron skeleton under all our ideas of free will Unless youre willing to take the pipe or eat the gun or take a long walk off a short dock you cant say no to some things You cant refuse to pick up your option because there is no option You cant stop it from happening any more than you could stand at home plate with a bat in your hand and let a fastball hit you I have to go That promise its in my mind like a fuhfishhook She stood up and walked herself carefully to him she felt very fragile as if she might break She put a hand on his shoulder and turned him to her The expression of horror that dawned on his face thennot horror of her but for herwas so naked that she stepped back really afraid for the first time No he said dont think of that Audra Dont you ever think of that Youre not going within three thousand miles of Derry I think Derrys going to be a very bad place to be during the next couple of weeks Youre going to stay here and carry on and make all the excuses for me you have to Now promise me that Should I promise she asked her eyes never leaving his should I Bill Should I You made a promise and look what its got you into And me as well since Im your wife and I love you His big hands tightened painfully on her shoulders Promise me Promise PPuhPuhPruhhuh And she could not stand that that broken word caught in his mouth like a gaffed and wriggling fish I promise okay I promise She burst into tears Are you happy now Jesus Youre crazy the whole thing is crazy but I promise He put an arm around her and led her to the couch Brought her a brandy She sipped at it getting herself under control a little at a time Today he said Concorde I can just make it if I drive to Heathrow instead of taking the train Freddie wanted me onset after ranch You go on ahead at nine and you dont know anything you see Ill be in New York before anything shows up funny And in Derry before sundown with the right ccconnections He put an arm around her and held her tightly but he never answered her question How many human eyes had snatched glimpses of their secret anatomies down the passage of years The segment below and all other Interlude segments are drawn from derry An Unauthorized Town History by Michael Hanlon This is an unpublished set of notes and accompanying fragments of manuscript which read almost like diary entries found in the Derry Public Library vault The title given is the one written on the cover of the looseleaf binder in which these notes were kept prior to their appearance here The author however refers to the work several times within his own notes as derry A Look Through Hells Back Door One supposes the thought of popular publication had done more than cross Mr Hanlons mind Not just a single building in that city or the corner of a single street or a single basketball court in a single pocketpark the netless basket jutting out at sunset like some obscure and bloody instrument of torture not just one area Haunting Persistently recurring to the mind difficult to forget Ditto Funk and Friend To haunt To appear or recur often especially as a ghost Butand listen A place often visited resort den hangout Italics are of course mine And one more This one like the last is a definition of haunt as a noun and its the one that really scares me A feeding place for animals Like the animals that beat up Adrian Mellon and then threw him over the bridge You know its sort of interestingI didnt know it was possible for a man to become as frightened as I have become since the Adrian Mellon business and still live let alone function Its as if Ive fallen into a story and everyone knows youre not supposed to feel this afraid until the end of the story when the haunter of the dark finally comes out of the woodwork to feed on you of course But if this is a story its not one of those classic screamers by Lovecraft or Bradbury or Poe I know you seenot everything but a lot I didnt just start when I opened the Derry News one day last September read the transcript of the Unwin boys preliminary hearing and realized that the clown who killed George Denbrough might well be back again I actually started around I think that is when some part of me which had been asleep woke up knowing that Its time might be coming round again Or maybe it was the voice of the Turtle Yes I rather think it was that I know its what Bill Denbrough would believe I discovered news of old horrors in old books read intelligence of old atrocities in old periodicals always in the back of my mind every day a bit louder I heard the seashell drone of some growing coalescing force I seemed to smell the bitter ozone aroma of lightningstocome I began making notes for a book I will almost certainly not live to write And at the same time I went on with my life On one level of my mind I was and am living with the most grotesque capering horrors on another I have continued to live the mundane life of a smallcity librarian I shelve books I make out library cards for new patrons I turn off the microfilm readers careless users sometimes leave on I joke with Carole Danner about how much I would like to go to bed with her and she jokes back about how much shed like to go to bed with me and both of us know that shes really joking and Im really not just as both of us know that she wont stay in a little place like Derry for long and I will be here until I die taping torn pages in Business Week sitting down at monthly acquisition meetings with my pipe in one hand and a stack of Library Journals in the other and waking in the middle of the night with my fists jammed against my mouth to keep in the screams The gothic conventions are all wrong My hair has not turned white I do not sleepwalk I have not begun to make cryptic comments or to carry a planchette around in my sportcoat pocket I think I laugh a little more thats all and sometimes it must seem a little shrill and strange because sometimes people look at me oddly when I laugh Part of methe part Bill would call the voice of the Turtlesays I should call them all tonight But am I even now completely sure Do I want to be completely sure Noof course not But God what happened to Adrian Mellon is so much like what happened to Stuttering Bills brother George in the fail of If it has started again I will call them Ill have to But not yet Its too early anyway Last time it began slowly and didnt really get going until the summer of So I wait And fill up the waiting with words in this notebook and long moments of looking into the mirror to see the stranger the boy became The boys face was bookish and timid the mans face is the face of a bank teller in a Western movie the fellow who never has any lines the one who just gets to put his hands up and look scared when the robbers come in And if the script calls for anyone to get shot by the bad guys hes the one Same old Mike A little starey in the eyes maybe and a little punchy from broken sleep but not sos youd notice without a good close look like kissingdistance close and I havent been that close to anyone in a very long time If you took a casual glance at me you might think Hes been reading too many books but thats all I doubt youd guess how hard the man with the mild banktellers face is now struggling just to hold on to hold on to his own mind If I have to make those calls it may kill some of them Thats one of the things Ive had to face on the long nights when sleep wont come nights when I lie there in bed wearing my conservative blue pajamas my spectacles neatly folded up and lying on the nighttable next to the glass of water I always put there in case I wake up thirsty in the night I lie there in the dark and I take small sips of the water and I wonder how muchor how littlethey remember I am somehow convinced that they dont remember any of it because they dont need to remember Im the only one that hears the voice of the Turtle the only one who remembers because Im the only one who stayed here in Derry And because theyre scattered to the four winds they have no way of knowing the identical patterns their lives have taken To bring them back to show them that pattern yes it might kill some of them It might kill all of them So I go over it and over it in my mind I go over them trying to recreate them as they were and as they might now be trying to decide which of them is the most vulnerable Richie Trashmouth Tozier I think sometimeshe was the one Criss Huggins and Bowers seemed to catch up with the most often in spite of the fact that Ben was so fat Bowers was the one Richie was the most scared ofthe one we were all the most scared ofbut the others used to really put the fear of God into him too If I call him out there in California would he see it as some horrible Return of the Big Bullies two from the grave and one from the madhouse in Juniper Hill where he raves to this day Sometimes I think Eddie was the weakest Eddie with his domineering tank of a mother and his terrible case of asthma Beverly She always tried to talk so tough but she was as scared as the rest of us Stuttering Bill faced with a horror that wont go away when he puts the cover on his typewriter Stan Uris Theres a guillotine blade hanging over their lives razorsharp but the more I think about it the more I think they dont know that blade is there Im the one with my hand on the lever I can pull it just by opening my telephone notebook and calling them one after the other Maybe I wont have to do it I hold on to the waning hope that Ive mistaken the rabbity cries of my own timid mind for the deeper truer voice of the Turtle After all what do I have Mellon in July A child found dead on Neibolt Street last October another found in Memorial Park in early December just before the first snowfall Maybe it was a tramp as the papers say Or a crazy whos since left Derry or killed himself out of remorse and selfdisgust as some of the books say the real Jack the Ripper may have done But the Albrecht girl was found directly across the street from that damned old house on Neibolt Street and she was killed on the same day as George Denbrough was twentyseven years before And then the Johnson boy found in Memorial Park with one of his legs missing below the knee Memorial Park is of course the home of the Derry Standpipe and the boy was found almost at its foot The Standpipe is within a shout of the Barrens the Standpipe is also where Stan Uris saw those boys Still it could all be nothing but smoke and mirages Could be Or coincidence Or perhaps something between the twoa kind of malefic echo Could that be I sense that it could be Here in Derry anything could be I think what was here before is still herethe thing that was here in and  the thing that was here in  and in  when the Black Spot was burned down by the Maine Legion of White Decency the thing that was here ha  and  and early at least until the Kitchener Ironworks exploded the thing that was here in  and  the thing that has shown up every twentyseven years or so Sometimes it comes a little sooner sometimes a little later but it always comes As one goes back the wrong notes are harder and harder to find because the records grow poorer and the mothholes in the narrative history of the area grow bigger But knowing where to lookand when to lookgoes a long way toward solving the problem It always comes back you see Soyes I think Ill have to make those calls I think it was meant to be us Somehow for some reason were the ones who have been elected to stop it forever Blind fate Blind luck Or is it that damned Turtle again Does it perhaps command as well as speak I dont know And I doubt if it matters All those years ago Bill said The Turtle cant help us and if it was true then it must be true now I think of us standing in the water hands clasped making that promise to come back if it ever started againstanding there almost like Druids in a ring our hands bleeding their own promise palm to palm A ritual that is perhaps as old as mankind itself an unknowing tap driven into the tree of all powerthe one that grows on the borderline between the land of all we know and that of all we suspect But Im doing my own Bill Denbrough here stuttering over the same ground again and again reciting a few facts and a lot of unpleasant and rather gaseous suppositions growing more and more obsessive with every paragraph No good Useless Dangerous even But it is so very hard to wait on events This notebook is supposed to be an effort to get beyond that obsession by widening the focus of my attentionafter all there is more to this story than six boys and one girl none of them happy none of them accepted by their peers who stumbled into a nightmare during one hot summer when Eisenhower was still President It is an attempt to pull the camera back a little if you willto see the whole city a place where nearly thirtyfive thousand people work and eat and sleep and copulate and shop and drive around and walk and go to school and go to jail and sometimes disappear into the dark To know what a place is I really do believe one has to know what it was And if I had to name a day when all of this really started again for me it would be the day in the early spring of when I went to see Albert Carson who died last summerat ninetyone he was full of years as well as honors He was head librarian here from  to  an incredible span but he was an incredible man and I felt that if anyone would know which history of this area was the best one to start with Albert Carson would I asked him my question as we sat on his porch and he gave me my answer speaking in a croakhe was already fighting the throatcancer which would eventually kill him Not one of them is worth a shit As you damn well know Oh Well Start with the Fricke and the Michaud Theyre supposed to be the best read them Christ no Throw em in the wastebasket Thats your first step Then read Buddinger Branson Buddinger was a damned sloppy researcher and afflicted with a terminal boner if half of what I heard when I was a kid was true but when it came to Derry his heart was in the right place He got most of the facts wrong but he got them wrong with feeling Hanlon I laughed a little and Carson grinned with his leathery lipsan expression of good humor that was actually a little frightening In that instant he looked like a vulture happily guarding a freshly killed animal waiting for it to reach exactly the right stage of tasty decomposition before beginning to dine When you finish with Buddinger read Ives Make notes on all the people he talked to Sandy Ives is still at the University of Maine Folklorist After you read him go see him Buy him a dinner Id take him to the Orinoka because dinner at the Orinoka seems to never end Pump him Fill up a notebook with names and addresses Talk to the oldtimers hes talked tothose that are still left there are a few of us ahhahhahhahand get some more names from them By then youll have all the place to stand youll need if youre half as bright as I think you are If you chase down enough people youll find out a few things that arent in the histories And you may find they disturb your sleep Right he asked in that whispery croak Whats right What does that word mean Is right pretty pictures of the Kenduskeag at sunset Kodachrome by soandso fstop suchandsuch If so then Derry is right because there are pretty pictures of it by the score Is right a damned committee of dryboxed old virgins to save the Governors Mansion or to put a commemorative plaque in front of the Standpipe If thats right then Derrys right as rain because weve got more than our share of old kittycats minding everybodys business Is right that ugly plastic statue of Paul Bunyan in front of City Center Oh if I had a truckful of napalm and my old Zippo lighter Id take care of that fucking thing I assure you but if ones aesthetic is broad enough to include plastic statues then Derry is right The question is what does right mean to you Hanlon Eh More to the point what does right not mean I could only shake my head He either knew or he didnt He would either tell or he wouldnt Do you mean the unpleasant stories you may hear or the ones you already know There are always unpleasant stories A towns history is like a rambling old mansion filled with rooms and cubbyholes and laundrychutes and garrets and all sorts of eccentric little hiding places not to mention an occasional secret passage or two If you go exploring Mansion Derry youll find all sorts of things Yes You may be sorry later but youll find them and once a thing is found it cant be unfound can it Some of the rooms are locked but there are keys there are keys You may come to think youve stumbled on the worst of Derrys secrets but there is always one more And one more And one more I think I shall have to ask you to excuse me just now My throat is very bad today Its time for my medicine and my nap In other words here is a knife and a fork my friend go see what you can cut with them I started with the Fricke history and the Michaud history I followed Carsons advice and threw them in the wastebasket but I read them first They were as bad as he had suggested I read the Buddinger history copied out the footnotes and chased them down That was more satisfactory but footnotes are peculiar things you knowlike footpaths twisting through a wild and anarchic country They split then they split again at any point you may take a wrong turn which leads you either to a bramblechoked dead end or into swampy quickmud If you find a footnote a libraryscience prof once told a class of which I was a part step on its head and kill it before it can breed They do breed and sometimes the breeding is a good thing but I think that more often it is not Those in Buddingers stiffly written A History of Old Derry Orono University of Maine Press wander through one hundred years worth of forgotten books and dusty masters dissertations in the fields of history and folklore through articles in defunct magazines and amid brainnumbing stacks of town reports and ledgers My conversations with Sandy Ives were more interesting His sources crossed Buddingers from time to time but a crossing was all it ever was Ives had spent a good part of his lifetime setting down oral historiesyarns in other wordsalmost verbatim a practice Branson Buddinger would undoubtedly have seen as taking the low road Ives had written a cycle of articles on Derry during the years Most of the oldtimers he talked to then were dead by the time I started my own investigations but they had sons daughters nephews cousins And of course one of the great true facts of the world is this for every oldtimer who dies theres a new oldtimer coming along And a good story never dies it is always passed down I sat on a lot of porches and back stoops drank a lot of tea Black Label beer homemade beer homemade rootbeer tapwater springwater I did a lot of listening and the wheels of my tapeplayer turned Both Buddinger and Ives agreed completely on one point the original party of white settlers numbered about three hundred They were English They had a charter and were formally known as the Derrie Company The land granted them covered what is today Derry most of Newport and little slices of the surrounding towns And in the year everyone in Derry Township just disappeared They were there in June of that yeara community which at that time numbered about three hundred and forty soulsbut come October they were gone The little village of wooden homes stood utterly deserted One of them which once stood roughly at the place where Witcham and Jackson Streets intersect today was burned to the ground The Michaud history states firmly that all of the villagers were slaughtered by Indians but there is no basissave the one burned housefor that idea More likely someones stove just got too hot and the house went up in flames Indian massacre Doubtful No bones no bodies Flood Not that year Disease No word of it in the surrounding towns They just disappeared All of them All three hundred and forty of them Without a trace So far as I know the only case remotely like it in American history is the disappearance of the colonists on Roanoke Island Virginia Every schoolchild in the country knows about that one but who knows about the Derry disappearance Not even the people who live here apparently I quizzed several juniorhigh students who are taking the required Mainehistory course and none of them knew a thing about it Then I checked the text Maine Then and Now There are better than forty index entries for Derry most of them concerning the boom years of the lumber industry Nothing about the disappearance of the original colonists and yet thatwhat shall I call itthat quiet fits the pattern too There is a kind of curtain of quiet which cloaks much of what has happened here and yet people do talk I guess nothing can stop people from talking But you have to listen hard and that is a rare skill I flatter myself that Ive developed it over the last four years If I havent then my aptitude for the job must be poor indeed because Ive had enough practice An old man told me about how his wife had heard voices speaking to her from the drain of her kitchen sink in the three weeks before their daughter diedthat was in the early winter of The girl he spoke of was one of the early victims in the murderspree which began with George Denbrough and did not end until the following summer A whole slew of voices all of em babblin together he told me He owned a Gulf station on Kansas Street and talked in between slow limping trips out to the pumps where he filled gastanks checked oillevels and wiped windshields said she spoke back once even though she was ascairt Leaned right over the dram she did and hollered down into it Who the hell are you she calls Whats your name And all these voices answered back she saidgrunts and babbles and howls and yips screams and laughin dont you know And she said they were sayin what the possessed man said to Jesus Our name is Legion they said She wouldnt go near that sink for two years For them two years Id spend twelve hours a day down here bustin my hump then have to go home and warsh all the damn dishes He was drinking a can of Pepsi from the machine outside the office door a man of seventytwo or three in faded gray work fatigues rivers of wrinkles flowing down from the corners of his eyes and mouth By now you probly think Im as crazy as a bedbug he said but Ill tell you sumpin else if youll turn off y whirligig there I turned off my taperecorder and smiled at him Considering some of the things Ive heard over the last couple of years youd have to go a fair country distance to convince me youre crazy I said He smiled back but there was no humor in it I was doin the dishes one night same as usualthis was in the fall of after things had settled down again My wife was upstair sleepin Betty was the only kid God ever saw fit to give us and after she was killed my wife spent a lot of her time sleepin Anyway I pulled the plug and the water started runnin out of the sink You know the sound real soapy water makes when it goes down the drain Kind of a suckin sound it is It was makin that noise but I wasnt thinkin about it only about goin out and choppin some kindlin in the shed and just as that sound started to die off I heard my daughter down in there I heard Betty somewhere down in those friggin pipes Laughin She was somewheres down there in the dark laughin Only it sounded more like she was screamin once you listened a bit Or both Screamin and laughin down there in the pipes Thats the only time I ever heard anything like that Maybe I just imagined it But I dont think so He looked at me and I looked at him The light falling through the dirty plateglass windows onto his face filled him up with years made him look as ancient as Methuselah I remember how cold I felt at that moment how cold You think Im storying you along the old man asked me the old man who would have been just about fortyfive in the old man to whom God had given a single daughter Betty Ripsom by name Betty had been found on Outer Jackson Street just after Christmas of that year frozen her remains ripped wide open No I said I dont think youre just storying me along Mr Ripsom And youre tellin the truth too he said with a land of wonder I can see it on yface I think he meant to tell me something more then but the bell behind us dinged sharply as a car rolled over the hose on the tarmac and pulled up to the pumps When the bell rang both of us jumped and I uttered a thin little cry Ripsom got to his feet and limped out to the car wiping his hands on a ball of waste When he came back in he looked at me as though I were a rather unsavory stranger who had just happened to wander in off the street I made my goodbyes and left Buddinger and Ives agree on some tiling else things really are not right here in Derry things in Derry have never been right I saw Albert Carson for the last time a scant month before he died His throat had gotten much worse all he could manage was a hissing little whisper still thinking about writing a history of Derry Hanlon Still toying with the idea I said but I had of course never planned to write a history of the townshipnot exactlyand I think he knew it It would take you twenty years he whispered and no one would read it No one would want to read it Let it go Hanlon Of course I had known thatbut only because people always talk and I had learned to listen The article in the News had called it a falling accident and it was true that Branson Buddinger had taken a fall What the News neglected to mention was that he fell from a stool in his closet and he had a noose around his neck at the time Oh yes Carson whispered I know Every twentysix or twentyseven years Buddinger knew too A lot of the oldtimers do although that is one thing they wont talk about even if you load them up with booze Let it go Hanlon He reached out with one birdclaw hand He closed it around my wrist and I could feel the hot cancer that was loose and raving through his body eating anything and everything left that was still good to eatnot that there could have been much by that time Albert Carsons cupboards were almost bare Michaelthis is nothing you want to mess into There are things here in Derry that bite Let it go Let it go Then beware he said Suddenly the huge and frightened eyes of a child were looking out of his dying oldmans face Beware My home town Named after the county of the same name in Ireland I was born here in Derry Home Hospital attended Derry Elementary School went to junior high at Ninth Street Middle School to high school at Derry High I went to the University of Maineaint in Derry but its just down the rud the oldtimers sayand then I came right back here To the Derry Public Library I am a smalltown man living a smalltown life one among millions In a crew of lumber jacks found the remains of another crew that had spent the winter snowed in at a camp on the Upper Kenduskeagat the tip of what the kids still call the Barrens There were nine of them in all all nine hacked to pieces Heads had rolled not to mention arms a foot or two and a mans penis had been nailed to one wall of the cabin In John Markson killed his entire family with poison and then sitting in the middle of the circle he had made with their corpses he gobbled an entire whitenightshade mushroom His death agonies must have been intense The town constable who found him wrote in his report that at first he believed the corpse was grinning at him he wrote of Marksons awful white smile The white smile was an entire mouthful of the killer mushroom Markson had gone on eating even as the cramps and the excruciating muscle spasms must have been wracking his dying body On Easter Sunday the owners of the Kitchener Ironworks which stood where the brandspankingnew Derry Mall now stands held an Easteregg hunt for all the good children of Derry The hunt took place in the huge Ironworks building Dangerous areas were closed off and employees volunteered their time to stand guard and make sure no adventurous boy or girl decided to duck under the barriers and explore Five hundred chocolate Easter eggs wrapped in gay ribbons were hidden about the rest of the works According to Buddinger there was at least one child present for each of those eggs They ran giggling and whooping and yelling through the Sundaysilent Ironworks finding the eggs under the giant tippervats inside the desk drawers of the foreman balanced between the great rusty teeth of gearwheels inside the molds on the third floor in the old photographs these molds look like cupcake tins from some giants kitchen Three generations of Kitcheners were there to watch the gay riot and to award prizes at the end of the hunt which was to come at four oclock whether all the eggs had been found or not The end actually came fortyfive minutes early at quarter past three That was when the Ironworks exploded Seventytwo people were pulled dead from the wreckage before the sun went down The final toll was a hundred and two Eightyeight of the dead were children On the following Wednesday while the city still lay in stunned silent contemplation of the tragedy a woman found the head of nineyearold Robert Dohay caught in the limbs of her backyard apple tree There was chocolate on the Dohay lads teeth and blood in his hair He was the last of the known dead Eight children and one adult were never accounted for It was the worst tragedy in Derrys history even worse than the fire at the Black Spot in  and it was never explained All four of the Ironworks boilers were shut down Not just banked shut down The murder rate in Derry is six times the murder rate of any other town of comparable size in New England I found my tentative conclusions in this matter so difficult to believe that I turned my figures over to one of the highschool hackers who spends what time he doesnt spend in front of his Commodore here in the library He went several steps furtherscratch a hacker find an overachieverby adding another dozen small cities to what he called the statpool and presenting me with a computergenerated bar graph where Derry slicks out like a sore thumb People must have wicked short tempers here Mr Hanlon was his only comment I didnt reply If I had I might have told him that something in Derry has a wicked short temper anyway Here in Derry children disappear unexplained and unfound at the rate of forty to sixty a year Most are teenagers They are assumed to be runaways I suppose some of them even are And during what Albert Carson would undoubtedly have called the time of the cycle the rate of disappearance shoots nearly out of sight In the year for instancethe year the Black Spot burnedthere were better than one hundred and seventy child disappearances in Derryand you must remember that these are only the disappearances which were reported to the police and thus documented Nothing surprising about it the current Chief of Police told me when I showed him the statistic It was the Depression Most of em probably got tired of eating potato soup or going flat hungry at home and went off riding the rods looking for something better During a hundred and twentyseven children ranging in age from three to nineteen were reported missing in Derry Was there a Depression in  I asked Chief Rademacher No he said But people move around a lot Hanlon Kids in particular get itchy feet Have a fight with the folks about coming in late after a date and boom theyre gone I showed Chief Rademacher the picture of Chad Lowe which had appeared in the Derry News in April You think this one ran away after a fight with his folks about coming in late Chief Rademacher He was three and a half when he dropped out of sight Rademacher fixed me with a sour glance and told me it sure had been nice talking with me but if there was nothing else he was busy I left Often visited by ghosts or spirits as in the pipes under the sink to appear or recur often as every twentyfive twentysix or twentyseven years a feeding place for animals as in the cases of George Denbrough Adrian Mellon Betty Ripsom the Albrecht girl the Johnson boy A feeding place for animals Yes thats the one that haunts me If anything else happensanything at allIll make the calls Ill have to In the meantime I have my suppositions my broken rest and my memoriesmy damned memories Oh and one other thingI have this notebook dont I The wall I wail to And here I sit my hand shaking so badly I can hardly write in it here I sit in the deserted library after closing listening to faint sounds in the dark stacks watching the shadows thrown by the dim yellow globes to make sure they dont move dont change I put my free hand on it let it slide down touch the holes in the dial that could put me in touch with all of them my old pals Would we come out of the black if we went in a second time Around PM one of the stews serving first class on the OmahatoChicago runUnited Airliness flight gets one hell of a shock She thinks for a few moments that the man in A has died When he boarded at Omaha she thought to herself Oh boy here comes trouble Hes just as drunk as a lord The stink of whiskey around his head reminded her fleetingly of the cloud of dust that always surrounds the dirty little boy in the Peanuts stripPig Pen his name is She was nervous about First Service which is the booze service She was sure he would ask for a drinkand probably a double Then she would have to decide whether or not to serve him Also just to add to the fun there have been thunderstorms all along the route tonight and she is quite sure that at some point the man a lanky guy dressed in jeans and chambray would begin upchucking But when First Service came along the tall man ordered nothing more than a glass of club soda just as polite as you could want His service light has not gone on and the stew forgets all about him soon enough because the flight is a busy one The flight is in fact the kind you want to forget as soon as its over one of those during which you just mightif you had timehave a few questions about the possibility of your own survival United slaloms between the ugly pockets of thunder and lightning like a good skier going downhill The air is very rough The passengers exclaim and make uneasy jokes about the lightning they can see flickering on and off in the thick pillars of cloud around the plane Mommy is God taking pictures of the angels a little boy asks and his mother who is looking rather green laughs shakily First Service turns out to be the only service on  that night The seatbelt sign goes on twenty minutes into the flight and stays on All the same the stewardesses stay in the aisles answering the callbuttons which go off like strings of politesociety firecrackers Ralph is busy tonight the head stew says to her as they pass in the aisle the head stew is going back to tourist with a fresh supply of airsick bags It is halfcode halfjoke Ralph is always busy on bumpy flights The plane lurches someone cries out softly the stewardess turns a bit and puts out a hand to catch her balance and looks directly into the staring sightless eyes of the man in A Oh my dear God hes dead she thinks The liquor before he got on then the bumps his heart scared to death The lanky mans eyes are on hers but they are not seeing her They do not move They are perfectly glazed Surely they are the eyes of a dead man The stew turns away from that awful gaze her own heart pumping away in her throat at a runaway rate wondering what to do how to proceed and thanking God that at least the man has no seatmate to perhaps scream and start a panic She decides she will have to notify first the head stew and then the male crew up front Perhaps they can wrap a blanket around him and close his eyes The pilot will keep the belt light on even if the air smooths out so no one can come forward to use the John and when the other passengers deplane theyll think hes just asleep These thoughts go through her mind rapidly and she turns back for a confirming look The dead sightless eyes fix upon hers and then the corpse picks up his glass of club soda and sips from it Just then the plane staggers again tilts and the stews little scream of surprise is lost in other heartier cries of fear The mans eyes move thennot much but enough so she understands that he is alive and seeing her And she thinks Why I thought when he got on that he was in his midfifties but hes nowhere near that old in spite of the graying hair She goes to him although she can hear the impatient chime of callbuttons behind her Ralph is indeed busy tonight after their perfectly safe landing at OHare thirty minutes from now the stews will dispose of over seventy airsick bags Everything okay sir she asks smiling The smile feels false unreal Everything is fine and well the lanky man says She glances at the firstclass stub tacked into the little slot on his seatback and sees that his name is Hanscom Fine and well But its a bit bumpy tonight isnt it Youve got your work cut out for you I think Dont bother with me ImHe offers her a ghastly smile a smile that makes her think of scarecrows flapping in dead November fields Im fine and well I was thinking of the old days he says I only realized earlier tonight that there were such things as old days at least as far as I myself am concerned I was thinking about a dam I built with some friends of mine Ben Hanscom says The first friends I ever had I guess They were building the dam when I He stops looks startled then laughs It is an honest laugh almost the carefree laugh of a boy and it sounds very odd in this jouncing bucking planewhen I dropped in on them And thats almost literally what I did Anyhow they were making a helluva mess with that dam I remember that Excuse me sirI ought to get about my appointed rounds again She hurries away glad to be rid of that gazethat deadly almost hypnotic gaze Ben Hanscom turns his head to the window and looks out Lightning goes off inside huge thunderheads nine miles off the starboard wing In the stutterflashes of light the clouds look like huge transparent brains filled with bad thoughts He feels in the pocket of his vest but the silver dollars are gone Out of his pocket and into Ricky Lees Suddenly he wishes he had saved at least one of them It might have come in handy Of course you could go down to any bankat least when you werent bumping around at twentyseven thousand feet you couldand get a handful of silver dollars but you couldnt do anything with the lousy copper sandwiches the government was trying to pass off as real coins these days And for werewolves and vampires and all manner of things that squirm by starlight it was silver you wanted honest silver You needed silver to stop a monster You needed He closed his eyes The air around him was full of chimes The plane rocked and rolled and bumped and the air was full of chimes Chimes It was bells it was the bell the bell of all bells the one you waited for all year once the new wore off school again and that always happened by the end of the first week The bell the one that signalled freedom again the apotheosis of all school bells Ben Hanscom sits in his firstclass seat suspended amid the thunders at twentyseven thousand feet his face turned to the window and he feels the wall of time grow suddenly thin some terriblewonderful peristalsis has begun to take place He thinks My God I am being digested by my own past The lightning plays fitfully across his face and although he does not know it the day has just turned May th has become May th over the dark and stormy country that is western Illinois tonight farmers backsore with plantings sleep like the dead below and dream their quicksilver dreams and who knows what may move in their barns and their cellars and their fields as the lightning walks and the thunder talks No one knows these things they know only that power is loose in the night and the air is crazy with the big volts of the storm But its bells at twentyseven thousand feet as the plane breaks into the clear again as its motion steadies again it is bells it is the bell as Ben Hanscom sleeps and as he sleeps the wall between past and present disappears completely and he tumbles backward through years like a man falling down a deep wellWellss Time Traveller perhaps falling with a broken iron rung in one hand down and down into the land of the Morlocks where machines pound on and on in the tunnels of the night Its   and suddenly he is here here in June of  bright summerlight is everywhere and behind sleeping eyelids Ben Hanscoms pupils contract at the command of his dreaming brain which sees not the darkness which lies over western Illinois but the bright sunlight of a June day in Derry Maine twentyseven yean ago The sound of the bell went burring up and down the halls of Derry School a big brick building which stood on Jackson Street and at its sound the children in Ben Hanscoms fifthgrade classroom raised a spontaneous cheerand Mrs Douglas usually the strictest of teachers made no effort to quell them Perhaps she knew it would have been impossible Children she called when the cheer died May I have your attention for a final moment Now a babble of excited chatter mixed with a few groans rose in the classroom Mrs Douglas was holding their report cards in her hand I sure hope I pass Sally Mueller said chirpily to Bev Marsh who sat in the next row Sally was bright pretty vivacious Bev was also pretty but there was nothing vivacious about her this afternoon last day of school or not She sat looking moodily down at her pennyloafers There was a fading yellow bruise on one of her cheeks I dont give a shit if I do or not Bev said Sally sniffed Ladies dont use such language the sniff said Then she turned to Greta Bowie It had probably only been the excitement of the bell signalling the end of another schoolyear that had caused Sally to slip and speak to Beverly anyhow Ben thought Sally Mueller and Greta Bowie both came from rich families with houses on West Broadway while Bev came to school from one of those shimmy apartment buildings on Lower Main Street Lower Main Street and West Broadway were only a mile and a half apart but even a kid like Ben knew that the real distance was like the distance between Earth and the planet Pluto All you had to do was look at Beverly Marshs cheap sweater her toobig skirt that probably came from the Salvation Army thriftbox and her scuffed pennyloafers to know just how far one was from the other But Ben still liked Beverly bettera lot better Sally and Greta had nice clothes and he guessed they probably had their hair permed or waved or something every month or so but he didnt think that changed the basic facts at all They could get their hair permed every day and theyd still be a couple of conceited snots He thought Beverly was nicer and much prettier although he never in a million years would have dared say such a thing to her But still sometimes in the heart of winter when the light outside seemed yellowsleepy like a cat curled up on a sofa when Mrs Douglas was droning on about mathematics how to carry down in long division or how to find the common denominator of two fractions so you could add them or reading the questions from Shining Bridges or talking about tin deposits in Paraguay on those days when it seemed that school would never end and it didnt matter if it didnt because all the world outside was slush on those days Ben would sometimes look sideways at Beverly stealing her face and his heart would both hurt desperately and somehow grow brighter at the same time He supposed he had a crush on her or was in love with her and that was why it was always Beverly he thought of when the Penguins came on the radio singing Earth Angelmy darling dear love you all the time  Yeah it was stupid all right sloppy as a used Kleenex but it was all right too because he would never tell He thought that fat boys were probably only allowed to love pretty girls inside If he told anyone how he felt not that he had anyone to tell that person would probably laugh until he had a heartattack And if he ever told Beverly she would either laugh herself bad or make retching noises of disgust worse Now please come up as soon as I call your name Paul Andersen Carla Bordeaux Greta Bowie Calvin Clark Cissy Clark As she called their names Mrs Douglass fifthgrade class came forward one by one except for the Clark twins who came together as always hand in hand indistinguishable except for the length of their whiteblonde hair and the fact that she wore a dress while he wore jeans took their buffcolored report cards with the American flag and the Pledge of Allegiance on the front and the Lords Prayer on the back walked sedately out of the classroom and then pounded down the hall to where the big front doors had been chocked open And then they simply ran out into summer and were gone some on bikes some skipping some riding invisible horses and slapping their hands against the sides of their thighs to manufacture hoofbeats some with arms slung about each other singing Mine eyes have seen the glory of the burning of the school to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic He rose stealing his last glance at Beverly Marsh for the summer or so he thought then and went forward to Mrs Douglass desk an elevenyearold kid with a can roughly the size of New Mexicosaid can packed into a pair of horrid new bluejeans that shone little darts of light from the copper rivets and went whsshtwhsshtwhssht as his big thighs brushed together His hips swung girlishly His stomach slid from side to side He was wearing a baggy sweatshirt although the day was warm He almost always wore baggy sweatshirts because he was deeply ashamed of his chest and had been since the first day of school after the Christmas vacation when he had worn one of the new Ivy League shuts his mother had given him and Belch Huggins who was a sixthgrader had cawed Hey you guys Lookit what Santy Claus brought Ben Hanscom for Christmas A big set of titties Belch had nearly collapsed with the deliciousness of his wit Others had laughed as wella few of them girls If a hole leading into the underworld had opened before him at that very moment Ben would have dropped into it without a sound or perhaps with the faintest murmur of gratitude Since that day he wore sweatshirts He had four of themthe baggy brown the baggy green and two baggy blues It was one of the few things on which he had managed to stand up to his mother one of the few lines he had ever in the course of his mostly complacent childhood felt compelled to draw in the dust If he had seen Beverly Marsh giggling with the others that day he supposed he would have died Its been a pleasure having you this year Benjamin Mrs Douglas said as A mocking falsetto wavered from somewhere at the back of the room sankooo Missus Dougwiss It was Henry Bowers of course Henry was in Bens fifthgrade class instead of in the sixth grade with his friends Belch Huggins and Victor Criss because he had been kept back the year before Ben had an idea that Bowers was going to stay back again His name had not been called when Mrs Douglas handed out the rankcards and that meant trouble Ben was uneasy about this because if Henry did stay back again Ben himself would be partly responsible and Henry knew it During the years final tests the week before Mrs Douglas had reseated them at random by drawing their names from a hat on her desk Ben had ended up sitting next to Henry Bowers in the last row As always Ben curled his arm around his paper and then bent close to it feeling the somehow comforting press of his gut against his desk licking his BeBop pencil occasionally for inspiration About halfway through Tuesdays examination which happened to be math a whisper drifted across the aisle to Ben It was as low and uncarrying and expert as the whisper of a veteran con passing a message in the prison exercise yard Let me copy Ben had looked to his left and directly into the black and furious eyes of Henry Bowers Henry was a big boy even for twelve His arms and legs were thick with farmmuscle His father who was reputed to be crazy had a little spread out at the end of Kansas Street near the Newport town line and Henry put in at least thirty hours a week hoeing weeding planting digging rocks cutting wood and reaping if there was anything to reap Henrys hair was cut in an angrylooking flattop short enough for the white of his scalp to show through He ButchWaxed the front with a tube he always carried in the hip pocket of his jeans and as a result the hair just above his forehead looked like the teeth of an oncoming powermower An odor of sweat and Juicy Fruit gum always hung about him He wore a pink motorcycle jacket with an eagle on the back to school Once a fourthgrader was unwise enough to laugh at that jacket Henry had turned on the little squirt Umber as a weasel and quick as an adder and doublepumped the squirt with one workgrimed fist The squirt lost three front teeth Henry got a twoweek vacation from school Ben had hoped with the unfocused yet burning hope of the downtrodden and terrorized that Henry would be expelled instead of suspended No such luck Bad pennies always turned up His suspension over Henry had swaggered back into the schoolyard balefully resplendent in his pink motorcycle jacket hair ButchWaxed so heavily that it seemed to scream up from his skull Both eyes bore the puffed colorful traces of the beating his crazy father had administered for fighting in the playyard The traces of the beating eventually faded for the kids who had to somehow coexist with Henry at Derry the lesson did not To the best of Bens knowledge no one had said anything about Henrys pink motorcycle jacket with the eagle on the back since then When he whispered grimly at Ben to let him copy three thoughts had gone skyrocketing through Bens mindwhich was every bit as lean and quick as his body was obesein a space of seconds The first was that if Mrs Douglas caught Henry cheating answers off his paper both of them would get zeros on their tests The second was that if he didnt let Henry copy Henry would almost surely catch him after school and administer the fabled doublepump to him probably with Huggins holding one of his arms and Criss holding the other These were the thoughts of a child and there was nothing surprising about that because he was a child The third and last thought however was more sophisticatedalmost adult He might get me all right But maybe I can keep out of his way for the last week of school Im pretty sure I can if I really try And hell forget over the summer I think Yeah Hes pretty stupid If he flunks this test maybe hell stay back again And if he stays back Ill get ahead of him I wont be in the same room with him anymore Ill get to junior high before he does I I might be free Let me copy Henry whispered again His black eyes were now blazing demanding Ben shook his head and curled his arm more tightly around his paper Ill get you fatboy Henry whispered a little louder now His paper was so far an utter blank save for his name He was desperate If he flunked his exams and stayed back again his father would beat his brains out You let me copy or Ill get you bad Ben shook his head again his jowls quivering He was scared but he was also determined He realized that for the first time in his life he had consciously committed himself to a course of action and that also frightened him although he didnt exactly know whyit would be long years before he would realize it was the coldbloodedness of his calculations the careful and pragmatic counting of the cost with its intimations of onrushing adulthood that had scared him even more than Henry had scared him Henry he might be able to dodge Adulthood where he would probably think in such a way almost all the time would get him in the end Is someone talking back there Mrs Douglas had said then very clearly If so I want it to stop right now Silence had prevailed for the next ten minutes young heads remained studiously bent over examination sheets which smelled of fragrant purple mimeograph ink and then Henrys whisper had floated across the aisle again thin just audible chilling in the calm assurance of its promise Youre dead fatboy Ben took his rankcard and escaped grateful to whatever gods there are for elevenyearold fatboys that Henry Bowers had not by virtue of alphabetical order been allowed to escape the classroom first so he could lay for Ben outside He did not run down the corridor like the other children He could run and quite fast for a kid his size but he was acutely aware of how funny he looked when he did He walked fast though and emerged from the cool booksmelling hall and into the bright June sunshine He stood with his face turned up into that sunshine for a moment grateful for its warmth and his freedom September was a million years from today The calendar might say something different but what the calendar said was a lie The summer would be much longer than the sum of its days and it belonged to him He felt as tall as the Standpipe and as wide as the whole town Someone bumped himbumped him hard Pleasant thoughts of the summer lying before him were driven from Bens mind as he tottered wildly for balance on the edge of the stone steps He grabbed the iron railing just in time to save himself from a nasty tumble Get out of my way you tub of guts It was Victor Criss his hair combed back in an Elvis pompadour and gleaming with Brylcreem He went down the steps and along the walk to the front gate hands in the pockets of his jeans shirtcollar turned up hoodstyle cleats on his engineer boots dragging and tapping Ben his heart still beating rapidly from his fright saw that Belch Huggins was standing across the street having a butt He raised a hand to Victor and passed him the cigarette when Victor joined him Victor took a drag handed it back to Belch then pointed to where Ben stood now halfway down the steps He said something and they both broke up Bens face flamed dully They always got you It was like fate or something You like this place so well youre gonna stand here all day a voice said at his elbow Ben turned and his face became hotter still It was Beverly Marsh her auburn hair a dazzling cloud around her head and upon her shoulders her eyes a lovely graygreen Her sweater pushed to her elbows was frayed around the neck and almost as baggy as Bens sweatshirt Too baggy certainly to tell if she was getting any chestworks yet but Ben didnt care when love comes before puberty it can come in waves so clear and so powerful that no one can stand against its simple imperative and Ben made no effort to do so now He simply gave in He felt both foolish and exalted as miserably embarrassed as he had ever been in his life and yet inarguably blessed These hopeless emotions mixed in a heady brew that left him feeling both sick and joyful No he croaked Guess not A large grin spread across his face He knew how idiotic it must look but he could not seem to pull it back Have Another croak He had to clear his throat and his blush deepened Have a nice summer Beverly She went quickly down the steps and Ben saw everything with his lovers eye the bright tartan of her skirt the bounce of her red hair against the back of her sweater her milky complexion a small healing cut across the back of one calf and for some reason this last caused another wave of feeling to sweep him so powerfully he had to grope for the railing again the feeling was huge inarticulate mercifully brief perhaps a sexual presignal meaningless to his body where the endocrine glands still slept almost without dreaming yet as bright as summer heatlightning a bright golden anklebracelet she wore just above her right loafer winking back the sun in brilliant little flashes A soundsome sort of soundescaped him He went down the steps like a feeble old man and stood at the bottom watching until she turned left and disappeared beyond the high hedge that separated the schoolyard from the sidewalk He only stood there for a moment and then while the kids were still streaming past in yelling running groups he remembered Henry Bowers and hurried around the building He crossed the littlekids playground running his fingers across the swingchains to make them jingle and stepping over the teetertotter boards He went out the much smaller gate which gave on Charter Street and headed off to the left never looking back at the stone pile where he had spent most of his weekdays over the last nine months He stuffed his rankcard in his back pocket and started to whistle He was wearing a pair of Keds but so far as he could tell their soles never touched the sidewalk for eight blocks or so School had let out just past noon his mother would not be home until at least six because on Fridays she went right to the Shop n Save after work The rest of the day was his He went down to McCarron Park for awhile and sat under a tree not doing anything but occasionally whispering I love Beverly Marsh under his breath feeling more lightheaded and romantic each time he said it At one point as a bunch of boys drifted into the park and began choosing up sides for a scratch baseball game he whispered the words Beverly Hanscom twice and then had to put his face into the grass until it cooled his burning cheeks Shortly after that he got up and headed across the park toward Costello Avenue A walk of five more blocks would take him to the Public Library which he supposed had been his destination all along He was almost out of the park when a sixthgrader named Peter Gordon saw him and yelled Hey tits Wanna play We need somebody to be rightfield There was an explosion of laughter Ben escaped it as fast as he could hunching his neck down into his collar like a turtle drawing into its shell Still he considered himself lucky all in all on another day the boys might have chased him maybe just to rank him out maybe to roll him in the dirt and see if he would cry Today they were too absorbed in getting the game goingwhether or not you could use fingers or get topsies when you threw the bat for first picks which team would get their guaranteed last ups all the rest Ben happily left them to the arcana preceding the first ballgame of the summer and went on his way Three blocks down Costello he spied something interesting perhaps even profitable under someones front hedge Glass gleamed through the ripped side of an old paper bag Ben hooked the bag out onto the sidewalk with his foot It seemed his luck really was in There were four beer bottles and four big soda bottles inside The biggies were worth a nickel each the Rheingolds two pennies Twentyeight cents under someones hedge just waiting for some kid to come along and scoff it up Some lucky kid Thats me Ben said happily having no idea what the rest of the day had in store He got moving again holding the bag by the bottom so it wouldnt break open The Costello Avenue Market was a block farther down the street and Ben turned in He swapped the bottles for cash and most of the cash for candy He stood at the pennycandy window pointing delighted as always by the ratcheting sound the sliding door made when the storekeeper slid it along its track which was lined with ballbearings He got five red licorice whips and five black ten rootbeer barrels two for a penny a nickel strip of buttons five to a row five rows on a nickel strip and you ate them right off the paper a packet of Likem Ade and a package of Pez for his PezGun at home Ben walked out with a small brown paper sack of candy in his hand and four cents in the right front pocket of his new jeans He looked at the brown bag with its load of sweetness and a thought suddenly tried to surface you keep eating this way Beverly Marsh is never going to look at you but it was an unpleasant thought and so he pushed it away It went easily enough this was a thought used to being banished If someone had asked him Ben are you lonely he would have looked at that someone with real surprise The question had never even occurred to him He had no friends but he had his books and his dreams he had his Revell models he had a gigantic set of Lincoln Logs and built all sorts of stuff with them His mother had exclaimed more than once that Bens Lincoln Logs houses looked better than some real ones that came from blueprints He had a pretty good Erector Set too He was hoping for the Super Set when his birthday came around in October With that one you could build a clock that really told time and a car with real gears in it Lonely he might have asked in return honestly foozled Huh What A child blind from birth doesnt even know hes blind until someone tells him Even then he has only the most academic idea of what blindness is only the formerly sighted have a real grip on the thing Ben Hanscom had no sense of being lonely because he had never been anything but If the condition had been new or more localized he might have understood but loneliness both encompassed his life and overreached it It simply was like his double jointed thumb or the funny little jag inside one of his front teeth the little jag his tongue began running over whenever he was nervous Beverly was a sweet dream the candy was a sweet reality The candy was his friend So he told the alien thought to take a hike and it went quietly without causing any fuss whatsoever And between the Costello Avenue Market and the library he gobbled all of the candy in the sack He honestly meant to save the Pez for watching TV that nighthe liked to load them into the little plastic PezGuns handgrip one by one liked to hear the accepting click of the small spring inside and liked most of all to shoot them into his mouth one by one like a kid committing suicide by sugar Whirlybirds was on tonight with Kenneth Tobey as the fearless helicopter pilot and Dragnet where the cases were true but the names had been changed to protect the innocent and his favorite cop show of all time Highway Patrol which starred Broderick Crawford as Highway Patrolman Dan Matthews Broderick Crawford was Bens personal hero Broderick Crawford was fast Broderick Crawford was mean Broderick Crawford took absolutely no shit from nobody and best of all Broderick Crawford was fat He arrived at the corner of Costello and Kansas Street where he crossed to the Public Library It was really two buildingsthe old stone structure in front built with lumberbaron money in and the new low sandstone building behind which housed the Childrens Library The adult library in front and the Childrens Library behind were connected by a glass corridor This close to downtown Kansas Street was oneway so Ben only looked in one directionrightbefore crossing If he had looked left he would have gotten a nasty shock Standing in the shade of a big old oak tree on the lawn of the Derry Community House a block down were Belch Huggins Victor Criss and Henry Bowers Henry watched the fat little prick scutter across the street his belly bouncing the cowlick at the back of his head springing back and forth like a goddam Slinky his ass wiggling like a girls inside his new bluejeans He estimated the distance between the three of them here on the Community House lawn and Hanscom and between Hanscom and the safety of the library He thought they could probably get him before he made it inside but Hanscom might start screaming He wouldnt put it past the little pansy If he did an adult might interfere and Henry wanted no interference The Douglas bitch had told Henry he had flunked both English and math She was passing him she said but he would have to take four weeks of summer makeup Henry would rather have stayed back If hed stayed back his father would have beaten him up once With Henry at school four hours a day for four weeks of the farms busiest season his father was apt to beat him up half a dozen times maybe even more He was reconciled to this grim future only because he intended to pass everything on to that fat little babyfag this afternoon They watched Ben open one of the big double doors and go inside and then they sat down and smoked cigarettes and told travellingsalesman jokes and waited for him to come back out Eventually Henry knew he would And when he did Henry was going to make him sorry he was ever born He loved the way it was always cool even on the hottest day of a long hot summer he loved its murmuring quiet broken only by occasional whispers the faint thud of a librarian stamping books and cards or the riffle of pages being turned in the Periodicals Room where the old men hung out reading newspapers which had been threaded into long sticks He loved the quality of the light which slanted through the high narrow windows in the afternoons or glowed in lazy pools thrown by the chainhung globes on winter evenings while the wind whined outside He liked the smell of the booksa spicy smell faintly fabulous He would sometimes walk through the adult stacks looking at the thousands of volumes and imagining a world of lives inside each one the way he sometimes walked along his street in the burning smokehazed twilight of a lateOctober afternoon the sun only a bitter orange line on the horizon imagining the lives going on behind all the windowspeople laughing or arguing or arranging flowers or feeding kids or pets or their own faces while they watched the boobtube He liked the way the glass corridor connecting the old building with the Childrens Library was always hot even in the winter unless there had been a couple of cloudy days Mrs Starrett the head childrens librarian told him that was caused by something called the greenhouse effect Ben had been delighted with the idea Years later he would build the hotly debated BBC communications center in London and the arguments might rage for a thousand years and still no one would know except for Ben himself that the communications center was nothing but the glass corridor of the Derry Public Library stood on end He liked the Childrens Library as well although it had none of the shadowy charm he felt in the old library with its globes and curving iron staircases too narrow for two people to pass upon themone always had to back up The Childrens Library was bright and sunny a little noisier in spite of the LETs BE QUIET SHALL WE signs that were posted around Most of the noise usually came from Poohs Corner where the little kids went to look at picturebooks When Ben came in today story hour had just begun there Miss Davies the pretty young librarian was reading The Three Billy Goats Gruff Miss Davies spoke in the low growling tones of the troll in the story Some of the little ones covered their mouths and giggled but most only watched her solemnly accepting the voice of the troll as they accepted the voices of their dreams and their grave eyes reflected the eternal fascination of the fairytale would the monster be bested or would it feed Bright posters were tacked everywhere Here was a good cartoon kid who had brushed his teeth until his mouth foamed like the muzzle of a mad dog here was a bad cartoon kid who was smoking cigarettes WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE SICK A LOT JUST LIKE MY DAD it said underneath here was a wonderful photograph of a billion tiny pinpoints of light flaring in darkness The motto beneath said There were invitations to JOIN THE SCOUTING EXPERIENCE A poster advancing the idea that THE GIRLS CLUBS OF TODAY BUILD THE WOMEN OF TOMORROW There were softball signup sheets and Community House Childrens Theater signup sheets And of course one inviting kids to JOIN THE SUMMER READING PROGRAM Ben was a big fan of the summer reading program You got a map of the United States when you signed up Then for every book you read and made a report on you got a state sticker to lick and put on your map The sticker came complete with info like the state bird the state flower the year admitted to the Union and what presidents if any had ever come from that state When you got all fortyeight stuck on your map you got a free book Helluva good deal Ben planned to do just as the poster suggested Waste no time sign up today Conspicuous amid this bright and amiable riot of color was a simple stark poster taped to the checkout deskno cartoons or fancy photographs here just black print on white posterpaper reading Just looking at it gave Ben a chill In the excitement of getting his rankcard worrying about Henry Bowers talking with Beverly and starting summer vacation he had forgotten all about the curfew and the murders People argued about how many there had been but everyone agreed that there had been at least four since last winterfive if you counted George Denbrough many held the opinion that the little Denbrough boys death must have been some kind of bizarre freak accident The first everyone was sure of was Betty Ripsom who had been found the day after Christmas in the area of turnpike construction on Outer Jackson Street The girl who was thirteen had been found mutilated and frozen into the muddy earth This had not been in the paper nor was it a thing any adult had spoken of to Ben It was just something he had picked up around the corners of overheard conversations About three and a half months later not long after the troutfishing season had begun a fisherman working the bank of a stream twenty miles east of Derry had hooked onto something he believed at first to be a stick It had turned out to be the hand wrist and first four inches of a girls forearm His hook had snagged this awful trophy by the web of flesh between the thumb and first finger The State Police had found the rest of Cheryl Lamonica seventy yards farther downstream caught in a tree that had fallen across the stream the previous winter It was only luck that the body had not been washed into the Penobscot and then out to sea in the spring runoff The Lamonica girl had been sixteen She was from Derry but did not attend school three years before she had given birth to a daughter Andrea She and her daughter lived at home with Cheryls parents Cheryl was a little wild sometimes but she was a good girl at heart her sobbing father had told police Andi keeps asking Wheres my mommy and I dont know what to tell her The girl had been reported missing five weeks before the body was found The police investigation of Cheryl Lamonicas death began with a logical enough assumption that she had been murdered by one of her boyfriends She had lots of boyfriends Many were from the air base up Bangor way They were nice boys most of them Cheryls mother said One of the nice boys had been a fortyyearold Air Force colonel with a wife and three children in New Mexico Another was currently serving time in Shawshank for armed robbery A boyfriend the police thought Or just possibly a stranger A sexfiend If it was a sexfiend he was apparently a fiend for boys as well In late April a juniorhigh teacher on a nature walk with his eighthgrade class had spied a pair of red sneakers and a pair of blue corduroy rompers protruding from the mouth of a culvert on Merit Street That end of Merit had been blocked off with sawhorses The asphalt had been bulldozed up the previous fall The turnpike extension would cross there as well on its way north to Bangor The body had been that of threeyearold Matthew Clements reported missing by his parents only the day before his picture had been on the front page of the Derry News a darkhaired little kid grinning brashly into the camera a Red Sox cap perched on his head The Clements family lived on Kansas Street all the way on the other side of town His mother so stunned by her grief that she seemed to exist in a glass ball of utter calm told police that Matty had been riding his tricycle up and down the sidewalk beside the house which stood on the corner of Kansas Street and Kossuth Lane She went to put her washing in the drier and when she next looked out the window to check on Matty he was gone There had only been his overturned trike on the grass between the sidewalk and the street One of the back wheels was still spinning lazily As she looked it came to a stop That was enough for Chief Borton He proposed the seven oclock curfew at a special session of the City Council the following evening it was adopted unanimously and went into effect the next day Small children were to be watched by a qualified adult at all times according to the story which reported the curfew in the News At Bens school there had been a special assembly a month ago The Chief went on stage hooked his thumbs into his gunbelt and assured the children they had nothing at all to worry about as long as they followed a few simple rules dont talk to strangers dont accept rides with people unless you know them well always remember that The Policeman Is Your Friend and obey the curfew Two weeks ago a boy Ben knew only vaguely he was in the other fifthgrade classroom at Derry Elementary had looked into one of the stormdrains out by Neibolt Street and had seen what looked like a lot of hair floating around in there This boy whose name was either Frankie or Freddy Ross or maybe Roth had been out prospecting for goodies with a gadget of his own invention which he called THE FABULOUS GUMSTICK When he talked about it you could tell he thought about it like that in capital letters and maybe neon as well THE FABULOUS GUMSTICK was a birch branch with a big wad of bubblegum stuck on the tip In his spare time Freddy or Frankie walked around Derry with it peering into sewers and drains Sometimes he saw moneypennies mostly but sometimes a dime or even a quarter he referred to these latter for some reason known only to him as quaymonsters Once the money was spotted FrankieorFreddy and THE FABULOUS GUMSTICK would swing into action One downward poke through the grating and the coin was as good as in his pocket Ben had heard rumors of FrankieorFreddy and his gum stick long before the kid had vaulted into the limelight by discovering the body of Veronica Grogan Hes really gross a kid named Richie Tozier had confided to Ben one day during activity period Tozier was a scrawny kid who wore glasses Ben thought that without them Tozier probably saw every bit as well as Mr Magoo his magnified eyes swam behind the thick lenses with an expression of perpetual surprise He also had huge front teeth that had earned him the nickname Bucky Beaver He was in the same fifthgrade class as FreddyorFrankie Pokes that gum stick of his down sewerdrains all day long and then chews the gum from the end of it at night FrankieorFreddy had worked THE FABULOUS GUMSTICK back and forth through the grate of the stormdrain believing hed found a wig He thought maybe he could dry it out and give it to his mother for her birthday or something After a few minutes of poking and prodding just as he was about to give up a face had floated out of the murky water in the plugged drain a face with dead leaves plastered to its white cheeks and dirt in its staring eyes Veronica Grogan had been in the fourth grade at the Neibolt Street Church School which was run by people Bens mother called the Christers She was buried on what would have been her tenth birthday After this most recent horror Arlene Hanscom had taken Ben into the living room one evening and sat beside him on the couch She picked up his hands and looked intently into his face Ben looked back feeling a little uneasy No Mamma Ben said feeling more uneasy than ever He hadnt the slightest idea what this was about He could not remember ever seeing his She fell silent for a long time then not looking at Ben but pensively out the window Ben wondered briefly if she had forgotten all about him She was a young woman stillonly thirtytwobut raising a boy by herself had put a mark on her She worked forty hours a week in the spoolandbale room at Starks Mills in Newport and after workdays when the dust and lint had been particularly bad she sometimes coughed so long and hard that Ben would become frightened On those nights he would lie awake for a long time looking through the window beside his bed into the darkness wondering what would become of him if she died He would be an orphan then he supposed He might become a State Kid he thought that meant you had to go live with farmers who made you work from sunup to sunset or he might be sent to the Bangor Orphan Asylum He tried to tell himself it was foolish to worry about such things but the telling did absolutely no good Nor was it just himself he was worried about he worried for her as well She was a hard woman his mamma and she insisted on having her own way about most things but she was a good mamma He loved her very much You know about these murders she said looking back at last At first people thought they were She hesitated over the next word never spoken in her sons presence before but the circumstances were unusual and she forced herself  sex crimes Maybe they were and maybe they werent Maybe theyre over and maybe theyre not No one can be sure of anything anymore except that some crazy man who preys on little children is out there Do you understand me Ben And you know what I mean when I say they may have been sex crimes He didntat least not exactlybut he nodded again If his mother felt she had to talk to him about the birds and bees as well as this other business he thought he would die of embarrassment I worry about you Ben I worry that Im not doing right by you Youre on your own a lot Too much I guess You Hush while Im talking to you she said and Ben hushed You have to be careful Benny Summers coming and I dont want to spoil your vacation but you have to be careful I want you in by suppertime every day What time do we eat supper Right with Eversharp So hear what Im saying if I set the table and pour your milk and see that theres no Ben washing his hands at the sink Im going to go right away to the telephone and call the police and report you missing Do you understand that It would probably turn out that I did it for nothing if I ever had to do it at all Im not entirely ignorant about the ways of boys I know they get wrapped up in their own games and projects during summer vacation lining bees back to their hives or playing ball or kickthecan or whatever I have a pretty good idea what you and your friends are up to you see Ben nodded soberly thinking that if she didnt know he had no friends she probably didnt know anywhere near as much about his boyhood as she thought she did But he would never have dreamed of saying such a thing to her not in ten thousand years of dreaming She took something from the pocket of her housedress and handed it to him It was a small plastic box Ben opened it When he saw what was inside his mouth dropped open Wow he said his admiration totally unaffected Thanks It was a Timex watch with small silver numbers and an imitationleather band She had set it and wound it he could hear it ticking Jeez its the coolest He gave her an enthusiastic hug and a loud kiss on the cheek She smiled pleased that he was pleased and nodded Then she grew grave again Put it on keep it on wear it wind it mind it dont lose it Now that you have a watch you have no reason to be late home Remember what I said if youre not on time the police will be looking for you on my behalf At least until they catch the bastard who is killing children around here dont you dare be a single minute late or Ill be on that telephone One other thing I dont want you going around alone You know enough not to accept candy or rides from strangerswe both agree that youre no fooland youre big for your age but a grown man particularly a crazy one can overpower a child if he really wants to When you go to the park or the library go with one of your friends She looked out the window again and uttered a sigh that was full of trouble Things have come to a pretty pass when a thing like this can go on Theres something ugly about this town anyway Ive always thought so She looked back at him brows drawn down Youre such a wanderer Ben You must know almost everyplace in Derry dont you The town part of it at least Ben didnt think he knew anywhere near all the places but he did know a lot of them And he was so thrilled by the unexpected gift of the Timex that he would have agreed with his mother that night if she had suggested John Wayne should play Adolf Hitler in a musical comedy about World War II He nodded Youve never seen anything have you she asked Anything or anyone well suspicious Anything out of the ordinary Anything that scared you And in his pleasure over the watch his feeling of love for her his smallboy gladness at her concern which was at the same time a little frightening in its unhidden unabashed fierceness he almost told her about the thing that had happened last January He opened his mouth and then somethingsome powerful intuitionclosed it again What was that something exactly Intuition No more than that and no less Even children may intuit loves more complex responsibilities from time to time and to sense that in some cases it may be kinder to remain quiet That was part of the reason Ben closed his mouth But there was something else as well something not so noble She could be hard his mamma She could be a boss She never called nun fat she called him big sometimes amplified to big for his age and when there were leftovers from supper she would often bring them to him while he was watching TV or doing his homework and he would eat them although some dim part of him hated himself for doing so but never his mamma for putting the food before himBen Hanscom would not have dared to hate his mamma God would surely strike him dead for feeling such a brutish ungrateful emotion even for a second And perhaps some even dimmer part of himthe faroff Tibet of Bens deeper thoughtssuspected her motives in this constant feeding Was it just love Could it be anything else Surely not But he wondered More to the point she didnt know he had no friends That lack of knowledge made nun distrust her made him unsure of what her reaction would be to his story of the thing which had happened to him in January If anything had happened Coming in at six and staying in was not so bad maybe He could read watch TV build stuff with his logs and Erector Set But having to stay in all day as well would be very bad and if he told her what he had seenor thought he had seenin January she might make him do just that No Mamma he said Just Mr McKibbon rooting around in other peoples garbage That made her laughshe didnt like Mr McKibbon who was a Republican as well as a Christerand her laugh closed the subject That night Ben had lain awake late but no thoughts of being cast adrift and parentless in a hard world troubled him He felt loved and safe as he lay in his bed looking at the moonlight which came in through the window and spilled across the bed onto the floor He alternately put his watch to his ear so he could listen to it tick and held it close to his eyes so he could admire its ghostly radium dial He had finally fallen asleep and dreamed he was playing baseball with the other boys in the vacant lot behind Tracker Brothers Truck Depot He had just hit a basesclearing home run swinging from his heels and getting every inch of that little honey and his cheering teammates met him in a mob at home plate They pummelled him and clapped him on the back They hoisted him onto their shoulders and carried him toward the place where their equipment was scattered In the dream he was almost bursting with pride and happiness and then he had looked out toward center field where a chainlink fence marked the boundary between the cindery lot and the weedy ground beyond that sloped into the Barrens A figure was standing in those tangled weeds and low bushes almost out of sight It held a clutch of balloonsred yellow blue greenin one whitegloved hand It beckoned with the other He couldnt see the figures face but he could see the baggy suit with the big orange pompombuttons down the front and the floppy yellow bowtie When Ben awoke the next morning he had forgotten the dream but his pillow was damp to the touch as if he had wept in the night He went up to the main desk in the Childrens Library shaking the train of thought the curfew sign had begun as easily as a dog shakes water after a swim Hullo Benny Mrs Starrett said Like Mrs Douglas at school she genuinely liked Ben Grownups especially those who sometimes needed to discipline children as part of their jobs generally liked him because he was polite softspoken thoughtful sometimes even funny in a very quiet way These were all the same reasons most kids thought he was a puke You tired of summer vacation yet Ben smiled This was a standard witticism with Mrs Starrett Not yet he said since summer vacations only been going onhe looked at his watchone hour and seventeen minutes Give me another hour Mrs Starrett laughed covering her mouth so it wouldnt be too loud She asked Ben if he wanted to sign up for the summer reading program and Ben said he did She gave him a map of the United States and Ben thanked her very much He wandered off into the stacks pulling a book here and there looking at it putting it back Choosing books was serious business You had to be careful If you were a grownup you could have as many as you wanted but kids could only take out three at a time If you picked a dud you were stuck with it He finally picked out his threeBulldozer The Black Stallion and one that was sort of a shot in the dark a book called Hot Rod by a man named Henry Gregor Felsen You may not like this one Mrs Starrett remarked stamping the book Its extremely bloody I urge it on the teenagers especially the ones who have just got their driving licenses because it gives them something to think about I imagine it slows some of them down for a whole week Well Ill give it a whirl Ben said and took his books over to one of the tables away from Poohs Corner where Big Billy Goat Gruff was in the process of giving a double dose of dickens to the troll under the bridge He worked on Hot Rod for awhile and it was not too shabby Not too shabby at all It was about a kid who was a really great driver but there was this partypooper cop who was always trying to slow him down Ben found out there were no speed limits in Iowa where the book was set That was sort of cool He looked up after three chapters and his eye was caught by a brandnew display The poster on top the library was gungho for posters all right showed a happy mailman delivering a letter to a happy kid LIBRARIES ARE FOR WRITING TOO the poster said WHY NOT WRITE A FRIEND TODAY THE SMILES ARE GUARANTEED Beneath the poster were slots filled with prestamped postcards prestamped envelopes and stationery with a drawing of the Derry Public Library on top in blue ink The prestamped envelopes were a nickel each the postcards three cents The paper was two sheets for a penny Ben felt in his pocket The remaining four cents of his bottle money was still there He marked his place in Hot Rod and went back to the desk May I have one of those postcards please Certainly Ben As always Mrs Starrett was charmed by his grave politeness and a little saddened by his size Her mother would have said the boy was digging his grave with a knife and fork She gave him the card and watched him go back to his seat It was a table that could seat six but Ben was the only one there She had never seen Ben with any of the other boys It was too bad because she believed Ben Hanscom had treasures buried inside He would yield them up to a kind and patient prospector if one ever came along Ben took out his ballpoint pen clicked the point down and addressed the card simply enough Miss Beverly Marsh Lower Main Street Derry Maine Zone He did not know the exact number of her building but his mamma had told him that most postmen had a pretty good idea of who their customers were once theyd been on their beats a little while If the postman who had Lower Main Street could deliver this card that would be great If not it would just go to the deadletter office and he would be out three cents It would certainly never come back to him because he had no intention of putting his name and address on it Carrying the card with the address turned inward he was taking no chances even though he didnt see anyone he recognized he got a few square slips of paper from the wooden box by the cardfile He took these back to his seat and began to scribble to cross out and then to scribble again During the last week of school before exams they had been reading and writing haiku in English class Haiku was a Japanese form of poetry brief disciplined A haiku Mrs Douglas said could be just seventeen syllables longno more no less It usually concentrated on one clear image which was linked to one specific emotion sadness joy nostalgia happiness love Ben had been utterly charmed by the concept He enjoyed his English classes although mild enjoyment was generally as far as it went He could do the work but as a rule there was nothing in it which gripped him Yet there was something in the concept of haiku that fired his imagination The idea made him feel happy the way Mrs Starretts explanation of the greenhouse effect had made him happy Haiku was good poetry Ben felt because it was structured poetry There were no secret rules Seventeen syllables one image linked to one emotion and you were out Bingo It was clean it was utilitarian it was entirely contained within and dependent upon its own rules He even liked the word itself a slide of air broken as if along a dotted line by the ksound at the very back of your mouth haiku Her hair he thought and saw her going down the school steps again with it bouncing on her shoulders The sun did not so much glint on it as seem to burn within it Working carefully over a twentyminute period with one break to go back and get more workslips striking out words that were too long changing deleting Ben came up with this He wasnt crazy about it but it was the best he could do He was afraid that if he frigged around with it too long worried it too much he would end up getting the jitters and doing something much worse Or not doing it at all He didnt want that to happen The moment she had taken to speak to him had been a striking moment for Ben He wanted to mark it in his memory Probably Beverley had a crush on some bigger boya sixthor maybe even a seventhgrader and she would think that maybe that boy had sent the haiku That would make her happy and so the day she got it would be marked in her memory And although she would never know it had been Ben Hanscom who marked it for her that was all right he would know He copied his completed poem onto the back of the postcard printing in block letters as if copying out a ransom note rather than a love poem clipped his pen back into his pocket and stuck the card in the back of Hot Rod He got up then and said goodbye to Mrs Starrett on his way out Goodbye Ben Mrs Starrett said Enjoy your summer vacation but dont forget about the curfew He strolled through the glassedin passageway between the two buildings enjoying the heat there greenhouse effect he thought smugly followed by the cool of the adult library An old man was reading the News in one of the ancient comfortably overstuffed chairs in the Reading Room alcove The headline just below the masthead blazed DULLES PLEDGES us TROOPS TO HELP LEBANON IF NEEDED There was also a photo of Ike shaking hands with an Arab in the Rose Garden Bens mamma said that when the country elected Hubert Humphrey President in maybe things would get moving again Ben was vaguely aware that there was something called a recession going on and his mamma was afraid she might get laid off A smaller headline on the bottom half of page one read POLICE HUNT FOR PSYCHOPATH GOES ON Ben pushed open the librarys big front door and stepped out There was a mailbox at the foot of the walk Ben fished the postcard from the back of the book and mailed it He felt his heartbeat speed up a little as it slipped out of his fingers What if she knows its me somehow Dont be a stupe he responded a little alarmed at how exciting that idea seemed to him He walked off up Kansas Street hardly aware of where he was going and not caring at all A fantasy had begun to form in his mind In it Beverly Marsh walked up to him her graygreen eyes wide her auburn hair tied back in a ponytail I want to ask you a question Ben this makebelieve girl said in his mind and youve got to swear to tell the truth She held up the postcard Did you write this This was a terrible fantasy This was a wonderful fantasy He wanted it to stop He didnt want it to ever stop His face was starting to burn again Ben walked and dreamed and shifted his library books from one arm to the other and began to whistle Youll probably think Im horrible Beverly said but I think I want to kiss you Her lips parted slightly I think I want you to he whispered and smiled a dopey dizzy and absolutely beautiful grin If he had looked down at the sidewalk just then he would have seen that three other shadows had grown around his own if he had been listening he would have heard the sound of Victors cleats as he Belch and Henry closed in But he neither heard nor saw Ben was far away feeling Beverlys lips slip softly against his mouth raising his timid hands to touch the dim Irish fire of her hair Like many cities small and large Derry had not been plannedlike Topsy it just growed City planners never would have located it where it was in the first place Downtown Derry was in a valley formed by the Kenduskeag Stream which ran through the business district on a diagonal from southwest to northeast The rest of the town had swarmed up the sides of the surrounding hills The valley the townships original settlers came to had been swampy and heavily grown over The stream and the Penobscot River into which the Kenduskeag emptied were great things for traders bad ones for those who sowed crops or built their houses too close to themthe Kenduskeag in particular because it flooded every three or four years The city was still prone to flooding in spite of the vast amounts of money spent over the last fifty years to control the problem If the floods had been caused only by the stream itself a system of dams might have taken care of things There were however other factors The Kenduskeags low banks were one The entire areas logy drainage was another Since the turn of the century there had been many serious floods in Derry and one disastrous one in To make matters worse the hills on which much of Derry was built were honeycombed with small streamsTorrault Stream in which the body of Cheryl Lamonica had been found was one of them During periods of heavy rain they were all apt to overflow their banks If it rains two weeks the whole damn town gets a sinus infection Stuttering Bills dad had said once The Kenduskeag was caged in a concrete canal two miles long as it passed through downtown This canal dived under Main Street at the intersection of Main and Canal becoming an underground river for half a mile or so before surfacing again at Bassey Park Canal Street where most of Derrys bars were ranked like felons in a police lineup paralleled the Canal on its way out of town and every few weeks or so the police would have to fish some drunks car out of the water which was polluted to dropdead levels by sewage and mill wastes Fish were caught from time to time in the Canal but they were inedible mutants On the northeastern side of townthe Canal sidethe river had been managed to at least some degree A thriving commerce went on all along it in spite of the occasional flooding People walked beside the Canal sometimes hand in hand if the wind was right that was if it was wrong the stench took much of the romance out of such strolling and at Bassey Park which faced the high school across the Canal there were sometimes Boy Scout campouts and Cub Scout wiener roasts In the citizens would be shocked and sickened to discover that hippies one of them had actually sewed an American flag on the seat of his pants and that pinkofaggot was busted before you could say Gene McCarthy were smoking dope and trading pills up there By  Bassey Park had become a regular openair pharmacy You just wait people said Somebodyll get killed before they put a stop to it And of course someone finally dida seventeenyearold boy had been found dead by the Canal his veins full of almost pure heroinwhat the kids called a tight white rail After that the druggies began to drift away from Bassey Park and there were even stories that the kids ghost was haunting the area The story was stupid of course but if it kept the speedfreaks and the nodders away it was at least a useful stupid story On the southwestern side of town the river presented even more of a problem Here the hills had been deeply cut open by the passing of the great glacier and further wounded by the endless water erosion of the Kenduskeag and its webwork of tributaries the bedrock showed through in many places like the halfunearthed bones of dinosaurs Veteran employees of the Derry Public Works Department knew that following the falls first hard frost they could count on a good deal of sidewalk repair on the southwestern side of town The concrete would contract and grow brittle and then the bedrock would suddenly shatter up through it as if the earth meant to hatch something What grew best in the shallow soil which remained was plants with shallow rootsystems and hardy naturesweeds and trashplants in other words scruffy trees thick low bushes and virulent infestations of poison ivy and poison oak grew everywhere they were allowed a foothold The southwest was where the land fell away steeply to the area that was known in Derry as the Barrens The Barrenswhich were anything but barrenwere a messy tract of land about a mile and a half wide by three miles long It was bounded by upper Kansas Street on one side and by Old Cape on the other Old Cape was a lowincome housing development and the drainage was so bad over there that there were stories of toilets and sewerpipes actually exploding The Kenduskeag ran through the center of the Barrens The city had grown up to the northeast and on both sides of it but the only vestiges of the city down there were Derry Pumphouse the municipal sewagepumping station and the City Dump Seen from the air the Barrens looked like a big green dagger pointing at downtown To Ben all this geography mated with geology meant was a vague awareness that there were no more houses on his right side now the land had dropped away A rickety whitewashed railing about waisthigh ran beside the sidewalk a token gesture of protection He could faintly hear running water it was the soundtrack to his continuing fantasy He paused and looked out over the Barrens still imagining her eyes the clean smell of her hair From here the Kenduskeag was only a series of twinkles seen through breaks in the thick foliage Some kids said that there were mosquitoes as big as sparrows down there at this time of year others said there was quicksand as you approached the river Ben didnt believe it about the mosquitoes but the idea of quicksand scared him Slightly to his left he could see a cloud of circling diving seagulls the dump Their cries reached him faintly Across the way he could see Derry Heights and the low roofs of the Old Cape houses closest to the Barrens To the right of Old Cape pointing skyward like a squat white finger was the Derry Standpipe Directly below him a rusty culvert stuck out of the earth spilling discolored water down the hill in a glimmering little stream which disappeared into the tangled trees and bushes Bens pleasant fantasy of Beverly was suddenly broken by one far more grim what if a dead hand flopped out of that culvert right now right this second while he was looking And suppose that when he turned to find a phone and call the police a clown was standing there A funny clown wearing a baggy suit with big orange puffs for buttons Suppose There was laughter He whirled around shrinking against the white fence separating the safe sane sidewalk of Kansas Street from the wildly undisciplined Barrens the railing creaked audibly and saw Henry Bowers Belch Huggins and Victor Criss standing there I want to beat you up Henry said He seemed to contemplate this prospect soberly even gravely But oh his black eyes sparkled I got to teach you something Tits You wont mind You like to learn new things dontcha Belch and Victor seized his arms Ben squealed It was a cowardly sound rabbity and weak but he couldnt help it Please God dont let them make me cry and dont let them break my watch Ben thought wildly He didnt know if they would get around to breaking his watch or not but he was pretty sure he would cry He was pretty sure he would cry plenty before they were through with him Jeezum he sounds just like a pig Victor said He twisted Bens wrist dont he sound like a pig Ben lunged first one way and then the other Belch and Victor went with him easily letting him lunge then yanking him back Henry grabbed the front of Bens sweatshirt and yanked it upward exposing his belly It hung over his belt in a swollen droop Victor and Belch laughed some more Ben looked around wildly for help He could see no one Behind him down in the Barrens crickets drowsed and seagulls screamed You just better quit he said He wasnt blubbering yet but was close to it You just better Or what Henry asked as if he was honestly interested Or what Tits Or what huh Ben suddenly found himself thinking of Broderick Crawford who played Dan Matthews on Highway Patrolthat bastard was tough that bastard was mean that bastard took zero shit from anybodyand then he burst into tears Dan Matthews would have belted these guys right through the fence down the embankment and into the puckerbrush He would have done it with his belly Oh boy lookit the baby Victor chortled Belch joined in Henry smiled a little but his face still held that grave reflective castthat look that was somehow almost sad It frightened Ben It suggested he might be in for more than just a beating As if to confirm this idea Henry reached into his jeans pocket and brought out a Buck knife Bens terror exploded He had been whipsawing his body futilely to either side now he suddenly lunged straight forward There was an instant when he believed he was going to get away He was sweating heavily and the boys holding his arms had greasy grips at best Belch managed to hold on to his right wrist but just barely He pulled entirely free of Victor Another lunge Before he could make it Henry stepped forward and gave him a shove Ben flew backward The railing creaked more loudly this tune and he felt it give a little under his weight Belch and Victor grabbed him again Sure Henry Belch said He sounded a trifle uneasy He aint gonna get away Dont worry Henry stepped forward until his flat stomach almost touched Bens belly Ben stared at him tears spilling helplessly out of his wide eyes Caught Im caught a part of his mind yammered He tried to stop ithe couldnt think at all with that yammering going onbut it wouldnt stop Caught Caught Caught Henry pulled out the blade which was long and wide and engraved with his name The tip glittered in the afternoon sunshine Ill gonna test you now Henry said in that same reflective voice Its exam time Tits and you better be ready Ben wept His heart thundered madly in his chest Snot ran out of his nose and collected on his upper lip His library books lay in a scatter at his feet Henry stepped on Bulldozer glanced down and dealt it into the gutter with a sideswipe of one black engineer boot Heres the first question on your exam Tits When somebody says Let me copy during finals what are you going to say Yes Ben exclaimed immediately Im going to say yes Sure Okay Copy all you want The Bucks tip slid through two inches of air and pressed against Bens stomach It was as cold as an icecube tray just out of the Frigidaire Ben gasped his belly away from it For a moment the world went gray Henrys mouth was moving but Ben couldnt tell what he was saying Henry was like a TV with the sound turned off and the world was swimming swimming Dont you dare faint the panicky voice shrieked If you faint he may get mad enough to kill you The world came back into some kind of focus He saw that both Belch and Victor had stopped laughing They looked nervous almost scared Seeing that had the effect of a headclearing slap on Ben All of a sudden they dont know what hes going to do or how far he might go However bad you thought things were thats how bad they really are maybe even a little worse You got to think If you never did before or never do again you better think now Because his eyes say theyre right to look nervous His eyes say hes crazy as a bedbug Thats the wrong answer Tits Henry said If just anyone says Let me copy I dont give a red fuck what you do Got it Yes Ben said his belly hitching with sobs Yes I got it Well okay Thats one wrong but the biggies are still coming up You ready for the biggies A car came slowly toward them It was a dusty Ford with an old man and woman propped up in the front seat like a pair of neglected department store mannequins Ben saw the old mans head turn slowly toward him Henry stepped closer to Ben hiding the knife Ben could feel its point dimpling his flesh just above his bellybutton It was still cold He didnt see how that could be but it was Go ahead yell Henry said Youll be pickin your fuckin guts off your sneakers They were close enough to kiss Ben could smell the sweet smell of Juicy Fruit gum on Henrys breath The car passed and continued on down Kansas Street as slow and serene as the pace car in the Tournament of Roses Parade All right Tits heres the second question If I say Let me copy during finals what are you going to say Henry smiled Thats good You got that one right Tits Now heres the third question how am I going to be sure you never forget that Henry smiled His face lit up and was for a moment almost handsome I know he said as if he had discovered a great truth I know Tits Ill carve my name on your big fat gut Victor and Belch abruptly began laughing again For a moment Ben felt a species of bewildered relief thinking it had all been nothing but makebelievea little shuckandjive the three of them had whomped up to scare the living hell out of him But Henry Bowers wasnt laughing and Ben suddenly understood that Victor and Belch were laughing because they were relieved It was obvious to both of them that Henry couldnt be serious Except Henry was The Buck knife slid upward smooth as butter Blood welled in a bright red line on Bens pallid skin Hey Victor cried The word came out muffled in a startled gulp Hold him Henry snarled You just hold him hear me Now there was nothing grave and reflective on Henrys face now it was the twisted face of a devil Jeezwmcrow Henry dont really cut im Belch screamed and his voice was high almost a girls voice Everything happened fast then but to Ben Hanscom it all seemed slow it all seemed to happen in a series of shutterclicks like action stills in a Lifemagazine photoessay His panic was gone He had discovered something inside him suddenly and because it had no use for panic that something just ate the panic whole In the first shutterclick Henry had snatched his sweatshirt all the way up to his nipples Blood was pouring from the shallow vertical cut above his bellybutton In the second shutterclick Henry drew the knife down again operating fast like a lunatic battlesurgeon under an aerial bombardment Fresh blood Sowed Backward Ben thought coldly as blood flowed down and pooled between the waistband of his jeans and his skin Got to go backward Thats the only direction I can get away in Belch and Victor werent holding him anymore In spite of Henrys command they had drawn away They had drawn away in horror But if he ran Bowers would catch him In the third shutterclick Henry connected the two vertical slashes with a short horizontal line Ben could feel blood running into his underpants now and a sticky snailtrail was creeping down his left thigh Henry leaned back momentarily frowning with the studied concentration of an artist painting a landscape After H comes E Ben thought and that was all it took to get him moving He pulled forward a little bit and Henry shoved him back again Ben pushed with his legs adding his own force to Henrys He hit the whitewashed railing between Kansas Street and the drop into the Barrens As he did he raised his right foot and planted it in Henrys belly This was not a retaliatory act Ben only wanted to increase his backward force And yet when he saw the expression of utter surprise on Henrys face he was filled with a clear savage joya feeling so intense that for a split second he thought the top of his head was going to come off Then there was a cracking splintering sound from the railing Ben saw Victor and Belch catch Henry before he could fall on his ass in the gutter next to the remains of Bulldozer and then Ben was falling backward into space He went with a scream that was half a laugh Ben hit the slope on his back and buttocks just below the culvert he had spotted earlier It was a good thing he landed below it if he had landed on it he might well have broken his back As it was he landed on a thick cushion of weeds and bracken and barely felt the impact He did a backward somersault feet and legs snapping over his head He landed sitting up and went sliding down the slope backward like a kid on a big green ChutetheChute his sweatshirt pulled up around his neck his hands grabbing for purchase and doing nothing but yanking out tuft after tuft of bracken and witchgrass He saw the top of the embankment it seemed impossible that he had just been standing up there receding with crazy cartoon speed He saw Victor and Belch their faces round white Os staring down at him He had time to mourn his library books Then he fetched up against something with agonizing force and nearly bit his tongue in half It was a downed tree and it checked Bens fall by nearly breaking his left leg He clawed his way back up the slope a little bit pulling his leg free with a groan The tree had stopped him about halfway down Below the bushes were thicker Water falling from the culvert ran over his hands in thin streams There was a shriek from above him Ben looked up again and saw Henry Bowers come flying over the drop his knife clenched between his teeth He landed on both feet body thrown backward at a steep angle so he would not overbalance He skidded to the end of a gigantic set of footprints and then began to run down the embankment in a series of gangling kangaroo leaps In goin oo kill ooo Its Henry was shrieking around the knife and Ben didnt need a UN translator to tell him Henry was saying Im going to kill you Tits Now with that cold generals eye he had discovered up above on the sidewalk Ben saw what he had to do He managed to gain his feet just before Henry arrived the knife now in his hand and held straight out in front of him like a bayonet Ben was peripherally aware that the left leg of his jeans was shredded and his leg was bleeding much more heavily than his stomach but it was supporting him and that meant it wasnt broken At least he hoped thats what it meant Ben crouched slightly to maintain his precarious balance and as Henry grabbed at him with one hand and swept the knife in a long flat arc with the other Ben stepped aside He lost his balance but as he fell down he stuck out his shredded left leg Henrys shins struck it and his legs were booted out from under him with great efficiency For a moment Ben gaped his terror overcome with a mixture of awe and admiration Henry Bowers appeared to be flying exactly like Superman over the fallen tree where Ben had stopped His arms were straight out in front of him the way George Reeves held his arms out on the TV show Only George Reeves always looked like flying was as natural as taking a bath or eating lunch on the back porch Henry looked like someone had shoved a hot poker up his ass His mouth was opening and closing A string of saliva was shooting back from one corner of it and as Ben watched it splatted against the lobe of Henrys ear Then Henry crashed back to earth The knife flew out of his hand He rolled over on one shoulder landed on his back and slid away into the bushes with his legs splayed into a V There was a yell A thud And then silence Ben sat dazed looking at the matted place in the bushes where Henry had done his disappearing act Suddenly rocks and pebbles began to bounce by him He looked up again Victor and Belch were now descending the embankment They were moving more carefully than Henry and hence more slowly but they would reach him in thirty seconds or less if he didnt do something He moaned Would this lunacy never end Keeping his eye on them he clambered over the downed tree and began to scramble down the embankment panting harshly He had a stitch in his side His tongue hurt like hell The bushes were no w almost as tall as Ben himself The randy green smell of stuff growing out of control filled his nose He could hear running water somewhere close chuckling over stones and rilling between them His feet slipped and here he went again rolling and sliding smashing the back of his hand against a jutting rock shooting through a patch of thorns that hooked bluegray puffs of cotton from his sweatshirt and little divots of meat from his hands and cheeks He slammed to a jarring halt sitting up with his feet in the water Here was a little curving stream which wound its way into a thick stand of secondgrowth trees to his right it looked as dark as a cave in there He looked to his left and saw Henry Bowers lying on his back in the middle of the stream His halfopen eyes showed only whites Blood trickled from one ear and ran toward Ben in delicate threads Oh my God I killed him Oh my God Im a murderer Oh my God Forgetting that Belch and Victor were behind him or perhaps understanding they would lose all interest in beating the shit out of him when they discovered their Fearless Leader was dead Ben splashed twenty feet upstream to where Henry lay his shirt in ribbons his jeans soaked black one shoe gone Ben was vaguely aware that there was precious little left of his own clothes and that his body was one big rattletrap of aches and pains His left ankle was the worst it had already puffed tight against his soaking sneaker and he was favoring it so badly that he was really not walking but lurching like a sailor on shore for the first time after a long sea voyage He bent over Henry Bowers Henrys eyes popped wide open He grabbed Bens calf with one scraped and bloody hand His mouth worked and although nothing but a series of whistling aspirations emerged Ben could still make out what he was saying Kill you you fat shit Henry was trying to pull himself up using Bens leg as a pole Ben pulled backward frantically Henrys hand slipped down then off Ben flew backward whirling his arms and fell on his ass for a recordbreaking third time in the last four minutes He also bit his tongue again Water splashed up around him A rainbow glimmered for an instant in front of Bens eyes Ben didnt give a fuck about the rainbow He didnt give a fuck about finding a pot of gold He would settle for his miserable fat life Henry rolled over Tried to stand Fell back Managed to get to his hands and knees And finally tottered to his feet He stared at Ben with those black eyes The front of his flattop now leaned this way and that like cornhusks after a high wind has passed through Ben was suddenly angry Nothis was more than being angry He was infuriated He had been walking with his library books under his arm having an innocent little daydream about kissing Beverly Marsh bothering nobody And look at this Just look Pants shredded Left ankle maybe broken badly sprained for sure Leg all cut up tongue all cut up Henry goddam Bowerss monogram on his stomach How about all that happy crappy sports fans But it was probably the thought of his library books for which he was liable that drove him to charge Henry Bowers His lost library books and his mental image of how reproachful Mrs Starretts eyes would become when he told her Whatever the reasoncuts sprain library books or even the thought of the soggy and probably illegible rankcard in his back pocketit was enough to get him moving He lumbered forward squashy Keds spatting in the shallow water and kicked Henry squarely in the balls Henry uttered a horrid rusty scream that sent birds beating up from the trees He stood spraddlelegged for a moment hands clasping his crotch staring unbelievingly at Ben Ug he said in a small voice Henry sank slowly back to his knees not so much falling as folding up He was still looking at Ben with those unbelieving black eyes Henry fell on his side still clutching his testicles and began to roll slowly from side to side Ug Henry moaned My balls Ug Oh you broke my balls Ugug He was now beginning to gain a little force and Ben started to back away a step at a time He was sickened by what he had done but he was also filled with a kind of righteous paralyzed fascination Ugmy fuckin sackugUGoh my fuckin BALLS Ben might have remained in the area for an untold length of timeperhaps even until Henry recovered enough to come after himbut just then a rock struck him above the right ear with such a deep drilling pain that until he felt warm blood flowing again Ben thought he had been stung by a wasp He turned and saw the other two striding up the middle of the stream toward him They each had a handful of waterrounded rocks Victor pegged one and Ben heard it whistle past his ear He ducked and another struck his right knee making him yell with surprised hurt A third bounced off his right cheekbone and that eye filled with water He scrambled for the far bank and climbed it as fast as he could grabbing onto protruding roots and hauling on handfuls of bushes He made it to the top one final stone struck his buttocks as he pulled himself up and took a quick look back over his shoulder Belch was kneeling beside Henry while Victor stood half a dozen feet away firing stones one the size of a baseball clipped through the manhigh bushes beside Ben He had seen enough in fact he had seen much more than enough Worst of all Henry Bowers was getting up again Like Bens own Timex watch Henry could take a licking and keep on ticking Ben turned and smashed his way into the bushes lumbering along in a direction he hoped was west If he could cross to the Old Cape side of the Barrens he could beg a dime off somebody and take the bus home And when he got there he would lock the door behind him and bury these tattered bloody clothes in the trash and this crazy dream would finally be over Ben thought of himself sitting in his chair in the living room freshly tubbed wearing his fuzzy red bathrobe watching Daffy Duck cartoons on The Mighty Ninety and drinking milk through a strawberry FlavRStraw Hold that thought he told himself grimly and kept lumbering along Bushes sprang into his face Ben pushed them aside Thorns reached and clawed He tried to ignore them He came to a flat area of ground that was black and mucky A thick stand of bamboolike growth spread across it and a fetid smell rose from the earth An ominous thought slipped across the foreground of his mind like a shadow as he looked at the sheen of standing water deeper into the grove of bamboostuff He didnt want to go in there Even if it wasnt quicksand the mud would suck his sneakers off He turned right instead running along the front of the bamboogrove and finally into a patch of real woods The trees mostly firs were thick growing everywhere battling each other for a little space and sun but there was less undergrowth and he could move faster He was no longer sure what direction he was moving in but still thought he was on measure a little ahead of the game The Barrens were enclosed by Derry on three sides and bounded by the halffinished turnpike extension on the fourth Sooner or later he would come out somewhere His stomach throbbed painfully and he pulled up the remains of his sweatshirt for a look He winced and drew a whistle of air in over his teeth His belly looked like a grotesque Christmastree ball all caked red blood and smeared green from his slide down the embankment He pulled the sweatshirt down again Looking at that mess made him feel like blowing lunch Now he heard a low humming noise from aheadit was one steady note just above the low range of his hearing An adult intent only on getting the hell out of there the mosquitoes had found Ben now and while nowhere near as big as sparrows they were pretty big would have ignored it or simply not heard it at all But Ben was a boy and he was already getting over his fright He swerved to his left and pushed through some low laurel bushes Beyond them sticking out of the ground were the top three feet of a cement cylinder about four feet wide It was capped with a vented iron manhole cover The cover was stamped with the words DERRY SEWER DEFT The soundthis close it was more a drone than a humwas coming from someplace deep inside Ben put one eye to a venthole but could see nothing He could hear that drone and water running down there someplace but that was all He took a breath got a whiff of a sour smell that was both dank and shitty and drew back with a wince It was a sewer that was all Or maybe a combined sewer and drainagetunnelthere were plenty of those in floodconscious Derry No big deal But it had given him a funny sort of chill Part of it was seeing the handiwork of man in all this overgrown jumble of wilderness but he supposed part of it was the shape of the thing itselfthat concrete cylinder jutting out of the ground Ben had read H G Wellss The Time Machine the year before first the Classics Comics version and then the whole book This cylinder with its vented iron cap reminded him of the wells which lead down into the country of the slumped and horrible Morlocks He moved away from it quickly trying to find west again He got to a link clearing and turned until his shadow was as directly behind him as he could get it Then he headed off in a straight line Five minutes later he heard more running water ahead and voices Kids voices He stopped to listen and that was when he heard snapping branches and other voices behind him They were perfectly recognizable They belonged to Victor Belch and the one and only Henry Bowers He came out of his hiding place about two hours later dirtier than ever but a little refreshed Incredible as it seemed to him he had dozed off When he had heard the three of them behind him coming after him still Ben had come dangerously close to freezing up completely like an animal caught in the headlamps of an oncoming truck A paralytic drowsiness began to steal over him The idea of simply lying down curling up into a ball like a hedgehog and letting them do whatever they felt they had to occurred to him It was a crazy idea but it also seemed like a strangely good idea But instead Ben began to move toward the sound of the running water and those other kids He tried to untangle their voices and get the sense of what they were sayinganything to shake off that scary paralysis of the spirit Some project They were talking about some project One or two of the voices were even a little familiar There was a splash followed by a burst of goodnatured laughter The laughter filled Ben with a kind of stupid longing and made him more aware of his dangerous position than anything else had done If he was going to be caught there was no need to let these kids in for a dose of his medicine Ben turned right again Like many large people he was remarkably lightfooted He passed close enough to the boys to see their shadows moving back and forth between him and the bright water but they neither saw him nor heard him Gradually their voices began to fall behind He came to a narrow path which had been beaten down to the bare earth Ben considered it for a moment then shook his head a little He crossed it and plunged into the undergrowth again He moved more slowly now pushing bushes aside rather than stampeding through them He was still moving roughly parallel to the stream the other kids had been playing beside Even through the intervening bushes and trees he could see it was much wider than the one into which he and Henry had fallen Here was another of those concrete cylinders barely visible amid a snarl of blackberry creepers humming quietly to itself Beyond an embankment dropped off to the stream and here an old gnarled elm tree leaned crookedly out over the water Its roots halfexposed by bank erosion looked like a snarl of dirty hair Hoping there wouldnt be bugs or snakes but too tired and numbly frightened to really care Ben had worked his way between the roots and into a shallow cave beneath He leaned back A root jabbed him like an angry finger He shifted his position a little and it supported him quite nicely Here came Henry Belch and Victor He had thought they might be fooled into following the path but no such luck They stood close by him for a momentany closer and he could have reached out of his hiding place and touched them Well lets go find out Henry replied and they headed back the way they had come A few moments later Ben heard him roar What the fuck you kids doin here There was some sort of reply but Ben couldnt tell what it was the kids were too far away and this close the riverit was the Kenduskeag of coursewas too loud But he thought the kid sounded scared Ben could sympathize Then Victor Criss bellowed something Ben hadnt understood at all What a fuckin baby dam Baby dam Baby damn Or maybe Victor had said what a damn bunch of babies and Ben had misheard him There were yells of protest followed by a scream of pain Someone began to cry Yes Ben could sympathize They hadnt been able to catch him or at least not yet but here was another bunch of little kids for them to take out their mad on Splashes Yells Big moronic gusts of laughter from Belch and Victor An agonized infuriated cry from one of the little kids Dont gimme any of your shit you stuttering little freak Henry Bowers said I aint takin no more shit from nobody today There was a splintering crack The sound of running water downstream grew louder and roared briefly before quieting to its former placid chuckle Ben suddenly understood Baby dam yes that was what Victor had said The kidstwo or three of them it had sounded like when he passed byhad been building a dam Henry and his friends had just kicked it apart Ben even thought he knew who one of the kids was The only stuttering little freak he knew from Derry School was Bill Denbrough who was in the other fifthgrade classroom You didnt have to do that a thin and fearful voice cried out and Ben recognized that voice as well although he could not immediately put a face with it Why did you do that Because I felt like it fucknuts Henry roared back There was a meaty thud It was followed by a scream of pain The scream was followed by weeping Shut up Victor said shut up that crying kid or Ill pull your ears down and tie em under your chin Were going Henry said but before we do I want to know one thing You seen a fat kid in the last ten minutes or so Big fat kid all bloody and cut up There was a reply too brief to be anything but no Lets go Henry said He probably waded acrost back that way Tata boys Victor Criss called It was a real baby dam believe me Youre better off without it Splashing sounds Belchs voice came again but farther away now Ben couldnt make out the words In fact he didnt want to make out the words Closer by the boy who had been crying now resumed There were comforting noises from the other boy Ben had decided there was just the two of them Stuttering Bill and the weeper He halfsat halflay where he was listening to the two boys by the river and the fading sounds of Henry and his dinosaur friends crashing toward the far side of the Barrens Sunlight flicked at his eyes and made little coins of light on the tangled roots above and around him It was dirty in here but it was also cozy safe The sound of running water was soothing Even the sound of the crying kid was sort of soothing His aches and pains had faded to a dull throb and the sound of the dinosaurs had faded out completely He would wait awhile just to be sure they werent coming back and then he would make tracks Ben could hear the throb of the drainage machinery coming through the earthcould even feel it a low steady vibration that went from the ground to the root he was leaning against and then into his back He thought of the Morlocks again of their naked flesh he imagined it would smell like the dank and shitty air that had come up through the ventholes of that iron cap He thought of their wells driven deep into the earth wells with rusty ladders bolted to their sides He dozed and at some point his thoughts became a dream It wasnt Morlocks he dreamed of He dreamed of the thing which had happened to him in January the thing which he hadnt quite been able to tell his mother It had been the first day of school after the long Christmas break Mrs Douglas had asked for a volunteer to stay after and help her count the books that had been turned in just before the vacation Ben had raised his hand Thank you Ben Mrs Douglas had said favoring him with a smile of such brilliance that it warmed him down to his toessuckass Henry Bowers remarked under his breath It had been the sort of Maine winter day that is both the best and the worst cloudless eyewateringly bright but so cold it was a little frightening To make the tendegree temperature worse there was a strong wind to give the cold a bitter cutting edge Ben counted books and called out numbers Mrs Douglas wrote them down not bothering to doublecheck his work even on a random basis he was proud to note and then they both carried the books down to the storage room through halls where radiators clanked dreamily At first the school had been full of sounds slamming locker doors the clacketyclack of Mrs Thomass typewriter in the office the slightly offkey choral renditions of the glee club upstairs the nervous thudthudthud of basketballs from the gym and the scrooch and thud of sneakers as players drove toward the baskets or cut turns on the polished wood floor Little by little these sounds ceased until as the last set of books was totted up one short but it hardly mattered Mrs Douglas sighedthey were all holding together on a wing and a prayer the only sounds were the radiators the faint whisshwhissh of Mr Fazios broom as he pushed colored sawdust up the hall floor and the howl of the wind outside Ben looked toward the book rooms one narrow window and saw that the light was fading rapidly from the sky It was four oclock and dusk was at hand Membranes of dry snow blew around the icy jungle gym and skirled between the teetertotters which were frozen solidly into the ground Only the thaws of April would break those bitter winterwelds He saw no one at all on Jackson Street He looked a moment longer expecting a car to roll through the JacksonWitcham intersection but none did Everyone in Derry save himself and Mrs Douglas might be dead or fled at least from what he could see from here He looked toward her and saw with a touch of real fright that she was feeling almost exactly the same things he was feeling himself He could tell by the look in her eyes They were deep and thoughtful and far off not the eyes of a schoolteacher in her forties but those of a child Her hands were folded just below her breasts as if in prayer Im scared Ben thought and shes scared too But what are we realty scared of He didnt know Then she looked at him and uttered a short almost embarrassed laugh Ive kept you too late she said Im sorry Ben Thats okay He looked down at his shoes He loved her a littlenot with the frank unquestioning love he had lavished on Miss Thibodeau his firstgrade teacher but he did love her If I drove Id give you a ride she said but I dont My husbands going to pick me up around quarter past five If youd care to wait we could No thanks Ben said I ought to get home before then This was not really the truth but he felt a queer aversion to the idea of meeting Mrs Douglass husband She doesnt drive either Ben said Ill be all right Its only a mile home A miles not far when its nice but it can be a very long way in this weather Youll go in somewhere if it gets too cold wont you Ben Aw sure Ill go into Costellos Market and stand by the stove a little while or something Mr Gedreau doesnt mind And I got my snowpants My new Christmas scarf too Mrs Douglas looked a little reassured and then she glanced toward the window again It just looks so cold out there she said so so inimical He didnt know the word but he knew exactly what she meant Something just happenedwhat He had seen her he realized suddenly as a person instead of just a teacher That was what had happened Suddenly he had seen her face in an entirely different way and because he did it became a new facethe face of a tired poet He could see her going home with her husband sitting beside him in the car with her hands folded as the heater hissed and he talked about his day He could see her making them dinner An odd thought crossed his mind and a cocktailparty question rose to his lips Do you have children Mrs Douglas I often think at this time of the year that people really werent meant to live this far north of the equator she said At least not in this latitude Then she smiled and some of the strangeness either went out of her face or his eyehe was able to see her at least partially as he always had But youll never see her that way again not completely he thought dismayed Ill feel old until spring and then Ill feel young again Its that way every year Are you sure youll be all right Ben He looked back at his toes blushing loving her more than ever In the hallway Mr Fazio said Be careful of de frosbite boy without looking up from his red sawdust He reached his locker opened it and yanked on his snowpants He had been painfully unhappy when his mother insisted he wear them again this winter on especially cold days thinking of them as baby clothes but he was glad to have them this afternoon He walked slowly toward the door zipping his coat yanking the drawstrings of his hood tight pulling on his mittens He went out and stood on the snowpacked top step of the front stairs for a moment listening as the door snicked closedand lockedbehind him Derry School brooded under a bruised skin of sky The wind blew steadily The snaphooks on the flagpole rope rattled a lonesome tattoo against the steel pole itself That wind cut into the warm and unprepared flesh of Bens face at once numbing his cheeks He quickly pulled his scarf up until he looked like a small pudgy caricature of Red Ryder That darkening sky had a fantastical sort of beauty but Ben did not pause to admire it it was too cold for that He got going At first the wind was at his back and things didnt seem so bad in fact it actually seemed to be helping him along At Canal Street however he had to turn right and almost fully into the wind Now it seemed to be holding him back as if it had business with him His scarf helped a little but not enough His eyes throbbed and the moisture in his nose froze to a crackglaze His legs were going numb Several times he stuck his mittened hands into his armpits to warm them up The wind whooped and screamed sometimes sounding almost human Ben felt both frightened and exhilarated Frightened because he could now understand stories he had read such as Jack Londons To Build a Fire where people actually froze to death It would be all too possible to freeze to death on a night like this a night when the temperature would drop to fifteen below The exhilaration was hard to explain It was a lonely feelinga somehow melancholy feeling He was outside he passed on the wings of the wind and none of the people beyond the brightly lighted squares of their windows saw him They were inside inside where there was light and warmth They didnt know he had passed them only he knew It was a secret thing The moving air burned like needles but it was fresh and clean White smoke jetted from his nose in neat little streams And as sundown came the last of the day a cold yellowyorange line on the western horizon the first stars cruel diamondchips glimmering in the sky overhead he came to the Canal He was only three blocks from home now and eager to feel the heat on his face and legs moving the blood again making it tingle The Canal was frozen in its concrete sluice like a frozen river of rosemilk its surface humped and cracked and cloudy It was moveless yet completely alive in this harshly puritanical winterlight it had its own unique and difficult beauty Ben turned the other waysouthwest Toward the Barrens When he looked in this direction the wind was at his back again It made his snowpants ripple and flap The Canal ran straight between its concrete walls for perhaps half a mile then the concrete was gone and the river sprawled its way into the Barrens at this time of the year a skeletal world of icy brambles and jutting naked branches Ben stared at it and thought There may be a man down there but can he be wearing what it looks like hes wearing Its impossible isnt it The figure was dressed in what appeared to be a whitesilver clown suit It rippled around him in the polar wind There were oversized orange shoes on his feet They matched the pompom buttons which ran down the front of his suit One hand grasped a bundle of strings which rose to a bright bunch of balloons and when Ben observed that the balloons were floating in his direction he felt unreality wash over him more strongly He closed his eyes rubbed them opened them The balloons still appeared to be floating toward him He heard Mr Fazios voke in his head Be careful of de frosbite boy It had to be a hallucination or a mirage brought on by some weird trick of the weather There could be a man down there on the ice he supposed it was even technically possible he could be wearing a clown suit But the balloons couldnt be floating toward Ben into the wind Yet that was just what they appeared to be doing Ben the clown on the ice called Ben thought that voice was only in his mind although it seemed he heard it with his ears Want a balloon Ben There was something so evil in that voice so awful that Ben wanted to run away as fast as he could but his feet seemed as welded to this sidewalk as the teetertotters in the schoolyard were welded to the ground The clown began walking along the ice toward the Canal bridge where Ben stood Ben watched him come not moving he watched as a bird watches an approaching snake The balloons should have burst in the intense cold but they did not they floated above and ahead of the clown when they should have been streaming out behind him trying to escape back into the Barrens where some part of Bens mind assured him this creature had come from in the first place Although the last of the daylight had struck a rosy glow across the ice of the Canal the clown cast no shadow None at all Youll like it here Ben the clown said Now it was close enough so Ben could hear the duddud sound its funny shoes made as they advanced over the uneven ice Youll like it here I promise all the boys and girls I meet like it here because its like Pleasure Island in Pinocchio and NeverNever Land in Peter Pan they never have to grow up and thats what all the kiddies want So come on See the sights have a balloon feed the elephants ride the ChutetheChutes Oh youII like it and oh Ben how youII float And in spite of his fear Ben found that part of him did want a balloon Who in all the world owned a balloon which would float into the wind Who had even heard of such a thing Yes he wanted a balloon and he wanted to see the clowns face which was bent down toward the ice as if to keep it out of that killer wind What might have happened if the five oclock whistle atop the Derry Town Hall hadnt blown just then Ben didnt know didnt want to know The important thing was that it did blow an icepick of sound drilling into the deep winter cold The clown looked up as if startled and Ben saw its face The mummy Oh my God its the mummy was his first thought accompanied by a swoony horror that caused him to clamp his hands down viciously on the bridges railing to keep from fainting Of course it hadnt been the mummy couldnt have been the mummy Oh there were Egyptian mummies plenty of them he knew that but his first thought had been that it was the mummythe dusty monster played by Boris Karloff in the old movie he had stayed up late to watch just last month on Shock Theater No it wasnt that mummy couldnt be movie monsters werent real everyone knew that even little kids But It wasnt makeup the clown was wearing Nor was the clown simply swaddled in a bunch of bandages There were bandages most of them around its neck and wrists blowing back in the wind but Ben could see the clowns face clearly It was deeply lined the skin a parchment map of wrinkles tattered cheeks arid flesh The skin of its forehead was split but bloodless Dead lips grinned back from a maw in which teeth leaned like tombstones Its gums were pitted and black Ben could see no eyes but something glittered far back in the charcoal pits of those puckered sockets something like the cold jewels in the eyes of Egyptian scarab beetles And although the wind was the wrong way it seemed to him that he could smell cinnamon and spice rotting cerements treated with weird drugs sand blood so old it had dried to flakes and grains of rust We all float down here the mummyclown croaked and Ben realized with fresh horror that somehow it had reached the bridge it was now just below him reaching up with a dry and twisted hand from which flaps of skin rustled like pennons a hand through which bone like yellow ivory showed One almost fleshless finger caressed the tip of his boot Bens paralysis broke He pounded the rest of the way across the bridge with the five oclock whistle still shrieking in his ears it only ceased as he reached the far side It had to be a mirage had to be The clown simply could not have come so far during the whistles tenor fifteensecond blast But his fear was not a mirage neither were the hot tears which spurted from his eyes and froze on his cheeks a second after being shed He ran boots thudding on the sidewalk and behind him he could hear the mummy in the clown suit climbing up from the Canal ancient stony fingernails scraping across iron old tendons creaking like dry hinges He could hear the arid whistle of its breath pulling in and pushing out of nostrils as devoid of moisture as the tunnels under the Great Pyramid He could smell its shroud of sandy spices and he knew that in a moment its hands as fleshless as the geometrical constructions he made with his Erector Set would descend upon his shoulders They would turn him around and he would stare into that wrinkled smiling face The dead river of its breath would wash over him Those black eyesockets with their deep glowing depths would bend over him The toothless mouth would yawn and he would have his balloon Oh yes All the balloons he wanted But when he reached the corner of his own street sobbing and winded his heart slamming crazed leaping beats into his ears when he at last looked back over his shoulder the street was empty The arched bridge with its low concrete sides and its oldfashioned cobblestone paving was also empty He could not see the Canal itself but he felt that if he could he would see nothing there either No if the mummy had not been a hallucination or a mirage if it had been real it would be waiting under the bridgelike the troll in the story of The Three Billy Goats Gruff Ben hurried home looking back every few steps until the door was safely shut and locked behind him He explained to his motherwho was so tired from a particularly hard day at the mill that she had not in truth much missed himthat he had been helping Mrs Douglas count books Then he sat down to a dinner of noodles and Sundays leftover turkey He stuffed three helpings into himself and the mummy seemed more distant and dreamlike with each helping It was not real those things were never real they came fully to life only between the commercials of the latenight TV movies or during the Saturday matinees where if you were lucky you could get two monsters for a quarterand if you had an extra quarter you could buy all the popcorn you could eat No they were not real TV monsters and movie monsters and comicbook monsters were not real Not until you went to bed and couldnt sleep not until the last four pieces ot candy wrapped in tissues and kept under your pillow against the evils of the night were gobbled up not until the bed itself turned into a lake of rancid dreams and the wind screamed outside and you were afraid to look at the window because there might be a face there an ancient grinning face that had not rotted but simply dried like an old leaf its eyes sunken diamonds pushed deep into dark sockets not until you saw one ripped and claw like hand holding out a bunch of balloons See the sights have a balloon feed the elephants ride the ChutetheChutes Ben oh Ben how youll float Ben awoke with a gasp the dream of the mummy still on him panicked by the close vibrating dark all around him He jerked and the root stopped supporting him and poked him in the back again as if in exasperation He saw light and scrambled for it He crawled out into afternoon sunlight and the babble of the stream and everything fell into place again It was summer not winter The mummy had not carried him away to its desert crypt Ben had simply hidden from the big kids in a sandy hole under a halfuprooted tree He was in the Barrens Henry and his buddies had gone to town in a small way on a couple of kids playing downstream because they hadnt been able to find Ben and go to town on him in a big way Tata boys It was a real baby dam believe me Youre better off without it Ben looked glumly down at his ruined clothes His mother was going to give him sixteen different flavors of holy old hell He had slept just long enough to stiffen up He slid down the embankment and then began to walk along the stream wincing at every step He was a medley of aches and pains it felt like Spike Jones was playing a fast tune on broken glass inside most of his muscles There seemed to be dried or drying blood on every inch of exposed skin The dambuilding kids would be gone anyway he consoled himself He wasnt sure how long hed slept but even if it had only been half an hour the encounter with Henry and his friends would have convinced Denbrough and his pal that some other placelike Timbuktu maybewould be better for their health Ben plugged grimly along knowing if the big kids came back now he would not stand a chance of outrunning them He hardly cared He rounded an elbowbend in the stream and just stood there for a moment looking The dambuilders were still there One of them was indeed Stuttering Bill Denbrough He was kneeling beside the other boy who was propped against the streambank in a sitting position This other kids head was thrown so far back that his adams apple stood out like a triangular plug There was dried blood around his nose on his chin and painted along his neck in a couple of streams He had something white clasped loosely in one hand Stuttering Bill looked around sharply and saw Ben standing there Ben saw with dismay that something was very wrong with the boy propped up on the bank Denbrough was obviously scared to death He thought miserably Wont this day ever end I wonder if yuhyuhyou could help mmme Bill Denbrough said HHis ahahahasppirator is ehhempty I think he mmight be His face froze turned red He dug at the word stuttering like a machinegun Spittle flew from his lips and it took almost thirty seconds worth of dddd before Ben realized Denbrough was trying to say the other kid might be dying Bill Denbrough thinks Im damned near spacetravelling I might as well be inside a bullet shot from a gun This thought although perfectly true is not one he finds especially comfortable In fact for the first hour following the Concordes takeoff or perhaps liftoff would be a better way to put it from Heathrow he has been coping with a mild case of claustrophobia The airplane is narrowunsettlingly so The meal is just short of exquisite but the flight attendants who serve it must twist and bend and squat to get the job done they look like a troupe of gymnasts Watching this strenuous service takes some of the pleasure out of the food for Bill although his seatmate doesnt seem particularly bothered The seatmate is another drawback Hes fat and not particularly clean it may be Ted Lapidus cologne on top of his skin but beneath it Bill detects the unmistakable odors of dirt and sweat Hes not being very particular about his left elbow either every now and then it strikes Bill with a soft thud His eyes are drawn again and again to the digital readout at the front of the cabin It shows how fast this British bullet is going Now as the Concorde reaches its cruising speed it tops out at just over mach Bill takes his pen from his shin pocket and uses its tip to tap buttons on the computer watch Audra gave him last Christmas If the machometer is rightand Bill has absolutely no reason to think it is notthen they are busting along at a speed of eighteen miles per minute He is not sure this is anything he really wanted to know Outside his window which is as small and thick as the window in one of the old Mercury space capsules he can see a sky which is not blue but the twilight purple of dusk although it is the middle of the day At the point where the sea and the sky meet he can see that the horizonline is slightly bowed I am sitting here Bill thinks a Bloody Mary in my hand and a dirty fat mans elbow poking into my bicep observing the curvature of the earth He smiles a little thinking that a man who can face something like that shouldnt be afraid of anything But he is afraid and not just of flying at eighteen miles a minute in this narrow fragile shell He can almost feel Derry rushing at him And that is exactly the right expression for it Eighteen miles a minute or not the sensation is of being perfectly still while Derry rushes at him like some big carnivore which has lain in wait for a long time and has finally broken from cover Derry ah Derry Shall we write an ode to Derry The stink of its mills and its rivers The dignified quiet of its treelined streets The library The Standpipe Bassey Park Derry Elementary School Lights are going on in his head big kliegs Its like hes been sitting in a darkened theater for twentyseven years waiting for something to happen and now its finally begun The set being revealed spot by spot and klieg by klieg is not however some harmless comedy like Arsenic and Old Lace to Bill Denbrough it looks more like The Cabinet of Dr Caligari All those stories I wrote he thinks with a stupid kind of amusement All those novels Derry is where they all came from Derry was the wellspring They came from what happened that summer and from what happened to George the autumn before All the interviewers that ever asked me THAT QUESTION I gave them the wrong answer The fat mans elbow digs into him again and he spills some of his drink Bill almost says something then thinks better of it THAT QUESTION of course was Where do you get your ideas It was a question Bill supposed all writers of fiction had to answeror pretend to answerat least twice a week but a fellow like him who made a living by writing of things which never were and never could be had to answer itor pretend tomuch more often than that All writers have a pipeline which goes down into the subconscious he told them neglecting to mention that he doubted more as each year passed if there even was such a thing as a subconscious But the man or woman who writes honor stories has a pipeline that goes further maybe into the subsubconscious if you like Elegant answer that but one he had never really believed Subconscious Well there was something down there all right but Bill thought people had made much too big a deal out of a function which was probably the mental equivalent of your eyes watering when dust got in them or breaking wind an hour or so after a big dinner The second metaphor was probably the better of the two but you couldnt very well tell interviewers that as far as you were concerned such things as dreams and vague longings and sensations like dejavu really came down to nothing more than a bunch of mental farts But they seemed to need something all those reporters with their notebooks and their little Japanese taperecorders and Bill wanted to help them as much as he could He knew that writing was a hard job a damned hard job There was no need to make theirs harder by telling them My friend you might as well ask me Who cut the cheese and have done with it He thought now You always knew they were asking the wrong question even before Mike called now you also know what the right question was Not where do you get your ideas but why do you get your ideas There was a pipeline all right but it wasnt either the Freudian or Jungian version of the subconscious that it came out of no interior drainsystem of the mind no subterranean cavern full of Morlocks waiting to happen There was nothing at the other end of that pipe but Derry Just Derry Andand whos that triptrapping upon my bridge He sits bolt upright suddenly and this time its his elbow that goes wandering it sinks deeply into his fat seatmates side for a moment Watch yourself buddy the fat man says Close quarters you know You stop whopping me with yours and Ill try to stop wuhwhapping you with mmine The fat man gives him a sour incredulous whatthehellyoutalkingabout look Bill simply gazes at him until the fat man looks away muttering He looks out the window again and thinks Were beating the devil His arms and the nape of his neck prickle He knocks back the rest of his drink in one swallow Another of those big lights has gone on Silver His bike That was what he had called it after the Lone Rangers horse A big Schwinn twentyeight inches tall Youll kill yourself on that Billy his father had said but with no real concern in his tone He had shown little concern for anything since Georges death Before he had been tough Fair but tough Since you could get around him He would make fatherly gestures go through fatherly motions but motions and gestures were all they were It was like he was always listening for George to come back into the house Bill had seen it in the window of the Bike and Cycle Shoppe down on Center Street It leaned gloomily on its kickstand bigger than the biggest of the others on display dull where they were shiny straight in places where the others were curved bent in places where the others were straight Propped on its front tire had been a sign What actually happened was that Bill went in and the owner made him an offer which Bill tookhe wouldnt have known how to dicker with the Cycle Shoppe owner if his life depended on it and the pricetwentyfour dollarsthe man quoted seemed very fair to Bill generous even He paid for Silver with money he had saved up over the last seven or eight monthsbirthday money Christmas money lawnmowing money He had been noticing the bike in the window ever since Thanksgiving He paid for it and wheeled it home as soon as the snow began to melt for good It was funny because hed never thought much about owning a bike before last year The idea seemed to come into his mind all at once perhaps on one of those endless days after George died Was murdered In the beginning Bill almost did kill himself The first ride on his new bike ended with Bill dumping it on purpose to keep from running smack into the board fence at the end of Kossuth Lane he had not been so afraid of running into the fence as he had been of bashing right through it and falling sixty feet into the Barrens He came away from that one with a fiveinch gash running between the wrist and elbow of his left arm Not even a week later he had found himself unable to brake soon enough and had shot through the intersection of Witcham and Jackson at perhaps thirtyfive miles an hour a little kid on a dusty gray mastodon of a bike Silver was silver only by the most energetic reach of a willing imagination playing cards machinegunning the spokes of the front and back wheels in a steady roar and if a car had been coming he would have been dead meat Just like Georgie He got control of Silver little by little as the spring advanced Neither of his parents noticed during that time that he was conning death by bicycle He thought that after the first few days they had ceased to really see his bike at allto them it was just a relic with chipped paint which leaned against the garage wall on rainy days Silver was a lot more than some dusty old relic though He didnt look like much but he went like the wind Bills friendhis only real friendwas a kid named Eddie Kaspbrak and Eddie was good with mechanical things He had shown Bill how to get Silver in shapewhich bolts to tighten and check regularly where to oil the sprockets how to tighten the chain how to put on a bike patch so it would stay if you got a flat You oughtta paint it he remembered Eddie saying one day but Bill didnt want to paint Silver For reasons he couldnt even explain to himself he wanted the Schwinn just the way it was It looked like a real bowwow the sort of bike a careless kid regularly left out on his lawn in the rain a bike that would be all squeaks and shudders and slow friction It looked like a bowwow but it went like the wind It would It would beat the devil he says aloud and laughs His fat seatmate looks at him sharply the laugh has that howling quality that gave Audra the creeps earlier Yes it looked pretty shoddy with its old paint and the oldfashioned package carrier mounted above the back wheel and the ancient oogahhorn with its black rubber bulbthat horn was permanently welded to the handlebars with a rusty bolt the size of a babys fist Pretty shoddy And it was a damned good thing he could because Silver had saved Bill Denbroughs life in the fourth week of June the week after he met Ben Hanscom for the first lime the week after he and Ben and Eddie built the dam the week that Ben and Richie Trashmouth Tozier and Beverly Marsh showed up in the Barrens after the Saturday matinee Richie had been riding behind him on Silvers package carrier the day Silver had saved Bills life so he supposed Silver had saved Richies too And he remembered the house they had been running from all right He remembered that just fine That damned house on Neibolt Street He had raced to beat the devil that day oh yeah for sure dont you just know it Some devil with eyes as shiny as old deadly coins Some hairy old devil with a mouthful of bloody teeth But all that had come later If Silver had saved Richies life and his own that day then perhaps he had saved Eddie Kaspbraks on the day Bill and Eddie met Ben by the kickedapart remains of their dam in the Barrens Henry Bowerswho looked a little bit like someone had run him through a Disposallhad mashed Eddies nose and then Eddies asthma had come on strong and few aspirator turned up empty So it had been Silver that day too Silver to the rescue Bill Denbrough who hasnt been on a bicycle in almost seventeen years looks out the window of an airplane that would not have been creditedor even imagined outside of a sciencefiction magazinein the year Hiyo Silver AWAYYY he thinks and has to close his eyes against the sudden needling sting of tears What happened to Silver He cant remember That pan of the set is still dark that klieg has yet to be turned on Perhaps that is just as well Perhaps that is a mercy AWAYYY he shouted The wind tore the words back over his shoulder like a fluttering crepe streamer They came out big and strong those words in a triumphant roar They were the only ones that ever did He pedaled down Kansas Street toward town gaining speed slowly at first Silver rolled once he got going but getting going was a job and a half Watching the gray bike pick up speed was a little like watching a big plane roll down the runway At first you couldnt believe such a huge waddling gadget could ever actually leave the earththe idea was absurd But then you could see its shadow beneath it and before you even had time to wonder if it was a mirage the shadow was trailing out long behind it and the plane was up cutting its way through the air as sleek and graceful as a dream in a satisfied mind Bill got a little downhill stretch and began to pedal faster his legs pumping up and down as he stood forward over the bikes fork He had learned very quicklyafter being bashed a couple of times by that fork in the worst place a boy can be bashedto yank his underpants up as high as he could before mounting Silver Later that summer observing this process Richie would say Bill does that because he thinks he might like to have some kids that live someday It seems like a bad idea to me but hey they might always take after his wife right He and Eddie had lowered the seat as far as it would go and it now bumped and scraped against the small of his back as he worked the pedals A woman digging weeds in her flowergarden shaded her eyes to watch him pass She smiled a little The boy on the huge bike reminded her of a monkey she had once seen riding a unicycle in the Barnum amp Bailey Circus Hes apt to kill himself though she thought turning back to her garden That bike is too big for him It was none of her problem though Bill had had more sense than to argue with the big boys when they broke out of the bushes looking like illtempered hunters on the track of a beast which had already mauled one of them Eddie however had rashly opened his mouth and Henry Bowers had unloaded on him Bill knew who they were all right Henry Belch and Victor were just about the worst kids in Derry School They had beaten up on Richie Tozier who Bill sometimes chummed with a couple of times The way Bill looked at it this was partly Richies own fault he was not known as Trashmouth for nothing One day in April Richie had said something about their collars as the three of them passed by in the schoolyard The collars had all been turned up just like Vie Morrows in The Blackboard Jungle Bill who had been sitting against the building nearby and listlessly shooting a few marbles hadnt really caught all of it Neither did Henry and his friends but they heard enough to turn in Richies direction Bill supposed Richie had meant to say whatever he said in a low voice The trouble was Richie didnt really have a low voice I didnt say nothing Richie said and that disclaimeralong with his face which looked quite sensibly dismayed and scaredmight have ended it Except that Richies mouth was like a halftamed horse that has a way of bolting for absolutely no reason at all Now it suddenly added You ought to dig the wax out of your ears big fella Want some blasting powder They stood looking at him incredulously for a moment and then they took after him Stuttering Bill had watched the unequal race from its start to its preordained conclusion from his place against the side of the building No sense getting involved those three galoots would be just as happy to beat up on two kids for the price of one Richie ran diagonally across the littlekids playyard leaping over the teetertotters and dodging among the swings realizing he had run into a blind alley only when he struck the chainlink fence between the playyard and the park which abutted the school grounds So he tried to go up the chainlink all clutching fingers and pointing seeking sneakertoes and he was maybe twothirds of the way to the top when Henry and Victor Criss hauled him back down again Henry getting him by the back of the jacket and Victor grabbing the seat of his jeans Richie was screaming when they peeled him off the fence He hit the asphalt on his back His glasses flew off He reached for them and Belch Huggins kicked them away and that was why one of the bows was mended with adhesive tape this summer Bill had winced and walked around to the front of the building He had observed Mrs Moran one of the fourthgrade teachers already hurrying over to break things up but he knew they would get Richie hard before then and by the time she actually arrived Richie would be crying Bawlbaby bawlbaby lookitthebabybawl Bill had only had minor problems with them They made fun of his stutter of course An occasional random cruelty came with the jibes one rainy day as they were going to lunch in the gym Belch Huggins had knocked Bills lunchbag out of his hand and had stomped it flat with one engineer boot squishing everything inside Oh juhjuhgee Belch cried in mock horror raising his hands and fluttering them about his face suhsuhsorry about your lllunch fuhhuhhuckface And he had strolled off down the hall toward where Victor Criss was leaning against the drinking fountain outside the boysroom door just about laughing himself into a hernia That hadnt been so bad though Bill had cadged half a PB amp J off Eddie Kaspbrak and Richie was happy to give him his devilled egg one of which his mother packed in his lunch about every second day and which made him want to puke he claimed But you had to stay out of their way and if you couldnt do that you had to try and be invisible He hadnt been too bad until the big boys went downstream and splashed across to the other side even though his nose was bleeding like a fountain When Eddies snotrag was soaked through Bill had given him his own and made him put a hand on the nape of his neck and lean his head back Bill could remember his mother getting Georgie to do that because Georgie sometimes got nosebleeds It wasnt until the sound of the big boys buffalolike progress through the Barrens had died away completely and Eddies nosebleed had actually stopped that his asthma got bad He started heaving for air his hands opening and then snapping shut like weak traps his respiration a fluting whistle in his throat He scrambled for his aspirator and finally got it out of his pocket It looked almost like a bottle of Windex the kind with the sprayer attachment on top He jammed it into his mouth and punched the trigger No Its empty Eddie looked at Bill with panicked eyes that said Im caught Bill Im caught The empty aspirator rolled away from his hand The stream chuckled on not caring in the least that Eddie Kaspbrak could barely breathe Bill thought randomly that the big boys had been right about one thing it had been a real baby dam But they had been having fun dammit and he felt a sudden dull fury that it should have come to this For the next forty minutes or so Bill sat next to him his expectation that Eddies asthma attack would at any moment let up gradually fading into unease By the time Ben Hanscom appeared the unease had become real fear It not only wasnt letting up it was getting worse And the Center Street Drug where Eddie got his refills was three miles away almost What il he went to get Eddies stuff and came back to rind Eddie unconscious Unconscious or No probably not But what if he came back and found Eddie in a comber Bill knew all about combers he had even deduced they were named after those great big waves guys surfed on in Hawaii and that seemed right enoughafter all what was a comber but a wave that drowned your brain On doctor shows like Ben Casey people were always going into combers and sometimes they stayed there in spite of all Ben Caseys illtempered shouting So he sat there knowing he ought to go he couldnt do Eddie any good staying here but not wanting to leave him alone An irrational superstitious part of him felt sure Eddie would slip into a comber the minute he Bill turned his back Then he looked upstream and saw Ben Hanscom standing there He knew who Ben was of course the fattest kid in any school has his or her own sort of unhappy notoriety Ben was in the other fifth grade Bill sometimes saw him at recess standing by himselfusually in a cornerlooking at a book and eating his lunch out of a bag about the size of a laundry sack Looking at Ben now Bill thought he looked even worse than Henry Bowers It was hard to believe but true Bill could not begin to imagine the cataclysmic fight these two must have been in Bens hair stood up in wild dirtclotted spikes His sweater or sweatshirtit was hard to tell which it had started the day as and it sure as shit didnt matter nowwas a matted ruin smeared with a sicko mixture of blood and grass His pants were out at the knees He saw Bill looking at him and recoiled a bit eyes going wary Duhduhduhhont gggo Bill cried He put his empty hands up in the air palms out to show he was harmless WWWe need some huhhuhhelp Ben came closer eyes still wary He walked as if one or both of his legs was killing him Are they gone Bowers and those guys YuhYes Bill said Listen cuhhan yyyou stay with my fruhhend while I go get his muhmedicine Hes got aaaa Ben came all the way down to the remains of the dam and dropped painfully to one knee beside Eddie who was lying back with his eyes mostly closed and his chest heaving Which one hit him Ben asked finally He looked up and Bill saw the same frustrated anger he had been feeling himself on the fat kids face Was it Henry Bowers Oh dont thank me Ben said Im the reason they landed on you in the first place Go on Hurry it up I have to be home for supper Bill went without saying anything else It would have been good to tell Ben not to take it to heartwhat had happened hadnt been Bens fault any more than it had been Eddies for stupidly opening his mouth Guys like Henry and his buddies were an accident waiting to happen the little kids version of floods or tornadoes or gallstones It would have been good to say that but he was so tightly wound right now it would have taken him about twenty minutes or so and by then Eddie might have slipped into a comber that was another thing Bill had learned from Drs Casey and Kildare you never went into a comber you always slipped into one He trotted downstream glancing back once He saw Ben Hanscom grimly collecting rocks from the edge of the water For a moment Bill couldnt figure out what he was doing and then he understood It was an ammo dump Just in case they came back The Barrens were no mystery to Bill He had played here a lot this spring sometimes with Richie more frequently with Eddie sometimes all by himself He had by no means explored the whole area but he could find his way back to Kansas Street from the Kenduskeag with no trouble and now did He came out at a wooden bridge where Kansas Street crossed one of the little noname streams that flowed out of the Derry drainage system and into the Kenduskeag down below Silver was stashed under this bridge his handlebars tied to one of the bridge supports with a hank of rope to keep his wheels out of the water Bill untied the rope stuck it in his shirt and hauled Silver up to the sidewalk by main force panting and sweating losing his balance a couple of times and landing on his tail But at last it was up Bill swung his leg over the high fork And as always once he was on Silver he became someone else The words came out deeper than his normal speaking voiceit was almost the voice of the man he would become Silver gained speed slowly the quickening clicketyciack of the Bicycle playing cards clothespinned to the spokes marking the increase Bill stood on the pedals his hands clamped on the bikegrips with the wrists turned up He looked like a man trying to lift a stupendously heavy barbell Cords stood out on his neck Veins pulsed in his temples His mouth was turned down in a trembling sneer of effort as he fought the familiar battle against weight and inertia busting his brains to get Silver moving Silver began to roll along more briskly Houses slid past smoothly instead of just poking by On his left where Kansas Street crossed Jackson the unfettered Kenduskeag became the Canal Past the intersection Kansas Street headed swiftly downhill toward Center and Main Berrys business district Streets crossed frequently here but they were all stopsigned in Bills favor and the possibility that a driver might one day blow by one of those stop signs and flatten him to a bleeding shadow on the street had never crossed Bills mind It is unlikely he would have changed his ways even if it had He might have done so either earlier or later in his life but this spring and early summer had been a strange thundery time for him Ben would have been astounded if someone were to ask him if he was lonely Bill would have been likewise astounded if someone asked him if he was courting death Of cuhcuhcourse nnot he would have responded immediately and indignantly but that did not change the fact that his runs down Kansas Street to town had become more and more like banzai charges as the weather warmed This section of Kansas Street was known as UpMile Hill Bill took it at full speed bent over Silvers handlebars to cut down the wind resistance one hand poised over the cracked rubber bulb of his oogahhorn to warn the unwary his red hair blowing back from his head in a rippling wave The click of the playing cards had mounted to a steady roar The effortful sneer had become a big goofball grin The residences on the right had given way to business buildings warehouses and meatpacking plants most of them which blurred by in a scary but satisfying rush To his left the Canal was a wink of fire in the corner of his eye Silver flew over the first curbing and as they almost always did at that point his feet lost contact with the pedals He was freewheeling now wholly in the lap of whatever god has been appointed the job of protecting small boys He swerved into the street doing maybe fifteen miles an hour over the posted speed of twentyfive It was all behind him now his stutter his dads blank hurt eyes as he puttered around his garage workshop the terrible sight of the dust on the closed piano cover upstairsdusty because his mother didnt play anymore The last time had been at Georges funeral three Methodist hymns George going out into the rain wearing his yellow slicker carrying the newspaper boat with its glaze of paraffin Mr Gardener coming up the street twenty minutes later with his body wrapped in a bloodstained quilt his mothers agonized shriek All behind him He was the Lone Ranger he was John Wayne he was Bo Diddley he was anybody he wanted to be and nobody who cried and got scared and wanted his muhmuhmother Silver flew and Stuttering Bill Denbrough flew with him their gantrylike shadow fled behind them They raced down UpMile Hill together the playing cards roared Bills feet found the pedals again and he began to pump wanting to go even faster wanting to reach some hypothetical speednot of sound but of memoryand crash through the pain barrier He raced on bent over his handlebars he raced to beat the devil The threeway intersection of Kansas Center and Main was coming up fast It was a horror of oneway traffic and conflicting signs and stoplights which were supposed to be timed but really werent The result a Derry News editorial had proclaimed the year before was a trafficrotary conceived in hell As always Bills eyes flicked right and left fast gauging the traffic flow looking for the holes If his judgment was mistakenif he stuttered you might sayhe would be badly hurt or killed He arrowed into the slowmoving traffic which dogged the intersection running a red light and fading to the right to avoid a lumbering portholed Buick He shot a bullet of a glance back over his shoulder to make sure the middle lane was empty He looked forward again and saw that in roughly five seconds he was going to crash into the rear end of a pickup truck that had stopped squarely in the middle of the intersection while the Uncle Ike type behind the wheel craned his neck to read all the signs and make sure he hadnt taken a wrong turn and somehow ended up in Miami Beach The lane on Bills right was full of a DerryBangor intercity bus He slipped in that direction just the same and shot the gap between the stopped pickup and the bus still moving at forty miles an hour At the last second he snapped his head hard to one side like a soldier doing an overenthusiastic eyesright to keep the mirror mounted on the passenger side of the pickup from rearranging his teeth Hot diesel from the bus laced his throat like a kick of strong liquor He heard a thin gasping squeal as one of his bikegrips kissed a line up the coachs aluminum side He got just a glimpse of the bus driver his face paperwhite under his peaked Hudson Bus Company cap The driver was shaking his fist at Bill and shouting something Bill doubted it was happy birthday Here was a trio of old ladies crossing Main Street from the New England Bank side to the Shoeboat side They heard the harsh burr of the playing cards and looked up Their mouths dropped open as a boy on a huge bike passed within half a foot of them like a mirage The worstand the bestof the trip was behind him now He had looked at the very real possibility of his own death again and again had found himself able to look away The bus had not crushed him he had not killed himself and the three old ladies with their Freeses shopping bags and their Social Security checks he had not been splattered across the tailgate of Uncle Ikes old Dodge pickup He was going uphill again now speed bleeding away Somethingoh call it desire that was good enough wasnt itwas bleeding away with it All the thoughts and memories were catching upin Bill gee we almost lost sight of you for awhile there but here we arerejoining him climbing up his shirt and jumping into his ear and whooshing into his brain like little kids going down a slide He could feel them settling into their accustomed places their feverish bodies jostling each other Gosh Wow Here we are inside Bills head again Lets think about George Okay Who wants to start Nothat wasnt the problem The problem was he imagined too much He turned into Richards Alley and came out on Center Street a few moments later pedaling slowly feeling the sweat on his back and in his hair He dismounted Silver in front of the Center Street Drug Store and went inside Before Georges death Bill would have gotten the salient points across to Mr Keene by speaking to him The druggist was not exactly kindor at least Bill had an idea he was notbut he was patient enough and he did not tease or make fun But now Bills stutter was much worse and he really was afraid something bad might happen to Eddie if he didnt move fast So when Mr Keene said Hello Billy Denbrough can I help you Bill took a folder advertising vitamins turned it over and wrote on the back Eddie Kaspbrak and I were playing in the Barrens Hes got a bad assmar attack I mean he can hardly breath Canyon give me a refill on his asspirador He pushed this note across the glasstopped counter to Mr Keene who read it looked at Bills anxious blue eyes and said Of course Wait right here and dont be handling anything you shouldnt Bill shifted impatiently from one foot to the other while Mr Keene was behind the rear counter Although he was back there less than five minutes it seemed an age before he returned with one of Eddies plastic squeezebottles He handed it over to Bill smiled and said This should take care of the problem Thats all right son Mrs Kaspbrak has an account here Ill just add this on Im sure shell want to thank you for your kindness Bill much relieved thanked Mr Keene and left quickly Mr Keene came around the counter to watch him go He saw Bill toss the aspirator into his bikebasket and mount clumsily Can he actually ride a bike that big Mr Keene wondered I doubt it I doubt it very much But the Denbrough kid somehow got it going without falling on his head and pedaled slowly away The bike which looked to Mr Keene like somebodys idea of a joke wobbled madly from side to side The aspirator rolled back and forth in the basket Mr Keene grinned a little If Bill had seen that grin it might have gone a good way toward confirming his idea that Mr Keene was not exactly one of the worlds champion nice guys It was sour the grin of a man who has found much to wonder about but almost nothing to uplift in the human condition Yeshe would add Eddies asthma medication to Sonia Kaspbraks bill and as always she would be surprisedand suspicious rather than gratefulat how cheap the medication was Other drugs were so dear she said Mrs Kaspbrak Mr Keene knew was one of those people who believed nothing cheap could do a person much good He could really have soaked her for her sons HydrOx Mist and there had been times when he had been tempted but why should he make himself a party to the womans foolishness It wasnt as though he were going to starve Cheap Oh my yes HydrOx Mist Administer as needed typed neatly on the gummed label he pasted on each aspirator bottle was wonderfully cheap but even Mrs Kaspbrak was willing to admit that it controlled her sons asthma quite well in spite of that fact It was cheap because it was nothing but a combination of hydrogen and oxygen with a dash of camphor added to give the mist a faint medicinal taste It took Bill longer to get back because he was going uphill In several places he had to dismount and push Silver He simply didnt have the musclepower necessary to keep the bike going up more than mild slopes By the time he had stashed his bike and made his way back to the stream it was ten past four All sorts of black suppositions were crossing his mind The Hanscom kid would have deserted leaving Eddie to die Or the bullies could have backtracked and beaten the shit out of both of them Or worst of all the man whose business was murdering kids might have gotten one or both of them As he had gotten George He knew there had been a great deal of gossip and speculation about that Bill had a bad stutter but he wasnt deafalthough people sometimes seemed to think he must be since he spoke only when absolutely necessary Some people felt that the murder of his brother wasnt related at all to the murders of Betty Ripsom Cheryl Lamonica Matthew Clements and Veronica Grogan Others claimed that George Ripsom and Lamonica had been killed by one man and the other two were the work of a copycat killer A third school of thought held that the boys had been killed by one man the girls by another Bill believed they had all been killed by the same person if it was a person He sometimes wondered about that As he sometimes wondered about his feelings concerning Derry this summer Was it still the aftermath of Georges death the way his parents seemed to ignore him now so lost in their grief over their younger son that they couldnt see the simple fact that Bill was still alive and might be hurting himself Those things combined with the other murders The voices that sometimes seemed to speak in his head now whispering to him and surely they were not variations of his own voice for these voices did not stutterthey were quiet but they were sure advising him to do certain things but not others Was it those things which made Derry seem somehow different now Somehow threatening with unexplored streets that did not invite but seemed instead to yawn in a kind of ominous silence That made some faces look secret and frightened He didnt know but he believedas he believed all the murders were the work of a single agencythat Derry really had changed and that his brothers death had signalled the beginning of that change The black suppositions in his head came from the lurking idea that anything could happen in Derry now Anything But when he came around the last bend all looked cool Ben Hanscom was still there sitting beside Eddie Eddie himself was sitting up now his hands dangling in his lap head bent still wheezing The sun had sunk low enough to project long green shadows across the stream Boy that was quick Ben said standing up I didnt expect you for another half an hour I got a fffast bbike Bill said with some pride For a moment the two of them looked at each other cautiously warily Then Ben smiled tentatively and Bill smiled back The kid was fat but he seemed okay And he had stayed put That must have taken some guts with Henry and his jd friends maybe still wandering around out there someplace Bill winked at Eddie who was looking at him with dumb gratitude HHere you ggo EEEEddie He tossed him the aspirator Eddie plunged it into his open mouth triggered it and gasped convulsively Then he leaned back eyes shut Ben watched this with concern I was scared there for awhile Ben said in a low voice I was wonderin what to do if he had a convulsion or something I kept tryin to remember the stuff they told us in that Red Cross assembly we had in April All I could come up with was put a stick in his mouth so he wouldnt bite his tongue off He wwont have a ccconvulsion anyway Bill said That mmmedicine will ffix him right up LuhLuhLook Eddies labored breathing had eased He opened his eyes and looked up at them I guess it started when they creamed your nose huh Ben asked Eddie laughed ruefully stood up and stuck the aspirator in his back pocket Wasnt even thinking about my nose Was thinking about my mom Yeah Really Ben sounded surprised but his hand went to the rags of his sweatshirt and began fiddling there nervously Shes gonna take one look at the blood on my shirt and have me down to the Mergency Room at Derry Home in about five seconds Why Ben asked It stopped didnt it Gee I remember this kid I was in kindergarten with Scooter Morgan and he got a bloody nose when he fell off the monkey bars They took him to the Mergency Room but only because it kept bleeding It doesnt matter if it stopped or not Eddie said gloomily shell take me anyway Shell think its broken and I got pieces of bone sticking in my brain or something CCCan you get bones in your buhbuhbrain Bill asked This was turning into the most interesting conversation hed had in weeks I dont know If you listen to my mother you can get anything Eddie turned to Ben again she takes me down to the Mergency Room about once or twice a month I hate that place There was this orderly once He told her they oughtta make her pay rent She was really POd Wow Ben said He thought Eddies mother must be really weird He was unconscious of the fact that now both of his hands were fiddling in the remains of his sweatshirt Why dont you just say no Say something like Hey Ma I feel all right I just want to stay home and watch Sea Hunt Like that Eddie Kaspbrak Eddie said I hate it when you stutter my name Bill You sound like Elmer Fudd Well Im pleased to meet you both Ben said It came out sounding prissy and a little lame A silence fell amid the three of them It was not an entirely uncomfortable silence In it they became friends Ben was silent a momentmostly in admirationbefore Bills use of what Bens mother sometimes called The Really Bad Word Ben had never said The Really Bad Word out loud in his whole life although he had written it in extremely small letters on a telephone pole the Halloween before last Bowers ended up sitting next to me during the exams Ben said at last He wanted to copy off my paper I wouldnt let him Stuttering Bill burst out laughing Ben looked at him sharply decided he wasnt being laughed at exactly it was hard to say how he knew it but he did and grinned I guess I must he said Anyway hes got to take summerschool and he and those other two guys were laying for me and thats what happened I fell down here from Kansas Street Down the side of the hill He looked at Eddie Ill probably see you in the Mergency Room now that I think about it When my mom gets a look at my clothes shell put me there Both Bill and Eddie burst out laughing this time and Ben joined them It hurt his stomach to laugh but he laughed anyway shrilly and a little hysterically Finally he had to sit down on the bank and the plopping sound his butt made when it hit the dirt got him going all over again He liked the way his laughter sounded with theirs It was a sound he had never heard before not mingled laughterhe had heard that lots of timesbut mingled laughter of which his own was a part He looked up at Bill Denbrough their eyes met and that was all it took to get both of them laughing again Bill hitched up his pants flipped up the collar of his shirt and began to slouch around in a kind of moody hoody strut His voice dropped down low and he said Im gonna killya kid Dont gimme no crap Im dumb but Im big I can crack walnuts with my forehead I can piss vinegar and shit cement My names Honeybunch Bowers and Im the boss prick round deseyere Derry parts Eddie had collapsed to the streambank now and was rolling around clutching his stomach and howling Ben was doubled up head between his knees tears spouting from his eyes snot hanging from his nose in long white runners laughing like a hyena Bill sat down with them and little by little the three of them quieted Theres one really good thing about it Eddie said presently If Bowers is in summer school we wont see him much down here You play in the Barrens a lot Ben asked It was an idea that never would have crossed his own mind in a thousand yearsnot with the reputation the Barrens hadbut now that he was down here it didnt seem bad at all In fact this stretch of the low bank was very pleasant as the afternoon made its slow way toward dusk SSSure Its nneat MMostly nnobody bbuhbothers uus down hhere We guhguhhoof off a lot BBBowers and those uhother gguys dont come ddown here ehehanyway RuhRuhRuh Bill shook his head His face knotted up like a wet dishrag when he stuttered Ben noticed and suddenly an odd thought occurred to him Bill hadnt stuttered at all when he was mocking the way Henry Bowers talked Richie Bill exclaimed now paused a moment and then went on Richie TTozier usually ccomes down too But hhim and his ddad were going to clean out their ahahah Attic Eddie translated and tossed a stone into the water Plonk Yeah I know him Ben said You guys come down here a lot huh The idea fascinated himand made him feel a stupid sort of longing as well PuhPuhPretty much Bill said WuhWhy ddont you cccome back down tuhhuhmorrow MMe and EEEddie were tubtrying to make a duhduhham Ben could say nothing He was astounded not only by the offer but by the simple and unstudied casualness with which it had come Maybe we ought to do something else Eddie said The dam wasnt working so hot anyway Ben got up and walked down to the stream brushing the dirt from his huge hams There were still matted piles of small branches at either side of the stream but anything else theyd put together had washed away You ought to have some boards Ben said Get boards and put em in a row facing each other like the bread of a sandwich Bill and Eddie were looking at him puzzled Ben dropped to one knee Look he said Boards here and here You stick em in the streambed facing each other Okay Then before the water can wash them away you fill up the space between them with rocks and sand Oh Ben said feeling and looking he was sure extremely stupid But he didnt care if he looked stupid because he suddenly felt very happy He couldnt even remember the last time he felt this happy Yeah We Anyway if youwefill up the space in between with rocks and stuff itll stay The upstream board will lean back against the rocks and dirt as the water piles up The second board would tilt back and wash away after awhile I guess but if we had a third board well look He drew in the dirt with a stick Bill and Eddie Kaspbrak leaned over and studied this little drawing with sober interest You ever built a dam before Eddie asked His tone was respectful almost awed Ben looked at Bill puzzled sure it will he said Why wouldnt it But hhow do you nuhnuhknow Bill asked Ben recognized the tone of the question as one not of sarcastic disbelief but honest interest HHow can yyou tell I just know Ben said He looked down at his drawing in the dirt again as if to confirm it to himself He had never seen a cofferdam in his life either in diagram or in fact and had no idea that he had just drawn a pretty fair representation of one OOkay Bill said and clapped Ben on the back sSee you tuhhuhmorrow If me and my mom arent still waiting at the Mergency Room Eddie said and sighed Ill bring some boards Ben said This old guy on the next blocks got a bunch of em Ill hawk a few Bring some supplies too Eddie said stuff to eat You know like sanwidges RingDings stuff like that I got my Daisy air rifle Ben said My mom gave it to me for Christmas but she gets mad if I shoot it off in the house Okay Ben said happily Listen I got to split for home you guys The three of them left the Barrens together Ben helped Bill push Silver up the embankment Eddie trailed behind them wheezing again and looking unhappily at his bloodspotted shirt Bill said goodbye and then pedaled off shouting Hiyo Silver AWAYYY at the top of his lungs Bet your fur Eddie said He had taken another gulp from his aspirator and was breathing normally again He rides me double sometimes on the back Goes so fast it just about scares the crap outta me Hes a good man Bill is He said this last in an offhand way but his eyes said something more emphatic They were worshipful You know about what happened to his brother dont you Got killed last fail Some guy killed him Pulled one of his arms right off just like pulling a wing off n a fly Bill he used to only stutter a little Now its really bad Did you notice that he stutters Anyway I just told you because if you want Bill to be your friend its better not to talk to him about his little brother Dont ask him questions or anythin Hes all frigged up about it Man I would be too Ben said He remembered now vaguely about the little kid who had been killed the previous fall He wondered if his mother had been thinking about George Denbrough when she gave him the watch he now wore or only about the more recent killings did it happen right after the big flood They had reached the corner of Kansas and Jackson where they would have to split up Kids ran here and there playing tag and throwing baseballs One dorky little kid in big blue shorts went trotting selfimportantly past Ben and Eddie wearing a Davy Crockett coonskin backward so that the tail hung down between his eyes He was rolling a Hula Hoop and yelling Hooptag you guys Hooptag wanna The two bigger boys looked after him amused and then Eddie said Well I gotta go Wait a sec Ben said I got an idea if you really dont want to go to the Mergency Room Oh yeah Eddie looked at Ben doubtful but wanting to hope Ben eyed the drying maroon splotches on Eddies shirt stop at the store and get a chocolate milk Pour about half of it on your shirt Then when you get home tell your mama you spilled all of it Eddies eyes brightened In the four years since his dad had died his mothers eyesight had worsened considerably For reasons of vanity and because she didnt know how to drive a car she refused to see an optometrist and get glasses Dried bloodstains and chocolate milk stains looked about the same Maybe Just dont tell her it was my idea if she finds out No Eddie said patiently When I say that youre supposed to say After awhile crocodile Eddie looked more than embarrassed he looked almost nervous Bill is he said and started off Ben watched him go down Jackson Street and then turned toward home Three blocks up the street he saw three alltoofamiliar figures standing at the bus stop on the corner of Jackson and Main They were mostly turned away from Ben which was damned lucky for him He ducked behind a hedge his heart beating hard Five minutes later the DerryNewportHaven interurban bus pulled up Henry and his friends pitched their butts into the street and swung aboard Ben waited until the bus was out of sight and then hurried home That night a terrible thing happened to Bill Denbrough It happened for the second time His mom and dad were downstairs watching TV not talking much sitting at either end of the couch like bookends There had been a time when the TV room opening off the kitchen would have been full of talk and laughter sometimes so much of both you couldnt hear the TV at all shut up Georgie Bill would roar stop hogging all the popcorn and I will George would return Ma make Bill give me the popcorn Bill give him the popcorn George dont call me Ma Mas a sound a sheep makes Or his dad would tell a joke and they would all laugh even Mom George didnt always get the jokes Bill knew but he laughed because everyone else was laughing In those days his mom and dad had also been bookends on the couch but he and George had been the books Bill had tried to be a book between them while they were watching TV since Georges death but it was cold work They sent the cold out from both directions and Bills defroster was simply not big enough to cope with it He had to leave because that kind of cold always froze his cheeks and made his eyes water WWant to hhear a joke I heard today in ssschool he had tried once some months ago Silence from them On television a criminal was begging his brother who was a priest to hide him Bills dad glanced up from the True he was looking at and glanced at Bill with mild surprise Then he looked back down at the magazine again There was a picture of a hunter sprawled in a snowbank and staring up at a huge snarling polar bear Mauled by the Killer from the White Wastes was the name of the article Bill had thought I know where theres some white wastesright between my dad and mom on this couch Its about hhow many FFFrenchmen it takes to sccherew in a luhhhhightbulb Bill plunged ahead He felt a fine mist of sweat spring out upon his forehead as it sometimes did in school when he knew the teacher had ignored him as long as she safely could and must soon call on him His voice was too loud but he couldnt seem to lower it The words echoed in his head like crazy chimes echoing jamming up spilling out again One to hold the bulb and four to turn the house Zack Denbrough said absently and turned the page of his magazine Did you say something dear his mother asked and on Four Star Playhouse the brother who was a priest told the brother who was a hoodlum to turn himself in and pray for forgiveness Bill sat there sweating but coldso cold It was cold because he wasnt really the only book between those two ends Georgie was still there only now it was a Georgie he couldnt see a Georgie who never demanded the popcorn or hollered that Bill was pinching This new version of George never cut up dickens It was a onearmed Georgie who was palely thoughtfully silent in the Motorolas shadowy whiteandblue glow and perhaps it was not from his parents but from George that the big chill was really coming perhaps it was George who was the real killer from the white wastes Finally Bill had fled from that cold invisible brother and into his room where he lay face down on his bed and cried into his pillow Georges room was just as it had been on the day he died Zack had put a bunch of Georges toys into a canon one day about two weeks after he was buried meaning them for the Goodwill or the Salvation Army or someplace like that Bill supposed Sharon Denbrough had spotted him coming out with the box in his arms and her hands had flown to her head like startled white birds and plunged themselves deep into her hair where they locked themselves into pulling fists Bill had seen this and had fallen against the wall the strength suddenly running out of his legs His mother looked as mad as Elsa Lanchester in The Bride of Frankenstein Zack flinched and then took the box of toys back into Georges room without a word He even put them back in exactly the same places from which he had taken them Bill came in and saw his father kneeling by Georges bed which his mother still changed although only once a week now instead of twice with his head on his hairy muscular forearms Bill saw his father was crying and this increased his terror A frightening possibility suddenly occurred to him maybe sometimes things didnt just go wrong and then stop maybe sometimes they just kept going wronger and wronger until everything was totally fucked up Go on Bill his father said His voice was muffled and shaking His back went up and down Bill badly wanted to touch his fathers back to see if perhaps his hand might be able to still that restless heaving He did not quite dare Go on buzz off He left and went creeping along the upstairs hall hearing his mother doing her own crying down in the kitchen The sound was shrill and helpless Bill thought Why are they crying so far apart and then he shoved the thought away On the first night of summer vacation Bill went into Georgies room His heart was beating heavily in his chest and his legs felt stiff and awkward with tension He came to Georges room often but that didnt mean he liked it in here The room was so full of Georges presence that it felt haunted He came in and couldnt help thinking that the closet door might creak open at any moment and there would be Georgie among the shirts and pants still neatly hung in there a Georgie dressed in a rainslicker covered with red splotches and streaks a rainslicker with one dangling yellow arm Georges eyes would be blank and terrible the eyes of a zombie in a horror movie When he came out of the closet his galoshes would make squishy sounds as he walked across the room toward where Bill sat on his bed a frozen block of terror If the power had gone out some evening while he sat here on Georges bed looking at the pictures on Georges wall or the models on top of Georges dresser he felt sure a heart attack probably fatal would ensue in the next ten seconds or so But he went anyway Warring with his terror of Georgetheghost was a mute and grasping needa hungerto somehow get over Georges death and find a decent way to go on Not to forget George but somehow to find a way to make him not so fucking gruesome He understood that his parents were not succeeding very well with that and if he was going to do it for himself he would have to do it by himself Nor was it just for himself that he came he came for Georgie as well He had loved George and for brothers they had gotten along pretty well Oh they had their pissy momentsBill giving George a good old Indian ropeburn George tattling on Bill when Bill snuck downstairs after lightsout and ate the rest of the lemoncream frostingbut mostly they got along Bad enough that George should be dead For him to turn George into some kind of horrormonster that was even worse He missed the little kid that was the truth Missed his voice his laughtermissed the way Georges eyes sometimes tipped confidently up to his own sure that Bill would have whatever answers were required And one surpassingly odd thing there were times when he felt he loved George best in his fear because even in his fearhis uneasy feelings that a zombieGeorge might be lurking in the closet or under the bedhe could remember loving George better in here and George loving him In his effort to reconcile these two emotionshis love and his terrorBill felt that he was closest to finding where final acceptance lay These were not things of which he could have spoken to his mind the ideas were nothing but an incoherent jumble But his warm and desiring heart understood and that was all that mattered Sometimes he looked through Georges books sometimes he sifted through Georges toys Now on the night after meeting Ben Hanscom Bill opened the door of Georges closet steeling himself as always to meet the sight of Georgie himself standing in his bloody slicker amid the hanging clothes expecting as always to see one pallid fishfingered hand come pistoning out of the dark to grip his arm and took the album down from the top shelf MY PHOTOGRAPHS the gold script on the front read Below Scotchtaped on the tape was now slightly yellow and peeling the carefully printed words GEORGE ELMER DENBROUGH AGE Bill took it back to the bed Georgie had slept in his heart beating heavier than ever He couldnt tell what had made him get the photograph album down again After what had happened in December A second look thats all Just to convince yourself that it wasnt real the first time That the first time was just your head playing a trick on itself It might even be true But Bill suspected it was just the album itself It held a certain mad fascination for him What he had seen or what he thought he had seen He opened the album now It was filled with pictures George had gotten his mother father aunts and uncles to give him George didnt care if they were pictures of people and places he knew or not it was the idea of photography itself which fascinated him When he had been unsuccessful at pestering anyone into giving him new photos to mount he would sit crosslegged on his bed where Bill was sitting now and look at the old ones turning the pages carefully studying the blackandwhite Kodaks Here was their mother when she was young and impossibly gorgeous here their father no more than eighteen one of a trio of smiling rifletoting young men standing over the openeyed corpse of a deer Uncle Hoyt standing on some rocks and holding up a pickerel Aunt Fortuna at the Derry Agricultural Fair kneeling proudly beside a basket of tomatoes she had raised an old Buick automobile a church a house a road that went from somewhere to somewhere All these pictures snapped by lost somebodies for lost reasons locked up here in a dead boys album of photographs Here Bill saw himself at three propped up in a hospital bed with a turban of bandages covering his hair Bandages went down his cheeks and under his fractured jaw He had been struck by a car in the parking lot of the A ampP on Center Street He remembered very little of his hospital stay only that they had given him icecream milk shakes through a straw and his head had ached dreadfully for three days Here was the whole family on the lawn of the house Bill standing by his mother and holding her hand and George only a baby sleeping in Zacks arms And here It wasnt the end of the book but it was the last page that mattered because the following ones were all blank The final picture was Georges school picture taken in October of last year less than ten days before he died In it George was wearing a crewneck shirt His flyaway hair was slicked down with water He was grinning revealing two empty slots in which new teeth would never growunless they keep on growing after you die Bill thought and shuddered He looked at the picture fixedly for some time and was about to close the book when what had happened in December happened again Georges eyes rolled in the picture They turned up to meet Bills own Georges artificial saycheese smile turned into a horrid leer His right eye drooped closed in a wink See you soon Bill In my closet Maybe tonight Bill threw the book across the room He clapped his hands over his mouth The book struck the wall and fell to the floor open The pages turned although there was no draft The book opened itself to that awful picture again the picture which said SCHOOL FRIENDS beneath it Bill sat frozen his tongue a swelling choking lump in his mouth his skin crawling his hair lifting He wanted to scream but the tiny whimpering sounds crawling out of his throat seemed to be the best he could manage The blood flowed across the page and began to drip onto the floor They werent all found No they werent all found And from time to time wrong assumptions were made Edward L Corcoran of Charter Street Derry was reported missing last night by his mother Monica Macklin and his stepfather Richard P Macklin The Corcoran boy is ten His disappearance has prompted new fears that Derrys young people are being stalked by a killer Mrs Macklin said the boy had been missing since June th when he failed to return home from school after the last day of classes before summer vacation When asked why they had delayed over twentyfour hours before reporting their sons absence Mr and Mrs Macklin refused comment Police Chief Richard Borton also declined comment but a Police Department source told the News that the Corcoran boys relationship with his stepfather was not a good one and that he had spent nights out of the house before The source speculated that the boys final grades may have played a part in the boys failure to turn up Derry School Superintendent Harold Metcalf declined comment on the Corcoran boys grades pointing out they are not a matter of public record I hope the disappearance of this boy will not cause unnecessary fears Chief Borton said last night The mood of the community is understandably uneasy but I want to emphasize that we log thirty to fifty missingpersons reports on minors each and every year Most turn up alive and well within a week of the initial report This will be the case with Edward Corcoran God willing Borton also reiterated his conviction that the murders of George Denbrough Betty Ripsom Cheryl Lamonica Matthew Clements and Veronica Grogan were not the work of one person There are essential differences in each crime Borton said but declined to elaborate He said that local police working in close cooperation with the Maine State Attorney Generals office are still following up a number of leads Asked in a telephone interview last night how good these leads are Chief Borton replied Very good Asked if an arrest in any of the crimes was expected soon Borton declined comment In a bizarre new twist to the disappearance of Edward Corcoran Derry District Court Judge Erhardt K Moulton ordered the exhumation of Corcorans younger brother Dorsey late yesterday The court order followed a joint request from the County Attorney and the County Medical Examiner Dorsey Corcoran who also lived with his mother and stepfather at Charter Street died of what were reported to be accidental causes in May of  The boy was brought into the Derry Home Hospital suffering from multiple fractures including a fractured skull Richard P Macklin the boys stepfather was the admitting person He stated that Dorsey Corcoran had been playing on a stepladder in the garage and had apparently fallen from the top The boy died without recovering consciousness three days later Edward Corcoran ten was reported missing late Wednesday Asked if either Mr or Mrs Macklin was under suspicion in either the younger boys death or the older boys disappearance Chief Richard Borton declined comment Chief Richard Borton of the Derry Police called a news conference yesterday to announce that Richard P Macklin of Charter Street had been arrested and charged with the murder of his stepson Dorsey Corcoran The Corcoran boy died in Derry Home Hospital of reported accidental causes on May st of last year The medical examiners report shows that the boy was badly beaten Borton said Although Macklin claimed the boy had fallen from a stepladder while playing in the garage Borton said the County Medical Examiners report showed that Dorsey Corcoran was severely beaten with some blunt instrument When asked what sort of instrument Borton said It might have been a hammer Right now the important thing is the medical examiners conclusion that this boy was struck repeated blows with some object hard enough to break his bones The wounds particularly those in the skull are not at all consistent with those which might be incurred in a fall Dorsey Corcoran was beaten within an inch of his life and then dumped off at the Home Hospital emergency room to die Asked if the doctors who treated the Corcoran boy might have been derelict in their duty when it came to reporting either an incidence of child abuse or the actual cause of death Borton said They will have serious questions to answer when Mr Macklin comes to trial Asked for an opinion on how these developments might bear on the recent disappearance of Dorsey Corcorans older brother Edward reported missing by Richard and Monica Macklin four days ago Chief Borton answered I think it looks much more serious than we first supposed dont you Henrietta Dumont who teaches fifth grade at Derry Elementary School on Jackson Street said that Edward Corcoran who has now been missing for nearly a week often came to school covered with bruises Mrs Dumont who has taught one of Derrys two fifthgrade classes since the end of World War II said that the Corcoran boy came to school one day about three weeks before his disappearance with both eyes nearly closed shut When I asked him what happened he said his father had taken him up for not eating his supper When asked why she had not reported a beating of such obvious severity Mrs Dumont said This isnt the first time Ive seen such a thing as this in my career as a teacher The first few times I had a student with a parent who was confusing beatings with discipline I tried to do something about it I was told by the assistant principal Gwendolyn Rayburn in those days to stay out of it She told me that when school employees get involved in cases of suspected child abuse it always comes back to haunt the School Department at tax appropriation tune I went to the principal and he told me to forget it or I would be reprimanded I asked him if a reprimand in a matter like that would go on my record He said a reprimand did not have to be on a teachers record I got the message Asked if the attitude in the Derry school system remained the same now Mrs Dumont said Well what does it look like in light of this current situation And I might add that I would not be speaking to you now if I hadnt retired at the end of this school year Mrs Dumont went on since this thing came out I get down on my knees every night and pray that Eddie Corcoran just got fed up with that beast of a stepfather and ran away I pray that when he reads in the paper or hears on the news that Macklin has been locked up Eddie will come home In a brief telephone interview Monica Macklin hotly refuted Mrs Dumonts charges Rich never beat Dorsey and he never beat Eddie either she said Im telling you that right now and when I die Ill stand at the Throne of Judgment and look God right in the eye and tell Him the same thing A local nurseryschool teacher who declined to be identified told a News reporter yesterday that young Dorsey Corcoran came to his twiceweekly nurseryschool class with bad sprains of his right thumb and three fingers of his right hand less than a week before his death in a purported garage accident It was hurting him enough so that the poor little guy couldnt color his Mr Do safety poster the teacher said The fingers were swelled up like sausages When I asked Dorsey what happened he said that his father stepfather Richard P Macklin had bent his fingers back because he had walked across a floor his mother had just washed and waxed Daddy had to take me up cause Im bad was the way he put it I felt like crying looking at his poor dear fingers He really wanted to color his poster like the other children so I gave him some baby aspirin and let him color while the others were having Story Time He loved to color the Mr Do postersthat was what he liked bestand now Im so glad I was able to help him have a little happiness that day When he died it never crossed my mind to think it was anything but an accident I guess at first I thought he must have fallen because he couldnt grip very well with that hand Now I think I just couldnt believe an adult could do such a thing to a little person I know better now I wish to God I didnt Dorsey Corcorans older brother Edward ten is still missing From his cell in Derry County Jail Richard Macklin continues to deny any part in either the death of his younger stepson or the disappearance of the older boy In a dramatic development in the District Court trial of Richard Macklin for the murder of his stepson Dorsey Corcoran Macklin broke down under the stern crossexamination of County Attorney Bradley Whitsun and admitted he had beaten the fouryearold boy to death with a recoilless hammer which he then buried at the far end of his wifes vegetable garden before taking the boy to Derry Home Hospitals emergency room The courtroom was stunned and silent as the sobbing Macklin who had previously admitted beating both of his stepsons occasionally if they had it coming for their own good poured out his story I dont know what came over me I saw he was climbing on the damn ladder again and I grabbed the hammer from the bench where it was laying and I just started to use it on him I didnt mean to kill him With God as my witness I never meant to kill him Did he say anything to you before he passed out Whitsun asked He said Stop daddy Im sorry I love you Macklin replied Eventually Macklin said He then began to weep in such a hysterical manner that Judge Erhardt Moulton declared the court in recess His stepfather sentenced to a term of two to ten years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his fouryearold brother Dorsey continues to claim he has no idea where Edward Corcoran is His mother who has instituted divorce proceedings against Richard P Macklin says she thinks her soontobe exhusband is lying I for one really dont think so says Father Ashley OBrian who serves the Catholic prisoners at Shawshank Macklin began taking instruction in the Catholic faith shortly after beginning his prison term and Father OBrian has spent a good deal of time with him He is sincerely sorry for what he has done Father OBrian goes on adding that when he initially asked Macklin why he wanted to be a Catholic Macklin replied I hear they have an act of contrition and I need to do a lot of that or else Ill go to hell when I die He knows what he did to the younger boy Father OBrian said If he also did something to the older one he doesnt remember it As far as Edward goes he believes his hands are clean How clean Macklins hands are in the matter of his stepson Edward is a question which continues to trouble Derry residents but he has been convincingly cleared of the other childmurders which have taken place here He was able to produce ironclad alibis for the first three and he was in jail when seven others were committed in late June July and August In an exclusive interview with the News last week Macklin again asserted that he knows nothing of Edward Corcorans whereabouts I beat them both he said in a painful monologue which was often halted by bouts of weeping I loved them but I beat them I dont know why any more than I know why Monica let me or why she covered up for me after Dorsey died I guess I could have killed Eddie as easy as I did Dorsey but I swear before God and Jesus and all the saints of heaven that I didnt I know how it looks but I didnt do it I think he just ran away If he did thats one thing Ive got to thank God for Asked if he is aware of any gaps in his memoryif he could have killed Edward and then blocked it out of his mindMacklin replied I aint aware of any gaps I know only too well what I did Ive given my life to Christ and Im going to spend the rest of it trying to make up for it Police Chief Richard Borton told reporters early today that the badly decomposed body of a boy about the age of Edward Corcoran who disappeared from his Derry home in June of is definitely not that of the missing youth The body was found in Aynesford Massachusetts buried in a gravel pit Both Maine and Massachusetts State Police at first theorized that the body might be that of the Corcoran boy believing that he might have been picked up by a child molester after running away from the Charter Street home where his younger brother had been beaten and killed Dental charts showed conclusively that the body found in Aynesford was not that of the Corcoran youth who has now been missing for nineteen months Richard P Macklin who was convicted of the murder of his fouryearold stepson nine years ago was found dead in his small thirdfloor Falmouth apartment late yesterday afternoon The parolee who had lived and worked quietly in Falmouth since his release from Shawshank State Prison in was an apparent suicide The note he left indicates an extremely confused state of mind Assistant Falmouth Police Chief Brandon K Roche said He refused to divulge the notes contents but a Police Department source said it consisted of two sentences I saw Eddie last night He was dead The Eddie referred to may well have been Macklins stepson brother of the boy Macklin was convicted of killing in It was the disappearance of Edward Corcoran which eventually led to Macklins conviction for the beating death of Edwards younger brother Dorsey The elder boy has been missing for nine years In a brief court proceeding in  the boys mother had her son declared legally dead so she could enter into possession of Edward Corcorans savings account The account contained a sum of sixteen dollars He died on the night of June th and his stepfather had nothing at all to do with it He died as Ben Hanscom sat home watching TV with his mother as Eddie Kaspbraks mother anxiously felt Eddies forehead for signs of her favorite ailment phantom fever as Beverly Marshs stepfathera gent who bore in temperament at least a remarkable resemblance to Eddie and Dorsey Corcorans stepfatherLifted a highstepping kick into the girls derriere and told her to get out there and dry those goddam dishes like your mummer told you as Mike Hanlon got yelled at by some highschool boys one of whom would some years later sire that fine upstanding young homophobe John Webby Garton passing in an old Dodge while Mike pulled weeds out of the garden beside the small Hanlon home out on Witcham Road not far from the farm owned by Henry Bowerss crazy father as Richie Tozier was sneaking a look at the halfundressed girls in a copy of Gem he had found at the bottom of his fathers socksandunderwear drawer and getting a regular good boner and as Bill Denbrough was throwing his dead brothers photograph album across the room in horrified unbelief Although none of them would remember doing so later all of them looked up at the exact moment Eddie Corcoran died as if hearing some distant cry The News had been absolutely right about one thing Eddies rankcard was just bad enough to make him afraid to go home and face his stepdad Also his mother and the old man were fighting a lot this month That made things even worse When they got going at it hot and heavy his mother shouted a lot of mostly incoherent accusations His stepdad responded to these first with grunts then yells to shut up and finally with the enraged bellows of a boar which has gotten a quiver of porcupine needles in its snout Eddie had never seen the old man use his fists on her though Eddie didnt think he quite dared He had saved his fists for Eddie and Dorsey in the old days and now that Dorsey was dead Eddie got his little brothers share as well as his own These shouting matches came and went in cycles They were most common at the end of the month when the bills came in A policeman called by a neighbor might drop by once or twice when things were at their worst and tell them to tone it down Usually that ended it His mother was apt to give the cop the finger and dare him to take her in but his stepdad rarely said boo He lay low during these periods of stress It was wiser If you didnt think so just look at what had happened to Dorsey Eddie didnt know the specifics and didnt want to but he had an idea about Dorsey He thought that Dorsey had been in the wrong place at the wrong time the garage on the last day of the month They told Eddie that Dorsey fell off the stepladder in the garageIf I told him once to stay off n it I told him sixty times his stepdad had saidbut his mother wouldnt look at him except by accident and when their eyes did meet Eddie had seen a frightened ratty little gleam in hers that he didnt like The old man just sat there silently at the kitchen table with a quart of Rheingold looking at nothing from beneath his heavy lowering eyebrows Eddie kept out of his reach When his stepfather was bellowing he was usuallynot always but usuallyall right It was when he stopped that you had to be careful Two nights ago he had thrown a chair at Eddie when Eddie got up to see what was on the other TV channeljust picked up one of the tubular aluminum kitchen chairs swept it back over his head and let fly It hit Eddie in the butt and knocked him over His butt still ached but he knew it could have been worse it could have been his head Then there had been the night when the old man had suddenly gotten up and rubbed a handful of mashed potatoes into Eddies hair for no reason at all One day last September Eddie had come in from school and foolishly allowed the screen door to slam shut behind him while his stepdad was taking a nap Macklin came out of the bedroom in his billowy boxer shorts hair standing up in corkscrews cheeks grizzled with two days of weekend beard breath grizzled with two days of weekend beer There now Eddie he said I got to take you up for slammin that fuckin door In Rich Macklins lexicon taking you up was a euphemism for beating the shit out of you Which was what he then did to Eddie Eddie had lost consciousness when the old man threw him into the front hall His mother had mounted a pair of low coathooks out there especially for him and Dorsey to hang their coats on These hooks had rammed hard steel fingers into Eddies lower back and that was when he passed out When he came to ten minutes later he heard his mother yelling that she was going to take Eddie to the hospital and he couldnt stop her After what happened to Dorsey his stepdad had responded You want to go to jail woman That was the end of her talk about the hospital She helped Eddie in to his room where he lay shivering on his bed his forehead beaded with sweat The only time he left the room during the next three days was when they were both gone Then he would hobble slowly into the kitchen groaning softly and get his stepdads whiskey from under the sink A few nips dulled the pain The pain was mostly gone by the fifth day but he had pissed blood for almost two weeks Oh the Craftsman hammerthe ordinary hammerwas still there It was the Scotti recoilless which was missing His stepdads special hammer the one he and Dorsey had been forbidden to touch If one of you touches that baby he had told them the day he bought it youll both be wearing your guts for earmuffs Dorsey had asked timidly if that hammer was very expensive The old man told him he was damn tooting He said it was filled with ballbearings and you couldnt make it bounce back up no matter how hard you brought it down Eddies grades werent the best because he had missed a lot of school since his mothers remarriage but he was not a stupid boy by any means He thought he knew what had happened to the Scotti recoilless hammer He thought maybe his stepfather had used it on Dorsey and then buried it in the garden or maybe thrown it in the Canal It was the sort of thing that happened frequently in the horror comics Eddie read the ones he kept on the top shelf of his closet He walked closer to the Canal which rippled between its concrete sides like oiled silk A swatch of moonlight glimmered across its dark surface in a boomerang shape He sat down swinging his sneakers idly against the concrete in an irregular tattoo The last six weeks had been quite dry and the water flowed past perhaps nine feet below the worn soles of his sneakers But if you looked closely at the Canals sides you could read the various levels to which it sometimes rose quite easily The concrete was stained a dark brown just above the waters current level This brown stain slowly faded to yellow then to a color that was almost white at the level where the heels of Eddies sneakers made contact when he swung them The water flowed smoothly and silently out of a concrete arch that was cobbled on the inside past the place where Eddie sat and then down to the covered wooden footbridge between Bassey Park and Derry High School The bridges sides and plank footingeven the beams under the roofwere covered with an intaglio of initials phone numbers and declarations Declarations of love declarations that Soandso was willing to suck or blow declarations that those discovered sucking or blowing would lose their foreskins or have their assholes plugged with hot tar occasional eccentric declarations that defied definition One that Eddie had puzzled over all this spring read SAVE RUSSIAN JEWS COLLECT VALUABLE PRIZES Eddie didnt go into the Kissing Bridge tonight he had no urge to cross over to the highschool side He thought he would probably sleep in the park maybe in the dead leaves under the bandstand but for now it was fine just to sit here He liked it in the park and came often when he had to think Sometimes there were people making out in the groves of trees which dotted the park but Eddie left them alone and they left him alone He had heard lurid stories in the playground at school about the queers that cruised in Bassey Park after sundown and he accepted these stories without question but he himself had never been bothered The park was a peaceful place and he thought the best part of it was right here where he was sitting He liked it in the middle of summer when the water was so low it chuckled over the stones and actually broke up into isolated streamlets that twisted and turned and sometimes came together again He liked it in late March or early April just after iceout when he would sometimes stand by the Canal too cold to sit then your ass would freeze for an hour or more the hood of his old parka now two years too small for him pulled up his hands plunged into his pockets unaware that his skinny body was shivering and shaking The Canal had a terrible irresistible power in the week or two after the ice went out He was fascinated by the way the water boiled whitely out of the cobbled arch and roared past him bearing sticks and branches and all manner of human trash along with it More than once he had envisioned walking beside the Canal in March with his stepdad and giving the bastard a great big motherfucking push He would scream and fall in his arms pinwheeling for balance and Eddie would stand on the concrete parapet and watch him carried off downstream his head a black bobbing shape in the middle of the unruly whitecapped current He would stand there yes and he would cup his hands around his mouth and scream THAT WAS FOR DORSEY YOU ROTTEN COCKSUCKER WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO HELL TELL THE DEVIL THE LAST THING YOU EVER HEARD WAS ME TELLING YOU TO PICK ON SOMEBODY YOUR OWN SIZE It would never happen of course but it was an absolutely grand fantasy A grand dream to dream as you sat here by the Canal a g He had been looking across the Canal toward the school smiling a sleepy and rather beautiful smile as he imagined his stepfather being carried off in the violent rip of the spring runoff being carried out of his life forever The soft yet strong grip startled him so much that he almost lost his balance and tumbled into the Canal Its one of the queers the big kids are always talking about he thought and then he looked down His mouth dropped open Urine spilled hotly down his legs and stained his jeans black in the moonlight It wasnt a queer It was Dorsey as he had been buried Dorsey in his blue blazer and gray pants only now the blazer was in muddy tatters Dorseys shirt was yellow rags Dorseys pants clung wetly to legs as thin as broomsticks And Dorseys head was horribly slumped as if it had been caved in at the back and consequently pushed up in the front Eddieeeee his dead brother croaked just like one of the dead people who were always coming back from the grave in the horror comics Dorseys grin widened Yellow teeth gleamed and somewhere way back in that darkness things seemed to be squirming Eddie tried to scream Waves of gray shock rolled over him and he had the curious sensation that he was floating But it was not a dream he was awake The hand on his sneaker was as white as a trouts belly His brothers bare feet clung somehow to the concrete Something had bitten one of Dorseys heels off Eddie couldnt scream His lungs didnt have enough ahin them to manage a scream He got out a curious reedy moaning sound Anything louder seemed beyond him That was all right In a second or two his mind would snap and after that nothing would matter Dorseys hand was small but implacable Eddies buttocks were sliding over the concrete to the edge of the Canal Still making that reedy moaning sound he reached behind himself and grabbed the concrete edging and yanked himself backward He felt the hand slide away momentarily heard an angry hiss and had time to think Thats not Dorsey I dont know what it is but its not Dorsey Then adrenaline flooded his body and he was crawling away trying to run even before he was on his feet his breath coming in short shrieky whistles White hands appeared on the concrete lip of the Canal There was a wet slapping sound Drops of water flew upward in the moonlight from dead pallid skin Now Dorseys face appeared over the edge Dim red sparks gleamed in his sunken eyes His wet hair was plastered to his skull Mud streaked his cheeks like warpaint Eddies chest finally unlocked He hitched in breath and turned it into a scream He got to his feet and ran He ran looking back over his shoulder needing to see where Dorsey was and as a result he ran smack into a large elm tree It felt as if someonehis old man for instancehad set off a dynamite charge in his left shoulder Stars shot and corkscrewed through his head He fell at the base of the tree as if poleaxed blood trickling from his left temple He swam in the waters of semiconsciousness for perhaps ninety seconds Then he managed to gain his feet again A groan escaped him as he tried to raise his left arm It didnt want to come Felt all numb and far away So he raised his right and rubbed his fiercely aching head Then he remembered why he had happened to run fulltilt into the elm tree in the first place and looked around There was the edge of the Canal white as bone and straight as string in the moonlight No sign of the thing from the Canal if there ever had been a thing He continued turning working his way slowly through a complete three hundred and sixty degrees Bassey Park was silent and as still as a blackandwhite photograph Weeping willows draggled their thin tenebrous arms and anything could be standing slumped and insane within their shelter Eddie began to walk trying to look everywhere at once His sprained shoulder throbbed in painful sync with his heartbeat Eddieeeee the breeze moaned through the trees dont you want to see meeeee Eddieeeee He felt flabby corpsefingers caress the side of his neck He whirled his hands going up As his feet tangled together and he fell he saw that it had only been willowfronds moving in the breeze He got up again He wanted to run but when he tried another dynamite charge went off in his shoulder and he had to stop He knew somehow that he should be getting over his fright by now calling himself a stupid little baby who got spooked by a reflection or maybe fell asleep without knowing it and had a bad dream That wasnt happening though quite the reverse in fact His heart was now beating so fast he could no longer distinguish the separate thuds and he felt sure it would soon burst in terror He couldnt run but when he got out of the willows he did manage a limping jogtrot He fixed his eyes on the streetlight that marked the parks main gate He headed in that direction managing a little more speed thinking Ill make it to the light and thats all right Ill make it to the light and thats all right Bright light no more fright up all night what a sight Eddie could hear it bludgeoning its way through the willow grove If he turned he would see it It was gaining He could hear its feet a kind of shuffling squelching stride but he would not look back no he would look ahead at the light the light was all right he would just continue his flight to the light and he was almost there almost The smell was what made him look back The overwhelming smell as if fish had been left to rot in a huge pile that had become carrionslushy in the summer heat It was the smell of a dead ocean It wasnt Dorsey after him now it was the Creature from the Black Lagoon The things snout was long and pleated Green fluid dripped from black gashes like vertical mouths in its cheeks Its eyes were white and jellylike Its webbed fingers were tipped with claws like razors Its respiration was bubbly and deep the sound of a diver with a bad regulator As it saw Eddie looking its greenblack lips wrinkled back from huge fangs in a dead and vacant smile It shambled after him dripping and Eddie suddenly understood It meant to take him back to the Canal to carry him down into the dank blackness of the Canals underground passage To eat him there Eddie put on a burst of speed The arcsodium light at the gate drew closer He could see its halo of bugs and moths A truck went by headed for Route the driver working his way up through the gears and it crossed Eddies desperate terrified mind that he could be drinking coffee from a paper cup and listening to a Buddy Holly tune on the radio completely unaware that less than two hundred yards away there was a boy who might be dead in another twenty seconds The stink The overwhelming stink of it Gaining All around him It was a park bench he tripped over Some kids had casually pushed it over earlier that evening heading toward their homes at a run to beat the curfew Its seat poked an inch or two out of the grass one shade of green on another almost invisible in the moondriven dark The edge of the seat smacked Eddie in the shins causing a burst of glassy exquisite pain His legs flipped out behind him and he thumped into the grass He looked behind him and saw the Creature bearing down its white poachedegg eyes glittering its scales dripping slime the color of seaweed the gills up and down its bulging neck and cheeks opening and closing lAgr Eddie croaked It seemed to be the only noise he could make Ag AgAgAg He crawled now fingers hooking deep into the turf His tongue hung out In the second before the Creatures fishsmelling horny hands closed around his throat a comforting thought came to him This is a dream it has to be Theres no real Creature no real Black Lagoon and even if there was that was in South America or the Florida Everglades or someplace like that This is only a dream and Ill wake up in my bed or maybe in the leaves under the bandstand and I Then batrachian hands closed around his neck and Eddies hoarse cries were choked off as the Creature turned him over the chitinous hooks which sprouted from those hands scrawled bleeding marks like calligraphy into his neck He stared into its glowing white eyes He felt the webs between its fingers pressing against his throat like constricting bands of living seaweed His terrorsharpened gaze noted the fin something like a roosters comb and something like a hornpouts poisonous backfin standing atop the Creatures hunched and plated head As its hands clamped tight shutting off his air he was even able to see the way the white light from the arcsodium lamp turned a smoky green as it passed through that membranous headfin Youre not real Eddie choked but clouds of grayness were closing in now and he realized faintly that it was real enough this Creature It was after all killing him And yet some rationality remained even until the end as the Creature hooked its claws into the soft meat of his neck as his carotid artery let go in a warm and painless gout that splashed the things reptilian plating Eddies hands groped at the Creatures back feeling for a zipper They fell away only when the Creature tore his head from his shoulders with a low satisfied grunt And as Eddies picture of what It was began to fade It began promptly to Unable to sleep plagued by bad dreams a boy named Michael Hanlon rose soon after first light on the first full day of summer vacation The light was pale bundled up in a low thick mist that would lift by eight oclock taking the wraps off a perfect summer day But that was for later For now the world was all gray and rose as silent as a cat walking on a carpet Mike dressed in corduroys a teeshirt and black hightopped Keds came downstairs ate a bowl of Wheaties he didnt really like Wheaties but had wanted the free prize in the boxa Captain Midnight Magic Decoder Ring then hopped on his bike and pedaled toward town riding on the sidewalks because of the fog The fog changed everything made the most ordinary things like fire hydrants and stopsigns into objects of mysterythings both strange and a trifle sinister You could hear cars but not see them and because of the fogs odd acoustic quality you could not tell if they were far or near until you actually saw them come rolling out of the fog with ghosthalos of moisture ringing their headlamps He turned right on Jackson Street bypassing downtown and then crossed to Main Street by way of Palmer Laneand during his short ride down this little byways oneblock length he passed the house where he would live as an adult He did not look at it it was just a small twostory dwelling with a garage and a small lawn It gave off no special vibration to the passing boy who would spend most of his adult life as its owner and only dweller At Main Street he turned right and rode up to Bassey Park still wandering simply riding and enjoying the stillness of the early day Once inside the main gate he dismounted his bike pushed down the kickstand and walked toward the Canal He was still as far as he knew impelled by nothing more than purest whim Certainly it did not occur to him to think that his dreams of the night before had anything to do with his current course he did not even remember exactly what his dreams had beenonly that one had followed another until he had awakened at five oclock sweaty but shivering and with the idea that he ought to eat a fast breakfast and then take a bikeride into town Here in Bassey there was a smell in the fog he didnt like a seasmell salty and old He had smelled it before of course In the earlymorning fogs you could often smell the ocean in Derry although the coast was forty miles away But the smell this morning seemed thicker more vital Almost dangerous Something caught his eye He bent down and picked up a cheap twoblade pocket knife Someone had scratched the initials EC on the side Mike looked at it thoughtfully for a moment or two and then pocketed it Finders keepers losers weepers He glanced around Here near where he had found the knife was an overturned park bench He righted it setting its iron footings back into the holes they had made over a period of months or years Beyond the bench he saw a matted place in the grass and leading away from it two grooves The grass was springing back up but those grooves were still fairly clear They went in the direction of the Canal And there was blood But he did not want to remember the bird and so he pushed the thought away Dogfight thats all One of em must have hurt the other one pretty bad It was a convincing thought by which he was somehow not convinced Thoughts of the bird kept wanting to come backthe one he had seen out at the Kitchener Ironworks one Stan Uris never would have found in his birdbook But instead of getting out he followed the grooves As he did he made up a little story in his mind It was a murder story Heres this kid out late see Out past the curfew The killer gets him And how does he get rid of the body Drags it to the Canal and dumps it in of course Just like an Alfred Hitchcock Presents The marks he was following could have been made by a dragging pair of shoes or sneakers he supposed Mike shivered and looked around uncertainly The story was somehow a little too real And suppose that it wasnt a man who did it but a monster Like out of a horror comic or a horror book or a horror movie or He decided he didnt like the story It was a stupid story He tried to push it out of his mind but it wouldnt go So what Let it stay It was dumb Riding into town this morning had been dumb Following these two matted grooves in the grass was dumb His dad would have a lot of chores for him to do around the place today He ought to get back and start in or when the hottest part of the afternoon rolled around he would be up the barn loft pitching hay Yes he ought to get back And thats just what he was going to do Instead of going back to his bike and getting on and riding home and starting his chores he followed the grooves in the grass There were more drops of drying blood here and there Not much though Not as much as there had been in that matted place back there by the park bench he had set to rights Mike could hear the Canal now running quiet A moment later he saw the concrete edge materialize out of the fog Here was something else in the grass My goodness its certainly your day for finding things his mind said with dubious geniality and then a gull screamed somewhere and Mike flinched thinking again of the bird he had seen that day that day just this spring Whatever that is in the grass I dont even want to look at it And that was oh so very true but here he was already bending over it hands planted just above his knees to see what it was A tattered bit of cloth with a drop of blood on it The seagull screamed again Mike stared at the bloody scrap of cloth and remembered what had happened to him in the spring Each year during April and May the Hanlon farm woke up from its winter doze Mike would let himself know that spring had come again not when the first crocuses showed under his moms kitchen windows or when kids started bringing immies and croakers to school or even when the Washington Senators kicked off the baseball season usually getting themselves shellacked in the process but only when his father hollered for Mike to help him push their mongrel truck out of the barn The front half was an old ModelA Ford car the back end a pickup truck with a tailgate which was the remainder of the old henhouse door If the winter hadnt been too cold the two of them could often get it going by pushing it down the driveway The trucks cab had no doors likewise there was no windshield The seat was half of an old sofa that Will Hanlon had scrounged from the Derry dump The stickshift ended in a glass doorknob They would push it down the driveway one on each side and when it got rolling good Will would jump in turn on the switch retard the spark step down on the clutch punch the shift into first gear with his big hand clamped over the doorknob Then he would holler Put me over the hump Hed pop the clutch and the old Ford engine would cough choke chug backfire and sometimes actually start to run rough at first then smoothing out Will would roar down the road toward Rhulin Farms turn around in their driveway if he had gone the other way Henry Bowerss crazy father Butch probably would have blown his head off with a shotgun and then roar back the unmuffled engine blatting stridently while Mike jumped up and down with excitement cheering and his mom stood in the kitchen doorway wiping her hands on a dishtowel and pretending a disgust she didnt really feel Other times the truck wouldnt rollstart and Mike would have to wait until his father came back from the barn carrying the crank and muttering under his breath Mike was quite sure that some of the words so muttered were swears and he would be a little frightened of his daddy then It wasnt until much later during one of those interminable visits to the hospital room where Will Hanlon lay dying that he found out his father muttered because he was afraid of the crank once it had kicked back viciously flown out of its socket and torn the side of his mouth open Stand back Mikey he would say slipping the crank into its socket at the base of the radiator And when the A was finally running hed say that next year he was going to trade it for a Chevrolet but he never did That old AFord hybrid was still in back of the home place up to its axles and henhouse tailgate in weeds When it was running and Mike was sitting in the passenger seat smelling hot oil and blue exhaust excited by the keen breeze that washed in through the glassless hole where the windshield had once been he would think Springs here again Were all waking up And in his soul he would raise a silent cheer that shook the wails of that mostly cheerful room He felt love for everything around him and most of all for his dad who would grin over at him and holler Hold on Mikey We gone wind this baby up We gone make some birds run for cover Then he would tear up the driveway the As rear wheels spitting back black dirt and gray clods of clay both of them jouncing up and down on the sofaseat inside the open cab laughing like stark naturalborn fools Will would run the A through the high grass of the back field which was kept for hay toward either the south field potatoes the west field corn and beans or the east field peas squash and pumpkins As they went birds would burst up out of the grass before the truck squawking in terror Once a partridge flew up a magnificent bird as brown as lateautumn oaks the explosive coughing whirr of its wings audible even over the pounding engine The years work began with the rock harvest Every day for a week they would take the A out and load the bed with rocks which might break a harrowblade when the time came to turn the earth and plant Sometimes the truck would get stuck in the mucky spring earth and Will would mutter darkly under his breath more swears Mike surmised He knew some of the words and expressions others such as son of a whore puzzled him He had come across the word in the Bible and so far as he could tell a whore was a woman who came from a place called Babylon He had once set out to ask his father but the A had been in mud up to her coilsprings there had been thunderclouds on his fathers brow and he had decided to wait for a better time He ended up asking Richie Tozier later that year and Richie told him his father had told him a whore was a woman who got paid for having sex with men Whats having sex Mike had asked and Richie had wandered away holding his head On one occasion Mike had asked his father why since they harvested rocks every April there were always more of them the following April They had been standing at the dumpingoff place near sunset on the last day of that years rock harvest A beaten dirt track not quite serious enough to be called a road led from the bottom of the west field to this gully near the bank of the Kenduskeag The gully was a jumbled wasteland of rocks that had been dragged off Wills land through the years Looking down at this badlands which he had made first alone and then with the help of his son somewhere under the rocks he knew were the rotting remains of the stumps he had yanked out one at a time before any of the fields could be tilled Will had lighted a cigarette and said My daddy used to tell me that God loved rocks houseflies weeds and poor people above all the rest of His creations and thats why He made so many of them Yeah I think they do Will said Thats the only way I know to explain it A loon cried from the far side of the Kenduskeag in a dusky sunset that had turned the water a deep orangered It was a lonely sound so lonely that it made Mikes tired arms tighten with gooseflesh I love you Daddy he said suddenly feeling his love so strongly that tears stung his eyes Why I love you too Mikey his father said and hugged him tight in his strong arms Mike felt the rough fabric of his fathers flannel shirt against his cheek Now what do you say we go on back We got just time to get a bath each before the good woman puts supper on the table Ayuh yourself Will Hanlon said and they both laughed feeling tired but feeling good arms and legs worked but not overworked their hands rockroughened but not hurting too bad Springs here Mike thought that night drowsing off in his room while his mother and father watched The Honeymooners in the other room Springs here again thank You God thank You very much And turning to sleep sinking down he had heard the loon call again the distance of its marshes blending into the desire of his dreams Spring was a busy time but it was a good time Following the rock harvest Will would park the A in the high grass back of the house and drive the tractor out of the barn There would be harrowing then his father driving the tractor Mike either riding behind and holding on to the iron seat or walking alongside picking up any rocks they had missed and throwing them aside Then came planting and following the planting came summers work hoeing hoeing hoeing His mother would refurbish Larry Moe and Curly their three scarecrows and Mike would help his father put mooseblowers on top of each strawfilled head A mooseblower was a can with both ends cut off You tied a length of heavily waxed and rosined string tightly across the middle of the can and when the wind blew through it a wonderfully spooky sound resulteda kind of whining croak Cropeating birds decided soon enough that Larry Moe and Curly were no threats but the mooseblowers always frightened them off Starting in July there was picking as well as hoeingpeas and radishes first then the lettuce and the tomatoes that had been started in the shedboxes then the corn and beans in August more corn and beans in September then the pumpkins and the squash Somewhere in the midst of all that came the new potatoes and then as the days shortened and the air sharpened he and his dad would take in the mooseblowers and sometime during the winter they would disappear it seemed they had to make new ones each spring The day after Will would call Norman Sadler who was as dumb as his son Moose but infinitely more goodhearted and Normie would come over with his potatodigger For the next three weeks all of them would work picking potatoes In addition to the family Will would hire three or four highschool boys to help pick paying them a quarter a barrel The AFord would cruise slowly up and down the rows of the south field the biggest field always in low gear the tailgate down the back filled with barrels each marked with the name of the person picking into it and at the end of the day Will would open his old creased wallet and pay each of the pickers cash money Mike was paid and so was his mother that money was theirs and Will Hanlon never once asked either of them what they did with it Mike had been given a fivepercent interest in the farm when he was five years oldold enough Will had told him then to hold a hoe and to tell the difference between witchgrass and peaplants Each year he had been given another one percent and each year on the day after Thanksgiving Will would compute the farms profits and deduct Mikes share but Mike never saw any of that money It went into his college account and was to be touched under absolutely no other circumstances At last the day would come when Normie Sadler drove his potatodigger back home by then the air would have most likely turned gray and cold and there would be frost on the drift of orange pumpkins piled against the side of the barn Mike would stand in the dooryard his nose red his dirty hands stuffed into his jeans pockets and watch as his father drove first the tractor and then the AFord back into the barn He would think Were getting ready to go to sleep again Spring vanished Summer gone Harvesttime done All that was left now was the butt end of autumn leafless trees frozen ground a lacing of ice along the banks of the Kenduskeag In the fields crows would sometimes land on the shoulders of Moe Larry and Curly and stay as long as they liked The scarecrows were voiceless threatless Mike would not exactly be dismayed by the thought of another year endingat nine and ten he was still too young to make mortal metaphorsbecause there was plenty to look forward to sledding in McCarron Park or on Rhulin Hill out here in Derrytown if you were brave although that was mostly for big kids iceskating snowball fights snowfort building There was time to think about snowshoeing out for a Christmas tree with his daddy and time to think about the Nordica downhill skis he might or might not get for Christmas Winter was good but watching his father drive the A back into the barn always made him feel sad the way the squadrons of birds heading south for the winter made him feel sad or the way a certain slant of light could sometimes make him feel like crying for no good reason Were getting ready to go to sleep again It was not all school and chores chores and school Will Hanlon had told his wife more than once that a boy needed time to go fishing even if it wasnt fishing he was really doing When Mike came home from school he first put his books on the TV in the parlor second made himself some kind of snack he was particularly partial to peanutbutterandonion sandwiches a taste that made his mother raise her hands in helpless horror and third studied the note his father had left him telling Mike where he Will was and what Mikes chores werecertain rows to be weeded or picked baskets to be carried produce to be rotated the barn to be swept whatever But on at least one schoolday a weekand sometimes twothere would be no note And on these days Mike would go fishing even if it wasnt really fishing he was doing Those were great days days when he had no particular place to go and consequently felt no urge to get there in a hurry Once in awhile his father left him another sort of note No chores one might say Go over to Old Cape amp look at trolley tracks Mike would go over to the Old Cape area find the streets with the tracks still embedded in them and inspect them closely marvelling to think of things like trains that had run right through the middle of the streets That night he and his father might talk about them and his dad would show him pictures from his Derry album of the trolleys actually running a funny pole went from the roof of the trolley up to an electrical wire and there were cigarette ads on the side Another time he had sent Mike to Memorial Park where the Standpipe was to look at the birdbath and once they had gone to the courthouse together to look at a terrible machine that Chief Borton had found in the attic This gadget was called a trampchair It was castiron and there were manacles built into the arms and legs Rounded knobs stuck out of the back and seat It reminded Mike of a photograph he had seen in some booka photograph of the electric chair at Sing Sing Chief Borton let Mike sit in the trampchair and try on the manacles After the first ominous novelty of wearing the manacles wore off Mike looked questioningly at his father and Chief Borton not sure why this was supposed to be such a horrible punishment for the vags Bortons word for them that had drifted into town in the twenties and thirties The knobs made the chair a little uncomfortable to sit in sure and the manacles on your wrists and ankles made it hard to shift to a more comfortable position but Well youre just a kid Chief Borton said laughing What do you weigh Seventy eighty pounds Most of the vags Sheriff Sully posted into that chair in the old days would go twice that Theyd feel a bit oncomfortable after an hour or so really oncomfortable after two or three and right bad after four or five After seven or eight hours theyd staat bellerin and after sixteen or seventeen theyd staat cryin mostly And by the time their twentyfourhour tour was up theyd be willin to swear before God and man that the next time they came riding the rods up New England way theyd give Derry a wide berth So far as I know most of cm did Twentyfour hours in the trampchair was a helluva persuader Suddenly there seemed to be more knobs in the chair digging more deeply into his buttocks spine the small of his back even the nape of his neck Can I get out now please he said politely and Chief Borton laughed again There was a moment one panicked instant of time when Mike thought the Chief would only dangle the key to the manacles in front of Mikes eyes and say Sure Ill let you out when your twentyfour hours is up Why did you take me there Daddy he asked on the way home No his father had replied in a voice so curt that Mike hadnt dared ask any more But Mike enjoyed most of the places in Derry his father sent or took him to and by the time Mike was ten Will had succeeded in conveying his own interest in the layers of Derrys history to his son Sometimes as when he had been trailing his fingers over the slightly pebbled surface of the stand in which the Memorial Park birdbath was set or when he had squatted down to look more closely at the trolley tracks which grooved Mont Street in the Old Cape he would be struck by a profound sense of time time as something real as something that had unseen weight the way sunlight was supposed to have weight some of the kids in school had laughed when Mrs Greenguss told them that but Mike had been too stunned by the concept to laugh his first thought had been Light has weight Oh my Lord thats terrible time as something that would eventually bury him The first note his father left him in that spring of was scribbled on the back of an envelope and held down with a saltshaker The air was springwarm wonderfully sweet and his mother had opened all the windows No chores the note read If you want to ride your bike out to Pasture Road Youll see a lot of tumbled masonry and old machinery out in the field on your left Have a look around bring back a souvenir Dont go near the cellarhole And be back before dark You know why He told his mother where he was going and she frowned Why dont you see if Randy Robinson wants to go with you He did too but Randy had gone up to Bangor with his father to buy seedling potatoes So Mike rode his bike over to Pasture Road alone It was a goodish ridea little over four miles Mike reckoned it was three oclock by the time he leaned his bike against an old wooden slatfence on the left side of Pasture Road and climbed into the field beyond He would have maybe an hour to explore and then he would have to start home again Ordinarily his mother would not be upset with him as long as he was back by six when she put dinner on the table but one memorable episode had taught him that wasnt the case this year On that one occasion when he had been late for dinner she had been nearly hysterical She took after him with a dishrag whopping him with it as he stood openmouthed in the kitchen entryway his wicker creel with the rainbow trout in it at his feet Dont you ever scare me like that she had screamed dont you ever Dont you ever Evereverever Each ever had been punctuated by another dishrag swat Mike had expected his father to step in and put a stop to it but his father hadnt done so Perhaps he knew that if he did she would turn her wildcat anger on him as well Mike had learned the lesson one whopping with the dishrag was all it took Home before dark Yes maam righto He walked across the field toward the titanic ruins standing in the center This was of course the remains of the Kitchener Ironworkshe had ridden past it but had never thought to actually explore it and he had never heard any kids saying that they had Now stooping to examine a few tumbled bricks that had formed a rough cairn he thought he could understand why The field was dazzlingly bright washed by sun from the spring sky occasionally as a cloud passed before the sun a great shutter of shadow would travel slowly across the field but there was something spooky about it all the samea brooding silence that was broken only by the wind He felt like an explorer who has found the last remnants of some fabulous lost city Up ahead and to the right he saw the rounded side of a massive tile cylinder rising out of the high field grass He ran over to it It was the Ironworks main smokestack He peered into its bore and felt a fresh chill worm up his spine It was big enough so he could have walked into it if he had wanted But he didnt want to God knew what strange guck there might be clinging to the smokeblackened inner tiles or what nasty bugs or beasts might have taken up residence inside The wind gusted When it blew across the mouth of the fallen stack it made a sound eerily like the sound of the wind vibrating the waxed strings he and his dad put in the mooseblowers every spring He stepped back nervously suddenly thinking about the movie he and his father had watched last night on the Early Show It had been called Rodan and watching it had seemed like great fun at the time his father laughing and shouting Git that bird Mikey every time Rodan made its appearance Mike shooting with his finger until his mom popped her head in and told them to hush up before they gave her a headache with the noise It didnt seem so funny now In the movie Rodan had been released from the bowels of the earth by these Japanese coalminers who had been digging the worlds deepest tunnel And looking into the black bore of this pipe it was all too easy to imagine that bird crouched at the far end leathery batlike wings folded over its back staring at the small round boyface looking into the darkness staring staring with its goldringed eyes He walked aways down the smokestack which had sunken into the earth to half of its circumference The land rose slightly and on impulse he scrambled his way up on top The stack was a lot less scary on the outside its tiled surface sunwarm He got to his feet and strolled along holding his arms out the surface was really too wide for him to need to worry about falling off but he was pretending he was a tightwirewalker in the circus liking the way the wind blew through his hair At the far end he jumped down and began to examine stuff more bricks twisted molds hunks of wood pieces of rusty machinery Bring back a souvenir his fathers note had said he wanted a good one He wandered closer to the mills yawning cellarhold looking at the debris being careful not to cut himself on the broken glass There was a lot of it around Mike was not unmindful of the cellarhold and his fathers warning to stay out of it neither was he unmindful of the death that had been dealt out on this spot fiftyodd years before He supposed that if there was a haunted place in Derry this was it But either in spite of that or because of it he was determined to stay until he found something really good to take back and show his father He moved slowly and soberly toward the cellarhold changing his course to parallel its ragged side when a warning voice inside whispered that he was getting too close that a bank weakened by the spring rains could crumble under his heels and pitch him into that hole where God only knew how much sharp iron might be waiting to impale him like a bug leaving him to die a rusty twitching death He picked up a windowsash and tossed it aside Here was a dipper big enough for a giants table its handle rippled and warped by some unimaginable flash of heat Here was a piston too big for him to even budge let alone lift He stepped over it He stepped over it and What if I find a skull he thought suddenly The skull of one of the kids who were killed here while they were hunting for chocolate Easter eggs back in nineteenwheneveritwas He looked around the sunwashed empty field nastily shocked by the idea The wind blew a low conchnote in his ears and another shadow cruised silently across the field like the shadow of a giant bat or bird He became aware all over again of how quiet it was here and how strange the field looked with its straggling piles of masonry and its beached iron hulks leaning this way and that It was as if some horrid battle had been fought here long ago Dont be such a dip he replied uneasily to himself They found everything there was to find fifty years ago After it happened And even if they didnt some other kidor grownupwould have found the rest since then Or do you think youre the only person who ever came here hunting for souvenirs But what that rational side of his mind demanded and Mike thought it was talking just a little too loud a little too fast Even if there was still something to find it would have decayed long ago So what Mike found a splintered desk drawer in the weeds He glanced at it tossed it aside and moved a little closer to the cellarhold where the stuff was thickest Surely he would find something there But what if there are ghosts Thats but what What if I see hands coming over the edge of that cellarhold and what if they start to come up kids in the remains of their Easter Sunday clothes clothes that are all rotted and torn and marked with fifty years of spring mud and fall rain and caked winter snow Kids with no heads he had heard at school that after the explosion a woman had found the head of one of the victims in a tree in her back yard kids with no legs kids flayed open like codfish kids just like me who would maybe come down and play down there where its dark under the leaning iron girders and the big old rusty cogs But a shudder wrenched its way up his back and he decided it was time to take somethinganythingand get the dickens out of here He reached down almost at random and came up with a geartoothed wheel about seven niches in diameter He had a pencil in his pocket and he used it quickly to dig the dirt out of the teeth Then he slipped his souvenir in his pocket He would go now He would go yes But his feet moved slowly in the wrong direction toward the cellarhold and he realized with a dismal sort of horror that he needed to look down inside He had to see He gripped a spongy supportbeam leaning out of the earth and swayed forward trying to see down and inside He couldnt quite do it He had come to within fifteen feet of the edge but that was still a little too far to see the bottom of the cellarhold I dont care if I see the bottom or not Im going back now Ive got my souvenir I dont need to look down into any crummy old hole And Daddys note said to stay away from it But the unhappy almost feverish curiosity that had gripped him would not let go He approached the cellarhold step by queasy step aware that as soon as the wooden beam was out of his reach there would be no more grabholds also aware that the ground here was indeed squelchy and crumbly In places along the edge he could see depressions like graves that had fallen in and knew that they were the sites of previous caveins Heart thudding in his chest like the hard measured strides of a soldiers boots he reached the edge and looked down Mike was not at first sure what he was seeing All the nerves and pathways in his body seemed frozen including those which conducted thoughts It was not just the shock of seeing a monster bird a bird whose breast was as orange as a robins and whose feathers were the unremarkable fluffy gray of a sparrows feathers most of it was the shock of the utterly unexpected He had expected monoliths of machinery halfsubmerged in stagnant puddles and black mud instead he was looking down into a giant nest which filled the cellarhold from end to end and side to side It had been made out of enough timothy grass to make a dozen bales of hay but this grass was silvery and old The bird sat in the middle of it its brightly ringed eyes as black as fresh warm tar and for an insane moment before his paralysis broke Mike could see himself reflected in each of them Then the ground suddenly began to shift and run out from beneath his feet He heard the tearing sound of shallow roots giving way and realized he was sliding With a yell he threw himself backward pinwheeling his arms for balance He lost it and thumped heavily to the littered ground Some hard dull chunk of metal pressed painfully into his back and he had time to think of the trampchair before he heard the whirring explosive sound of the birds wings He scrambled to his knees crawled looked back over his shoulder and saw it rising out of the cellarhold Its scaly talons were a dusky orange Its beating wings each more than ten feet across blew the scraggy timothy grass this way and that patternlessly like the wind generated by helicopter rotors It uttered a buzzing chirruping scream A few loose feathers slipped from its wings and spiraled back down into the cellarhold He pounded across the field not looking back now afraid to look back The bird did not look like Rodan but he sensed it was the spirit of Rodan risen from the cellarhold of the Kitchener Ironworks like a horrible birdinthebox He stumbled went to one knee got up and ran on That weird chirruping buzzing screech came again A shadow covered him and when he looked up he saw the thing it had passed less than five feet over his head Its beak dirty yellow opened and closed revealing a pink lining inside It whirled back toward Mike The wind it generated washed across his face bringing a dry unpleasant smell with it attic dust dead antiques rotting cushions He jigged to his left and now he saw the fallen smokestack again He sprinted for it running allout his arms pumping in short jabbing strokes at his sides The bird screamed and he heard its fluttering wings They sounded like sails Something slammed into the back of his head Warm fire traced its way up the nape of his neck He felt it spread as blood began to trickle down the back of his shirtcollar The bird whirled around again meaning to pick him up with its talons and carry him away like a hawk with a fieldmouse Meaning to carry him back to its nest Meaning to eat him As it flew at him swooping down its black horribly alive eyes fixed on him Mike cut sharply right The bird missed himbarely The dusty smell of its wings was overpowering unbearable Now he was running parallel to the fallen smokestack its tiles blurring by He could see where it ended If he could reach the end and buttonhook to the left get inside he might be safe He thought the bird was too big to squeeze inside He came very close to not making it The bird flew at him again pulling up as it closed in its wings flapping and pushing air in a hurricane its scaly talons now angled toward him and descending It screamed again and this time Mike thought he heard triumph in its voice He lowered his head put his arm up and rammed straight forward The talons closed and for a moment the bird had him by the forearm The grip was like the clutch of incredibly strong fingers tipped with tough nails They bit like teeth The birds flapping wings were a thunder in his ears he was dimly aware of feathers falling around him some brushing past his cheeks like phantom kisses The bird rose then and for just a moment Mike felt himself pulled upward first straight then on tiptoe and for one freezing second he felt the toes of his Keds lose contact with the earth Let me GO he screamed at it and twisted his arm For a moment the talons held on and then the sleeve of his shirt ripped He thumped back down The bird squalled Mike ran again brushing through the things tailfeathers gagging at that dry smell It was like running through a showercurtain of feathers Still coughing eyes stinging from both tears and whatever vile dust coated the birds feathers he stumbled into the fallen smokestack There was no thought now of what might be lurking inside He ran into the darkness his gasping sobs taking on a flat echo He went back perhaps twenty feet and then turned toward the bright circle of daylight His chest was rising and falling in quick jerks He was suddenly aware that if he had misjudged either the size of the bird or the size of the smokestacks muzzle he had killed himself as surely as if he had put his fathers shotgun to his head and pulled the trigger There was no way out This wasnt just a pipe it was a blind alley The other end of the stack was buried in the earth The bird squalled again and suddenly the light at the end of the smokestack was blotted out as it lighted on the ground outside He could see its yellow scaly legs each as thick as a mans cabs Then it cocked its head down and looked inside Mike found himself again staring into those hideously bright freshtar eyes with their gold weddingrings of iris The birds beak opened and closed opened and closed and each time it snapped shut he heard an audible click like the sound you hear in your own ears when you snap your teeth together hard Sharp he thought Its beak is sharp I guess I knew birds had sharp beaks but I never really thought about it until now It squawked again The sound was so loud in the tile throat of the stack that Mike clapped his hands to his ears The bird began to force itself into the mouth of the stack The light faded as more of the birds body pressed its way into the stacks bore Oh my Lord why didnt I remember it was mostly feathers Why didnt I remember it could squeeze The light faded faded was gone Now there was only an inky blackness the suffocating atticsmell of the bird and the rustling sound of its feathers Mike fell on his knees and began to grope on the curved floor of the smokestack his hands spread wide feeling He found a piece of broken tile its sharp edges furred with what felt like moss He cocked his arm back and pegged it There was a thump The bird uttered its buzzing chirruping sound again There was silence and then that crackly rustling sound began again as the bird resumed forcing itself into the pipe Mike felt along the floor found other pieces of tile and began to throw one after another They thumped and thudded off the bird and then clinked to the tile sleeve of the smokestack Please God Mike thought incoherently Please God phase God please God It came to him that he ought to retreat down the smokestacks bore He had run in through what had been the stacks base it stood to reason that it would narrow as he backed up He could retreat yes and listen to that low dusty rustle as the bird worked its way in after him He could retreat and if he was lucky he might get beyond the point where the bird could continue to advance If that happened he and the bird would die in here together They would die in here together and rot in here together In the dark Please God he screamed and was totally unaware that he had cried out aloud He threw another piece of tile and this time his throw was more powerfulhe felt he told the others much later as if someone were behind him at that moment and that someone had given his arm a tremendous push This time there was no feathery thud instead there was a splatting sound the sound a kids hand might make slapping into the surface of a bowl of halfsolidified JellO This time the bird screamed not in anger but in real pain The tenebrous whirr of its wings filled the smokestack stinking air streamed past Mike in a hurricane flapping his clothes making him cough and gag and retreat as dust and moss flew Light appeared again gray and weak at first then brightening and shifting as the bird retreated from the stacks muzzle Mike burst into tears fell to his knees again and began grubbing madly for more pieces of tile Without any conscious thought he ran forward with both hands full of tiling in this light he could see the pieces were splotched with bluegray moss and lichen like the surface of slate gravestones until he was nearly at the mouth of the stack He intended to keep the bird from coming back in if he could It bent down cocking its head the way a trained bird on a perch will sometimes cock its head and Mike saw where his last shot had struck home The birds right eye was nearly gone Instead of that glittering bubble of fresh tar there was a crater filled with blood Whitishgray goo dripped from the corner of the socket and trickled along the side of the birds beak Tiny parasites wriggled and squirmed in this pussy discharge It saw him and lunged forward Mike began to throw chunks of tile at it They struck its head and beak It withdrew for a moment and then lunged again beak opening revealing that pink lining again revealing something else that caused Mike to freeze for a moment his own mouth dropping open The birds tongue was silver its surface as crazycracked as the surface of a volcanic land which has first baked and then slagged off And on this tongue like weird tumbleweeds that had taken temporary root there were a number of orange puffs Mike threw the last of his tiles directly into that gaping maw and the bird withdrew again screaming its frustration rage and pain For a moment Mike could see its reptilian talons Then its wings ruffled the air and it was gone A moment later he lifted his facea face that was graybrown under the dirt dust and bits of moss that the birds windmachine wings had blown at himtoward the clicking sound of its talons on the tile The only clean places on Mikes face were the tracks that had been washed clean by his tears Mike retreated a bit gathered up more chunks of tile and heaped them as close to the mouth of the stack as he dared If the thing came back he wanted to be able to fire at it from pointblank range The light outside was still brightnow that it was May it wouldnt get dark for a long time yetbut suppose the bird just decided to wait Mike swallowed the dry sides of his throat rubbing together for a moment He had a fine pile of ammunition now In the dim light here beyond the place where the angle of the sun made a shadowspiral inside the pipe it looked like a pile of broken crockery swept together by a housewife Mike rubbed the palms of his dirty hands along the sides of his jeans and waited to see what would happen next A space of time passed before something didwhether five minutes or twentyfive he could not tell He was only aware of the bird walking back and forth overhead like an insomniac pacing the floor at three in the morning Then its wings fluttered again It landed in front of the smokestacks opening Mike on his knees just behind his pile of tiling began to peg missiles at it before it could even bend its head down One of them slammed into a plated yellow leg and drew a trickle of blood so dark it seemed almost as black as the birds eyes Mike screamed in triumph the sound thin and almost lost under the birds own enraged squawk Get out of here Mike cried Im going to keep hitting you until you get out of here I swear to God I will The bird flew up to the top of the smokestack and resumed its pacing Finally its wings ruffled again as it took off Mike waited expecting the yellow feet so like hens feet to appear again They didnt He waited longer convinced it had to be some kind of a trick realizing at last that that wasnt why he was waiting at all He was waiting because he was scared to go out scared to leave the safety of this bolthole Never mind Never mind stuff like that Im not a rabbit He took as many chunks of tile as he could handle comfortably then put some more inside his shirt He stepped out of the smokestack trying to look everywhere at once and wishing madly for eyes in the back of his head He saw only the field stretching ahead and around him littered with the exploded rusting remains of the Kitchener Ironworks He wheeled around sure he would see the bird perched on the lip of the stack like a vulture a oneeyed vulture now only wanting the boy to see him before it attacked for the final time using that sharp beak to jab and rip and strip He uttered a breaking scream of fear and ran for the weatherbeaten fence between the field and the road dropping the last pieces of tile from his hands Most of the others fell out of his shirt as the shirt pulled free of his belt He vaulted over the fence onehanded like Roy Rogers showing off for Dale Evans on his way back from the corral with Pat Brady and the rest of the buckaroos He grabbed the handlebars of his bike and ran beside it forty feet up the road before getting on Then he pedaled madly not daring to look back not daring to slow down until he reached the intersection of Pasture Road and Outer Main Street where there were lots of cars passing back and forth When he got home his father was changing the plugs on the tractor Will observed that Mike looked powerful musty and dusty Mike hesitated for just a split second and then told his father that hed taken a tumble from his bike on the way home swerving to avoid a pothole Did you break anything Mikey Will asked observing his son a little more carefully Mike reached into his pocket and found the gearwheel He showed it to his father who looked at it briefly and then plucked a tiny crumb of tiling from the pad of flesh just below Mikes thumb He seemed more interested in this See anything in there Will asked and then as if to make a joke of the question which hadnt sounded like a joke at all he added Buried treasure Well dont tell your mother you was muckin about in there Will said Shed shoot me first and you second He looked even more closely at his son I guess I might be a little tired Mike said Its eight or ten miles there and back again dont forget You want some help with the tractor Daddy No Im about done screwing it up for this week You go on in and wash up Mike started away and then his father called to him once more Mike looked back I dont want you going around that place again he said at least not until all this trouble is cleared up and they catch the man whos doing it you didnt see anybody out there did you No one chased you or hollered you down Will nodded and lit a cigarette I think I was wrong to send you there Old Okay Daddy Mike said I dont want to go back anyway It was a little spooky Will nodded again Less said the better I reckon You go and get cleaned up now And tell her to put on three or four extra sausages Never mind that now Mike Hanlon thought looking at the grooves which went up to the concrete edge of the Canal and stopped there Never mind that it might just have been a dream anyhow and There were splotches of dried blood on the lip of the Canal Mike looked at these and then he looked down into the Canal Black water flowed smoothly past Runners of dirty yellow foam clung to the Canals sides sometimes breaking free to flow downstream in lazy loops and curves For a momentjust a momenttwo clots of this foam came together and seemed to form a face a kids face its eyes turned up in an avatar of terror and agony The foam broke apart became meaningless again and at that moment there was a loud splash on his right Mike snapped his head around shrinking back a little and for a moment he believed he saw something in the shadows of the outflow tunnel where the Canal resurfaced after its course under downtown Suddenly cold and shuddering he dug in his pocket for the knife he had found in the grass He threw it into the Canal There was a small splash a ripple that began as a circle and was then tugged into the shape of an arrowhead by the current then nothing Nothing except the fear that was suddenly suffocating him and the deadly certainty that there was something near something watching him gauging its chances biding its time He turned meaning to walk back to his biketo run would be to dignify those fears and undignify himselfand then that splashing sound came again It was a lot louder this second time So much for dignity Suddenly he was running as fast as he could beating his buns for the gate and his bike jamming the kickstand up with one heel and pedaling for the street as fast as he could That seasmell was all at once too thick much too thick It was everywhere And the water dripping from the wet branches of the trees seemed much too loud Something was coming He heard dragging lurching footsteps in the grass He stood on the pedals giving it everything and shot out onto Main Street without looking back He headed for home as fast as he could wondering what in hell had possessed him to come in the first place what had drawn him And then he tried to think about the chores the whole chores and nothing but the chores After awhile he actually succeeded And when he saw the headline in the paper the next day MISSING BOY PROMPTS NEW FEARS he thought about the pocket knife he had thrown into the Canalthe pocket knife with the initials EC scratched on the side He thought about the blood he had seen on the grass And he thought about those grooves which stopped at the edge of the Canal Seen from the expressway at quarter to five in the morning Boston seems a city of the dead brooding over some tragedy in its pasta plague perhaps or a curse The smell of salt heavy and cloying comes off the ocean Runners of earlymorning fog obscure much of what movement would be seen otherwise Driving north along Storrow Drive sitting behind the wheel of the black Cadillac he picked up from Butch Carrington at Cape Cod Limousine Eddie Kaspbrak thinks you can feel this citys age perhaps you can get that feeling of age nowhere else in America but here Boston is a sprat compared with London an infant compared with Rome but by American standards at least it is old old It kept its place on these low hills three hundred years ago when the Tea and Stamp Taxes were unthought of Paul Revere and Patrick Henry unborn Its age its silence and the foggy smell of the seaall of these things make Eddie nervous When Eddies nervous he reaches for his aspirator He sticks it in his mouth and triggers a cloud of revivifying spray down his throat There are a few people in the streets hes passing and a pedestrian or two on the walkways of the overpassesthey give lie to the impression that he has somehow wandered into a Lovecrafty tale of doomed cities ancient evils and monsters with unpronounceable names Here ganged around a bus stop with a sign reading KENMORE SQUARE CITY CENTER he sees waitresses nurses city employees their faces naked and puffed with sleep Thats right Eddie thinks now passing under a sign which reads TOBIN BRIDGE Thats right stick to the buses Forget the subways The subways are a bad idea I wouldnt go down there if I were you Not down below Not in the tunnels This is a bad thought to have if he doesnt get rid of it he will soon be using the aspirator again Hes glad for the heavier traffic on the Tobin Bridge He passes a monument works Painted on the brick side is a slightly unsettling admonishment Here is a green reflectorized sign which reads TO MAINE NH ALL NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND POINTS He looks at it and suddenly a bonedeep shudder wracks his body His hands momentarily weld themselves to the wheel of the Cadillac He would like to believe it is the onset of some sickness a virus or perhaps one of his mothers phantom fevers but he knows better It is the city behind him poised silently on the straightedge that runs between day and night and what that sign promises ahead of him Hes sick all right no doubt about that but its not a virus or a phantom fever He has been poisoned by his own memories Im scared Eddie thinks That was always what was at the bottom of it Just being scared That was everything But in the end I think we turned that around somehow We used it But how He cant remember He wonders if any of the others can For all their sakes he certainly hopes so A truck drones by on his left Eddie has still got his lights on and now he hits his brights momentarily as the truck draws safely ahead He does this without thinking It has become an automatic function just part of driving for a living The unseen driver in the truck flashes his running lights in return quickly twice thanking Eddie for his courtesy If only everything could be that simple and that clear he thinks He follows the signs to I The northbound traffic is light although he observes that the southbound lanes into the city are starting to fill up even at this early hour Eddie floats the big car along preguessing most of the directional signs and getting into the correct lane long before he has to It has been yearsliterally yearssince he has guessed wrong enough to be swept past an exit he wanted He makes his lanechoices as automatically as he flashed okay to cut back in to the trucker as automatically as he once found his way through the tangle of paths in the Derry Barrens The fact that he has never before in his life driven out of downtown Boston one of the most confusing cities in America to drive in does not seem to matter much at all He suddenly remembers something else about that summer something Bill said to him one day YYouve ggot a cccuhhompass in your head EEEddie How that had pleased him It pleases him again as the dorado shoots back onto the turnpike He slides the limos speed up to a copsafe fiftyseven miles an hour and finds some quiet music on the radio He supposes he would have died for Bill back then if that had been required if Bill had asked him Eddie would simply have responded sure Big Bill you got a time in mind yet Eddie laughs at thisnot much of a sound just a snort but the sound of it startles him into a real laugh He laughs seldom these days and he certainly did not expect to find many chucks Richies word meaning chuckles as in You had any good chucks today Eds on this black pilgrimage But he supposes if God is dirtymean enough to curse the faithful with what they want most in life Hes maybe quirky enough to deal you a good chuck or two along the way Had any good chucks lately Eds he says out loud and laughs again Man he had hated it when Richie called him Eds but he had sort of liked it too The way he thought Ben Hanscom got to like Richie calling him Haystack It was something like a secret name A secret identity A way to be people that had nothing to do with their parents fears hopes constant demands Richie couldnt do his beloved Voices for shit but maybe he did know how important it was for creeps like them to sometimes be different people Eddie glances at the change lined up neatly on the dorados dashboardlining up the change is another of those automatic tricks of the trade When the tollbooths come up you never want to have to dig for your silver never want to find that youve gotten in an automatictoll lane with the wrong change Among the coins are two or three Susan B Anthony silver dollars They are coins he reflects that you probably only find in the pockets of chauffeurs and taxidrivers from the New York area these days just as the only place you are apt to see a lot of twodollar bills is at a racetrack payoff window He always keeps a few on hand because the robot tolltaker baskets on the George Washington and the Triboro Bridges take them Another of those lights suddenly comes on in his head silver dollars Not these fake copper sandwiches but real silver dollars with Lady Liberty dressed in her gauzy robes stamped upon them Ben Hanscoms silver dollars Yes but wasnt it Bill who once used one of those silver cartwheels to save their lives He is not quite sure of this is in fact not quite sure of anything or is it just that he doesnt want to remember It was dark in there he thinks suddenly I remember that much It was dark Boston is well behind him now and the fog is starting to bum off Ahead is MAINE NH ALL NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND POINTS Derry is ahead and there is something in Derry which should be twentyseven years dead and yet is somehow not Something with as many faces as Lon Chaney But what is it really Didnt they see it at the end as it really was with all its masks cast aside He remembers that he loved Bill Denbrough he remembers that well enough Bill never made fun of his asthma Bill never called him little sissy queerboy He loved Bill like he would have loved a big brother or a father Bill knew stuff to do Places to go Things to see Bill was never up against it When you ran with Bill you ran to beat the devil and you laughed but you hardly ever ran out of breath And hardly ever running out of breath was great so fucking great Eddie would tell the world When you ran with Big Bill you got your chucks every day Sure kid EVery day he says in a Richie Tozier Voice and laughs again It had been Bills idea to make the dam in the Barrens and it was in a way the dam that had brought them all together Ben Hanscom had been the one to show them how the dam could be builtand they had built it so well that theyd gotten in a lot of trouble with Mr Nell the cop on the beatbut it had been Bills idea And although all of them except Richie had seen very odd thingsfrightening thingsin Derry since the turn of the year it had been Bill who had first found the courage to say something out loud He remembered Victor Cris Tata boys It was a real baby dam believe me Youre better off without it Bill and Eddie looked at Ben doubtfully and then at the stuff Ben had brought along with him some boards scrounged from Mr McKibbons back yard but that was okay since Mr McKibbon had probably scavenged them from someone elses a sledgehammer a shovel I dunno Eddie said glancing at Bill When we tried yesterday it didnt work very good The current kept washing our sticks away Thisll work Ben said He also looked to Bill for the final decision Well lets ggive it a tttry Bill said I ccalled RRRRichie Tozier this mmorning Hes ggonna be ohover Mater he ssaid Maybe him and Stuhhuhhanley will want to hhelp Uris Eddie said He was still looking cautiously at Bill who seemed somehow different todayquieter less enthusiastic about the idea of the dam Bill looked pale today Distant Stanley Uris I guess I dont know him Does he go to Derry Elementary Hes our age but he just finished the fourth grade Eddie said He started school a year late because he was sick a lot when he was a little kid You think you took chong yesterday you just oughtta be glad youre not Stan Someones always rackin Stan to the dogs an back Hes Juhjuhhooish Bill said Luhlots of kkids dont luhhike him because hhes Jewish Oh yeah Ben asked impressed Jewish huh He paused and then said carefully Is that like being Turkish or is it more like you know Egyptian I gguess its more like Turhurhurkish Bill said He picked up one of the boards Ben had brought and looked at it It was about six feet long and three feet wide My dddad says most JJews have big nuhnoses and lots of mmmoney but StuhStuhStuh But Stans got a regular nose and hes always broke Eddie said Yeah Bill said and broke into a real grin for the first time that day Bill tossed the board aside got up and brushed off the seat of his jeans He walked to the edge of the stream and the other two boys joined him Bill shoved his hands in his back pockets and sighed deeply Eddie was sure Bill was going to say something serious He looked from Eddie to Ben and then back to Eddie again not smiling now Eddie was suddenly afraid But all Bill said then was You got your ahahaspirator EEddie Eddie laughed Worked great he said He and Ben broke up while Bill looked at them smiling but puzzled Eddie explained and Bill nodded grinning again EEEddies muhhum is wwworried that hhes ggonna break and shshe wuhhont be able to gget a rererefund Eddie snorted and made as if to push him into the stream Watch it fuckface Bill said sounding uncannily like Henry Bowers Ill twist your head so far around youll be able to watch when you wipe yourself Ben collapsed shrieking with laughter Bill glanced at him still smiling hands still in the back pockets of his jeans smiling yeah but a little distant again a little vague He looked at Eddie and then cocked his head toward Ben Yeah Eddie agreed but he felt somehow that they were only going through the motions of having a good time Something was on Bills mind He supposed Bill would spill it when he was ready the question was did Eddie want to hear what it was Kids mentally retarded YYou gggonna shshow us how to bbuild a dam or aare you gggonna sihit there on your bbig cccan all dday Ben got to his feet again He looked first at the stream flowing past them at moderate speed The Kenduskeag was not terribly wide this far up in the Barrens but it had defeated them yesterday just the same Neither Eddie nor Bill had been able to figure out how to get a foothold on the current But Ben was smiling the smile of one who contemplates doing something new something that will be fun but not very hard Eddie thought He knows howI really think he does Okay he said You guys want to take your shoes off because youre gonna get your little footsies wet The mindmother in Eddies head spoke up at once her voice as stern and commanding as the voice of a traffic cop Dont you dare do it Eddie Dont you dare Wet feet thats one wayone of the thousands of waysthat colds start and colds lead to pneumonia so dont you do it Bill and Ben were sitting on the bank pulling off their sneakers and socks Ben was fussily rolling up the legs of his jeans Bill looked up at Eddie His eyes were clear and warm sympathetic Eddie was suddenly sure Big Bill knew exactly what he had been thinking and he was ashamed Yeah sure Eddie said He sat down on the bank and undressed his feet while his mother ranted inside his head but her voice was growing steadily more distant and echoey he was relieved to note as if someone had stuck a heavy fishhook through the back of her blouse and was now reeling her away from him down a very long corridor It was one of those perfect summer days which in a world where everything was on track and on the beam you would never forget A moderate breeze kept the worst of the mosquitoes and blackflies away The sky was a bright crisp blue Temperatures were in the low seventies Birds sang and went about their birdybusiness in the bushes and secondgrowth trees Eddie had to use his aspirator once and then his chest lightened and his throat seemed to widen magically to the size of a freeway He spent the rest of the morning with it stuffed forgotten into his back pocket Ben Hanscom who had seemed so timid and unsure the day before became a confident general once he was fully involved in the actual construction of the dam Every now and then he would climb the bank and stand there with his muddy hands on his hips looking at the work in progress and muttering to himself Sometimes he would run a hand through his hair and by eleven oclock it was standing up in crazy comical spikes Eddie felt uncertainty at first then a sense of glee and finally an entirely new feelingone that was at the same time weird terrifying and exhilarating It was a feeling so alien to his usual state of being that he was not able to put a name to it until that night lying in bed and looking at the ceiling and replaying the day Power That was what that feeling had been Power It was going to work by God and it was going to work better than he and Billmaybe even Ben himselfhad dreamed it could He could see Bill getting involved tooonly a little at first still mulling over whatever it was he had on his mind and then bit by bit committing himself fully Once or twice he clapped Ben on one meaty shoulder and told him he was unbelievable Ben flushed with pleasure each time Ben got Eddie and Bill to set one of the boards across the stream and hold it as he used the sledgehammer to seat it in the streambed Thereits in but youll have to hold it or the currentll just pull it loose he told Eddie so Eddie stood in the middle of the stream holding the board while water sluiced over its top and made his hands into wavering starfish shapes Ben and Bill located a second board two feet downstream of the first Ben used the sledge again to seat it and Bill held it while Ben began to fill up the space between the two boards with sandy earth from the streambank At first it only washed away around the ends of the boards in gritty clouds and Eddie didnt think it was going to work at all but when Ben began adding rocks and muddy gook from the streambed the clouds of escaping silt began to diminish In less than twenty minutes he had created a heaped brown canal of earth and stones between the two boards in the middle of the stream To Eddie it looked like an optical illusion If we had real cement instead of just mud and rocks theyd have to move the whole city over to the Old Cape side by the middle of next week Ben said slinging the shovel aside at last and sitting on the bank until he got his breath back Bill and Eddie laughed and Ben grinned at them When he grinned there was a ghost of the handsome man he would become in the lines of his face Water had begun to pile up behind the upstream board now Eddie asked what they were going to do about the water escaping around the sides Ben shrugged I just do the shrug said and Eddie was silenced When he was rested Ben got a third boardthe thickest of the four or five he had carried laboriously across town to the Barrensand placed it carefully against the downstream board wedging one end firmly into the streambed and socking the other against the board Bill had been holding creating the strut he had put in his little drawing the day before Okay he said standing back He grinned at them You guys should be able to let go now The gook in between the two boards will take most of the water pressure The strut will take the rest And if youre ruhruhwrong we gget to kkkill yuhyou Bill said Bill and Eddie stepped back The two boards that formed the basis of the dam creaked a little tilted a little and that was all They sat on the bank and ate not talking much watching the water stack up behind the dam and sluice around the ends of the boards They had already done something to the geography of the streambanks Eddie saw the diverted current was cutting scalloped hollows into them As he watched the new course of the stream undercut the bank enough on the far side to cause a small avalanche Upstream of the dam the water formed a roughly circular pool and at one place it had actually overflowed the bank Bright reflecting rills ran off into the grass and the underbrush Eddie slowly began to realize what Ben had known from the first the dam was already built The gaps between the boards and the banks were sluiceways Ben had not been able to tell Eddie this because he did not know the word Above the boards the Kenduskeag had taken on a swelled look The chuckling sound of shallow water babbling its way over stones and gravel was now gone all the stones upstream of the dam were underwater Every now and then more sod and dirt undercut by the widening stream would fall into the water with a splash Downstream of the dam the watercourse was nearly empty thin trickles ran restlessly down its center but that was about all Stones which had been underwater for God knew how long were drying in the sun Eddie looked at these drying stones with mild wonder and that weird other feeling They had done this They He saw a frog hopping along and thought maybe old Mr Froggy was wondering just where the water had gone Eddie laughed out loud Ben was neatly stowing his empty wrappers in the lunchbag he had brought Both Eddie and Bill had been amazed by the size of the repast Ben had laid out with businesslike efficiency two PB ampJ sandwiches one baloney sandwich a hardcooked egg complete with a pinch of salt twisted up in a small piece of waxed paper two figbars three large chocolate chip cookies and a RingDing What did your ma say when she saw how bad you got racked Eddie asked him Hmmmm Ben looked up from the spreading pool of water behind the dam and belched gently against the back of his hand Oh Well I knew shed be groceryshopping yesterday afternoon so I was able to beat her home I took a bath and washed my hair Then I threw away the jeans and the sweatshirt I was wearing I dont know if shell notice theyre gone or not Probably not the sweatshirt I got lots of sweatshirts but I guess I ought to buy myself a new pair of jeans before she gets nosing through my drawers The thought of wasting his money on such a nonessential item cast momentary gloom across Bens face I told her I was so excited to be out of school that I ran out the door and fell down the steps Ben said and looked both amazed and a little hurt when Eddie and Bill began laughing Bill who had been chowing up a piece of his mothers devils food cake blew out a brown jet of crumbs and then had a coughing fit Eddie still howling clapped him on the back Well I almost did fall down the steps Ben said Only it was because Victor Criss pushed me not because I was running Id be as hhot as a tuhtuhtamale in a swuhheatshirt like that Bill said finishing the last bite of his cake Ben hesitated For a moment it seemed he would say nothing Its better when youre fat he said finally sweatshirts I mean There was a moment of awkward silence and then Eddie said Look how dark the waters getting when it goes around that side of the dam Oh cripes Ben shot to his feet Currents pulling out the fill Jeez I wish we had cement The damage was quickly repaired but even Eddie could see what would happen without someone there to almost constantly shovel in fresh fill erosion would eventually cause the upstream board to collapse against the downstream board and then everything would fall over We can shore up the sides Ben said That wont stop the erosion but itll slow it down If we use sand and mud wont it just go on washing away Eddie asked Bill nodded smiled and made an O with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand Lets gggo Ill ddig em and yyou shshow me where to pput em ihin Big Ben From behind them a stridently cheery voice called My Gawd someone put the Ypool down in the Barrens bellybutton lint and all Eddie turned noticing the way Ben tightened up at the sound of a strange voice the way his lips thinned Standing above them and aways upstream on the path Ben had crossed the day before were Richie Tozier and Stanley Uris Richie came bopping down to the stream glanced at Ben with some interest and then pinched Eddies check Dont do that I hate it when you do that Richie Ah you love it Eds Richie said and beamed at him so what do you say You havin any good chucks or what The five of them knocked off around four oclock They sat much higher on the bankthe place where Bill Ben and Eddie had eaten lunch was now underwaterand stared down at their handiwork Even Ben found it a little difficult to believe He felt a sense of tired accomplishment which was mixed with uneasy fright He found himself thinking of Fantasia and how Mickey Mouse had known enough to get the brooms started but not enough to make them stop Fucking incredible Richie Tozier said softly and pushed his glasses up on his nose Eddie glanced over at him but Richie was not doing one of his numbers now his face was thoughtful almost solemn On the far side of the stream where the land first rose and then tilted shallowly downhill they had created a new piece of bogland Bracken and holly bushes stood in a foot of water Even as they sat here they could see the bog sending out fresh pseudopods spreading steadily westward Behind the dam the Kenduskeag shallow and harmless just this morning had become a still swollen band of water By two oclock the widening pool behind the dam had taken so much embankment that the spillways had grown almost to the size of rivers themselves Everyone but Ben had gone on an emergency expedition to the dump in search of more materials Ben stuck around methodically sodding up leaks The scavengers had returned not only with boards but with four bald tires the rusty door of a Hudson Hornet and a big piece of corrugatedsteel siding Under Bens leadership they had built two wings on the original dam blocking off the waters escape around the sides againand with the wings raked back at an angle against the current the dam worked even better than before He produced the crumpled redandwhite pack from his pants pocket and passed it around Eddie thinking of the hell a cigarette would raise with his asthma refused Stan also refused Bill took one and after a moments thought Ben took one too Richie produced a book of matches with the words ROITAN on the outside and lit first Bens cigarette then Bills He was about to light his own when Bill blew out the match Bill smiled apologetically TheTheThree on a muhmuhhatch he said BBad luhluhluck Bad luck for your folks when you were born Richie said and lit his cigarette with another match He lay down and crossed his arms beneath his head The cigarette jutted upward between his teeth Winston tastes good like a cigarette should He turned his head slightly and winked at Eddie Aint that right Eds Ben Eddie saw was looking at Richie with a mixture of awe and wariness Eddie could understand that He had known Richie Tozier for four years and he still didnt really understand what Richie was about He knew that Richie got As and Bs in his schoolwork but he also knew that Richie regularly got Cs and Ds in deportment His father really racked him about it and his mother just about cried every time Richie brought home those poor conduct grades and Richie would swear to do better and maybe he even would for a quarter or two The trouble with Richie was that he couldnt keep still for more than a minute at a time and he couldnt keep his mouth shut at all Down here in the Barrens that didnt get him in much trouble but the Barrens werent NeverNever Land and they couldnt be the Wild Boys for more than a few hours at a stretch the idea of a Wild Boy with an aspirator in his back pocket made Eddie smile The trouble with the Barrens was that you always had to leave Out there in the wider world Richies bullshit was always getting him in troublewith adults which was bad and with guys like Henry Bowers which was even worse His entrance earlier today was a perfect example Ben Hanscom had no more than started to say in when Richie had fallen on his knees at Bens feet He then began a series of gigantic salaams his arms outstretched his hands fwapping against the muddy bank every time he bowed again At the same time he had begun to speak in one of his Voices Richie had about a dozen different Voices His ambition he had told Eddie one rainy afternoon when they were in the little raftered room over the Kaspbrak garage reading Little Lulu comic books was to become the worlds greatest ventriloquist He was going to be even greater than Edgar Bergen he said and he would be on The Ed Sullivan Show every week Eddie admired this ambition but foresaw problems with it First ail of Richies Voices sounded pretty much like Richie Tozier This was not to say Richie could not be very funny from time to time he could be When referring to verbal zingers and loud farts Richies terminology was the same he called it Getting Off A Good One and he got off Good Ones of both types frequently usually in inappropriate company however Second when Richie did ventriloquism his lips moved Not just a little on the pand bsounds but a lot and on all the sounds Third when Richie said he was going to throw his voice it usually didnt go very far Most of his friends were too kindor too bemused with Richies sometimes enchanting often exhausting charmto mention these little failings to him Salaaming frantically in front of the startled and embarrassed Ben Hanscom Richie was speaking in what he called his Nigger Jim Voice Lawksamussy its be Haystack Calhoun Richie screamed dont fall on me Mistuh Haystack suh Youse gwineter cream me if you do Lawksamussy lawksamussy Three hunnert pounds of swaingin meat eightyeight inches from tit to tit Haystack be smellin jest like a loader panther shit Ise gwineter leadjer inter de raing Mistuh Haystack suh Ise sho enuf gwineter leadjer Jest dontchoo be fallin on dis yere black boy Richie bounced to his feet I heard that Denbrough You better leave me alone or Ill sic Haystack here on you BBest pppart of you rran down your fuhfuhhathers llleg Bill said True Richie said but look how much good stuff was left How ya doin Haystack Richie Tozier is my name doing Voices is my game He popped his hand out Thoroughly confused Ben reached for it Richie pulled his hand back Ben bunked Relenting Richie shook Seen you around school Richie said He swept a hand at the spreading pool of water This must have been your idea These wet ends couldnt light a firecracker with a flamethrower Ohyou mean it was your idea Eds Jesus Im sorry He fell down in front of Eddie and began salaaming wildly again Get up stop it youre splattering mud on me Eddie cried Richie jumped to his feet a second time and pinched Eddies cheek Cute cute cute Richie exclaimed Good deal Richie turned and discovered Stanley Uris standing behind him hands in his pockets watching quietly as Richie put on his show This heres Stan the Man Uris Richie told Ben stans a Jew Also he killed Christ At least thats what Victor Criss told me one day I been after Stan ever since I figure if hes that old he ought to be able to buy us some beer Right Stan I think that must have been my father Stan said in a low pleasant voice and that broke them all up Ben included Eddie laughed until he was wheezing and tears were running down his face A Good One Richie cried striding around with his arms thrown up over his head like a football referee signalling that the extra point was good stan the Man Gets Off A Good One Great Moments in History YowzaYowzaYOWza Hi Stan said to Ben seeming to take no notice of Richie at all Hello Ben replied We were in the same class in second grade You were the kid who Stan wouldnt say shit if he had a mouthful Richie said Which he FREEquently doesyowzayowzaYOW Okay but first I have to tell you one more thing much as I hate to I think youre losing your dam Valleys gonna flood pardners Lets get the women and children out first And without bothering to roll up his pantsor even to remove his sneakersRichie jumped into the water and began to slam sods into place on the nearside wing of the dam where the persistent current was pulling fill out in muddy streamers again A piece of Red Cross adhesive tape was wrapped around one of the bows of his glasses and the loose end flapped against his cheekbone as he worked Bill caught Eddies eye smiled a Little and shrugged It was just Richie He could drive you bugshit but it was still sort of nice to have him around They worked on the dam for the next hour or so Richie took Bens commandswhich had become rather tentative again with two more kids to generalwith perfect willingness and fulfilled them at a manic pace When each mission was completed he reported back to Ben for further orders executing a backhand British salute and snapping the soggy heels of his sneakers together Every now and then he would begin to harangue the others in one of his Voices the German Commandant Toodles the English Butler the Southern Senator who sounded quite a bit like Foghorn Leghorn and who would in the fullness of time evolve into a character named Buford Kissdrivel the MovieTone Newsreel Narrator The work did not just go forward it sprinted forward And now shortly before five oclock as they sat resting on the bank it seemed that what Richie had said was true they had stopped the sucker cold The car door the piece of corrugated steel and the old tires had become the second stage of the dam and it was backstopped by a huge sloping hill of earth and stones Bill Ben and Richie smoked Stan was lying on his back A stranger might have thought he was just looking at the sky but Eddie knew better Stan was looking into the trees on the other side of the stream keeping an eye out for a bird or two he could write up in his bird notebook that night Eddie himself just sat crosslegged feeling pleasantly tired and rather mellow At that moment the others seemed to him like the greatest bunch of guys to chum with a fellow could ever hope to have They felt right together they fitted neatly against each others edges He couldnt explain it to himself any better than that and since it didnt really seem to need any explaining he decided he ought to just let it be He looked over at Ben who was holding his halfsmoked cigarette clumsily and spitting frequently as if he didnt like the taste of it much As Eddie watched Ben stubbed it out and covered the long butt with dirt Ben looked up saw Eddie watching him and looked away embarrassed Eddie glanced at Bill and saw something on Bills face that he didnt like Bill was looking across the water and into the trees and bushes on the far side his eyes gray and thoughtful That brooding expression was back on his face Eddie thought Bill looked almost haunted As if reading his thought Bill looked around at him Eddie smiled but Bill didnt smile back He put his cigarette out and looked around at the others Even Richie had withdrawn into the silence of his own thoughts an event which occurred about as seldom as a lunar eclipse Eddie knew that Bill rarely said anything important unless it was perfectly quiet because it was so hard for him to speak And he suddenly wished he had something to say or that Richie would start in with one of his Voices He was suddenly sure Bill was going to open his mouth and say something terrible something which would change everything Eddie reached automatically for his aspirator pulled it out of his back pocket and held it in his hand He did this without even thinking about it They all looked at him Crack a joke Richie Eddie thought Crack a joke say something really outrageous embarrass him I dont care just shut him up Whatever it is I dont want to hear it I dont want things to change I dont want to be scared In his mind a tenebrous croaking voice whispered Ill do it for a dime Eddie shuddered and tried to unthink that voice and the sudden image it called up in his mind the house on Neibolt Street its front yard overgrown with weeds gigantic sunflowers nodding in the untended garden off to one side Bill opened his mouth more anxiety on Eddies part closed it blessed relief for Eddie and then opened it again renewed anxiety IIIf you guhguhguys lllaugh IIll never hhang around with you again Bill said Its cuhcuhcrazy but I swear Im not muhhaking it up It rrreally happened We wont laugh Ben said He looked around at the others Will we Eddie wanted to say Yes we will too Billy well laugh our heads off and say youre really stupid so why dont you shut up right now But of course he could not say any such thing This was after all Big Bill He shook his head miserably No he wouldnt laugh He had never felt less like laughing in his life They sat there above the dam Ben had showed them how to make looking from Bills face to the expanding pool and the likewise expanding bog beyond it and then back to Bills face again listening silently as he told them about what had happened when he opened Georges photograph albumhow Georgies school photograph had turned its head and winked at him how the book had bled when he threw it across the room It was a long painful recital and by the time he finished Bill was redfaced and sweating Eddie had never heard him stutter so badly At last though the tale was told Bill looked around at them both defiant and afraid Eddie saw an identical expression on the faces of Ben Richie and Stan It was solemn awed fear It was not in the slightest tinctured by disbelief An urge came to him then an urge to spring to his feet and shout What a crazy story You dont believe that crazy story do you and even if you do you dont believe we believe it do you School pictures cant wink Books cant bleed Youre out of your mind Big Bill But he couldnt very well do so because that expression of solemn fear was also on his own face He couldnt see it but he could feel it Come back here kid the hoarse voice whispered Ill blow you for free Come back here No Eddie moaned at it Please go away I dont want to think about that And now Eddie saw something elsenot on Richies face at least he didnt think so but on Stans and Bens for sure He knew what that something else was knew because that expression was on his own face too The house at Neibolt Street was just outside the Derry trainyards It was old and boarded up its porch gradually sinking back into the ground its lawn an overgrown field An old trike rusting and overturned hid in that long grass one wheel sticking up at an angle But on the left side of the porch there was a huge bald patch in the lawn and you could see dirty cellar windows set into the houses crumbling brick foundation It was in one of those windows that Eddie Kaspbrak first saw the face of the leper six weeks ago On Saturdays when Eddie could find no one to play with he often went down to the trainyards No real reason he just liked to go out there He would ride his bike out Witcham Street and then cut to the northwest along Route where it crossed Witcham The Neibolt Street Church School stood on the corner of Route  and Neibolt Street a mile or so farther on It was a shabbyneat woodframe building with a large cross on top and the words SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME written over the front door in gilt letters two feet high Sometimes on Saturdays Eddie heard music and singing coming from inside It was gospel music but whoever was playing the piano sounded more like Jerry Lee Lewis than a regular church piano player The singing didnt sound very religious to Eddie either although there was lots of stuff in it about beautiful Zion and being washed in the blood of the lamb and what a friend we have in Jesus The people singing seemed to be having much too good a time for it to really be sacred singing in Eddies opinion But he liked the sound of it all the samethe way he liked to hear Jerry Lee hollering out Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On Sometimes he would stop for awhile across the street leaning his bike against a tree and pretending to read on the grass actually jiving along to the music Other Saturdays the Church School would be shut up and silent and he would ride out to the trainyard without stopping out to where Neibolt Street ended in a parking lot with weeds growing up through the cracks in the asphalt There he would lean his bike against the wooden fence and watch the trains go by There were a lot of them on Saturdays His mother told him that in the old days you could catch a GS ampWM passenger train at what was then Neibolt Street Station but the passenger trains had stopped running around the time the Korean War was starting up If you got on the northbound train you went to Brownsville Station she said and from Brownsville you could catch a train that would take you all the way across Canada if you wanted all the way to the Pacific The southbound tram would take you to Portland and then on down to Boston and from South Station the country was yours But the passenger trains have gone the way of the trolley lines now I guess No one wants to ride a train when they can just jump in a Ford and go You may never even ride one But great long freights still came through Derry They headed south loaded down with pulpwood paper and potatoes and north with manufactured goods for those towns of what Maine people sometimes called the Big NorthernBangor Millinocket Machias Presque Isle Houlton Eddie particularly liked to watch the northbound carcarriers with their loads of gleaming Fords and Chevies Ill have me a car like one of those someday he promised himself Like one of those or even better Maybe even a Cadillac There were six tracks in all swooping into the station like strands of cobweb tending toward the center Bangor and Great Northern Lines from the north the Great Southern and Western Maine from the west the Boston and Maine from the south and Southern Seacoast from the east One day two years before when Eddie had been standing near the latter line and watching a train go through a drunken trainman had thrown a crate out of a slowmoving boxcar at Mm Eddie ducked and flinched backward although the crate landed in the cinders ten feet away There were things inside it live things that clicked and moved Last ran boy the drunken trainman had shouted He pulled a flat brown bottle from one of the pockets of his denim jacket tipped it up drank then flipped it into the cinders where it smashed The trainman pointed at the crate Take em home to yer mum Compliments of the SouthernFuckingSeacoastBoundforWelfare Line He had reeled forward to shout these last words as the train pulled away gathering speed now and for one alarming moment Eddie thought he was going to tumble right out When the train was gone Eddie went to the box and bent cautiously over it He was afraid to get too close The things inside were slithery and crawly If the trainman had yelled that they were for him Eddie would have left them right there But he had said take em home to your Mom and like Ben when someone said Mom Eddie jumped He scrounged a hank of rope from one of the empty quonset warehouses and tied the crate onto the package carrier of his bike His mother had peered inside the crate even more warily than Eddie himself and then she screamedbut with delight rather than terror There were four lobsters in the crate big twopounders with their claws pegged She cooked them for supper and had been extremely grumpy with Eddie when he wouldnt eat any What do you think the Rockefellers are eating this evening at their place in Bar Harbor she asked indignantly What do you think the swells are eating at Twentyone and Sardis in New York City Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches Theyre eating lobster Eddie same as we are Now come ongive it a try But Eddie wouldntat least that was what his mother said Maybe it was true but inside it felt more to Eddie like couldnt than wouldnt He kept thinking of the way they had slithered inside the crate and the clicking sounds their claws had made She kept telling him how delicious they were and what a treat he was missing until he started to gasp for breath and had to use his aspirator Then she left him alone Eddie retreated to his bedroom and read His mother called up her friend Eleanor Dunton Eleanor came over and the two of them read old copies of Photoplay and Screen Secrets and giggled over the gossip columns and gorged themselves on cold lobster salad When Eddie got up for school the next morning his mother was still in bed snoring away and letting frequent farts that sounded like long mellow cornet notes she was Getting Off Some Good Ones Richie would have said There was nothing left in the bowl where the lobster salad had been except a few tiny blots of mayonnaise That was the last Southern Seacoast train Eddie ever saw and when he later saw Mr Braddock the Derry trainmaster he asked him hesitantly what had happened Cumpny went broke Mr Braddock said Thats all there was to it Dont you read the papers Its hapnin ail over the damn country Now get out of here This aint no place for a kid After that Eddie would sometimes walk along track which had been the Southern Seacoast track and listen as a mental conductor chanted names inside his head reeling them off in a lovely Downcast monotone those names those magic names Camden Rockland Bar Harbor pronounced Baa Haabaa Wiscasset Bath Portland Ogunquit the Berwicks he would walk down track  heading east until he got tired and the weeds growing up between the crossties made him feel sad Once he had looked up and seen seagulls probably just fat old dumpgulls who didnt give a shit if they ever saw the ocean but that had not occurred to him then wheeling and crying overhead and the sound of their voices had made him cry a little too There had once been a gate at the entrance to the trainyards but it had blown over in a windstorm and no one had bothered to replace it Eddie came and went pretty much as he liked although Mr Braddock would kick him out if he saw him or any other kid for that matter There were truckdrivers who would chase you sometimes put not very far because they thought you were hanging around just so you could hawk somethingand sometimes kids did Mostly though the place was quiet There was a guardbooth but it was empty its glass windows broken by stones There had been no fulltime security service since or so Mr Braddock shooed the kids away by day and a nightwatchman drove through four or five times a night in an old Studebaker with a searchlight mounted outside the vent window and that was all There were tramps and hobos sometimes though If anything about the trainyards scared Eddie they didmen with unshaven cheeks and cracked skin and blisters on their hands and coldsores on their lips They rode the rails for awhile and then climbed down for awhile and spent some time in Derry and then got on another train and went somewhere else Sometimes they had missing fingers Usually they were drunk and wanted to know if you had a cigarette One of these fellows had crawled out from under the porch of the house at Neibolt Street one day and had offered to give Eddie a blowjob for a quarter Eddie had backed away his skin like ice his mouth as dry as lintballs One of the hobos nostrils had been eaten away You could look right into the red scabby channel I dont have a quarter Eddie said backing toward his bike Ill do it for a dime the hobo croaked coming toward him He was wearing old green flannel pants Yellow puke was stiffening across the lap He unzipped his fly and reached inside He was trying to grin His nose was a red horror I I dont have a dime either Eddie said and suddenly thought Oh my God hes got leprosy If he touches me Ill catch it too His control snapped and he ran He heard the hobo break into a shuffling run behind him his old stringtied shoes slapping and flapping across the riotous lawn of the empty saltbox house Come back here kid Ill blow you for free Come back here Eddie had leaped on his bike wheezing now feeling his throat closing up to a pinhole His chest had taken on weight He hit the pedals and was just picking up speed when one of the hobos hands struck the package carrier The bike shimmied Eddie looked over his shoulder and saw the hobo running along behind the rear wheel GAINING his lips drawn back from the black stumps of his teeth in an expression which might have been either desperation or fury In spite of the stones lying on his chest Eddie had pedaled even faster expecting that one of the hobos scabcrusted hands would close over his arm at any moment pulling him from his Raleigh and dumping him in the ditch where God knew what would happen to him He hadnt dared look around until he had flashed past the Church School and through the Route intersection The bo was gone Eddie held this terrible story inside him for almost a week and then confided it to Richie Tozier and Bill Denbrough one day when they were reading comics over the garage He didnt have leprosy you dummy Richie said He had the Syph Eddie looked at Bill to see if Richie was ribbing himhe had never heard of a disease called the Sift before It sounded like something Richie might have made up Bill nodded gravely Only its the SuhSuhSyph not the Sift Its sshort for syphilis Its a disease you get from fucking Richie said You know about fucking dont you Eds Sure Eddie said He hoped he wasnt blushing He knew that when you got older stuff came out of your penis when it was hard Vincent Boogers Taliendo had filled him in on the rest one day at school What you did when you fucked according to Boogers was you rubbed your cock against a girls stomach until it got hard your cock not the girls stomach Then you rubbed some more until you started to get the feeling When Eddie asked what that meant Boogers had only shaken his head in a mysterious way Boogers said that you couldnt describe it but youd know it as soon as you got it He said you could practice by lying in the bathtub and rubbing your cock with Ivory soap Eddie had tried this but the only feeling he got was the need to urinate after awhile Anyway Boogers went on after you got the feeling this stuff came out of your penis Most kids called it come Boogers said but his big brother had told him that the really scientific word for it was jizzum And when you got the feeling you had to grab your cock and aim it real fast so you could shoot the jizzum into the girls bellybutton as soon as it came out It went down into her stomach and made a baby there Do girls like that Eddie had asked Boogers Taliendo He himself was sort of appalled Now listen up Eds Richie said because there may be questions later Some women have got this disease Some men too but mostly its women A guy can get it from a woman Right The important thing is you get the Syph from screwing someone whos already got it Its bad I know but its true Richie said Your nose is the first thing to go Some guys with the Syph their noses fall right off Then their cocks So whats the difference between leprosy and the Syph Eddie asked You dont get leprosy from fucking Richie said promptly and then went off into a gale of laughter that left both Bill and Eddie mystified Following that day the house at Neibolt Street had taken on a kind of glow in Eddies imagination Looking at its weedy yard and its slumped porch and the boards nailed across its windows he would feel an unhealthy fascination take hold of him And six weeks ago he had parked his bike on the gravelly verge of the street the sidewalk ended four houses farther back and walked across the lawn toward the porch of that house His heart had been beating hard in his chest and his mouth had that dry taste againlistening to Bills story of the dreadful picture he knew that what he had felt when approaching that house was about the same as what Bill had felt going into Georges room He did not feel as if he was in control of himself He felt pushed It did not seem as if his feet were moving instead the house itself brooding and silent seemed to draw closer to where he stood Faintly he could hear a diesel engine in the trainyardthat and the liquidmetallic slam of couplings being made They were shunting some cars onto sidings picking up others Making a train His hand gripped his aspirator but oddly his asthma had not closed down as it had on the day he fled from the hobo with the rotted nose There was only that sense of standing still and watching the house slide stealthily toward him as if on a hidden track Eddie looked under the porch There was no one there It was not really surprising This was spring and hobos showed up most frequently in Derry from late September to early November During those six weeks or so a man could pick up daywork on one of the outlying farms if he looked even halfdecent There were potatoes and apples to pick snowfence to string barn and shed roofs which needed to be patched before December came along whistling up winter No hobos under the porch but plenty of sign they had been there Empty beer cans empty beer bottles empty liquor bottles A dirtcrusted blanket lay against the brick foundation like a dead dog There were drifts of crumpled newspapers and one old shoe and a smell like garbage There were thick layers of old leaves under there Not wanting to do it but unable to help himself Eddie had crawled under the porch He could feel his heartbeat slamming in his head now driving white spots of light across his field of vision The smell was worse underneathbooze and sweat and the dark brown perfume of decaying leaves The old leaves didnt even crackle under his hands and knees They and the old newspapers only sighed Im a hobo Eddie thought incoherently Im a hobo and I ride the rods Thats what I do Aint got no money aint got no home but I got me a bottle and a dollar and a place to sleep Ill pick apples this week and potatoes the week after that and when the frost locks up the ground like money inside a bank vault why Ill hop a GS ampWM box that smells of sugarbeets and Ill sit in the corner and pull some hay over me if there is some and Ill drink me a little drink and chew me a link chew and sooner or later Ill get to Portland or Beantown and if I dont get busted by a railroad security dick Ill hop one of those Bama Star boxes and head down south and when I get there Ill pick lemons or limes or oranges And if I get nagged Ill build roads for tourists to ride on Hell I done it before aint I Im just a lonesome old hobo aint got no money aint got no home but I got me one thing I got me a disease thats eating me up My skins cracking open my teeth are falling out and you know what I can feel myself turning bad like an apple thats going soft I can feel it happening eating from the inside to the out eating eating eating me Eddie pulled the stiffening blanket aside tweezing at it with his thumb and forefinger grimacing at its matted feel One of those low cellar windows was directly behind it one pane broken the other opaque with dirt He leaned forward now feeling almost hypnotized He leaned closer to the window closer to the cellardarkness breathing in that smell of age and must and dryrot closer and closer to the black and surely the leper would have caught him if his asthma hadnt picked that exact moment to kick up It cramped his lungs with a weight that was painless yet frightening his breath at once took on the familiar hateful whistling sound He drew back and that was when the face appeared Its coming was so sudden so startling and yet at the same time so expected that Eddie could not have screamed even if he hadnt been having an asthma attack His eyes bulged His mouth creaked open It was not the hobo with the flayed nose but there were resemblances Terrible resemblances And yet this thing could not be human Nothing could be so eaten up and remain alive The skin of its forehead was split open White bone coated with a membrane of yellow mucusy stuff peered through like the lens of a bleary searchlight The nose was a bridge of raw gristle above two red flaring channels One eye was a gleeful blue The other socket was filled with a mass of spongy brownblack tissue The lepers lower lip sagged like liver It had no upper lip at all its teeth poked out in a sneering ring It shot one hand out through the broken pane It shot the other through the dirty glass to the left shattering it to fragments Its questing clutching hands crawled with sores Beetles crawled and lumbered busily to and fro Mewling gasping Eddie hunched his way backward He could hardly breathe His heart was a runaway engine in his chest The leper appeared to be wearing the ragged remains of some strange silvery suit Things were crawling in the straggles of its brown hair How bout a blowjob Eddie the apparition croaked grinning with its remains of a mouth It lilted Bobby does it for a dime he will do it anytime fifteen cents for overtime It winked Thats me EddieBob Gray And now that weve been properly introduced One of its hands splatted against Eddies right shoulder Eddie screamed thinly Thats all right the leper said and Eddie saw with dreamlike terror that it was crawling out of the window The bony shield behind its peeling forehead snapped the thin wooden strip between the two panes Its hands clawed through the leafy mulchy earth The silver shoulders of its suit costume whatever it was began to push through the gap That one glaring blue eye never left Eddies face Here I come Eddie thats all right it croaked Youll like it down here with us Some of your friends are down here Its hand reached out again and in some corner of his panicmaddened screaming mind Eddie was suddenly coldly sure that if that thing touched his bare skin he would begin to rot too The thought broke his paralysis He skittered backward on his hands and knees then turned and lunged for the far end of the porch Sunlight falling in narrow dusty beams through the cracks between the porch boards striped his face from moment to moment His head pushed through the dusty cobwebs that settled in his hair He looked back over his shoulder and saw that the leper was halfway out It wont do you any good to run Eddie it called Eddie had reached the far end of the porch There was a latticework skirt here The sun shone through it printing diamonds of light on his cheeks and forehead He lowered his head and slammed into it with no hesitation at all tearing the entire skirt free with a scream of rusted hapenny nails There was a tangle of rosebushes beyond and Eddie tore through these stumbling to his feet as he did so not feeling the thorns that scrawled shallow cuts along his arms and cheeks and neck He turned and backed away on buckling legs pulling his aspirator out of his pocket triggering it Surely it hadnt really happened He had been thinking about that hobo and his mind had well had just shown him a movie a horror movie like one of those Saturdaymatinee pictures with Frankenstein and Wolfman that they had sometimes at the Bijou or the Gem or the Aladdin Sure that was all He had scared himself What an asshole There was even time to utter a shaky laugh at the unsuspected vividness of his imagination before the rotting hands shot out from under the porch clawing at the rosebushes with mindless ferocity pulling at them stripping them printing beads of blood on them The leper was crawling out It was wearing a clown suit he sawa clown suit with big orange buttons down the front It saw Eddie and grinned Its halfmouth dropped open and its tongue lolled out Eddie shrieked again but no one could have heard one boys breathless shriek under the pounding of the diesel engine in the trainyard The lepers tongue had not just dropped from its mouth it was at least three feet long and had unrolled like a partyfavor It came to an arrowpoint which dragged in the dirt Foam thicksticky and yellowish coursed along it Bugs crawled over it The rosebushes which had been showing the first touches of spring green when Eddie broke through them now turned a dead and lacy black Eddie raced for his bike It was the same race as before only it now had the quality of a nightmare where you can only move with the most agonizing slowness no matter how hard you try to go fast and in those dreams didnt you always hear or feel something some It gaining on you Didnt you always smell Its stinking breath as Eddie was smelling it now For a moment he felt a wild hope perhaps this really was a nightmare Perhaps he would awake in his own bed bathed in sweat shaking maybe even crying but alive Safe Then he pushed the thought away Its charm was deadly its comfort fatal He did not try to mount his bike immediately he ran with it instead head down pushing the handlebars He felt as if he was drowning not in water but inside his own chest Blowjob the leper whispered again Come back anytime Eddie Bring your friends Its rotting fingers seemed to touch the back of his neck but perhaps that was only a dangling strand of cobweb from under the porch caught in his hair and brushing against his shrinking flesh Eddie leaped onto his bike and pedaled away not caring that his throat had closed up tight as Tillie again not giving two sucks for his asthma not looking back He didnt look back until he was almost home and of course there was nothing behind him when he finally did but two kids headed over to the park to play ball That night lying straight as a poker in bed one hand folded tightly around his aspirator looking into the shadows he heard the leper whisper It wont do you any good to run Eddie Wow Richie said respectfully It was the first thing any of them had said since Bill Denbrough finished his story Richie gave him the last one in the pack he had hawked almost empty from his dads desk drawer He even lit it for Bill real I said Eddie looked at him almost resentfully It really happened It was real And before he could stop himselfbefore he even knew he was going to do itEddie found himself telling the story of the leper that had come crawling out of the basement at Neibolt Street Halfway through the telling he began to gasp and had to use his aspirator And at the end he burst into shrill tears his thin body shaking They all looked at him uncomfortably and then Stan put a hand on his back Bill gave him an awkward hug while the others glanced away embarrassed I saw it too Ben Hanscom said suddenly His voice was flat and harsh and scared Eddie looked up his face still naked with tears his eyes red and rawlooking What I saw the clown Ben said Only he wasnt like you saidat least not when I saw him He wasnt all gooshy He was he was dry He paused ducked his head and looked at his hands which lay palely on his elephantine thighs I think he was the mummy Like that but not like that Ben said slowly In the movies he looks fake Its scary but you can tell its a putup job you know All those bandages they look too neat or something But this guy he looked the way a real mummy would look I think If you actually found one in a room under a pyramid I mean Except for the suit Ben looked at Eddie A silver suit with big orange buttons down the front Eddies mouth dropped open He shut it and said If youre kidding say so I still I still dream about that guy under the porch Its not a joke Ben said and began to tell the story He told it slowly beginning with his volunteering to help Mrs Douglas count and store books and ending with his own bad dreams He spoke slowly not looking at the others He spoke as if deeply ashamed of his own behavior He didnt raise his head again until the story was over You must have dreamed it Richie said finally He saw Ben wince and hurried on Now dont take it personal Big Ben but you got to see that balloons cant like float against the wind Richie looked from Ben to Bill troubled Accusing Ben of dreaming awake was one thing accusing Bill was something else Bill was their leader the guy they all looked up to No one said so out loud no one needed to But Bill was the idea man the guy who could think of something to do on a boring day the guy who remembered games the others had forgotten And in some odd way they all sensed something comfortingly adult about Billperhaps it was a sense of accountability a feeling that Bill would take the responsibility if responsibility needed to be taken The truth was Richie believed Bills story crazy as it was And perhaps he didnt want to believe Bens or Eddies for that matter Nothing like that ever happened to you huh Eddie asked Richie Richie paused began to say something shook his head paused again then said scariest thing Ive seen lately was Mark Prenderlist takin a leak in McCarron Park Ugliest hogger you ever saw No Stan said quickly and looked somewhere else His small face was pale his lips pressed together so tightly they were white No I told you Stan got to his feet and walked to the embankment hands in his pockets He stood watching the water course over the top of the original dam and pile up behind the second Watergate Come on now Stanley Richie said in a shrill falsetto This was another of his Voices Granny Grunt When speaking in his Granny Grunt Voice Richie would hobble around with one fist against the small of his back and cackle a lot He still however sounded more like Richie Tozier than anyone else Fess up Stanley tell your old Granny about the baaaaad clown and Ill give you a chockerchip cookie You just tell Shut up Stan yelled suddenly whirling on Richie who fell back a step or two astonished Just shut up Yowza boss Richie said and sat down He looked at Stan Uris mistrustfully Bright spots of color flamed in Stans cheeks but he still looked more scared than mad It wasnt a clown Stanley said His eyes flicked from one of them to the next to the next to the next He seemed to struggle with himself Which was when the carrying whiskeyroughened tones of Mr Nell interrupted making them all jump as if they had been shot Jaysus Christ on a jumpedup chariotdriven crutch Look at this mess Jaysus Christ Richard Tozier turns off the radio which has been blaring out Madonnas Like a Virgin on WZON a station which declares itself to be Bangers AM stereo rocker with a kind of hysterical frequency pulls over to the side of the road shuts down the engine of the Mustang the Avis people rented him at Bangor International and gets out He hears the pull and release of his own breath in his ears He has seen a sign which has caused the flesh of his back to break out in hard ridges of gooseflesh He walks to the front of the car and puts one hand on its hood He hears the engine ticking softly to itself as it cools He hears a jay scream briefly and then shut up There are crickets And as far as the soundtrack goes thats it He has seen the sign he passes it and suddenly he is in Derry again After twentyfive years Richie Trashmouth Tozier has come home He has Burning agony suddenly needles into his eyes breaking his thought cleanly off He utters a strangled little shout and his hands fly up to his face The only time he felt anything even remotely like this burning pain was when he got an eyelash caught under one of his contacts in collegeand that was only in one eye This terrible pain is in both Before he can reach even halfway to his face the pain is gone He lowers his hands again slowly thoughtfully and looks down Route He left the turnpike at the EtnaHaven exit wanting for some reason he doesnt understand not to come in by the turnpike which was still under construction in the Derry area when he and his folks shook the dust of this weird little town from their heels and headed out for the Midwest Nothe turnpike would have been quicker but it would have been wrong So he had driven along Route through the sleeping nestle of buildings that was Haven Village then turned off on Route  And as he went the day grew steadily brighter Now this sign It was the same sort of sign which marked the borders of more than six hundred Maine towns but how this one had squeezed his heart Beyond that an Elks sign a Rotary Club sign and completing the trinity a sign proclaiming the fact that DERR Y LIONS ROAR FOR THE UNITED FUND Past that one there is just Route again continuing on in a straight line between bulking banks of pine and spruce In this silent light as the day steadies itself those trees look as dreamy as bluegray cigarette smoke stacked on the moveless air of a sealed room Derry he thinks Derry God help me Derry Stone the crows Here he is on Route Five miles up if time or tornado has not carried it away in the intervening years will be the Rhulin Farms where his mother bought all of their eggs and most of their vegetables Two miles beyond that Route  became Witcham Road and of course Witcham Road eventually became Witcham Street can you gimme hallelujah world without end amen And somewhere along there between the Rhulin Farms and town he would drive past the Bowers place and then the Hanlon place A mile or so after Hanlons he would see the first glitter of the Kenduskeag and the first spreading tangle of poison green The lush lowlands that had been known for some reason as the Barrens I really dont know if I can face all of that Richie thinks I mean lets tell the truth here folks I just dont know if I can The whole previous night has passed in a dream for him As long as he continued travelling moving forward making miles the dream went on But now he has stoppedor rather the sign has stopped himand he has awakened to a strange truth the dream was the reality Derry is the reality It seems he just cannot stop remembering he thinks the memories will eventually drive him mad and now he bites down on his lip and puts his hands together palm to palm tight as if to keep himself from flying apart He feels that he will fly apart and soon There seems to be some mad part of him which actually looks forward to what may be coming but most of him only wonders how hes going to get through the next few days He A deer is walking out into the road He can hear the light thud of its springsoft hoofs on the tar Richies breath stops in midexhale then slowly starts again He looks dumbfounded part of him thinking that he never saw anything like this on Rodeo Drive Nohed needed to come back home to see something like this Its a doe doe a deer a female deer a Voice chants merrily in his head Shes out of the woods on the right and pauses in the middle of Route front legs on one side of the broken white line rear legs on the other Her dark eyes regard Rich Tozier mildly He reads interest in those eyes but no fear He looks at her in wonder thinking shes an omen or a portent or some sort of Madame Azonka shit like that And then quite unexpectedly a memory of Mr Nell comes to him What a start he had given them that day busting in on them in the wake of Bills story and Bens story and Eddies story The whole bunch of them had damn near gone up to heaven Now looking at the deer Rich draws in a deep breath and finds himself speaking in one of his Voices but for the first time in twentyfive years or more it is the Voice of the Irish Cop one he had incorporated into his repertoire after that memorable day It comes rolling out of the morning silence like a great big bowling ballit is louder and bigger than Richie would ever have believed Jaysus Christ on a jumpedup chariotdriven crutch Whats a nice girrul like you doin out in this wilderness deer Jaysus Christ You be gettin on home before I decide to tell Father Ostaggers on ye Before the echoes have died away before the first shocked jay can begin scolding him for his sacrilege the doe flicks her tail at him like a truce flag and disappears into the smokylooking firs on the left side of the road leaving only a small pile of steaming pellets behind to show that even at thirtyseven Richie Tozier is still capable of Getting Off A Good One from time to time Richie begins to laugh He is only chuckling at first and then his own ludicrousness strikes himstanding here in the dawnlight of a Maine morning thirtyfour hundred miles from home shouting at a deer in the accents of an Irish cop The chuckles become a string of giggles the giggles become guffaws the guffaws become howls and he is finally reduced to holding on to his car while tears roll down his face and he wonders dimly if hes going to wet his pants or what Every time he starts to get control of himself his eyes fix on that little clump of pellets and he goes off into fresh gales Snorting and snickering he is at last able to get back into the drivers seat and restart the Mustangs engine An Orinco chemicalfertilizer truck snores by in a blast of wind After it passes him Rich pulls out and heads for Derry again He feels better now in control or maybe its just that hes moving again making miles and the dream has reasserted itself He starts thinking about Mr Nell againMr Nell and that day by the dam Mr Nell had asked them who thought this little trick up He can see the five of them looking uneasily at each other and remembers how Ben finally stepped forward cheeks pale and eyes downcast face trembling all over as he fought grimly to keep from blubbering Poor kid probably thought he was going to get fivetoten in Shawshank for backflooding the drains on Witcham Street Rich thinks now but he had owned up to it just the same And by doing that he had forced the rest of them to come forward and back him up It was either that or consider themselves bad guys Cowards All the things their TV heroes were not And that had welded them together for better or worse Had apparently welded them together for the last twentyseven years Sometimes events are dominoes The first knocks over the second the second knocks over the third and there you are When Richie wonders did it become too late to turn back When he and Stan showed up and pitched in helping to build the dam When Bill told them how the school picture of his brother had turned its head and winked Maybe but to Rich Tozier it seems that the dominoes really began to fall when Ben Hanscom stepped forward and said I showed them Mr Nell simply stood there looking at him lips pressed together hands on his creaking black leather belt He looked from Ben to the spreading pool behind the dam and then back to Ben again his face that of a man who cant believe what he is seeing He was a burly Irishman his hair a premature white combed back in neat waves beneath his peaked blue cap His eyes were bright blue his nose bright red There were small nests of burst capillaries in his cheeks He was a man of no more than medium height but to the five boys arrayed before him he looked at least eight feet tall Mr Nell opened his mouth to speak but before he could Bill Denbrough had stepped up beside Ben IhIhIhIt wwuhwuhwas mmy iiiiidea he finally managed to say He heaved in a gigantic gulping breath and as Mr Nell stood there regarding him impassively the sun tossing back imperial flashes from his badge Bill managed to stutter out the rest of what he needed to say it wasnt Bens fault Ben just happened to come along and show them how to do better what they were already doing badly Me too Eddie said abruptly and stepped up on Bens other side Whats this me too Mr Nell asked Is that yer name or yer address buckaroo Eddie flushed brightlythe color went all the way up to the roots of bis hair I was with Bill before Ben even came he said That was all I meant Richie stepped up next to Eddie The idea that a Voice or two might cheer Mr Nell up a little get him thinking jolly thoughts popped into his head On second thought and second thoughts were for Richie extremely rare and wonderful things maybe a Voice or two might only make things worse Mr Nell didnt look like he was in what Richie sometimes thought of as a chuckalicious mood In fact Mr Nell looked like maybe chucks were the last thing on his mind So he just said I was in on it too in a low voice and then made his mouth shut up Now the five of them were standing before Mr Nell in a line Ben looked from one side to the other more than dazedhe was almost stupefied by their support For a moment Richie thought ole Haystack was going to burst into tears of gratitude Jaysus Mr Nell said again and although he sounded deeply disgusted his face suddenly looked as if it might like to laugh A sorrier bunch of boyos I aint nivver seen If yer folks knew where you were I guess thered be some hot bottoms tonight I aint sure there wont be anyway Richie could hold back no longer his mouth simply fell open and then ran away like the gingerbread man as it so often did Hows things back in the auid country Mr Nell it bugled Ah yer a sight for sore eyes sure an begorrah yer a lovely man a credit to the auld sod Ill be a credit to the seat of yer pants in about three seconds my dear little friend Mr Nell said dryly Bill turned on him snarled For GGGods ssake RRRichie shuhshuhhut UP Good advice Master William Denbrough Mr Nell said Ill bet Zack doesnt know youre down here in the Barns playing amongst the floating turdies does he Bill dropped his eyes shook his head Wild roses burned in his cheeks Mr Nell looked at Ben I dont recall your name son Mr Nell nodded and looked back at the dam again This was your idea How to build it yeah Bens whisper was now nearly inaudible Well yer a hell of an engineer big boy but you dont know Jack Shit about these here Barns or the Derry drainage system do you Not unkindly Mr Nell told him Theres two parts to the system One part carries solid human wasteshit if Id not be offendin yer tender ears The other part carries gray waterwater flushed from toilets or run down the drains from sinks and washinmachines and showers its also the water that runs down the gutters into the city drains Well yeve caused no problems with the solidwaste removal thank Godall of that gets pumped into the Kenduskeag a bit farther down Theres probably some almighty big patties down that way half a mile dryin in the sun thanks to what you done but you can be pretty sure that there aint shit stickin to anyones ceiling because of it But as for the gray water well theres no pumps for gray water That all runs downhill in what the engineer boyos call gravity drains And Ill bet you know where all them gravity drains end up dont you big boy Up there Ben said He pointed to the area behind the dam the area they had in large part submerged He did this without looking up Big tears were beginning to course slowly down his cheeks Mr Nell pretended not to notice Thats right my large young friend All them gravity drains feed into streams that feed into the upper Barrens In fact a good many of them little streams that come tricklin down are gray water and gray water only comin out of drams you cant even see theyre so deepburied in the underbrush The shit goes one way and everythin else goes the other God praise the clever mind o man and did it ever cross yer minds that youd spent the whole livelong day paddlin around in Derrys pee an old washwater Eddie suddenly began to gasp and had to use his aspirator What you did was back water up into about six o the eight central Catchbasins that serve Witcham and Jackson and Kansas and four or five little streets that run between em Mr Nell fixed Bill Denbrough with a dry glance One of em serves yer own hearth an home young Master Denbrough So there we are with sinks that wont drain washinmachines that wont drain outflow pipes pourin merrily into cellars Ben let out a dry barking sob The others turned toward him and then looked away Mr Nell put a large hand on the boys shoulder It was callused and hard but at the moment it was also gentle Now now No need to take on big boy Maybe it aint that bad at least not yet could be I exaggerated just a mite to make sure you took my point They sent me down to see if a tree blew down across the stream That happens from time to time Theres no need for anyone but me and you five to know it wasnt just that Weve got more important things to worry about in town these days than a little backedup water Ill say on my report that I located the blowdown and some boys came along and helped me shift it out o the way o the water Not that Ill mention ye by name YeIl not be gettin any citations for dambuilding in the Barns He surveyed the five of them Ben was furiously wiping his eyes with his handkerchief Bill was looking thoughtfully at the dam Eddie was holding his aspirator in one hand Stan stood close by Richie with one hand on Richies arm ready to squeezehardif Richie should show the slightest sign of having anything to say other than thank you very much You boys got no business at all in a dirty place like this Mr Nell went on Theres probably sixty different kinds o disease breeding down here Breeding came out braidin as in what a girl may do with her hair in the morning dump down one way streams full of piss an gray water muck an slop bugs an brambles quickmud you got no business at all in a dirty place like this Four clean city parks for you boyos to be playin ball in all the day long and I catch you down here Jaysus Christ WuhWuhWe llllike it dddown hhere Bill said suddenly and defiantly WhWhen wwwe cuhhum down hhere nuhhohobody gives us aaany stuhstuhhatic He said when we come down here nobody gives us any static Eddie said His voice was thin and whistling but it was also unmistakably firm And hes right When guys like us go to the park and say we want to play baseball the other guys say sure you want to be second base or third Richie cackled Eddie Gets Off A Good One And You Are There Richie shrugged sorry But hes right And Bills right too We like it down here Richie thought Mr Nell would become angry again at that but the whitehaired cop surprised himsurprised them allwith a smile Ayuh he said I liked it down here meself as a boy so I did And Ill not forbid ye But hark to what Im tellin you now He leveled a finger at them and they all looked at him soberly If ye come down here to play ye come in a gang like ye are now Together Do you understand me That means together all the time No hideanseek games where yer split up one an one an one You all know whats goin on in this town All the same I dont forbid you to come down here mostly because yed be down here anyway But for yer own good here or anywhere around gang together He looked at Bill do you disagree with me young Master Bill Denbrough Thats good enough for me Mr Nell said Yer hand on it Sure an begorrah Mr Nell yer a prince among men yare A foine man A foine foine man He stuck out his own hand seized the Irishmans huge paw and flagged it furiously grinning all the time To the bemused Mr Nell the boy looked like a hideous parody of Franklin D Roosevelt Thank you boy Mr Nell said retrieving his hand Ye want to work on that a bit As of now ye sound about as Irish as Groucho Marx The other boys laughed mostly in relief Even as he was laughing Stan shot Richie a reproachful look Grow up Richie Mr Nell shook hands all around gripping Bens last of all Yeve nothing to be ashamed of but bad judgment big boy As for that there did you see how to do it in a book Well if that dont beat Harry YeIl do great things someday Ive no doubt But the Barrens isnt the place to do em He looked around thoughtfully No great thing will ever be done here Nasty place He sighed Tear it down dear boys Tear it right down I believe Ill just sit me down in the shade o this bush here and bide a wee as you do it He looked ironically at Richie as he said this last as if inviting another manic outburst Yes sir Richie said humbly and that was all Mr Nell nodded satisfied and the boys fell to work once again turning to Benthis time to show them the quickest way to tear down what he had shown them how to build Meanwhile Mr Nell removed a brown bottle from inside his tunic and helped himself to a large gulp He coughed then blew out breath in an explosive sigh and regarded the boys with watery benign eyes And what might ye have in yer bottle sor Richie asked from the place where he was standing kneedeep in the water This Mr Nell regarded Richie with mild surprise and looked at the bottle again It had no label of any kind on it This is the cough medicine of the gods my boy Now lets see if you can bend yer back anywhere near as fast as you can wag yer tongue Bill and Richie were walking up Witcham Street together later on Bill was pushing Silver after first building and then tearing down the dam he simply did not have the energy it would have taken to get Silver up to cruising speed Both boys were dirty dishevelled and pretty well used up Stan had asked them if they wanted to come over to his house and play Monopoly or Parcheesi or something but none of them wanted to It was getting late Ben sounding tired and depressed said he was going to go home and see if anybody had returned his library books He had some hope of this since the Derry Library insisted on writing in the borrowers street address as well as his name on each books pocket card Eddie said he was going to watch The Rock Show on TV because Neil Sedaka was going to be on and he wanted to see if Neil Sedaka was a Negro Stan told Eddie not to be so stupid Neil Sedaka was white you could tell he was white just listening to him Eddie claimed you couldnt tell anything by listening to them until last year he had been positive Chuck Berry was white but when he was on Bandstand he turned out to be a Negro My mother still thinks hes white so thats one good thing Eddie said If she finds out hes a Negro she probably wont let me listen to his songs anymore Stan bet Eddie four funnybooks that Neil Sedaka was white and the two of them set off together for Eddies house to settle the issue And here were Bill and Richie headed in a direction which would bring them to Bills house after awhile neither of them talking much Richie found himself thinking about Bills story of the picture that had turned its head and winked And in spite of his tiredness an idea came to him It was crazy but it also held a certain attraction Billy me boy he said Lets stop for awhile Take five Im dead No such llluck Bill said but he stopped laid Silver carefully down on the edge of the green Theological Seminary lawn and the two boys sat on the wide stone steps which led up to the rambling red Victorian structure What a ddday Bill said glumly There were dark purplish patches under his eyes His face looked white and used You better call your house when wwe get to muhmine So your ffolks dont go bbbananas Richie paused for a moment thinking about Bens mummy Eddies leper and whatever Stan had almost told them For a moment something swam in his own mind something about that Paul Bunyan statue out by the City Center But that had only been a dream for Gods sake Lets go up to your house what do you say Take a look in Georgies room I want to see that picture Bill looked at Richie shocked He tried to speak but could not his stress was simply too great He settled for shaking his head violently Richie said You heard Eddies story And Bens Do you believe what they said Yeah Me too All the kids thatve been killed around here I think all of them would have had stories to tell too The only difference between Ben and Eddie and those other kids is that Ben and Eddie didnt get caught Bill raised his eyebrows but showed no great surprise Richie had supposed Bill would have taken it that far himself He couldnt talk so good but he was no dummy So now dig on this awhile Big Bill Richie said A guy could dress up in a clown suit and kill kids I dont know why hed want to but nobody can tell why crazy people do things right Right Its not that much different than the Joker in a Batman funnybook Just hearing his ideas out loud excited Richie He wondered briefly if he was actually trying to prove something or just throwing up a smokescreen of words so he could see that room that picture In the end it probably didnt matter In the end maybe just seeing Bills eyes light up with their own excitement was enough In a low voice not looking at Richie Bill said he didnt think it had anything to do with the murders I think it was JuhJuhGeorgies gghost Richie thought about it The idea of ghosts gave his childs mind no trouble at all He was sure there were such things His parents were Methodists and Richie went to church every Sunday and to Thursdaynight Methodist Youth Fellowship meetings as well He knew a great deal of the Bible already and he knew the Bible believed in all sorts of weird stuff According to the Bible God Himself was at least onethird Ghost and that was just the beginning You could tell the Bible believed in demons because Jesus threw a bunch of them out of this guy Real chuckalicious ones too When Jesus asked the guy who had them what his name was the demons answered and told Him to go join the Foreign Legion Or something like that The Bible believed in witches or else why would it say Thou shall not suffer a witch to live Some of the stuff in the Bible was even better than the stuff in the horror comics People getting boiled in oil or hanging themselves like Judas Iscariot the story about how wicked King Ahaz fell off the tower and all the dogs came and licked up his blood the mass babymurders that had accompanied the births of both Moses and Jesus Christ guys who came out of their graves or flew into the air soldiers who witched down walls prophets who saw the future and fought monsters All of that was in the Bible and every word of it was trueso said Reverend Craig and so said Richies folks and so said Richie He was perfectly willing to credit the possibility of Bills explanation it was the logic which troubled him But you said you were scared Why would Georges ghost want to scare you Bill Bill put a hand to his mouth and wiped it The hand was trembling slightly HHes probably muhmuhmad at mmme For ggetting him kinhilled It was my fuhfuhfault I ssent him out with the buhbuhbuh He was incapable of getting the word out so he rocked his hand in the air instead Richie nodded to show he understood what Bill meant but not to indicate agreement I dont think so he said If you stabbed him in the back or shot him that would be different Or even if you like gave him a loaded gun that belonged to your dad to play with and he shot himself with it But it wasnt a gun it was just a boat You didnt want to hurt him in factRichie raised one finger and waggled it at Bill in a lawyerly wayyou just wanted the kid to have a little fun right Bill thought backthought desperately hard What Richie had just said had made him feel better about Georges death for the first time in months but there was a part of him which insisted with quiet firmness that he was not supposed to feel better Of course it was your fault that part of him insisted not entirely maybe but at least partly If not how come theres that cold place on the couch between your mother and father If not how come no one ever says anything at the supper table anymore Now its just knives and forks rattling until you cant take it anymore and ask if you can be ehehehexcused please It was as if he were the ghost a presence that spoke and moved but was not quite heard or seen a thing vaguely sensed but still not accepted as real He did not like the thought that he was to blame but the only alternative he could think of to explain their behavior was much worse that all the love and attention his parents had given him before had somehow been the result of Georges presence and with George gone there was nothing for him and all of that had happened at random for no reason at all And if you put your ear to that door you could hear the winds of madness blowing outside So he went over what he had done and felt and said on the day Georgie had died part of him hoping that what Richie had said was true part of him hoping just as hard it was not He hadnt been a saint of a big brother to George that much was certain They had had fights plenty of them Surely there had been one that day No No fight For one thing Bill himself had still been feeling too punk to work up a really good quarrel with George He had been sleeping dreaming something dreaming about some funny little animal he couldnt remember just what and he had awakened to the sound of the diminishing rain outside and George muttering unhappily to himself in the dining room He asked George what was wrong George came in and said he was trying to make a paper boat from the directions in his Best Book of Activities but it kept coming out wrong Bill told George to bring his book And sitting next to Richie on the steps leading up to the seminary he remembered how Georgies eyes lit up when the paper boat came out right and how good that look had made him feel like Georgie thought he was a real hot shit a straight shooter the guy who could do it until it got done Making him feel in short like a big brother The boat had killed George but Richie was rightit hadnt been like handing George a loaded gun to play with Bill hadnt known what was going to happen No way he could He drew a deep shuddering breath feeling something like a rocksomething he hadnt even known was therego rolling off his chest All at once he felt better better about everything He opened his mouth to tell Richie this and burst into tears instead Alarmed Richie put an arm around Bills shoulders after taking a quick glance around to make sure no one who might mistake them for a couple of fagolas was looking Youre okay he said Youre okay Billy right Come on Turn off the waterworks I didnt wuhwuhwant hhim tto ggget kuhhilled Bill sobbed THTHAT WUHWUHWASNT ON MY MMMMIND AT UHUHALL Christ Billy I know it wasnt Richie said If youd wanted to scrub him you woulda pushed him downstairs or something Richie patted Bills shoulder clumsily and gave him a hard little hug before letting go Come on quit bawlin okay You sound like a baby Little by little Bill stopped He still hurt but this hurt seemed cleaner as if he had cut himself open and taken out something that was rotting inside him And that feeling of relief was still there II didnt wwant him to get kuhkuhkilled Bill repeated and ihif yyyou ttell anybody I wwas cccryin Ill bbbust your nnnose I wont tell Richie said dont worry He was your brother for gosh sake If my brother got killed Id cry my fuckin head off Course Richie paused fixing Bill with a wary eye trying to decide if Bill was really over it He was still wiping his red eyes with his snotrag but Richie decided he probably was All I meant was that I dont know why George would want to haunt you So maybe the pictures got something to do with well with that other The clown Richie understood what Bill was trying to say and waved it aside After you croak you know everything people ever thought about you Big Bill He spoke with the indulgent air of a great teacher correcting a country bumpkins fatuous ideas Its in the Bible It says Yea even though we cant see too much in the mirror right now we will see through it like it was a window after we die Thats in First Thessalonians or Second Babylonians I forget which It means Lets go up to his room and take a look Maybe well get a clue about whos killing all the kids I am too Richie said thinking it was just more sand something to say that would get Bill moving and then something heavy turned over in his midsection and he discovered it was true he was scared green Bills father was still at work Sharon Denbrough was in the kitchen reading a paperback at the kitchen table The smell of suppercodfishdrifted out into the front hall Richie called home so his mom would know he wasnt dead just at Bills Someone there Mrs Denbrough called as Richie put the phone down They froze eyeing each other guiltily Then Bill called MMe Mom And RRRRR Hello Richie Mrs Denbrough called back her voice disconnected almost not there at all Would you like to stay for supper Thanks maam but my moms gonna pick me up in half an hour or so They went upstairs and down the hall to Bills room It was boyneat which meant it would have given the mother of the boy in question only a mild headache to look at The shelves were stuffed with a helterskelter collection of books and comics There were more comics plus a few models and toys and a stack of s on the desk There was also an old Underwood office model typewriter on it His folks had given it to him for Christmas two years ago and Bill sometimes wrote stories on it He did this a bit more frequently since Georges death The pretending seemed to ease his mind There was a phonograph on the floor across from the bed with a pile of folded clothes stacked on the lid Bill put the clothes in the drawers of his bureau and then took the records from the desk He shuffled through them picking half a dozen He put them on the phonographs fat spindle and turned the machine on The Fleetwoods started singing Come Softly Darling Bill grinned in spite of his thumping heart ThThey ddont luhluhhike rock and rroll he said They ggave me this wuhone for my bbbirthday Also two PPat BBBoone records and TuhTuhTommy Sands I keep LLLittle RuhRichard and Scuhhreamin J Jay Hawkins for when theyre not hhere But if she hears the mmmusic shell ththink were iin mmy room CCCome oon Georges room was across the hall The door was shut Richie looked at it and licked his lips They dont keep it locked he whispered to Bill Suddenly he found himself hoping it was locked Suddenly he was having trouble believing this had been his idea Bill his face pale shook his head and turned the knob He stepped in and looked back at Richie After a moment Richie followed Bill shut the door behind them muffling the Fleetwoods Richie jumped a little at the soft snick of the latch He looked around fearful and intensely curious at the same tune The first thing he noticed was the dry mustiness of the airNo ones opened a window in here for a long time he thought Heck no ones breathed in here for a long time Thats really what it feels like He shuddered a little at the thought and licked his lips again His eye fell on Georges bed and he thought of George sleeping now under a comforter of earth in Mount Hope Cemetery Rotting there His hands not folded because you needed two hands to do the old folding routine and George had been buried with only one A little sound escaped Richies throat Bill turned and looked at him enquiringly Youre right Richie said huskily Its spooky in here I dont see how you could stand to come in alone HHe was my bruhbrother Bill said simply sometimes I wwwant to is aall There were posters on the wallslittlekid posters One showed Tom Terrific the cartoon character on Captain Kangaroos program Tom was springing over the head and clutching hands of Crabby Appleton who was of course Rotten to the Core Another showed Donald Ducks nephews Huey Louie and Dewie marching off into the wilderness in their Junior Woodchucks coonskin caps A third which George had colored himself showed Mr Do holding up traffic so a bunch of little kids headed for school could cross the street MR DO SAYS WAIT FOR THE CROSSING GUARD it said underneath Kid wasnt too cool about staying in the lines Richie thought and then shuddered The kid was never going to get any better at it either Richie looked at the table by the window Mrs Denbrough had stood up all of Georges rankcards there halfopen Looking at them knowing there would never be more knowing that George had died before he could stay in the lines when he colored knowing his life had ended irrevocably and eternally with only those few kindergarten and firstgrade rankcards all the idiot truth of death crashed home to Richie for the first time It was as if a large iron safe had fallen into his brain and buried itself there I could die his mind screamed at him suddenly in tones of betrayed horror Anybody could Anybody could Boy oh boy he said in a shaky voice He could manage no more Yeah Bill said in a nearwhisper He sat down on Georges bed Look Richie followed Bills pointing finger and saw the photo album lying closed on the floor MY PHOTOGRAPHS Richie read GEORGE ELMER DENBROUGH AGE Age his mind shrieked in those same tones of shrill betrayal Age  forever Anybody could Shit Fucking anybody So it closed Richie said uneasily He sat down on the bed beside Bill and looked at the photo album Lots of books close on their own The pppages maybe but nnot the cuhcuhcover It cclosed itself He looked at Richie solemnly his eyes very dark in his pale tired face BBut it wuhwuhwants yyou to ohopen it up again Thats what I ththink Richie got up and walked slowly over to the photograph album It lay at the base of a window screened with light curtains Looking out he could see the apple tree in the Denbrough back yard A swing rocked slowly back and forth from one gnarled black limb A dried maroon stain colored the thickness of the pages in the middle of the book It could have been old ketchup Sure it was easy enough to see George looking at his photo album while eating a hot dog or a big sloppy hamburger he takes a big bite and some ketchup squirts out onto the book Little kids were always doing spasmoid stuff like that It could be ketchup But Richie knew it was not He touched the album briefly and then drew his hand away It felt cold It had been lying in a place where the strong summer sunlight only slightly filtered by those light curtains would have been falling on it all day but it felt cold Well Ill just leave it alone Richie thought I dont want to look in his stupid old album anyway see a lot of people I dont know I think maybe Ill tell Bill I changed my mind and we can go to his room and read comic books for awhile and then Ill go home and eat supper and go to bed early because Im pretty tired and when I wake up tomorrow morning Im sure Ill be sure that stuff was just ketchup Thats just what Ill do Yowza So he opened the album with hands that seemed a thousand miles away from him at the end of long plastic arms and he looked at the faces and places in Georges album the aunts the uncles the babies the houses the old Fords and Studebakers the telephone lines the mailboxes the picket fences the wheelruts with muddy water in them the Ferris wheel at the Esty County Fair the Standpipe the ruins of the Kitchener Ironworks His fingers flipped faster and faster and suddenly the pages were blank He turned back not wanting to but unable to help himself Here was a picture of downtown Derry Main Street and Canal Street from around and beyond it there was nothing Theres no school picture of George in here Richie said He looked at Bill with a mixture of relief and exasperation What kind of line were you handing me Big Bill This picture of downtown in the olden days is the last one in the book All the rest of the pages are blank Bill got off the bed and joined Richie He looked at the picture of downtown Derry as it had been almost thirty years ago oldfashioned cars and trucks oldfashioned streetlights with clusters of globes like big white grapes pedestrians by the Canal caught in midstride by the click of a shutter He turned the page and just as Richie had said there was nothing No waitnot quite nothing There was one studio corner the sort of item you use to mount photographs It wwwas here he said and tapped the studio corner LLook Bill had taken the album from Richie and was now holding it on his own lap He turned back through the pages looking for Georges picture He gave up after a minute but the pages did not They turned themselves flipping slowly but steadily with big deliberate riffling sounds Bill and Richie looked at each other wideeyed and then back down It arrived at that last picture again and the pages stopped turning Here was downtown Derry in sepia tones the city as it had been long before either Bill or Richie had been born Say Richie said suddenly and took the album back from Bill There was no fear in his voice now and his face was suddenly full of wonder Holy shit Bill took one side of the book Bent over it sharing it they looked like boys at choir practice Bill drew in breath sharply and Richie knew he had seen it too Caught under the shiny surface of this old blackandwhite photograph two small boys were walking along Main Street toward the point where Main and Center intersectedthe point where the Canal went underground for a mile and a half or so The two boys showed up clearly against the low concrete wall at the edge of the Canal One was wearing knickers The other was wearing something that looked almost like a sailor suit A tweed cap was perched on his head They were turned in threequarter profile toward the camera looking at something on the far side of the street The boy in the knickers was Richie Tozier beyond a doubt And the boy in the sailor suit and the tweed cap was Stuttering Bill They stared at themselves in a picture almost three times as old as they were hypnotized The inside of Richies mouth suddenly felt as dry as dust and as smooth as glass A few steps ahead of the boys in the picture there was a man holding the brim of his fedora his topcoat frozen forever as it flapped out behind him in a sudden gust of wind There were ModelTs on the street a PierceArrow Chevrolets with running boards IIII ddont buhbuhbelieve Bill began and that was when the picture began to move The ModelT that should have remained eternally in the middle of the intersection or at least until the chemicals in the old photo finally dissolved completely passed through it a haze of exhaust puffing out of its tailpipe It went on toward UpMile Hill A small white hand shot out of the drivers side window and signalled a left turn It swung onto Court Street and passed beyond the photos white border and so out of sight The PierceArrow the Chevrolets the Packardsthey all began to roll along dodging their separate ways through the intersection After twentyeight years or so the skirt of the mans topcoat finally finished its flap He settled his hat more firmly on his head and walked on The two boys completed their turn coming fullface and a moment later Richie saw what they had been looking at as a mangy dog came trotting across Center Street The boy in the sailor suitBillraised two fingers to the corners of his mouth and whistled Stunned beyond any ability to move or think Richie realized he could hear the whistle could hear the cars irregular sewingmachine engines The sounds were faint like sounds heard through thick glass but they were there The dog glanced toward the two boys then trotted on The boys glanced at each other and laughed like chipmunks They started to walk on and then the Richie in knickers grabbed Bills arm and pointed toward the Canal They turned in that direction They went to the low concrete wall and suddenly the clown popped up over its edge like a horrible jackinthebox a clown with Georgie Denbroughs face his hair slicked back his mouth a hideous grin full of bleeding greasepaint his eyes black holes One hand clutched three balloons on a string With the other he reached for the boy in the sailor suit and seized his neck He was almost too late He saw the tips of Bills fingers go through the surface of the photograph and into that other world He saw the fingertips go from the warm pink of living flesh to the mummified cream color that passed for white in old photos At the same tune they became small and disconnected It was like the peculiar optical illusion one sees when one thrusts a hand into a glass bowl of water the part of the hand underwater seems to be floating disembodied inches away from the part which is still out of the water A series of diagonal cuts slashed across Bills fingers at the point where they ceased being his fingers and became photofingers it was as if he had stuck his hand into the blades of a fan instead of into a picture Richie seized his forearm and gave a tremendous yank They both fell over Georges album hit the floor and snapped itself shut with a dry clap Bill stuck his fingers in his mouth Tears of pain stood in his eyes Richie could see blood running down his palm to his wrist in thin streams HuHurts Bill said He held his hand out to Richie palm down There were ladderlike slashcuts running up his index second and third fingers The pinky had barely touched the surface of the photograph if it had a surface and although that finger had not been cut Bill told Richie later that the nail had been neatly clipped as if with a pair of manicurists scissors Jesus Bill Richie said BandAids That was all he could think of God they had been luckyif he hadnt pulled Bills arm when he did his fingers might have been amputated instead of just badly cut We got to fix those up Your mother can Nehnehnever mmind mmy muhhuther Bill said He grabbed the photo album again spilling drops of blood on the floor Dont open that again Richie cried grabbing frantically at Bills shoulder Jesus Christ Billy you almost lost your fingers Bill shook him off He flipped through the pages and there was a grim determination on his face that scared Richie more than anything else Bills eyes looked almost mad His wounded fingers printed Georges album with new bloodit didnt look like ketchup yet but when it had a little time to dry it would Of course it would The ModelT stood in the middle of the intersection The other cars were frozen in the places where they had been before The man walking toward the intersection held the brim of his fedora his coat once more belled out in midflap Look Richie whispered and pointed He was careful to keep the tip of his finger well away from the picture An arc showed just over the low concrete wall at the edge of the Canalthe top of something round They got out of Georges room just in time Bills mother was a voice at the foot of the stairs and a shadow on the wall Have you boys been wrestling she asked sharply I heard a thud Just a lihlihlittle MMom Bill threw a sharp glance at Richie Be quiet it said Well I want you to stop it I thought the ceiling was going to come right down on my head They heard her go back toward the front of the house Bill had wrapped his handkerchief around his bleeding hand it was turning red and in a moment would start to drip The boys went down to the bathroom where Bill held his hand under the faucet until the bleeding stopped Cleaned the cuts looked thin but cruelly deep Looking at their white lips and the red meat just inside them made Richie feel sick to his stomach He wrapped them with BandAids as fast as he could Well whyd you want to go and put your hand in there you wet end Bill looked solemnly at the rings of BandAids on his fingers then up at Richie IIIt was the cluhhown he said It wwwas the cclown pretending to be JuhJuhGeorge Thats right Richie said Like it was the clown pretending to be the mummy when Ben saw it Like it was the clown pretending to be that sick bum Eddie saw Its a monster Richie said flatly some kind of monster Some kind of monster right here in Derry And its killing kids On a Saturday not long after the incident of the dam in the Barrens Mr Nell and the picture that moved Richie Ben and Beverly Marsh came face to face with not one monster but twoand they paid to do it Richie did anyway These monsters were scary but not really dangerous they stalked their victims on the screen of the Aladdin Theater while Richie Ben and Bev watched from the balcony One of the monsters was a werewolf played by Michael Landon and he was cool because even when he was the werewolf he still had sort of a ducks ass haircut The other was this smashedup hotrodder played by Gary Conway He was brought back to life by a descendant of Victor Frankenstein who fed all parts he didnt need to a bunch of alligators he kept in the basement Also on the program a MovieTone Newsreel that showed the latest Paris fashions and the latest Vanguard rocket explosions at Cape Canaveral two Warner Brothers cartoons one Popeye cartoon and a Chilly Willy cartoon for some reason the hat Chilly Willy wore always cracked Richie up and PREVUES OF COMING ATTRACTIONS The coming attractions included two pictures Richie immediately put on his gottasee list I Married a Monster from Outer Space and The Blob Ben was very quiet during the show Ole Haystack had nearly been spotted by Henry Belch and Victor earlier and Richie assumed that was all that was troubling him Ben however had forgotten all about the creeps they were sitting close to the screen down below chucking popcorn boxes at each other and hooting Beverly was the reason for his silence Her nearness was so overwhelming that he was almost ill with it His body would break out in goosebumps and then if she should so much as shift in her seat his skin would flash hot as if with a tropical fever When her hand brushed his reaching for the popcorn he trembled with exaltation He thought later that those three hours in the dark next to Beverly had been both the longest and shortest hours of his life Richie unaware that Ben was in deep throes of calflove was feeling just as fine as paint In his book the only thing any better than a couple of Francis the Talking Mule pictures was a couple of horror pictures in a theater filled with kids all of them yelling and screaming at the gory parts He certainly did not connect any of the goingsons in the two lowbudget AmericanInternational pictures they were watching with what was going on in town not then at least He had seen the Twin Shock Show Saturday Matinee ad in the News on Friday morning and had almost immediately forgotten how badly he had slept the night beforeand how he had finally gotten up and turned on the light in his closet a real baby trick for sure but he hadnt been able to get a wink of sleep until hed done it But by the following morning things had seemed normal again well almost He began to think that maybe he and Bill had just shared a hallucination Of course the cuts on Bills fingers werent a hallucination but maybe theyd just been papercuts from some of the sheets in Georgies album Pretty thick paper Could of been Maybe Besides there was no law saying he had to spend the next ten years thinking about it was there Nope And so following an experience that might well have sent an adult running for the nearest headshrinker Richie Tozier got up ate a giant pancake breakfast saw the ad for the two horror movies on the Amusements page of the paper checked his funds found them a little low well nonexistent might actually have been a better word and began to pester his father for chores His dad who had come to the table already wearing his white dentists tunic put down the Sports pages and poured himself a second cup of coffee He was a pleasantlooking man with a rather thin face He wore steelrimmed spectacles was developing a bald spot at the back of his head and would die of cancer of the larynx in He looked at the ad to which Richie was pointing Feel like youll probably die in convulsions of disappointment if you dont get to see those two trashy movies Yeah yeah I would I know I would Graaaag Richie fell out of his chair onto the floor clutching his throat his tongue sticking out This was Richies admittedly peculiar way of turning on the charm Oh God Richie will you please stop it his mother asked him from the stove where she was frying him a couple of eggs to top off the pancakes Gee Rich his father said as Richie got back into his chair I guess I must have forgotten to pay you your allowance on Monday Thats the only reason I can think of for you needing more money on Friday Thats an extremely deep subject for a boy with such a shallow mind Wentworth Tozier said He put his elbow on the table and then cupped his chin on the palm of his hand regarding his only son with what appeared to be deep fascination Whered it go Richie immediately fell into the Voice of Toodles the English Butler Why I spent it didnt I guvnor Pippip cheerio and all that rot My part of the war effort All got to do our bit to beat back the bloody Hun dont we Bit of a sticky wicket aywot Bit of a wet hedgehog wotwot Bit of a Bit of a pile of bullshit Went said amiably and reached for the strawberry preserves Spare me the vulgarity at the breakfast table if you please Maggie Tozier said to her husband as she brought Richies eggs over to the table And to Richie I dont know why you want to fill your head up with such awful junk anyway Aw Mom Richie said He was outwardly crushed inwardly jubilant He could read both of his parents like bookswellworn and wellloved booksand he was pretty sure he was going to get what he wanted chores and permission to go to the show Saturday afternoon Went leaned forward toward Richie and smiled widely I think I have you right where I want you he said Is that right Dad Richie said and smiled back a trifle uneasily Oh yes You know our lawn Richie You are familiar with our lawn Indeed I am guvnor Richie said becoming Toodles againor trying to Bit shaggy aywot Okay Dad sure Richie said but a terrible suspicion had suddenly blossomed in his mind Maybe his dad didnt mean just the front lawn Wentworth Toziers smile widened to a predatory sharks grin All of it O idiot child of my loins Front Back Sides And when you finish I will cross your palm with two green pieces of paper with the likeness of George Washington on one side and a picture of a pyramid oertopped with the EverWatching Oculary on the other I dont get you Dad Richie said but he was afraid he did Two bucks for the whole lawn Richie cried genuinely wounded Its the biggest lawn on the block Jeez Dad Went sighed and picked the paper up again Richie could read the front page headline MISSING BOY PROMPTS NEW FEARS He thought briefly of George Denbroughs strange scrapbookbut that had surely been a hallucination and even if it hadnt been that was yesterday and this was today Guess you didnt want to see those movies as bad as you thought Went said from behind the paper A moment later his eyes appeared over the top studying Richie Studying him a trifle smugly in truth Studying him the way a man with four of a kind studies his poker opponent over the fan of his cards When the Clark twins do it all you give them two dollars each Thats true Went admitted But as far as I know they dont want to go to the movies tomorrow Or if they do they must have funds sufficient to the occasion because they havent popped by to check the state of the herbiage surrounding our domicile lately You on the other hand do want to go and find yourself lacking the funds to do so That pressure you feel in your midsection may be the five pancakes and two eggs you ate for breakfast Richie or it may just be the barrel I have you over Wotwot Wents eyes submerged behind the paper again Hes blackmailing me Richie said to his mother who was eating dry toast She was trying to lose weight again This is blackmail I just hope you know that Yes dear I know that his mother said Theres egg on your chin Richie wiped the egg off his chin Three bucks if I have it all done when you get home tonight he asked the newspaper My idol Went said from behind the paper Make up your mind Richie I want to read these box scores Deal Richie said and sighed When your folks had you by the balls they really knew how to squeeze It was pretty chuckalicious when you thought it over As he mowed he practiced his Voices He finishedfront back and sidesby three oclock Friday afternoon and began Saturday with two dollars and fifty cents in his jeans Pretty damn near a fortune He called Bill up but Bill told him glumly that he had to go up to Bangor and take some kind of speechtherapy test Richie sympathized and then added in his best Stuttering Bill Voice GGGive em hhhell BuhBuhBig BihBill Your ffface and my buhbuhbutt TTTozier Bill said and hung up He called Eddie Kaspbrak next but Eddie sounded even more depressed than Billhis mother had gotten them each a fullday buspass he said and they were going to visit Eddies aunts in Haven and Bangor and Hampden All three of them were fat like Mrs Kaspbrak and all three of them were single Theyll all pinch my cheek and tell me how much Ive grown Eddie said Thats cause they know how cute you are Edsjust like me I saw what a cutie you were the first time I met you It takes one to know one Eds and you know em all You gonna be down in the Barrens next week I guess so if you guys are Want to play guns Maybe But I think me and Big Bill have got something to tell you Its really Bills story I guess Ill see you Enjoy your aunts His third call was to Stan the Man but Stan was in dutch with his folks for breaking their picture window He had been playing flyingsaucer with a pieplate and it took a bad bank Keerash He had to do chores all weekend and probably next weekend too Richie commiserated and then asked Stan if he would be coming down to the Barrens next week Stan said he guessed so if his father didnt decide to ground him or something Richie started to leave the living room then thought of Ben Hanscom He thumbed through the telephone book and found a listing for an Arlene Hanscom Since she was the only lady Hanscom among the four listed Richie figured it had to be Bens number and called Id like to go but I already spent my allowance Ben said He sounded depressed and ashamed by the admissionhe had in fact spent it all on candy soda chips and beefjerky strips Richie who was rolling in dough and who didnt like to go to the movies alone said I got plenty of money You can gimme owesies wooi Okay Ben said happily Okay thatd be great Two horror movies Did you say one was a werewolf picture Ben laughed Ill see you out in front of the Aladdin okay Richie hung up and looked at the phone thoughtfully It suddenly occurred to him that Ben Hanscom was lonely And that in turn made him feel rather heroic He was whistling as he ran upstairs to get some comics to read before the show The day was sunny breezy and cool Richie jived along Center Street toward the Aladdin popping his fingers and singing Rockin Robin under his breath He was feeling good Going to the movies always made him feel goodhe loved that magic world those magic dreams He felt sorry for anyone who had dull duties to discharge on such a dayBill with his speech therapy Eddie with his aunts poor old Stan the Man who would be spending the afternoon scraping down the frontporch steps or sweeping the garage because the pieplate hed been throwing around swept right when it was supposed to sweep left Richie had his yoyo tucked in his back pocket and now he took it out and tried again to get it to sleep This was an ability Richie lusted to acquire but so far no soap The crazy lil fucker just wouldnt do it Either it went down and popped right back up or it went down and dropped dead at the end of its string Halfway up Center Street Hill he saw a girl in a beige pleated skirt and a white sleeveless blouse sitting on a bench outside Shocks Drug Store She was eating what looked like a pistachio icecream cone Bright redauburn hair its highlights seeming coppery or sometimes almost blonde hung down to her shoulderblades Richie knew only one girl with hair of that particular shade It was Beverly Marsh Richie liked Bev a lot Well he liked her but not that way He admired her looks and knew he wasnt alonegirls like Sally Mueller and Greta Bowie hated Beverly like fire still too young to understand how they could have everything else so easily and still have to compete in the matter of looks with a girl who lived in one of those shimmy apartments on Lower Main Street but mostly he liked her because she was tough and had a really good sense of humor Also she usually had cigarettes He liked her in short because she was a good guy Still he had once or twice caught himself wondering what color underwear she was wearing under her small selection of rather faded skirts and that was not the sort of thing you wondered about the other guys was it And Richie had to admit she was one hell of a pretty guy Approaching the bench where she sat eating her ice cream Richie belted an invisible topcoat around his middle pulled down an invisible slouch hat and pretended to be Humphrey Bogart Adding the correct Voice he became Humphrey Bogartat least to himself To others he would have sounded like Richie Tozier with a mild headcold Hello shweetheart he said gliding up to the bench where she was sitting and looking out at the traffic No sensh waitin for a bus here The Nazish have cut off our retreat The last plane leavesh at midnight You be on it He needsh you shweetheart So do I but Ill get along shomehow Hi Richie Bev said and when she turned toward him he saw a purpleblackish bruise on her right cheek like the shadow of a crows wing He was again struck by her good looks only it occurred to him now that she might actually be beautiful It had never really occurred to him until that moment that there might be beautiful girls outside of the movies or that he himself might know one Perhaps it was the bruise that allowed him to see the possibility of her beautyan essential contrast a particular flaw which first drew attention to itself and then somehow denned the rest the grayblue eyes the naturally red lips the creamy unblemished childs skin There was a tiny spray of freckles across her nose You shweetheart Richie said Youve turned green ash limberger cheese But when we get you out of Cashablanca youre going into the finesht hoshpital money can buy Well turn you white again I shwear it on my mothersh name Youre an asshole Richie That doesnt sound like Humphrey Bogart at all But she smiled a little as she said it Richie sat down next to her You going to the movies I dont have any money she said Can I see your yoyo He handed it over I oughtta take it back he told her Its supposed to sleep but it doesnt I got japped She poked her finger through the loop of string and Richie pushed his glasses up on the bridge of his nose so he could watch what she was doing better She turned her hand over palm toward the sky the Duncan yoyo tucked neatly into the valley of flesh formed by her cupped hand She rolled the yoyo off her index finger It went down to the end of its string and fell asleep When she twitched her fingers in a comeon gesture it promptly woke up and climbed its string to her palm again Thats kid stuff Bev said Watch this She snapped the yoyo down again She let it sleep for a moment and then walked the dog with it in a smart series of snap jerks up the string to her hand again Or how about this Bev asked smiling sweetly She got the yoyo going back and front making the red wooden Duncan look like a BoLo Bouncer Richie had had once She finished with two Around the Worlds almost hitting a shuffling old lady who glared at them The yoyo ended up in her cupped palm its string neatly rolled around its spindle Bev handed it back to Richie and sat down on the bench again Richie sat down next to her his jaw hanging agape in perfectly unaffected admiration Bev looked at him and giggled Besides that last part was just luck First time in my life I did two Around the Worlds in a row without fizzing out Kids were walking past them now on their way to the show Peter Gordon walked by with Marcia Fadden They were supposed to be going together but Richie figured it was just that they lived nest door to each other on West Broadway and were such a couple of assholes that they needed each others support and attention Peter Gordon was already getting a pretty good crop of acne although he was only twelve He sometimes hung around with Bowers Criss and Huggins but he wasnt quite brave enough to try anything on his own He glanced over at Richie and Bev sitting together on the bench and chanted Richie and Beverly up in a tree KayEyeEssEssEyeEnGee First comes love then comes marriage and here comes Richie with a baby carriage Marcia finished cawing laughter Sit on this dear heart Bev said and whipped the finger on them Marcia looked away disgusted as if she could not believe anyone could be so uncouth Gordon slipped an arm around her and called back over his shoulder to Richie Maybe Ill see you later foureyes Maybe youll see your mothers girdle Richie responded smartly if a little senselessly Beverly collapsed with laughter She leaned against Richies shoulder for a moment and Richie had just time to reflect that her touch and the sensation of her lightly carried weight was not exactly unpleasant Then she sat up again Yeah I think Marcia Fadden pees rosewater Richie said and Beverly got the giggles again Chanel Number Five she said her voice muffled because her hands were over her mouth You bet said Richie although he hadnt the slightest idea what Chanel Number Five was Bev She gave him a disgusted look No one showed me I just figured it out Like twirling a baton Im great at that Well I am she said But I didnt take classes or anything She smiled It was a kind of smile Richie had never seen before It was wise cynical and sad all at the same time He recoiled a little from its unknowing power as he had recoiled from the picture of downtown in Georgies album when it had begun to move Thats for girls like Marcia Fadden she said Her and Sally Mueiler and Greta Bowie Girls who pee rosewater Their fathers help to buy the sports equipment and the uniforms They got an in Ill never be a cheerleader Sure it is if its the truth She shrugged I dont care Who wants to do somersaults and show your underwear to a million people anyway Look Richie Watch this For the next ten minutes she worked on showing Richie how to make his yoyo sleep Near the end Richie actually began to get the hang of it although he could usually only get it to come halfway up the string after waking it up Youre not jerking your fingers hard enough thats all she said Richie looked at the clock on the Merrill Trust across the street and jumped up stuffing his yoyo into his back pocket Jeepers I gotta get goin Bev Im supposed to meet ole Haystack Hell think I changed my mind or somethin Oh Ben Hanscom I call him Haystack though You know like Haystack Calhoun the wrestler Bev frowned at him Thats not very nice I like Ben Doan whup me massa Richie screeched in his Pickaninny Voice rolling his eyes and flapping his hands doan whup me Ise gwineter be a good dahkie maam Ise Richie quit it I like him too he said We all built a dam down in the Barrens a couple of days ago and Sure A bunch of us guys do Its sorta cool down there Richie glanced at the clock again I really gotta split for the scene Benll be waiting He paused thought and said If youre not doing anything come on with me She tossed the remains of her icecream cone in a nearby litter barrel Her eyes that fine clear shade of bluegray turned up to his They were coolly amused She pretended to primp her hair and asked him Oh dear am I being asked out on a date For a moment Richie was uncharacteristically flustered He actually felt a blush rising in his cheeks He had made the offer in a perfectly natural way just as he had made it to Ben except hadnt he said something to Ben about owesies Yes But he hadnt said anything about owesies to Beverly Richie suddenly felt a bit weird He had dropped his eyes retreating from her amused glance and realized now that her skirt had ridden up a bit when she shifted forward to drop the icecream cone in the litter barrel and he could see her knees He raised his eyes but that was no help now he was looking at the beginning swells of her bosoms Richie as he usually did in such moments of confusion took refuge in absurdity Yes A date he screamed throwing himself on his knees before her and holding his clasped hands up Please come Please come I shall ruddy kill meself if you say no aywot Wotwot Oh Richie youre such a fuzzbrain she said giggling again but werent her cheeks also a trifle flushed If so it made her look prettier than ever Get up before you get arrested He got up and plopped down beside her again He felt as if his equilibrium had returned A little foolishness always helped when you had a dizzy spell he believed You wanna go Sure she said Thank you very much Think of it My first date Just wait until I write it in my diary tonight She clasped her hands together between her budding breasts fluttered her eyelashes rapidly and then laughed But he felt somehow delighted with himself The world seemed suddenly very clear to him and very friendly He found himself glancing sideways at her from time to time She was looking in the shop windowsat the dresses and nightgowns in CornellHopleys at the towels and pots in the window of the Discount Barn and he stole glances at her hair the line of her jaw He observed the way her bare arms came out of the round holes of her blouse He saw the edge of her slip strap All of these things delighted him He could not have said why but what had happened in George Denbroughs bedroom had never seemed more distant to him than it did right then It was time to go time to meet Ben but he would sit here just a moment longer while her eyes windowshopped because it was good to look at her and be with her Kids were ponying up their quarter admissions at the Aladdins boxoffice window and going into the lobby Looking through the bank of glass doors Richie could see a crowd around the candy counter The popcorn machine was in overdrive spilling out drifts of the stuff its greasy hinged lid jittering up and down He didnt see Ben anywhere He asked Beverly if she had spotted him She shook her head He said he didnt have any money And the Daughter of Frankenstein there would never let him in without a ticket Richie cocked a thumb at Mrs Cole who had been the tickettaker at the Aladdin since a time well before the pictures had begun to talk Her hair dyed a bright red was so thin you could see her scalp beneath She had enormous hanging lips which she painted with plumcolored lipstick Wild blotches of rouge covered her cheeks Her eyebrows were drawn on in black pencil Mrs Cole was a perfect democrat She hated all kids equally Boy I dont wanna go in without him but the shows gonna start Richie said Where in heck is he You can buy him a ticket and leave it at the boxoffice Bev said reasonably enough Then when he comes But just then Ben came around the corner of Center and Macklin Streets He was puffing and his belly joggled beneath his sweatshirt He saw Richie and raised one hand to wave Then he saw Bev and his hand stopped in midflap His eyes widened momentarily He finished his wave and then walked slowly to where they stood under the Aladdins marquee Hi Richie he said and then looked at Bev briefly It was as if he was afraid that an overlong look might result in a flash burn Hi Bev Hello Ben she said and a strange silence fell between the two of themit was not precisely awkward it was Richie thought almost powerful And he felt a vague twinge of jealousy because something had passed between them and whatever it had been he had been excluded from it Howdy Haystack he said Thought you went chicken on me These movies goan scare ten pounds off your pudgy body Ah say Ah say they goan turn your hair white boy When you come out of this theater you goan need an usher to help you up the aisle you goan be shakin so bad Richie started for the boxoffice and Ben touched his arm Ben started to speak glanced at Bev who was smiling at him and had to start over again I was here he said but I went up the street and around the corner when those guys came along Richie whistled They must have already gone inside the theater I dont see em buying candy If I was them I wouldnt bother paying to see a couple of horror movies Richie said Id just stay home and look in a mirror Save some bread Bev laughed merrily at that but Ben only smiled a little Henry Bowers had maybe only started out to hurt him that day last week but he had ended up meaning to kill him Ben was quite sure of that Tell you what Richie said Well go up in the balcony Theyll all be sittin down in the second or third row with their feet up You positive Ben asked He was not at all sure Richie understood what bad news those kids were Henry of course being the worst news of all Richie who had barely escaped what might have been a really bad beating at the hands of Henry and his spasmoid friends three months ago he had managed to elude them in the toy department of Freeses Department Store of all places understood more about Henry and his merry crew than Ben thought he did If I wasnt fairly positive I wouldnt go in he said I want to see those movies Haystack but I dont want to like die for em Besides if they give us any trouble well just tell Foxy to kick them out Bev said Foxy was Mr Foxworth the thin sallow glumlooking man who managed the Aladdin He was now selling candy and popcorn chanting his litany of Wait your turn wait your turn wait your turn In his threadbare tux and yellowing boiled shirt he looked like an undertaker who had fallen on hard times Ben looked doubtfully from Bev to Foxy to Richie You cant let em run your life man Richie said softly dont you know that I guess so Ben said and sighed Actually he knew no such thing but Beverlys being here had given the equation a crazy skew If she hadnt come he would have tried to persuade Richie to go to the movies another day And if Richie had persisted Ben might have bowed out But Bev was here He didnt want to look like a chicken in front of her And the thought of being with her in the balcony in the dark even if Richie was between them as he probably would be was a powerful attraction Well wait until the show starts before we go in Richie said He grinned and punched Ben on the arm shit Haystack you wanna live forever Bens brows drew together and then he snorted laughter Richie also laughed Looking at them Beverly laughed too Richie approached the ticket booth again Liver Lips Cole looked at him sourly Good ahfternyoon deah lady Richie said in his best Baron Butthole Voice I am in diah need of three tickeytickies to youah deah old American flicktoons Cut the crap and tell me what you want kid Liver Lips barked through the round hole cut in the glass and something about the way her painted eyebrows were going up and down unsettled Richie so much that he simply pushed a rumpled dollar through the slot and muttered Three please Three tickets popped out of the slot Richie took them Liver Lips rammed a quarter back at him dont be smart dont throw popcorn boxes dont holler dont run in the lobby dont run in the aisles No maam Richie said backing away to where Ben and Bev stood He said to them It always warms my heart to see an old fart like that who really likes kids They stood outside awhile longer waiting for the show to start Liver Lips glared at them suspiciously from her glass cage Richie regaled Bev with the story of the dam in the Barrens trumpeting Mr Nells lines in his new Irish Cop Voice Beverly was giggling before long laughing hard not long after that Even Ben was grinning a little although his eyes kept shifting either toward the Aladdins glass doors or to Beverlys face The balcony was okay During the first reel of I Was a Teenage Frankenstein Richie spotted Henry Bowers and his shitkicking friends They were down in the second row just as he had figured they would be There were five or six of them in allfifth sixth and seventhgraders all of them with their motorhuckle boots cocked up on the seats in front of them Foxy would come down and tell them to put their feet on the floor They would Foxy would leave Up went the motorhuckle boots again as soon as he did Five or ten minutes later Foxy would return and the entire charade would be acted out again Foxy didnt quite have the guts to kick them out and they knew it The movies were great The Teenage Frankenstein was suitably gross The Teenage Werewolf was somehow scarier though perhaps because he also seemed a little sad What had happened wasnt his own fault There was this hypnotist who had fucked him up but the only reason hed been able to was that the kid who turned into the werewolf was full of anger and bad feelings Richie found himself wondering if there were many people in the world hiding bad feelings like that Henry Bowers was just overflowing with bad feelings but he sure didnt bother hiding them Beverly sat between the boys ate popcorn from their boxes screamed covered her eyes sometimes laughed When the Werewolf was stalking the girl doing exercises in the gym after school she pressed her face against Bens arm and Richie heard Bens gasp of surprise even over the screams of the two hundred kids below them The Werewolf was finally killed In the last scene one cop solemnly told another that this should teach people not to fiddle with things best left to God The curtain came down and the lights came up There was applause Richie felt totally satisfied if a little headachy Hed probably have to go to the eyedoctor pretty soon and get his lenses changed again He really would be wearing Coke bottles on his eyes by the time he got to high school he thought glumly Ben twitched at his sleeve They saw us Richie he said in a dry dismayed voice Bowers and Criss They looked up here on their way out They saw us Okay okay Richie said Calm down Haystack Just caaalm down Well go out the side door Nothing to worry about They went down the stairs Richie in the lead Beverly in the middle Ben bringing up the rear and looking back over his shoulder every two steps or so Have those guys really got it in for you Ben Beverly asked Yeah I guess they do Ben said I got in a fight with Henry Bowers on the last day of school Not as much as he wanted to Ben said Thats why hes still mad I guess Ole Hank the Tank also lost a fair amount of skin Richie murmured Or so I heard I dont think he was very pleased about that either He pushed open the exit door and the three of them stepped out into the alley that ran between the Aladdin and Nans Luncheonette A cat which had been rooting in a garbage can hissed and ran past them down the alley which was blocked at the far end by a board fence The cat scrambled up and over A trashcan lid clattered Bev jumped grabbed Richies arm and then laughed nervously I guess Im still scared from the movies she said Startled the three of them turned around Henry Victor and Belch were standing at the mouth of the alley There were two other guys behind them Oh shit I knew this was going to happen Ben moaned Richie turned quickly back toward the Aladdin but the exit door had closed behind them and there was no way to open it from the outside The things that happened next seemed to Richie both then and later like something out of a moviesuch things simply did not happen in real life In real life the little kids took their beatings picked up their teeth and went home Beverly stepped forward and to one side almost as if she intended to meet Henry perhaps shake his hand Richie could hear the cleats on his boots rapping Victor and Belch were coming after him the other two boys stood at the mouth of the alley guarding it Leave him alone Beverly shouted Pick on someone your own size Hes as big as a fucking Mack truck bitch Henry no gentleman snarled Now get out of my Richie stuck out his foot He didnt think he meant to His foot went out the same way wisecracks dangerous to his health sometimes emerged all on their own from his mouth Henry ran into it and fell forward The brick surface of the alley was slippery with spilled garbage from the overflowing cans on the luncheonette side Henry went skidding like a shuffleboard weight He started to get up his shirt blotched with coffee grounds mud and bits of lettuce Oh you guys are gonna DIE he screamed Until this moment Ben had been terrified Now something in him snapped He let out a roar and grabbed one of the garbage cans For just a moment holding it up garbage spilling everywhere he really did look like Haystack Calhoun His face was pale and furious He threw the garbage can It struck Henry in the small of the back and knocked him flat again They ran toward the mouth of the alley Victor Criss jumped in front of them Bellowing Ben lowered his head and rammed it into Victors middle Woof Victor grunted and sat down Belch grabbed a handful of Beverlys ponytail and whipped her smartly against the Aladdins brick wall Beverly bounced off and ran down the alley rubbing her arm Richie ran after her grabbing a garbagecan lid on the way Belch Huggins swung a fist almost the size of a Daisy ham at him Richie pistoned out the galvanized steel lid Belchs fist met it There was a loud bonnngga sound that was almost mellow Richie felt the shock travel all the way up his arm to the shoulder Belch screamed and began to hop up and down holding his swelling hand Yondah lies da tent of my faddah Richie said confidentially doing a very passable Tony Curtis Voice and then ran after Ben and Beverly One of the boys at the mouth of the alley had caught Beverly Ben was tussling with him The other boy began to rabbitpunch Ben in the small of the back Richie swung his foot It connected with the rabbitpunchers buttocks The boy howled with pain Richie grabbed Beverlys arm in one hand Bens in the other The boy Ben had been tussling with let go of Beverly and looped a punch at Richie His ear exploded with momentary pain then went numb and became very warm A high whistling sound began to whine in his head It sounded like the noise you were supposed to listen for when the school nurse put the earphones on you to test your hearing They ran down Center Street People turned to look at them Bens large stomach pogoed up and down Beverlys ponytail bounced Richie let go of Ben and held his glasses against his forehead with his left thumb so he wouldnt lose them His head was still ringing and he believed his ear was going to swell but he felt wonderful He started laughing Beverly joined him Soon Ben was laughing too They cut up Court Street and collapsed on a bench in front of the police station at that moment it seemed the only place in Derry where they might possibly be safe Beverly looped an arm around Bens neck and Richies She gave them a furious hug That was great Her eyes sparkled did you see those guys Did you see them I saw them all right Ben gasped And I never want to see them again This sent them off into another storm of hysterical laughter Richie kept expecting Henrys gang to come around the corner onto Court Street and take after them again police station or not Still he could not stop laughing Beverly was right It had been great The Losers Club Gets Off A Good One Richie yelled exuberantly Wackawackawacka He cupped his hands around his mouth and put on his Ben Bernie Voice YOWza YOWza YOWZA childrens A cop poked his head out of an open secondfloor window and shouted You kids get out of here Right now Take a walk Richie opened his mouth to say something brilliantquite possibly in his brandnew Irish Cop Voiceand Ben kicked his foot shut up Richie he said and promptly had trouble believing that he had said such a thing Okay Richie said What do you guys want to do Wanna go find Henry Bowers and ask him if he wants to work it out over a game of Monopoly Hesitantly blushing furiously Ben asked did that guy hurt your hair Beverly She smiled at him gently and in that moment she became sure of something she had only guessed at beforethat it had been Ben Hanscom who had sent her the postcard with the beautiful little haiku on it No it wasnt bad she said And so that was where they went or where they escaped Richie would think later that it set a pattern for the rest of the summer The Barrens had become their place Beverly like Ben on the day of his first encounter with the big boys had never been down there before She walked between Richie and Ben as the three of them moved singlefile down the path Her skirt twitched prettily and looking at her Ben was aware of waves of feeling as powerful as stomach cramps She was wearing her ankle bracelet It flashed in the afternoon sun They crossed the arm of the Kenduskeag the boys had dammed up the stream divided about seventy yards farther up along its course and became one again about two hundred yards farther on toward town using steppingstones downstream of the place where the dam had been found another path and eventually came out on the bank of the streams eastern fork which was much wider than the other It sparkled in the afternoon light To his left Ben could see two of those concrete cylinders with the manhole covers on top Below them jutting out over the stream were large concrete pipes Thin streams of muddy water poured over the lips of these outflow pipes and into the Kenduskeag Someone takes a crap uptown and heres where it comes out Ben thought remembering Mr Nells explanation of Derrys drainage system He felt a dull sort of helpless anger Once there had probably been fish in this river Now your chances of catching a trout wouldnt be so hot Your chances of catching a used wad of toilet paper would be better Yeah not bad Richie agreed The blackflies are gone and theres enough of a breeze to keep the mosquitoes away He looked at her hopefully Got any cigarettes No she said I had a couple but I smoked them yesterday There was the blast of an airhorn and they all watched as a long freight rumbled across the embankment on the far side of the Barrens and toward the trainyards Jeez if it was a passenger train theyd have a great view Richie thought First the poorfolks houses of the Old Cape then the bamboo swamps on the other side of the Kenduskeag and finally before leaving the Barrens the smoldering gravelpit that was the town dump For just a moment he found himself thinking about Eddies story againthe leper under the abandoned house on Neibolt Street He pushed it out of his mind and turned to Ben Huh Ben turned to him guiltily As Bev looked out across the Kenduskeag lost in thoughts of her own he had been looking at her profile and at the bruise on her cheekbone I liked it when Dr Frankenstein started tossing the bodies to the crocodiles under his house Ben said That was my best part That was gross Beverly said and shivered I hate things like that Crocodiles and piranhas and sharks Little tiny fish Beverly said And theyve got all these little tiny teeth but theyre wicked sharp And if you go into a river where they are they eat you right down to the bone I saw this movie once and these natives wanted to cross a river but the footbridge was down she said so they put a cow in the water on a rope and crossed while the piranhas were eating the cow When they pulled it out the cow was nothing but a skeleton I had nightmares for a week Man I wish I had some of those fish Richie said happily Id put em in Henry Bowers bathtub I dont know about that but I do know we better watch out for those guys Beverly said Her ringers touched the bruise on her cheek My dad went up the side of my head day before yesterday for breaking a pile of dishes One a week is enough There was a moment of silence that might have been awkward but was not Richie broke it by saying his best part was when the Teenage Werewolf got the evil hypnotist They talked about the moviesand other horror movies they had seen and Alfred Hitchcock Presents on TVfor an hour or more Bev spotted daisies growing on the riverbank and picked one She held it first under Richies chin and then under Bens chin to see if they liked butter She said they both did As she held the flower under their chins each was conscious of her light touch on their shoulders and the clean scent of her hair Her face was close to Bens only for a moment or two but that night he dreamed of how her eyes had looked during that brief endless span of time Conversation was fading a little when they heard the crackling sounds of people approaching along the path The three of them turned quickly toward the sound and Richie was suddenly acutely aware that the river was at their backs There was no place to run The voices drew closer They got to their feet Richie and Ben moving a little in front of Beverly without even thinking about it The screen of bushes at the end of the path shookand suddenly Bill Denbrough emerged Another kid was with him a fellow Richie knew a little bit His name was Bradley something and he had a terrible lisp Probably went up to Bangor with Bill for that speechtherapy thing Richie thought Big Bill he said and then in the Voice of Toodles We are glad to see you Mr Denbrough mawster Bill looked at them and grinnedand a peculiar certainty stole over Richie as Bill looked from him to Ben to Beverly and then back to Bradley WhateverHisNameWas Beverly was a part of them Bills eyes said so Bradley WhatsHisName was not He might stay for awhile today might even come down to the Barrens againno one would tell him no so sorry the Losers Club membership is full we already have our speechimpediment memberbut he was not part of it He was not part of them This thought led to a sudden irrational fear For a moment he felt the way you did when you suddenly realized you had swum out too far and the water was over your head There was an intuitive flash Were being drawn into something Being picked and chosen None of this is accidental Are we all here yet Then the intuition fell into a meaningless jumble of thoughtlike the smash of a glass pane on a stone floor Besides it didnt matter Bill was here and Bill would take care Bill would not let things get out of control He was the tallest of them and surely the most handsome Richie only had to look sideways at Bevs eyes fixed on Bill and then farther to Bens eyes fixed knowingly and unhappily on Bevs face to know that Bill was also the strongest of themand not just physically There was a good deal more to it than that but since Richie did not know either the word charisma or the full meaning of the word magnetism he only felt that Bills strength ran deep and might manifest itself in many ways some of them probably unexpected And Richie suspected if Beverly fell for him or got a crush on him or whatever they called it Ben would not be jealous like he would Richie thought if she got a crush on me he would accept it as nothing but natural And there was something else Bill was good It was stupid to think such a thing he did not in fact precisely think it he felt it but there it was Goodness and strength seemed to radiate from Bill He was like a knight in an old movie a movie that was corny but still had the power to make you cry and cheer and clap at the end Strong and good And five years later after his memories of what had happened in Derry both during and before that summer had begun to fade rapidly it occurred to a Richie Tozier in his midteens that John Kennedy reminded him of Stuttering He would look up faintly puzzled and shake his head Some guy I used to know he would think and would dismiss vague unease by pushing his glasses up on his nose and turning to his homework again Some guy I used to know a long time ago Bill Denbrough put his hands on his hips smiled sunnily and said Wuhwuhwell hhere we aaare now wuhwuhwuhwhat are wwe dddoing Five days later as June drew toward its end Bill told Richie that he wanted to go down to Neibolt Street and investigate under the porch where Eddie had seen the leper They had just arrived back at Richies house and Bill was walking Silver He had ridden Richie double most of the way home an exhilarating speedtrip across Derry but he had been careful to let Richie dismount a block away from his house If Richies mother saw Bill riding Richie double shed have a bird Silvers wire basket was full of play sixshooters two of them Bills three of them Richies They had been down in the Barrens for most of the afternoon playing guns Beverly Marsh had shown up around three oclock wearing faded jeans and toting a very old Daisy air rifle that had lost most of its popwhen you pulled its tapewrapped trigger it uttered a wheeze that sounded to Richie more like someone sitting on a very old Whoopee Cushion than a rifleshot Her specialty was Japanesesniper She was very good at climbing trees and shooting the unwary as they passed below The bruise on her cheekbone had faded to a faint yellow What did you say Richie asked He was shocked but also a little intrigued I wwwant to take a llook under that puhpuhporch Bill said His voice was stubborn but he wouldnt look at Richie There was a hard spot of flush high on each of his cheekbones They had arrived in front of Richies house Maggie Tozier was on the porch reading a book She waved to them and called Hi boys Want some iced tea Well be right there Mom Richie said and then to Bill There isnt going to be anything there He probably just saw a hobo and got all bent out of shape for Gods sake You know Eddie YYeah I nunknow EEEddie BBut ruhrememmember the pipipicture in the aalbum Richie shifted his feet uncomfortable Bill raised his right hand The BandAids were gone now but Richie could see circlets of healing scab on Bills first three fingers Luhluhhisten to meme Bill said He began to speak very slowly holding Richies eyes with his own Once more he related the similarities between Bens story and Eddies and tied those to what they had seen in the picture that moved He suggested again that the clown had murdered the boys and girls who had been found dead in Berry since the previous December AAnd muhmuhhaybe not just tthein Bill finished WWhat about aaall the oones who ddisappeared WWhat about EEEddie CuhCuhCorcoran Shit his stepfather scared him off Richie said dont you read the papers Wwell mmaybe he dddid and mmaybe he dddidnt Bill said I knew him a llihlittle bit ttoo and I nuhnuhknow his ddad bbbeat him And I aalso kknow he uuused to stay out nnuhhights ssometimes to gget awway from hhhim So maybe the clown got him while he was staying away Richie said thoughtfully Is that it If the cluhcluhcluhhown killed the ooothers then hhe kkkilled JuhGeorgie Bill said His eyes caught Richies They were like slatehard uncompromising unforgiving I wwant to kkkill it Jesus Christ Richie said frightened How are you going to do that Muhmy ddads got a pihpihpistol Bill said A little spittle flew from his lips but Richie barely noticed HHe doesnt nuhknow I know but I dddo Its on the top shshelf in his cluhcluhhoset Thats great if its a man Richie said and if we can find him sitting on a pile of kids bones I poured the tea boys Richies mom called cheerily Better come and get it Right there Mom Richie called again offering a big false smile It disappeared immediately as he turned back to Bill Because I wouldnt shoot a guy just because he was wearing a clown suit Billy Youre my best friend but I wouldnt do it and I wouldnt let you do it if I could stop you Richie licked his lips and said nothing for a moment Then he asked Bill What are you going to do if its not a man Billy What if it really is some kind of monster What if there really are such things Ben Hanscom said it was the mummy and the balloons were floating against the wind and it didnt cast a shadow The picture in Georgies album either we imagined that or it was magic and I gotta tell you man I dont think we just imagined it Your fingers sure didnt imagine it did they So what are we going to do if its not a man Billy Oh yeah Richie said I can see it After you shoot it four or five times and it keeps comin at us like the Teenage Werewolf in that movie me and Ben and Bev saw you can try your Bullseye on it And if the Bullseye doesnt work Ill throw some of my sneezing powder at it And if it keeps on coming after that well just call time and say Hey now hold on This aint getting it Mr Monster Look I got to read up on it at the library Ill be back Pawdon me Is that what youre going to say Big Bill He looked at his friend his head thudding rapidly Part of him wanted Bill to press on with his idea to check under the porch of that old house but another part wanteddesperately wantedBill to give the idea up In some ways all of this was like having stepped into one of those Saturdayafternoon horror movies at the Aladdin but in another waya crucial wayit wasnt like that at all Because this wasnt safe like a movie where you knew everything would turn out all right and even if it didnt it was no skin off your ass The picture in Georgies room hadnt been like a movie He had thought he was forgetting that but apparently he had been fooling himself because now he could see those cuts whirling up Billys fingers If he hadnt pulled Bill back Incredibly Bill was grinning Actually grinning YYYou wuhwanted mme to take yyou to luhluhlook at a ppicture he said NNow I wwant to ttake you to llook at a hhouse Tit for ttat You got no tits Richie said and they both burst out laughing And if its a monster Richie asked holding Bills eyes If your dads gun doesnt stop it Big Bill If it just keeps coming Wuhwuhwell thuhthuhthink of suhhomething else Bill said again Well hhhave to He threw back his head and laughed like a loon After a moment Richie joined him It was impossible not to They walked up the crazypaving to Richies porch together Maggie had set out huge glasses of iced tea with mintsprigs in them and a plate of vanilla wafers Bill clapped him on the back hard and that seemed to make the fear bearablealthough Richie was suddenly sure and he was not wrong that sleep would be long coming that night You boys looked like you were having a serious discussion out there Mrs Tozier said sitting down with her book in one hand and a glass of iced tea in the other She looked at the boys expectantly Aw Denbroughs got this crazy idea the Red Sox are going to finish in the first division Richie said MMe and my dddddad ththink tthey got a shshot at tthird Bill said and slipped his iced tea TThis is vehvehvery gogood MuhMrs Tozier The year the Sox finish in the first division will be the year you stop stuttering mush mouth Richie said Richie Mrs Tozier screamed shocked She nearly dropped her glass of iced tea But both Richie and Bill Denbrough were laughing hysterically totally cracked up She looked from her son to Bill and back to her son again touched by wonder that was mostly simple perplexity but partly a fear so thin and sharp that it found its way deep into her inner heart and vibrated there like a tuningfork made of clear ice I dont understand either of them she thought Where they go what they do what they want or what will become of them Sometimes oh sometimes their eyes are wild and sometimes Im afraid for them and sometimes Im afraid of them She found herself thinking not for the first time that it would have been nice if she and Went could have had a girl as well a pretty blonde girl that she could have dressed in skirts and matching bows and black patentleather shoes on Sundays A pretty little girl who would ask to bake cupcakes after school and who would want dolls instead of books on ventriloquism and Revell models of cars that went fast They were walking their bikes up Kansas Street beside the Barrens at ten oclock the next morning The sky was a dull gray Rain had been forecast for that afternoon Richie hadnt gotten to sleep until after midnight and he thought Denbrough looked as if he had spent a fairly restless night himself ole Big Bill was toting a matched set of Samsonite bags one under each eye I ggot it Bill said He patted the green duffel coat he was wearing Not now Bill said and then grinned someone ehehelse might see too But lllook what else I bruhbrought He reached behind him under the coat and brought his Bullseye slingshot out of his back pocket Bill had gotten the custom aluminum slingshot for his birthday the year before It had been Zacks compromise between the Bill had wanted and his mothers adamant refusal to even consider giving a boy Bills age a firearm The instruction booklet said a slingshot could be a fine hunting weapon once you learned to use it In the right hands your Bullseye Slingshot is as deadly and effective as a good ash bow or a highpowered firearm the booklet proclaimed With such virtues dutifully extolled the booklet went on to warn that a slingshot could be dangerous the owner should no more aim one of the twenty ballbearing slugs which came with it at a person than he would aim a loaded pistol at a person Bill wasnt very good at it yet and guessed privately he probably never would be but he thought the booklets caution was meritedthe slingshots thick elastic had a hard pull and when you hit a tin can with it it made one hell of a hole A luhluhlittle Bill said This was only partly true After much study of the pictures in the booklet which were labelled figs as in fig fig  and so on and enough practice in Derry Park to lame his arm he had gotten so he could hit the paper target which had also come with the slingshot maybe three times out of every ten tries And once he had gotten a bullseye Almost Richie pulled the sling back by the cup twanged it then handed it back He said nothing but privately doubted if it would count for as much as Zack Denbroughs pistol when it came to killing monsters Yeah he said You brought your slingshot okay big deal Thats nothing Look what I brought Denbrough And from his own jacket he hauled out a packet with a cartoon picture on it of a bald man saying AhCHOO as his cheeks puffed out like Dizzy Gillespies DR WACKYs SNEEZING POWDER the packet said ITs A LAFF RIOT The two of them stared at each other for a long moment and then broke up screaming with laughter and pounding each other on the back WWWere pruhprepared for aaanything Bill said finally still giggling and wiping his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket I thththought it wuhwas the uhuhother way aaround Bill said Now listen WWere ggonna sthahash yyour bbbike down in the BBarrens WWhere I puhput Silver when we play YYou ride dddouble bbehind me in ccase wwe have to make a quihhick gggetaway Richie nodded feeling no urge to argue His twentytwoinch Raleigh he sometimes whammed his kneecaps on the handlebars when he was pedaling fast looked like a pygmy bike next to the scrawny gantry like edifice that was Silver He knew that Bill was stronger and Silver was faster They got to the little bridge and Bill helped Richie stow his bike underneath Then they sat down and with the occasional rumble of traffic passing over their heads Bill unzipped his duffel and took out his fathers pistol YYou be goddam cccareful Bill said handing it over after Richie had whistled his frank approval ThTheres nno sssafety on a pihpihstol like that Is it loaded Richie asked awed The pistol an SSPKWalther that Zack Denbrough had picked up during the Occupation seemed unbelievably heavy NNot yyet Bill said He patted his pocket I gggot some buhbuhbuhbullets in hhhere But my dddad ssays ssometimes you llook aand ththen iif the ggggun ththinks yyoure not being cccareful it lloads ihihitself Sso it can shshhoot you His face uttered a strange smile which said that while he didnt believe anything so silly he believed it completely Richie understood There was a caged deadliness in the thing that he had never sensed in his dads or even the shotgun although there was something about the shotgun wasnt theresomething about the way it leaned mute and oily in the corner of the garage closet as if it might say I could be mean if I wanted to plenty mean you bet if it could speak But this pistol this Walther it was as if it had been made for the express purpose of shooting people With a chill Richie realized that was why it had been made What else could you do with a pistol Use it to light your cigarettes He turned the muzzle toward him being careful to keep his hands far away from the trigger One look into the Walthers black lidless eye made him understand Bills peculiar smile perfectly He remembered his father saying If you remember there is no such thing as an unloaded gun youll be okay with firearms all your life Richie He handed the gun back to Bill glad to be rid of it Bill stowed it in his duffel coat again Suddenly the house on Neibolt Street seemed less frightening to Richie but the possibility that blood might actually be spilledthat seemed much stronger He looked at Bill perhaps meaning to appeal this idea again but he saw Bills face read it and only said You ready As always when Bill finally pulled his second foot up from the ground Richie felt sure that they would crash splitting their silly skulls on unyielding cement The big bike wavered crazily from side to side The cards clothespinned to the fenderstruts stopped firing single shots and started machinegunning The bikes drunken wavers became more pronounced Richie closed his eyes and waited for the inevitable The bike picked up more speed and finally stopped that seasick sidetoside wavering Richie loosened his deathgrip on Bills middle and held the front of the package carrier over the rear wheel instead Bill crossed Kansas Street on a slant raced down sidestreets at an everquickening pace heading for Witcham as if racing down a set of geographical steps They came bulleting out of Strapham Street and onto Witcham at an exorbitant rate of speed Bill laid Silver damn near over on his side and bellowed Hiyo Silver again Ride it Big Bill Richie screamed so scared he was nearly creaming his jeans but laughing wildly all the same stand on this baby Bill suited the action to the word getting up and leaning over the handlebars and pumping the pedals at a lunatic rate Looking at Bills back which was amazingly broad for a boy of elevengoingontwelve watching it work under the duffel coat the shoulders slanting first one way and then the other as he shifted his weight from one pedal to the other Richie suddenly became sure that they were invulnerable they would live forever and ever Well perhaps not they but Bill would Bill had no idea of how strong he was how somehow sure and perfect They sped along the houses thinning out a little now the streets crossing Witcham at longer intervals Hiyo Silver Bill yelled and Richie hollered in his Nigger Jim Voice high and shrill Hiyo Silvuh massa thass rant You is rahdin disyere bike fo sho Lawksamussy Hiyo Silvuh AWWAYYY Now they were passing green fields that looked flat and depthless under the gray sky Richie could see the old brick train station up ahead in the distance To the right of it quonset warehouses marched off in a row Silver bumped over one set of train tracks then another And here was Neibolt Street cutting off to the right DERRY TRAINYARDS a blue sign under the streetsign read It was rusty and hung askew Below this was a much bigger sign yellow field black letters It was almost like a comment on the trainyards themselves DEAD END it read Bill turned onto Neibolt Street coasted to the sidewalk and put his foot back down Lets wwwalk from here Richie slipped off the package carrier with mingled feelings of relief and regret Okay They walked along the sidewalk which was cracked and weedy Up ahead of them in the trainyards a diesel engine revved slowly up faded off and then began all over again Once or twice they heard the metallic music of couplings being smashed together Bill walking Silver by the handlebars looked over at Richie briefly and then nodded YYeah You Bill told Richie he had asked his father about Neibolt Street the night before His father said that a lot of trainmen had lived out this way until the end of World War IIengineers conductors signalmen yardworkers baggage handlers The street had declined with the trainyards and as Bill and Richie moved farther along it the houses became farther apart seedier dirtier The last three or four on both sides were empty and boarded up their yards overgrown A FOR SALE sign flapped forlornly from the porch of one To Richie the sign looked about a thousand years old The sidewalk stopped and now they were walking along a beaten track from which weeds grew halfheartedly Twentynine Neibolt Street had once been a trim red Cape Cod MaybeRichie thought an engineer used to live there a bachelor with no pants but jeans and lots of those gloves with the big stiff cuffs and four or five pillowtick capsa fellow who would come home once or twice a month for stretches of three or four days and listen to the radio while he pottered in the garden a fellow who would eat mostly fried foods and no vegetables although he would grow them for his friends and who would on windy nights think about the Girl He Left Behind Now the red paint had faded to a wishywashy pink that was peeling away in ugly patches that looked like sores The windows were blind eyes boarded up Most of the shingles were gone Weeds grew rankly down both sides of the house and the lawn was covered with the seasons first bumper crop of dandelions To the left a high board fence perhaps once a neat white but now faded to a dull gray that almost matched the lowering sky lurched drunkenly in and out of the dank shrubbery About halfway down this fence Richie could see a monstrous grove of sunflowersthe tallest looked five feet tall or more They had a bloated nasty look he didnt like A breeze rustled them and they seemed to nod together The boys are here isnt that nice More boys Our boys Richie shivered While Bill leaned Silver carefully against an elm Richie surveyed the house He saw a wheel sticking out of the thick grass near the porch and pointed it out to Bill Bill nodded it was the overturned trike Eddie had mentioned They looked up and down Neibolt Street The chug of the diesel engine rose and fell off then began again The sound seemed to hang in the overcast like a charm The street was utterly deserted Richie could hear occasional cars passing on Route but could not see them The huge sunflowers nodded sagely together Fresh boys Good boys Our boys You know I was just thinking that maybe the last bunch of library books I took out are due today Richie said Maybe I ought to I guess I am Richie said knowing he was not ready at allhe was never going to be ready for this scene At the far lefthand side the porchs latticework skirt leaned out against a tangle of bushes Both boys could see the rusty nails that had been pulled free There were old rosebushes here and while the roses both to the right and the left of the unanchored stretch of latticework were blooming in a lackadaisical way those directly around and in front of it were skeletal and dead Bill and Richie looked at each other grimly Everything Eddie said seemed true enough seven weeks later the evidence was still here You dont really want to go under there do you Richie asked He was almost pleading And with a sinking heart Richie saw that he absolutely meant it That gray light was back in Billys eyes shining steadily There was a stony eagerness in the lines of his face that made him look older Richie thought I think he really does mean to kill it if its still there Kill it and maybe cut off its head and take it to his father and say Look this is what killed Georgie now will you talk to me again at night maybe just tell me how your day was or who lost when you guys were flipping to see who paid for the morning coffee Bill he said but Bill was no longer there He was walking around to the righthand end of the porch where Eddie must have crawled under Richie had to chase after him and he almost fell over the trike caught in the weeds and slowly rusting its way into the ground He caught up as Bill squatted looking under the porch There was no skirt at all on this end someonesome hobohad pried it off long ago to gain access to the shelter underneath out of the January snow or the cold November rain or a summer thundershower Richie squatted beside him his heart thudding like a drum There was nothing under the porch but drifts of moldering leaves yellowing newspapers and shadows Too many shadows Whwhwhat Bill had produced his fathers Walther again He pulled the clip carefully from the grip and then took four bullets from his pants pocket He loaded them in one at a tune Richie watched this fascinated and then looked under the porch again He saw something else this tune Broken glass Faintly glinting shards of glass His stomach cramped painfully He was not a stupid boy and he understood this came close to completely confirming Eddies story Splinters of glass on the moldering leaves under the porch meant that the window had been broken from inside From the cellar Whwhat Bill asked again looking up at Richie His face was grim and white Looking at that set face Richie mentally threw in the towel The smell of decaying leaves was a smell Richie usually liked but there was nothing pleasant about the smell under here The leaves felt spongy under his hands and knees and he had an impression that they might go down for two or three feet He suddenly wondered what he would do if a hand or a claw sprang out of those leaves and seized him Bill was examining the broken window Glass had sprayed everywhere The wooden strip which had been between the panes lay in two splintered pieces under the porch steps The top of the window frame jutted out like a broken bone Something hit that fucker wicked hard Richie breathed Bill now peering insideor trying tonodded Richie elbowed him aside enough so he could look too The basement was a dim litter of crates and boxes The floor was earth and like the leaves it gave off a damp and humid aroma A furnace bulked to the left thrusting round pipes at the low ceiling Beyond it at the end of the cellar Richie could see a large stall with wooden sides A horse stall was his first thought but who kept horses in the jeezly cellar Then he realized that in a house as old as this one the furnace must have burned coal instead of oil Nobody had bothered to convert the furnace because no one wanted the house That thing with the sides was a coalbin To the far right Richie could make out a flight of stairs going up to ground level Now Bill was sitting down hunching himself forward and before Richie could actually believe what he was up to his friends legs were disappearing into the window Bill he hissed Chrissake what are you doing Get outta there Bill didnt reply He slithered through scraping his duffel coat up from the small of his back barely missing a chunk of glass that would have cut him a good one A second later Richie heard his tennies smack down on the hard earth inside Piss on this action Richie muttered frantically to himself looking at the square of darkness into which his friend had disappeared Bill you gone out of your mind Bills voice floated up YYou cccan stay up ththere if you wwant RuhRuhRichie StStand ggguard Instead he rolled over on his belly and shoved his legs through the cellar window before his nerve could go bad on him hoping he wouldnt cut his hands or his stomach on the broken glass IIIts juhjuhhust mme Bill hissed and a moment later Richie was standing beside him in the cellar pulling down his shirt and his jacket Whwho ddid you ththink it wwas Fuck that Richie said He could actually hear his heartbeat in his voice making it sound bumpy and uneven first up and then down Im stickin with you Big Bill They moved toward the coalpit first Bill slightly in the lead the gun in his hand Richie close behind him trying to look everywhere at once Bill stood beyond one of the coalpits jutting wooden sides for a moment and then suddenly darted around it pointing the gun with both hands Richie squinched his eyes shut steeling himself for the explosion It didnt come He opened his eyes again cautiously Richie stepped up beside Bill and looked There was still a drift of old coal piled up almost to the ceiling at the back of the stall and trickling away to a lump or two by their feet It was as black as a crows wing Lets Richie began and then the door at the head of the cellar stairs crashed open against the wall with a violent bang spilling thin white daylight down the stairs Richie heard snarling sounds They were very loudthe sounds a wild animal in a cage might make He saw loafers descend the steps Faded jeans on top of themswinging hands Cuhcuhclimb the cccoal Bill was screaming but Richie stood frozen suddenly knowing what was coming for them what was going to kill them in this cellar that stank of damp earth and the cheap wine that had been spilled in the corners Knowing but needing to see Theres a wuhwuhwindow at the ttop of the ccoal The paws were covered with dense brown hair that curled and coiled like wire the fingers were tipped with jagged nails Now Richie saw a silk jacket It was black with orange pipingthe Derry High School colors GGGo Bill screamed and gave Richie a gigantic shove Richie went sprawling into the coal Sharp jags and corners of it poked him painfully breaking through his daze More coal avalanched over his hands That mad snarling went on and on Barely aware of what he was doing he scrambled up the mountain of coal gaining ground sliding back lunging upward again screaming as he went The window at the top was grimed black with coaldust and let in next to no light at all It was latched shut Richie seized the latch which was of the sort that turned and threw all his weight against it The latch moved not at all The snarling was closer now The gun went off below him the sound nearly deafening in the closed room Gunsmoke sharp and acrid stung Richies nose It shocked him back to some sort of awareness and he realized that he had been trying to turn the thumblatch the wrong way He reversed the direction of the force he was applying and the latch gave with a protracted rusty squeal Coaldust sifted down on his hands like pepper The gun went off again with a second deafening bang Bill Denbrough shouted YOU KILLED MY BROTHER YOU FUCKER For a moment the creature which had come down the stairs seemed to laugh seemed to speakit was as if a vicious dog had suddenly begun to bark out garbled words and for a moment Richie thought the thing in the highschool jacket snarled back Im going to kill you too Richie Bill screamed then and Richie heard coal clattering and falling again as Bill scrambled up The snarls and roars continued Wood splintered There were mingled barks and howlssounds out of a cold nightmare Richie gave the window a tremendous shove not caring if the glass broke and cut his hands to ribbons He was beyond caring It did not break it swung outward on an old steel hinge flaked with rust More coaldust sifted down this time on Richies face He wriggled out into the side yard like an eel smelling sweet fresh air feeling the long grass whip at his face He was dimly aware that it was raining He could see the thick stalks of the giant sunflowers green and hairy The Walther went off a third time and the beast in the cellar screamed a primitive sound of pure rage Then Bill cried Its ggot me Richie Help Its gggot me Richie turned around on his hands and knees and saw the terrified circle of his friends upturned face in the square of the oversized cellar window through which a winters load of coal had once been funnelled each October Bill was lying spreadeagled on the coal His hands waved and clutched fruitlessly for the window frame which was just out of reach His shirt and jacket were rucked up almost to his breastbone And he was sliding backward no he was being pulled backward by something Richie could barely see It was a moving bulking shadow behind Bill A shadow that snarled and gibbered and sounded almost human Richie didnt need to see it He had seen it the previous Saturday on the screen of the Aladdin Theater It was mad totally mad but even so it never occurred to Richie to doubt either his own sanity or his conclusion The Teenage Werewolf had Bill Denbrough Only it wasnt that guy Michael Landon with a lot of makeup on his face and a lot of fake fur It was real Richie reached in and caught Bills hands in his own The Walther pistol was in one of them and for the second time that day Richie looked into its black eye only this time it was loaded They tussled for BillRichie gripping his hands the Werewolf gripping his ankles The face of the Werewolf suddenly swam out of the dark Its forehead was low and prognathous covered with scant hair Its cheeks were hollow and furry Its eyes were a dark brown filled with horrible intelligence horrible awareness Its mouth dropped open and it began to snarl White foam ran from the corners of its thick lower lip in twin streams that dripped from its chin The hair on its head was swept back in a gruesome parody of a teenagers da It threw its head back and roared its eyes never leaving Richies Bill scrambled up the coal Richie seized his forearms and pulled For a moment he thought he was actually going to win Then the Werewolf laid hold of Bills legs again and he was yanked backward toward the darkness once more It was stronger It had laid hold of Bill and it meant to have him Then with no thought at all about what he was doing or why he was doing it Richie heard the Voice of the Irish Cop coming out of his mouth Mr Nells voice But this was not Richie Tozier doing a bad imitation it wasnt even precisely Mr Nell It was the Voice of every Irish beatcop that had ever lived and twirled a billy by its rawhide rope as he tried the doors of closed shops after midnight Let go of him boyo or Ill crack yer thick head I swear to Jaysus Leave go of him now or Ill serve ye yer own arse on a platter The creature in the cellar let out an earsplitting roar of rage but it seemed to Richie that there was another note in that bellow as well Perhaps fear Or pain He gave one more tremendous tug and Bill flew out of the window and onto the grass He stared up at Richie with dark horrified eyes The front of his jacket was smeared black with coaldust KwuhKwuhQuick Bill panted He was nearly moaning He grabbed at Richies shirt WWWe guhguhhotta Richie could hear coal tumbling and avalanching down again A moment later the Werewolf s face filled the cellar window It snarled at them Its paws clutched at the listless grass Bill still had the Waltherhe had held on to the gun through all of it Now he held it out in both hands his eyes squinched down to slits and pulled the trigger There was another deafening bang Richie saw a chunk of the Werewolf s skull tear free and a torrent of blood spilled down the side of its face matting the fur there and soaking the collar of the school jacket it wore Moving slowly dreamily Richie reached under his coat and into his back pocket He brought out the envelope with the picture of the sneezing man on it He tore it open as the bleeding roaring creature pulled itself out of the window forcing its way claws digging deep furrows in the earth Richie tore the packet open and squeezed it Git back in yer place boyo he ordered in the Voice of the Irish Cop A white cloud puffed into the Werewolf s face Its roars suddenly stopped It stared at Richie with almost comic surprise and made a choked wheezing sound Its eyes red and bleary rolled toward Richie and seemed to mark him once and forever It sneezed again and again and again Ropy strings of saliva flew from its muzzle Greenishblack clots of snot flew out of its nostrils One of these splatted against Richies skin and burned there like acid He wiped it away with a scream of hurt and disgust There was still anger in its face but there was also painit was unmistakable Bill might have hurt it with his dads pistol but Richie had hurt it more first with the Voice of the Irish Cop and then with the sneezing powder Jesus if I had some itching powder too and maybe a joy buzzer I might be able to kill it Richie thought and then Bill grabbed the collar of his jacket and jerked him backward It was well that he did The Werewolf stopped sneezing as suddenly as it had started and lunged at Richie It was quick tooincredibly quick Richie might have only sat there with the empty envelope of Dr Wackys sneezing powder in one hand staring at the Werewolf with a kind of drugged wonder thinking how brown its fur was how red the blood was how nothing was in black and white in real life he might have sat there until its paws closed around his neck and its long nails pulled his throat out but Bill grabbed him again and pulled him to his feet Richie stumbled after him They ran around to the front of the house and Richie thought It wont dare chase us anymore were on the street now it wont dare chase us wont dare wont dare But it was coming He could hear it just behind them gibbering and snarling and slobbering There was Silver still leaning against the tree Bill jumped onto the seat and threw his fathers pistol into the carrier basket where they had carried so many play guns Richie chanced a glance behind him as he flung himself onto the package carrier and saw the Werewolf crossing the lawn toward them less than twenty feet away now Blood and slobber mixed on its highschool jacket White bone gleamed through its pelt about the right temple There were white smudges of sneezing powder on the sides of its nose And Richie saw two other things which seemed to complete the horror There was no zipper on the things jacket instead there were big fluffy orange buttons like pompoms The other thing was worse It was the other thing that made him feel as if he might faint or just give up and let it kill him A name was stitched on the jacket in gold thread the kind of thing you could get done down at Machens for a buck if you wanted it Stitched on the bloody left breast of the Werewolf s jacket stained but readable were the words RICHIE TOZIER Silver began to move but slowlymuch too slowly It took Bill so long to get going The Werewolf crossed the rutted path just as Bill pedaled into the middle of Neibolt Street Blood splattered its faded jeans and looking back over his shoulder filled with a kind of dreadful unbreakable fascination that was akin to hypnosis Richie saw that the seams of the jeans were giving way in places and tufts of coarse brown fur had sprung through Silver wavered wildly back and forth Bill was standing up gripping the bikes handlebars from underneath head turned up toward the cloudy sky cords standing out on his neck And still the playing cards were only firing single shots One paw groped for Richie He screamed miserably and ducked away from it The Werewolf snarled and grinned It was close enough so Richie could see the yellowing corneas of its eyes could smell sweet rotten meat on its breath Its teeth were crooked fangs Richie screamed again as it swung a paw at him He was sure it was going to take his head offbut the paw passed in front of him missing by no more than an inch The force of the swing blew Richies sweaty hair back from his forehead Hiyo Silver AWAYYY Bill screamed at the top of his voice He had reached the top of a short shallow hill Not much but enough to get Silver rolling The playing cards picked up speed and began to burr along gill pumped the pedals madly Silver stopped wavering and cut a straight course down Neibolt Street toward Route Thank God thank God thank God Richie thought incoherently Thank The Werewolf roared againoh my God it sounds like its RIGHT BESIDE MEand Richies wind was cut off as his shirt and jacket were jerked back against his windpipe He made a gargling choking sound and managed to grip Bills middle just before he was pulled off the back of the bike Bill tilted backward but held on to Silvers handlebar grips For one moment Richie thought the big bike would simply do a wheelie and spill both of them off the back Then his jacket which had been just about ready for the ragbag anyway parted down the back with a loud ripping noise that sounded weirdly like a big fart Richie could breathe again He looked around and stared directly into those muddy murderous eyes Bill He tried to howl it but the word had no force no sound Bill seemed to hear him anyway He pedaled even harder harder than he ever had in his life All his guts seemed to be rising coming unanchored He could taste thick coppery blood in the back of his throat His eyeballs were starting from their sockets His mouth hung open scooping air And a crazy ineluctable sense of exhilaration filled himsomething that was wild and free and all his own A desire He stood on the pedals coaxed them battered them Silver continued to pick up speed He was beginning to feel the road now beginning to fly Bill could feel him go Richie could hear the fast rattlethud of loafers on the macadam He turned The Werewolf s paw struck him above the eyes with stunning force and for a moment Richie really did think the top of his head had come off Things suddenly seemed dim unimportant Sounds faded in and out The color washed out of the world He turned back clinging desperately to Bill Warm blood ran into his right eye stinging The paw swung again striking the back fender this time Richie felt the bike waver crazily for a moment on the verge of tipping over finally straightening out again Bill yelled Hiyo Silver A WAY again but that was distant too like an echo heard just before it dies out Richie closed his eyes and held on to Bill and waited for the end Bill had also heard the running steps and understood that the clown hadnt given up yet but he didnt dare turn around and look He would know if it caught up and knocked them flat That was really all he needed to know Come on boy he thought Give me everything now Everything you got Go Silver GO So once again Bill Denbrough found himself racing to beat the devil only now the devil was a hideously grinning clown whose face sweated white greasepaint whose mouth curved up in a leering red vampire smile whose eyes were bright silver coins A clown who was for some lunatic reason wearing a Derry High School jacket over its silvery suit with the orange ruff and the orange pompom buttons Neibolt Street blurred by him now Silver was starting to hum good now Had those running footfalls faded back a bit He still didnt dare turn around to see Richie had him in a death grip he was pinching off his wind and Bill wanted to tell Richie to loosen up a little but he didnt dare waste breath on that either There up ahead like a beautiful dream was the stopsign marking the intersection of Neibolt Street and Route Cars were passing back and forth on Witcham In his state of exhausted terror this seemed somehow like a miracle to Bill Now because he would have to put on his brakes in a moment or do something really inventive he risked a look back over his shoulder What he saw caused him to reverse Silvers pedals with a single snapjerk Silver skidded laying rubber with its locked rear tire and Richies head smacked painfully into the hollow of Bills right shoulder But twentyfive yards or so behind them by the first of the abandoned houses which formed a kind of funeral cortege leading up to the trainyards there was a bright flick of orange It lay close to a stormdrain cut into the curbing Almost too late Bill realized that Richie was sliding off the back of Silver Richies eyes were turned up so Bill could only see the lower rims of the irises below his upper lids The mended bow of his glasses hung askew Blood was flowing slowly from his forehead Bill grabbed his arm they both slipped to the right and Silver overbalanced They crashed to the street in a tangle of arms and legs Bill barked his crazybone a good one and shouted with pain Richies eyes flickered at the sound I am going to show you how to get to thees treasure senhorr but thees man Dobbs ees plenny dangerous Richie said in a snoring gasp It was his Pancho Vanilla Voice but its floating unconnected quality scared Bill badly He saw several coarse brown hairs clinging to the shallow headwound on Richies forehead They were slightly kinky like his fathers pubic hair They made him feel even more afraid and he fetched Richie a strong smack upside the head Yowch Richie cried His eyes fluttered then opened wide What are you hittin me for Big Bill Youll break my glasses They aint in very good shape anyway just in case you didnt notice Richie sat up slowly in the street and put a hand to his head He groaned What hap And then he remembered His eyes widened in sudden shock and terror and he scrambled around on his knees gasping harshly Richie saw the empty street where nothing moved and suddenly burst into tears Bill looked at him for a moment and then put his arms around Richie and hugged him Richie clutched at Bills neck and hugged him back He wanted to say something clever something about how Bill should have tried the Bullseye on the Werewolf but nothing would come out Nothing except sobs DDont RRichie Bill said duhduhduhhh Then he burst into tears himself and they only hugged each other on their knees in the street beside Bills spilled bike and their tears made clean streaks down their cheeks which were sooted with coaldust Somewhere high over New York State on the afternoon of May th Beverly Rogan begins to laugh again She stifles it in both hands afraid someone will think she is crazy but cant quite stop We laughed a lot back then she thinks It is something else another light on in the dark We were afraid all the time but we couldnt stop laughing any more than I can stop now The guy sitting next to her in the aisle seat is young longhaired goodlooking He has given her several appreciative glances since the plane took off in Milwaukee at half past two almost two and a half hours ago now with a stop in Cleveland and another one in Philly but has respected her clear desire not to talk after a couple of conversational gambits to which she has responded with politeness but no more he opens his totebag and takes out a Robert Ludlum novel Now he closes it holding his place with his finger and says with some concern Everything cool with you She nods trying to make her face serious and then snorts more laughter He smiles a little puzzled questioning Its nothing she says once again trying to be serious but its no good the more she tries to be serious the more her face wants to crack up Just like the old days Its just that all at once I realized I didnt know what airline I was on Only that there was a great big ddduck on the ssside But the thought is too much She goes off into gales of merry laughter People look around at her some frowning You are whizzing through the air at four hundred and seventy miles an hour courtesy of Republic Airlines Its on the KYAG folder in the seat pocket He pulls the folder which does indeed have the Republic logo on the front out of the pocket It shows where the emergency exits are where the flotation devices are how to use the oxygen masks how to assume the crashlanding position The kissyourassgoodbye folder he says and this time they both burst out laughing He really is goodlooking she thinks suddenlyit is a fresh thought somehow cleareyed the sort of thought you might expect to have upon waking when your mind isnt all junked up Hes wearing a pullover sweater and faded jeans His darkish blond hair is tied back with a piece of rawhide and this makes her think of the ponytail she always wore her hair in when she was a kid She thinks I bet hes got a nice polite collegeboys cock Long enough to jazz with not thick enough to be really arrogant She starts to laugh again totally unable to help it She realizes she doesnt even have a handkerchief with which to wipe her streaming eyes and this makes her laugh harder You better get yourself under control or the stewardess will throw you off the plane he says solemnly and she only shakes her head laughing her sides and her stomach hurt now He hands her a clean white handkerchief and she uses it Somehow this helps her to get it under control finally She doesnt stop all at once though It just sort of tapers off into little hitchings and gaspings Every now and then she thinks of the big duck on the side of the plane and belches out another little stream of giggles Jesus maam what happened to your hand He holds it for a moment concerned She looks down at it and sees the torn fingernails the ones she ripped down to the quick tipping the vanity over on Tom The memory of doing that hurts more than the fingernails themselves and that stops the laughter for good She takes her hand away from him but gently I slammed it in the car door at the airport she says thinking of all the times she has lied about things Tom has done to her and all the times she lied about the bruises her father put on her Is this the last time the last lie How wonderful that would be almost too wonderful to be believed She thinks of a doctor coming in to see a terminal cancer patient and saying The Xrays show the tumor is shrinking We dont have any idea why but its happening I took some aspirin She opens the inflight magazine again although he probably knows shes been through it twice already She closes the magazine looks at him smiles Youre very nice she says but I dont want to talk All right All right he says smiling back But if you want to drink to the big duck on the side of the plane when we get to Boston Im buying Boy was my horoscope ever wrong this morning he says and reopens his novel But you sound great when you laugh A guy could fall in love She opens the magazine again but finds herself looking at her jagged nails instead of the article on the pleasures of New Orleans There are purple bloodblisters under too of them In her mind she hears Tom screaming down the stairwell Ill kill you you bitch You fucking bitch She shivers cold A bitch to Tom a bitch to the seamstresses who goofed up before important shows and took a Beverly Rogan reaming for it a bitch to her father long before either Tom or the hapless seamstresses became part of their lives Her foot cut on a shard of perfume bottle as she fled their bedroom throbs more than her fingers Kay gave her a BandAid a pair of shoes and a check for a thousand dollars which Beverly cashed promptly at nine oclock at the First Bank of Chicago in Water tower Square Over Kays protests Beverly wrote her own check for a thousand dollars on a plain sheet of typing paper I read once that they have to take a check no matter what its written on she told Kay Her voice seemed to be coming from somewhere else A radio in another room maybe someone cashed a check once that was written on an artillery shell I read that in The Book of Lists I think She paused then laughed uneasily Kay looked at her soberly even solemnly But Id cash it fast before Tom thinks to freeze the accounts Although she doesnt feel tired she is aware however that by now she must be going purely on nerves and Kays black coffee the previous night seems like something she must have dreamed She can remember being followed by three teenaged boys who called and whistled but didnt quite dare come right up to her She remembers the relief that washed over her when she saw the white fluorescent glow of a SevenEleven store spilling out onto the sidewalks at an intersection She went in and let the pimplyfaced counterman look down the front of her old blouse and talked him into loaning her forty cents for the pay phone It wasnt hard the view being what it was She called Kay McCall first dialing from memory The phone rang a dozen times and she began to fear that Kay was in New York Kays sleepy voice mumbled It better be good whoever you are just as Beverly was about to hang up Its Bev Kay she said hesitated and then plunged I need help There was a moment of silence and then Kay spoke again sounding fully awake now Where are you What happened Im at a SevenEleven on the comer of S trey land Avenue and some other street I Kay Ive left Tom Kay quick and emphatic and excited Good Finally Hurray Ill come and gel you That son of a bitch That piece of shit Ill come and get you in the fucking Mercedes Ill hire a fortypiece band Ill Ill take a cab Bev said holding the other two dimes in one sweating palm In the round mirror at the back of the store she could see the pimply clerk staring at her ass with deep and dreamy concentration But youll have to pay the tab when I get there I dont have any money Not a cent Ill tip the bastard five bucks Kay cried This is the best fucking news since Nixon resigned You get your buns over here girl And She paused and when she spoke again her voice was serious and so full of kindness and love that Beverly felt she might weep Thank God you finally did it Bev I mean that Thank God Kay McCall is a former designer who married rich divorced richer and discovered feminist politics in about three years before Beverly first met her At the time Of her greatest popularitycontroversy she was accused of having embraced feminism after using archaic chauvinistic laws to take her manufacturer husband for every cent the law would allow her Bullshit Kay had once exclaimed to Beverly The people who say that stuff never had to go to bed with Sam Chacowicz Two pumps a tickle and a squirt that was ole Sammys motto The only time he could keep it up for longer than seventy seconds was when he was pulling off in the tub I didnt cheat him I just took my combat pay retroactively She wrote three booksone on feminism and the working woman one on feminism and the family one on feminism and spirituality The first two were quite popular In the three years since her last she had fallen out of fashion to a degree and Beverly thought it was something of a relief to her Her investments had done well Feminism and capitalism are not mutually exclusive thank God she had once told Bev and now she was a wealthy woman with a townhouse a place in the country and two or three lovers virile enough to go the distance with her in the sack but not quite virile enough to beat her at tennis When they get that good I drop them at once she said and although Kay clearly thought this was a joke Beverly wondered if it really was Beverly called a cab and when it came she piled into the back with her suitcase glad to be away from the clerks eyes and gave the driver Kays address She was waiting at the end of her driveway wearing her mink coat over a flannel nightgown Pink fuzzy mules with great big pompoms were on her feet Not orange pompoms thank Godthat might have sent Beverly screaming into the night again The ride over to Kays had been weird things were coming back to her memories pouring in so fast and so clearly that it was frightening She felt as if someone had started up a big bulldozer in her head and begun excavating a mental graveyard she hadnt even known was there Only it was names instead of bodies that were turning up names she hadnt thought of in years Ben Hanscom Richie Tozier Greta Bowie Henry Bowers Eddie Kaspbrak Bill Denbrough Especially BillStuttering Bill they had called him with that openness of children that is sometimes called candor sometimes cruelty He had seemed so tall to her so perfect until he opened his mouth and started to talk that was Alternately hot and cold she had remembered the voices from the drain and the blood She had screamed and her father had popped her one Her fatherTom Tears threatened and then Kay was paying the cabdriver and tipping him big enough to make the startled cabbie exclaim Thanks lady Wow Kay took her into the house got her into the shower gave her a robe when she got out made coffee examined her injuries Mercurochromed her cut foot and put a BandAid on it She poured a generous dollop of brandy into Bevs second cup of coffee and hectored her into drinking every drop Then she cooked them each a rare strip steak and sauteed fresh mushrooms to go with them All right she said What happened Do we call the cops or just send you to Reno to do your residency I cant tell you too much Beverly said It would sound too crazy But it was my fault mostly Kay slammed her hand down on the table It made a sound on the polished mahogany like a smallcaliber pistol shot Bev jumped Dont you say that Kay said There was high color in her cheeks and her brown eyes were blazing How long have we been friends Nine years Ten If I hear you say it was your fault one more time Im going to puke You hear me Im just going to fucking puke It wasnt your fault this time or last time or the time before or any of the times Dont you know most of your friends thought that sooner or later hed put you in a body cast or maybe even kill you And that would have been your fault at least to a degree for staying there and letting it happen But now youre gone Thank God for small favors But dont you sit there with half of your fingernails ripped off and your foot cut open and beltmarks on your shoulders and tell me it was your fault He didnt use his belt on me Bev said The lie was automatic and so was the deep shame which brought a miserable flush to her cheeks If youre done with Tom you ought to be done with the lies as well Kay said quietly and she looked at Bev so long and so lovingly that Bev had to drop her eyes She could taste salt tears in the back of her throat Who did you think you were fooling Kay asked still speaking quietly She reached across the table and took Bens hands The dark glasses the blouses with high necks and long sleeves maybe you fooled a buyer or two But you cant fool your friends Bev Not the people who love you And then Beverly did cry long and hard and Kay held her and later just before going to bed she told Kay what she could That an old friend from Derry Maine where she had grown up had called and had reminded her of a promise she had made long ago The time to fulfill the promise had arrived he said Would she come She said she would Then the trouble with Tom had started Beverly shook her head slowly I cant tell you that Kay Much as Id like to Kay chewed on this and then nodded All right Fair enough What are you going to do about Tom when you get back from Maine And Bev who had begun to feel more and more that she wouldnt be coming back from Derry ever said only Ill come to you first and well decide together Okay As soon as Im back Bev said steadily you can count on it And she hugged Kay hard With Kays check cashed and Kays shoes on her feet she had taken a Greyhound north to Milwaukee afraid that Tom might have gone out to OHare to look for her Kay who had gone with her to the bank and the bus depot tried to talk her out of it OHares lousy with security people dear she said You dont have to worry about him If he comes near you what you do is scream your fucking head off Beverly shook her head I want to avoid him altogether This is the way to do it Kay looked at her shrewdly Youre afraid he might talk you out of it arent you Beverly thought of the seven of them standing in the stream of Stanley and his piece of broken Coke bottle glinting greenly in the sun she thought of the thin pain as he cut her palm lightly on a slant she thought of them clasping hands in a childrens circle promising to come back if it ever started again to come back and kill it for good No she said He couldnt talk me out of this But he might hurt me security guards or not You didnt see him last night Kay Ive seen him enough on other occasions Kay said her brows drawing together The asshole that walks like a man He was crazy Bev said security guards might not stop him This is better Believe me All right Kay said reluctantly and Bev thought with some amusement that Kay was disappointed that there was going to be no confrontation no big blowoff Cash the check quick Beverly told her again before he can think to freeze the accounts He will you know Sure Kay said If he does that Ill go see the son of a bitch with a horsewhip and take it out in trade You stay away from him Beverly said sharply Hes dangerous Kay Believe me He was like Like my father was what trembled on her lips Instead she said He was like a wildman Okay Kay said Be easy in your mind dear Go keep your promise And do some thinking about what comes after I will Bev said but that was a lie She had too many other things to think about what had happened the summer she was eleven for instance Showing Richie Tozier how to make his yoyo sleep for instance Voices from the drain for instance And something she had seen something so horrible that even then embracing Kay for the last time by the long silvery side of the grumbling Greyhound bus her mind would not quite let her see it Now as the plane with the duck on the side begins its long descent into the Boston area her mind turns to that again and to Stan Uris and to an unsigned poem that came on a postcard and the voices and to those few seconds when she had been eye to eye with something that was perhaps infinite She looks out the window looks down and thinks that Toms evil is a small and petty thing compared with the evil waiting for her in Derry If there is a compensation is that Bill Denbrough will be there and there was a time when an elevenyearold girl named Beverly Marsh loved Bill Denbrough She remembers the postcard with the lovely poem written on the back and remembers that she once knew who wrote it She doesnt remember anymore any more than she remembers exactly what the poem said but she thinks it might have been Bill Yes it might well have been Stuttering Bill Denbrough She thinks suddenly of getting ready for bed the night after Richie and Ben took her to see those two honor movies After her first date She had cracked wise with Richie about itin those days that had been her defense when she was out on the streetbut a pan of her had been touched and excited and a little scared It really had been her first date even though there had been two boys instead of one Richie had paid her way and everything just like a real date Then afterward there had been those boys who chased them and they had spent the rest of the afternoon in the Barrens and Bill Denbrough had come down with another kid she couldnt remember who but she remembered the way Bills eyes had rested on hers for a moment and the electric shock she had felt the shock and a flush that seemed to warm her entire body She remembers thinking of all these things as she pulled on her nightgown and went into the bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth She remembers thinking that it would take her a long time to get to sleep that night because there was so much to think about and to think about in a good way because they seemed like good kids like kids you could maybe goof with and maybe even trust a little bit That would be nice That would be well like heaven And thinking these things she took her washcloth and leaned over the basin to get some water and the voice Beverly drew back startled the dry washcloth dropping onto the floor She shook her head a little as if to clear it and then she bent over the basin again and looked curiously at the drain The bathroom was at the back of their fourroom apartment She could hear faintly some Western program going on the TV When it was over her father would probably switch over to a baseball game or the fights and then go to sleep in his easy chair The wallpaper in here was a hideous pattern of frogs on lily pads It bulged and swayed over the lumpy plaster beneath It was watermarked in some places actually peeling away in others The tub was rustmarked the toilet seat cracked One naked watt bulb jutted from a porcelain socket over the basin Beverly could remembervaguelythat there had once been a light fixture but it had been broken some years ago and never replaced The floor was covered with linoleum from which the pattern had faded except for a small patch under the sink Not a very cheery room but Beverly had used it so long that she no longer noticed what it looked like The washbasin was also waterstained The drain was a simple crosshatched circle about two inches in diameter There had once been a chrome facing but that was also long gone A rubber drainplug on a chain was looped nonchalantly over the faucet marked C The drainhole was pipedark and as she leaned over it she noticed for the first time that there was a faint unpleasant smella slightly fishy smellcoming from the drain She wrinkled her nose a little in disgust She gasped It was a voice She had thought perhaps a rattle in the pipes or maybe just her imagination some holdover from those movies Alternate waves of coldness and warmth swept her She had taken the rubber band out of her hair which lay spread across her shoulders in a bright cascade She could feel the roots trying to stiffen Unaware that she meant to speak she bent over the basin again and halfwhispered Hello Is someone there The voice from the drain had been that of a very young child who had perhaps just learned to talk And in spite of the gooseflesh on her arms her mind searched for some rational explanation It was an apartment house The Marshes lived in the back apartment on the ground floor There were four other apartments Maybe there was a kid in the building amusing himself by calling into the drain And some trick of sound Is someone there she asked the drain in the bathroom louder this time It suddenly occurred to her that if her father happened to come in just now he would think her crazy There was no answer from the drain but that unpleasant smell seemed stronger It made her think of the bamboo patch in the Barrens and the dump beyond it it called up images of slow bitter smokes and black mud that wanted to suck the shoes off your feet There were no really little kids in the building that was the thing The Tremonts had had a boy who was five and girls who were three and six months but Mr Tremont had lost his job at the shoe shop on Tracker Avenue they got behind on the rent and one day not long before school let out they had all just disappeared in Mr Tremonts rusty old PowerFlite Buick There was Skipper Bolton in the front apartment on the second floor but Skipper was fourteen Her hand went to her mouth and her eyes widened in horror For a moment just for a moment she believed she had seen something moving down there She was suddenly aware that her hair was now hanging over her shoulders in two thick sheaves and that they dangled closevery closeto that drainhole Some clear instinct made her straighten up quick and get her hair away from there She looked around The bathroom door was firmly closed She could hear the TV faintly Cheyenne Bodie warning the bad guy to put the gun down before someone got hurt She was alone Except of course for that voice Who are you she called into the basin pitching her voice low Matthew Clements the voice whispered The clown took me down here in the pipes and I died and pretty soon hell come and take you Beverly and Ben Hanscom and Bill Denbrough and Eddie Her hands flew to her cheeks and clutched them Her eyes widened widened widened She felt her body growing cold Now the voice sounded choked and ancient and still it crawled with corrupted glee Youll float down here with your friends Beverly we all float down here tell Bill that Georgie says hello tell Bill that Georgie misses him but hell see him soon tell him Georgie will be in the closet some night with a piece of piano wire to stick in his eye tell him The voice broke up in a series of choking hiccups and suddenly a bright red bubble backed up the drain and popped spraying beads of blood on the distained porcelain The choking voice spoke rapidly now and as it spoke it changed now it was the young voice of the child that she had first heard now it was a teenaged girls voice nowhorriblyit became the voice of a girl Beverly had known Veronica Grogan But Veronica was dead she had been found dead in a sewerdrain Im Matthew Im Betty Im Veronica were down here down here with the clown and the creature and the mummy and the werewolf and you Beverly were down here with you and we float we change A gout of blood suddenly belched from the drain splattering the sink and the mirror and the wallpaper with its frogsandlilypads pattern Beverly screamed suddenly and piercingly She backed away from the sink struck the door rebounded clawed it open and ran for the living room where her father was just getting to his feet What the Sam Hills wrong with you he asked his brows drawing together The two of them were here alone this evening Bevs mom was working the threetoeleven shift at Greens Farm Derrys best restaurant The bathroom she cried hysterically The bathroom Daddy in the bathroom Was someone peekin at you Beverly Huh His arm shot out and his hand gripped her arm hard sinking into the flesh There was concern on his face but it was a predatory concern somehow more frightening than comforting No the sink in the sink the the She burst into hysterical tears before she could say anything more Her heart was thundering so hard in her chest that she thought it would choke her Al Marsh thrust her aside with an OJesusChristwhatnext expression on his face and went into the bathroom He was in there so long that Beverly became afraid again There was no question of not going If the two of them had been standing on the edge of a high cliff and he had told her to step offright now girlher instinctive obedience would almost certainly have carried her over the edge before her rational mind could have intervened The bathroom door was open There her father stood a big man who was now losing the redauburn hair he had passed on to Beverly He was still wearing his gray fatigue pants and his gray shirt he was a janitor at the Derry Home Hospital and he was looking hard at Beverly He did not drink he did not smoke he did not chase after women I got all the women I need at home he said on occasion and when he said it a peculiar secretive smile would cross his faceit did not brighten it but did quite the opposite Watching that smile was like watching the shadow of a cloud travel rapidly across a rocky field They take care of me and when they need it I take care of them Now just what the Sam Hill is this foolishness all about he asked as she came in Beverly felt as if her throat had been lined with slate Her heart raced in her chest She thought that she might vomit soon There was blood on the mirror running in long drips There were spots of blood on the light over the sink she could smell it cooking onto the watt bulb Blood ran down the porcelain sides of the sink and plopped in fat drops on the linoleum floor He turned disgusted with her as he was so often and began casually to wash his hands in the bloody sink Good God girl Speak up You scared hell out of me Explain yourself for Lords sake He was washing his hands in the basin she could see blood staining the gray fabric of his pants where they rubbed against the lip of the sink and if his forehead touched the mirror it was close it would be on his skin She made a choked noise in her throat He turned off the water grabbed a towel on which two fans of blood from the drain had splashed and began to dry his hands She watched near swooning as he grimed blood into his big knuckles and the lines of his palms She could see blood under his fingernails like marks of guilt Well Im waiting He tossed the bloody towel back over the rod There was blood blood everywhere and her father didnt see it Daddy She had no idea what might have come next but her father interrupted her I worry about you Al Marsh said I dont think youre ever going to grow up Beverly You go out running around you dont do hardly any of the housework around here you cant cook you cant sew Half the time youre off on a cloud someplace with your nose stuck in a book and the other half youve got vapors and megrims I worry His hand suddenly swung and spatted painfully against her buttocks She uttered a cry her eyes fixed on his There was a tiny stipple of blood caught in his bushy right eyebrow If I look at that long enough Ill just go crazy and none of this will matter she thought dimly I worry a lot he said and hit her again harder on the arm above the elbow That arm cried out and then seemed to go to sleep She would have a spreading yellowishpurple bruise there the next day An awful lot he said and punched her in the stomach He pulled the punch at the last second and Beverly lost only half of her air She doubled over gasping tears starting in her eyes Her father looked at her impassively He shoved his bloody hands in the pockets of his trousers You got to grow up Beverly he said and now his voice was kind and forgiving Isnt that so She nodded Her head throbbed She cried but silently If she sobbed aloudstarted what her father called that baby whining he might go to work on her in earnest Al Marsh had lived his entire life in Derry and told people who asked and sometimes those who did not that he intended to be buried herehopefully at the age of one hundred and ten No reason why I shouldnt live forever he sometimes told Roger Aurlette who cut his hair once each month I have no vices There was She swallowed and it hurt because there was no moisture in her throat none at all There was a spider A big fat black spider It it crawled out of the drain and I I guess it crawled back down Oh He smiled a little at her now as if pleased by this explanation Was that it Damn If youd told me Beverly I never would have hit you All girls are scared of spiders Sam Hill Why didnt you speak up He bent over the drain and she had to bite her lip to keep from crying out a warning and some other voice spoke deep inside her some terrible voice which could not have been a part of her surely it was the voice of the devil himself Let it get him if it wants him Let it pull him down Goodfuckingriddance She turned away from that voice in horror To allow such a thought to stay for even a moment in her head would surely damn her to hell He peered into the eye of the drain His hands squelched in the blood on the rim of the basin Beverly fought grimly with her gorge Her belly ached where her dad had hit her Dont see a thing he said All these buildings are old Bev Got drains the size of freeways you know it When I was janitorin down in the old high school we used to get drowned rats in the toilet bowls once in awhile It drove the girls crazy He laughed fondly at the thought of such female vapors and megrims Mostly when the Kenduskeag was high Less wildlife in the pipes since they put in the new drain system though Look You go to bed and dont think about it anymore Okay She felt her love for him I never hit you when you didnt deserve it Beverly he told her once when she had cried out that some punishment had been unfair And surely that had to be true because he was capable of love Sometimes he would spend a whole day with her showing her how to do things or just telling her stuff or walking around town with her and when he was kind like that she thought her heart would swell with happiness until it killed her She loved him and tried to understand that he had to correct her often because it was as he said his Godgiven job Daughters Al Marsh said need more correction than sons He had no sons and she felt vaguely as if that might be partly her fault as well They walked into her small bedroom together Her right arm now ached fiercely from the blow it had taken She looked back over her shoulder and saw the bloody sink bloody mirror bloody wall bloody floor The bloody towel her father had used and then hung casually over the rod She thought How can I ever go in there to wash up again Please God dear God Im sorry if I had a bad thought about my dad and You can punish me for it if You want I deserve to be punished make me fall down and hurt myself or make me have the flu like last winter when I coughed so hard once I threw up but please God make the blood be gone in the morning pretty please God okay Okay Her father tucked her in as he always did and kissed her forehead Then he only stood there for a moment in what she would always think of as his way of standing perhaps of being bent slightly forward hands plunged deep to above the wristin his pockets the bright blue eyes in his mournful bassethounds face looking down at her from above In later years long after she stopped thinking about Derry at all she would see a man sitting on the bus or maybe standing on a comer with his dinnerbucket in his hand shapes oh shapes of men sometimes seen as day closed down sometimes seen across Watertower Square in the noonlight of a clear windy autumn day shapes of men rules of men desires of men or Tom so like her father when he took off his shirt and stood slightly slumped in front of the bathroom mirror to shave Shapes of men Sometimes I worry about you Bev he said but there was no trouble or anger in his voice now He touched her hair gently smoothing it back from her forehead The bathroom is full of blood Daddy she almost screamed then Didnt you see it Its everywhere Cooking onto the light over the sink even Didnt you SEE it But she kept her silence as he went out and closed the door behind him filling her room with darkness She was still awake still staring into the darkness when her mother came in at eleventhirty and the TV went off She heard her parents go into their room and she heard the bedsprings creaking steadily as they did their sexact thing Beverly had overheard Greta Bowie telling Sally Mueller that the sexact thing hurt like fire and no nice girl ever wanted to do it At the end of it the man pees all over your bug Greta said and Sally had cried Oh yuck Id never let a boy do that to me If it hurt as badly as Greta said then Bevs mother kept the hurt to herself Bev had heard her mom cry out once or twice in a low voice but it hadnt sounded at all like a paincry The slow creak of the springs speeded up to a beat so rapid it was just short of frantic and then stopped There was a period of silence then some low talk then the sound of her mothers footsteps as she went into the bathroom Beverly held her breath waiting for her mother to scream or not There was no screamonly the sound of water running into the basin That was followed by some low splashing Then the water ran out of the basin with its familiar gurgling sound Her mother was brushing her teeth now Moments later the bedsprings in her parents room creaked again as her mom got back into bed Five minutes or so after that her father began to snore A black fear stole over her heart and closed her throat She found herself afraid to turn over on her right sideher favorite sleeping positionbecause she might see something looking in the window at her So she just lay on her back stiff as a poker looking up at the pressedtin ceiling Some time laterminutes or hours there was no way of tellingshe fell into a thin troubled sleep Beverly always woke up when the alarm went off in her parents bedroom You had to be fast because the alarm no more than got started before her father banged it off She dressed quickly while her father used the bathroom She paused as she now almost always did to look at her chest in the mirror trying to decide if her breasts had gotten any bigger in the night She had started getting them late last year There had been some faint pain at first but that was gone now They were extremely smallnot much more than spring apples reallybut they were there It was true childhood would end she would be a woman She smiled at her reflection and put a hand behind her head pushing her hair up and sticking her chest out She giggled a little girls unaffected giggle and suddenly remembered the blood spewing out of the bathroom drain the night before The giggles stopped abruptly She looked at her arm and saw the bruise that had formed there in the nightan ugly stain between her shoulder and elbow a stain with many discolored fingers Moving quickly not wanting him to be mad with her this morning not wanting him to even notice her this morning Beverly pulled on a pair of jeans and her Derry High School sweatshirt And then because it could no longer be put off she left her room for the bathroom Her father passed her in the living room on his way back to his room to get dressed His blue pyjama suit flapped loosely around him He grunted something at her she didnt understand She stood in front of the closed bathroom door for a moment trying to get her mind ready for what she might see inside At least its daytime she thought and that brought some comfort Not much but some She grasped the doorknob turned it and stepped inside That was a busy morning for Beverly She got her father his breakfastorange juice scrambled eggs Al Marshs version of toast the bread hot but not really toasted at all He sat at the table barricaded behind the News and ate it all The paper rustled then dropped His blue stare fell on her like weight He looked at her a moment longer Then the paper went back up and Beverly hurried to the refrigerator to get the meat She cooked him a hamburger mashing the little bit of ground meat that was left in the icebox as hard as she could to make it look bigger He ate it reading the Sports page and Beverly made his luncha couple of peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches a big piece of cake her mother had brought back from Greens Farm last night a Thermos of hot coffee heavily laced with sugar You tell your mother I said to get this place cleaned up today he said taking his dinnerbucket It looks like a damn old pigsty Sam Hill I spend the whole day cleaning up messes over to the hospital I dont need to come home to a pigsty You mind me Beverly He kissed her cheek gave her a rough hug and left As she always did Beverly went to the window of her room and watched him walk down the street And as she always did she felt a sneaking sense of relief when he turned the corner and hated herself for it She did the dishes and then took the book she was reading out on the back steps for awhile Lars Theramenius his long blonde hair glowing with its own serene inner light toddled over from the next building to show Beverly his new Tonka truck and the new scrapes on his knees Beverly exclaimed over both Then her mother was calling her They changed both beds washed the floors and waxed the kitchen linoleum Her mother did the bathroom floor for which Beverly was profoundly grateful Elfrida Marsh was a small woman with graying hair and a grim look Her lined face told the world that she had been around for awhile and intended to stay around awhile longer It also told the world that none of it had been easy and she did not look for an early change in that state of affairs Will you do the livingroom windows Bevvie she asked coming back into the kitchen She had changed into her waitress uniform I have to go up to Saint Joes in Bangor to see Cheryl Tarrent She broke her leg last night Yeah Ill do them Beverly said What happened to Mrs Tarrent Did she fall down or something Cheryl Tarrent was a woman Elfrida worked with at the restaurant She and that nogood shes married to were in a car wreck Beverlys mother said grimly He was drinking You want to thank God in your prayers every night that your father doesnt drink Bevvie Shes going to lose her job I guess and he cant hold one Now tones of grim horror crept into Elfridas voice Theyll have to go on the county I guess It was the worst thing Elfrida Marsh could think of Losing a child or finding out you had cancer didnt hold a candle to it You could be poor you could spend your life doing what she called scratchin But at the bottom of everything below even the gutter was a time when you might have to go on the county and drink the worksweat from the brows of others as a gift This she knew was the prospect that now faced Cheryl Tarrent Once you got the windows washed and take the trash out you can go and play awhile if you want Its your fathers bowling night so you wont have to fix his supper but I want you in before dark You know why My God youre growing up fast Elfrida said She looked for a moment at the nubs in Beverlys sweatshirt Her glance was loving but pitiless I dont know what Im going to do around here once youre married and have a place of your own Ill be around for just about ever Beverly said smiling Her mother hugged her briefly and kissed the corner of her mouth with her warm dry lips I know better she said But I love you Bevvie You make sure there arent any streaks on those windows when youre done she said picking up her purse and going to the door If there are youll catch the blue devil from your father Ill be careful As her mother opened the door to go out Beverly asked in a tone she hoped was casual did you see anything funny in the bathroom Mom Well I saw a spider in there last night It crawled out of the drain Didnt Daddy tell you Did you get your dad angry at you last night Bevvie No Huhuh I told him a spider crawled out of the drain and scared me and he said sometimes they used to find drowned rats in the toilets at the old high school Because of the drains He didnt tell you about the spider I saw Oh Well it doesnt matter I just wondered if you saw it I didnt see any spider I wish we could afford a little new linoleum for that bathroom floor She glanced at the sky which was blue and cloudless They say if you kill a spider it brings rain You didnt kill it did you Her mother looked back at her her lips pressed together so tightly they almost werent there You sure your dad wasnt angry with you last night What Beverly looked at her mother totally perplexed God her father touched her every day I dont get what you Never mind Elfrida said shortly dont forget the trash And if those windows are streaked you wont need your father to give you blue devil Elfrida left Beverly went into her room again and watched her around the corner and out of view as she had her father Then when she was sure her mother was well on her way to the bus stop Beverly got the floorbucket the Windex and some rags from under the sink She went into the living room and began on the windows The apartment seemed too quiet Each time the floor creaked or a door slammed she jumped a little When the Boltons toilet flushed above her she uttered a gasp that was nearly a scream At last she walked down there and drew it open again and looked inside Her mother had cleaned in here this morning and most of the blood which had pooled under the sink was gone So was the blood on the sinks rim But there were still maroon streaks drying in the sink itself spots and splashes of it on the mirror and on the wallpaper Beverly looked at her pale reflection and realized with sudden superstitious dread that the blood on the mirror made it seem as if her face was bleeding She thought again What am I going to do about this Have I gone crazy Am I imagining it Beverly screamed and slammed the door and five minutes later her hands were still trembling so badly that she almost dropped the bottle of Windex as she washed the windows in the living room It was around three oclock that afternoon the apartment locked up and the extra key tucked snugly away in the pocket of her jeans when Beverly Marsh happened to turn up Richards Alley a narrow walkthrough which connected Main and Center Streets and came upon Ben Hanscom Eddie Kaspbrak and a boy named Bradley Donovan pitching pennies Hi Bev Eddie said You get any nightmares from those movies Nope Beverly said squatting down to watch the game Howd you know about that Haystack told me Eddie said jerking a thumb at Ben who was blushing wildly for no good reason Beverly could see What movieth Bradley asked and now Beverly recognized him he had come down to the Barrens a week ago with Bill Denbrough They had a speech class together in Bangor Beverly more or less dismissed him from her mind If asked she might have said he seemed somehow less important than Ben and Eddieless there Couple of creature features she said to him and duckwalked closer until she was between Ben and Eddie You pitchin Yes Ben said He looked at her quickly then looked away She looked at Eddie who polished his nails solemnly on the front of his shirt and then giggled Jeez how do you dare to go out of the house with such a wad Eddie asked Id be scared Girls can be brave too Beverly said gravely and a moment later they were all laughing Bradley pitched first then Ben then Beverly Because he was winning Eddie had lasties They tossed the pennies toward the back wall of the Center Street Drug Store Sometimes they landed short sometimes they struck and bounced back At the end of each round the shooter with the penny closest to the wall collected all four pennies Five minutes later Beverly had twentyfour cents She had lost only a single round Girlth cheat Bradley said disgusted and got up to go His good humor was gone and he looked at Beverly with both anger and humiliation Girlth thouldnt be allowed to Ben bounced to his feet It was awesome to watch Ben Hanscom bounce Bradley looked from Ben to Eddie to Beverly who was still on her knees Then he looked back at Ben again You want a fat lip to math the reth of you athhole Sure Ben said and a grin suddenly crossed his face Something in its quality caused Bradley to take a surprised uneasy step backward Perhaps what he saw in that grin was the simple fact that after tangling with Henry Bowers and coming out ahead not once but twice Ben Hanscom was not about to be terrorized by skinny old Bradley Donovan who had warts all over his hands as well as that cataclysmic lisp Yeah and then you all gang up on me Bradley said taking another step backward His voice had picked up an uncertain waver and tears stood out in his eyes All a bunth of cheaterth You just take back what you said about her Ben said Never mind Ben Beverly said She held out a handful of coppers to Bradley Take whats yours I wasnt playing for keepsies anyway Tears of humiliation spilled over Bradleys lower lashes He struck the pennies from Beverlys hand and ran for the Center Street end of Richards Alley The others stood looking at him openmouthed With safety within reach Bradley turned around and shouted Youre jutht a little bith thatth all Cheater Cheater Your motherth a whorel Beverly gasped Ben ran up the alley toward Bradley and succeeded in doing no more than tripping over an empty crate and falling down Bradley was gone and Ben knew better than to believe he could ever catch him He turned toward Beverly instead to see if she was all right That word had shocked him as much as it had her She saw the concern in his face She opened her mouth to say she was okay not to worry sticksandstoneswillbreakmybonesbutnameswillneverhurtme and that odd question her mother had asked recurred Odd question yessimple yet nonsensical full of somehow ominous undertones murky as old coffee Instead of saying that names would never hurt her she burst into tears Eddie looked at her uncomfortably took his aspirator from his pants pocket and sucked on it Then he bent down and began picking up the scattered pennies There was a fussy careful expression on his face as he did this Ben moved toward her instinctively wanting to hug and give comfort and then stopped She was too pretty In the face of that prettiness he felt helpless Cheer up he said knowing it must sound idiotic but unable to think of anything more useful He touched her shoulders lightly she had put her hands over her face to hide her wet eyes and blotchy cheeks and then took them away as if she were too hot to touch He was now blushing so hard he looked apoplectic Cheer up Beverly She lowered her hands and cried out in a shrill furious voice My mother is not a whore She shes a waitress This was greeted by absolute silence Ben stared at her with his lower jaw sprung ajar Eddie looked up at her from the cobbled surface of the alley his hands full of pennies And suddenly all three of them were laughing hysterically A waitress Eddie cackled He had only the faintest idea of what a whore was but something about this comparison struck him as delicious just the same Is that what she is Yes Yes she is Beverly gasped laughing and crying at the same time Ben was laughing so hard he couldnt stand up He sat heavily on a trashcan His bulk drove the lid into the can and spilled him into the alley on his side Eddie pointed at him and howled with laughter Beverly helped him to his feet A window went up above them and a woman yelled You kids get out of there Theres people that have to work the night shift you know Get lost Without thinking the three of them linked hands Beverly in the middle and ran for Center Street They were still laughing They pooled their money and discovered they had forty cents enough for two icecream frappes from the drugstore Because old Mr Keene was a grouch and wouldnt let kids under twelve eat their stuff at the soda fountain he claimed the pinball machines in the back room might corrupt them they took the frappes in two huge waxed containers up to Bassey Park and sat on the grass to drink them Ben had coffee Eddie strawberry Beverly sat between the two boys with a straw sampling each in turn like a bee at flowers She felt okay again for the first time since the drain had coughed up its gout of blood the night beforewashed out and emotionally exhausted but okay at peace with herself For the time being anyway I just dont get what was wrong with Bradley Eddie said at lastit had the tone of awkward apology He never acted like that before You stood up for me Beverly said and suddenly kissed Ben on one cheek Thank you Ben went scarlet again You werent cheating he mumbled and abruptly gulped down half of his coffee frappe in three monster swallows This was followed by a burp as loud as a shotgun blast Get any on you Daddyo Eddie asked and Beverly laughed helplessly holding her stomach Ben was smiling That night before sleep he would play the moment when she had kissed him over and over again in his mind She nodded It wasnt him It really wasnt even what he said about my mother It was something that happened last night She hesitated looking from Ben to Eddie and back to Ben again I I have to tell somebody Or show somebody Or something I guess I cried because Ive been scared Im going looneytunes It was Stanley Uris As always he looked small slim and preternaturally neatmuch too neat for a kid who was just barely eleven In his white shirt neatly tucked into his fresh jeans all the way around his hair combed the toes of his hightop Keds spotlessly clean he looked instead like the worlds smallest adult Then he smiled and the illusion was broken She wont say whatever she was going to say Eddie thought because he wasnt there when Bradley called her mother that name But after a moments hesitation Beverly did tell Because somehow Stanley was different from Bradleyhe was there in a way Bradley had not been Stanleys one of us Beverly thought and wondered why that should cause her arms to suddenly break out in bumps Im not doing any of them any favors by telling she thought Not them and not me neither But it was too late She was already speaking Stan sat down with them his face still and grave Eddie offered him the last of the strawberry frappe and Stan only shook his head his eyes never leaving Beverlys face None of the boys spoke She told them about the voices About recognizing Ronnie Grogans voice She knew Ronnie was dead but it was her voice all the same She told them about the blood and how her father had not seen it or felt it and how her mother had not seen it this morning When she finished she looked around at their faces afraid of what she might see there but she saw no disbelief Terror but no disbelief They went in by the back door not just because that was the lock Bevs key fitted but because she said her father would kill her if Mrs Bolton saw her going into the apartment with three boys while her folks were gone Eddie started to reply looked again at Stans white strained face and decided to keep his mouth shut The door gave on the kitchen which was full of lateafternoon sun and summer silence The breakfast dishes sparkled in the drainer The four of them stood by the kitchen table bunched up and when a door slammed upstairs they all jumped and then laughed nervously Her heart thudding in her temples Beverly led them down the little hall with her parents bedroom on one side and the closed bathroom door at the end She pulled it open stepped quickly inside and pulled the chain over the sink Then she stepped back between Ben and Eddie again The blood had dried to maroon smears on the mirror and the basin and the wallpaper She looked at the blood because it was suddenly easier to look at that than at them In a small voice she could hardly recognize as her own she asked do you see it Do any of you see it Is it there Ben stepped forward and she was again struck by how delicately he moved for such a fat boy He touched one of the smears of blood then a second then a long drip on the mirror Here Here Here His voice was flat and authoritative Jeepers It looks like somebody killed a pig in here Stan said softly awed It all came out of the drain Eddie asked The sight of the blood made him feel ill His breath was shortening He clutched at his aspirator Beverly had to struggle to keep from bursting into fresh tears She didnt want to do that she was afraid if she did they would dismiss her as just another girl But she had to clutch for the doorknob as relief washed through her in a wave of frightening strength Until that moment she hadnt realized how sure she was that she was going crazy having hallucinations something And your mom and dad never saw it Ben marvelled He touched a splotch of blood which had dried on the basin and then pulled his hand away and wiped it on the tail of his shirt Jeeperscreepers I dont know how I can ever come in here again Beverly said Not to wash up or brush my teeth or you know Well why dont we clean the place up Stanley asked suddenly Sure Maybe we couldnt get all of it off the wallpaperit looks sorta you know on its last legsbut we could get the rest Havent you got some rags Under the kitchen sink Beverly said But my momll wonder where they went if we use them Ive got fifty cents Stan said quietly His eyes never left the blood that had spattered the area of the bathroom around the washbasin Well clean up as good as we can then take the rags down to that coinop laundry place back the way we came Well wash them and dry them and theyll all be back under the sink before your folks get home My mother says you cant get blood out of cloth Eddie objected she says it sets in or something Ben uttered a hysterical little giggle doesnt matter if it comes out of the No one had to ask him who he meant by they For the next half hour the four of them cleaned like grim elves and as the blood disappeared from the walls and the mirror and the porcelain basin Beverly felt her heart grow lighter and lighter Ben and Eddie did the sink and mirror while she scrubbed the floor Stan worked on the wallpaper with studious care using a rag that was almost dry In the end they got almost all of it Ben finished by removing the lightbulb over the sink and replacing it with one from the box of bulbs in the pantry There were plenty Elfrida Marsh had bought a twoyear supply from the Derry Lions during their annual lightbulb sale the fall before They used Elfridas floorbucket her Ajax and plenty of hot water They dumped the water frequently because none of them liked to have their hands in it once it had turned pink At last Stanley backed away looked at the bathroom with the critical eye of a boy in whom neatness and order are not simply ingrained but actually innate and told them Its the best we can do I think There were still faint traces of blood on the wallpaper to the left of the sink where the paper was so thin and ragged that Stanley had dared do no more than blot it gently Yet even here the blood had been sapped of its former ominous strength it was little more than a meaningless pastel smear Thank you Beverly said to all of them She could not remember ever having meant thanks so deeply Thank you all Lets get these rags done Stanley said His face was set almost stern And later Beverly would think that perhaps only Stan realized that they had taken another step toward some unthinkable confrontation They measured out a cup of Mrs Marshs Tide and put it in an empty mayonnaise jar Bev found a paper shopping bag to put the bloody rags in and the four of them went down to the KleenKloze Washateria on the corner of Main and Cony Streets Two blocks farther up they could see the Canal gleaming a bright blue in the afternoon sun The KleenKloze was empty except for a woman in a white nurses uniform who was waiting for her dryer to stop She glanced at the four kids distrustfully and then went back to her paperback of Peyton Place Cold water Ben said in a low voice My mom says you gotta wash blood in cold water They dumped the rags into the washer while Stan changed his two quarters for four dimes and two nickels He came back and watched as Bev dumped the Tide over the rags and swung the washers door closed Then he plugged two dimes into the coinop slot and twisted the start knob Beverly had chipped in most of the pennies she had won at pitch for the frappes but she found four survivors deep down in the lefthand pocket of her jeans She fished them out and offered them to Stan who looked pained Jeez he said I take a girl on a laundry date and right away she wants to go Dutch Im sure Stan said in his dry way I mean its really breaking my heart to give up those four pence Beverly but Im sure The four of them went over to the line of plastic contour chairs against the Washaterias cinderblock wall and sat there not talking The Maytag with the rags in it chugged and sloshed Fans of suds slobbered against the thick glass of its round porthole At first the suds were reddish Looking at them made Bev feel a little sick but she found it was hard to look away The bloody foam had a gruesome sort of fascination The lady in the nurses uniform glanced at them more and more often over the top of her book She had perhaps been afraid they would be rowdy now their very silence seemed to unnerve her When her dryer stopped she took her clothes out folded them put them into a blue plastic laundrybag and left giving them one last puzzled look as she went out the door As soon as she was gone Ben said abruptly almost harshly Youre not alone He stopped and looked at Eddie who nodded He looked at Stan who looked unhappy but who after a moment shrugged and also nodded What in the world are you talking about Beverly asked She was tired of people saying inexplicable things to her today She gripped Bens lower arm If you know something about this tell me Eddie shook his head He took his aspirator out of his pocket and sucked in on it with a monstrous gasp Speaking slowly picking his words Ben told Beverly how he had happened to meet Bill Denbrough and Eddie Kaspbrak in the Barrens on the day school let outthat was almost a week ago as hard as that was to believe He told her about how they had built the dam in the Barrens the following day He told Bills story of how the school photograph of his dead brother had turned its head and winked He told his own story of the mummy who had walked on the icy Canal in the dead heart of winter with balloons that floated against the wind Beverly listened to all this with growing horror She could feel her eyes widening her hands and feet growing cold Ben stopped and looked at Eddie Eddie took another wheezing pull on his aspirator and then told the story of the leper again speaking as rapidly as Ben had slowly his words tumbling over one another in their urgency to escape and be gone He finished with a sucking little halfsob but this time he didnt cry There was sudden silence making them all start the way a sudden explosion might have done They watched him get upsmall economical gracefuland open the washer He pulled out the rags which were stuck together in a clump and examined them Theres a little stain left he said but its not too bad Looks like it could be cranberry juice He showed them and they all nodded gravely as if over important documents Beverly felt a relief that was similar to the relief she had felt when the bathroom was clean again She could stand the faded pastel smear on the peeling wallpaper in there and she could stand the faint reddish stain on her mothers cleaning rags They had done something about it that seemed to be the important thing Maybe it hadnt worked completely but she discovered it had worked well enough to give her heart peace and brother that was good enough for Al Marshs daughter Beverly Stan tossed them into one of the barrelshaped dryers and put in two nickels The dryer started to turn and Stan came back and took his seat between Eddie and Ben For a moment the four of them sat silent again watching the rags turn and fall turn and fall The drone of the gasfired dryer was soothing almost soporific A woman passed by the chockedopen door wheeling a cart of groceries She glanced in at them and passed on I did see something Stan said suddenly I didnt want to talk about it because I wanted to think it was a dream or something Maybe even a fit like that Stavier kid has Any you guys know that kid Ben and Bev shook their heads Eddie said The kid whos got epilepsy Yeah right Thats how bad it was I would have rather thought I had something like that than that I saw something really real What was it Bev asked but she wasnt sure she really wanted to know This was not like listening to ghoststories around a campfire while you ate wieners in toasted buns and cooked marshmallows over the flames until they were black and crinkly Here they sat in this stifling laundromat and she could see great big dust kitties under the washing machines ghostturds her father called them she could see dustmotes dancing in the hot shafts of sunlight which fell through the laundromats dirty plateglass window she could see old magazines with their covers torn off These were all normal things Nice and normal and boring But she was scared Terribly scared Because she sensed none of these things were madeup storks madeup monsters Bens mummy Eddies leper either or both of them might be out tonight when the sun went down Or Bill Denbroughs brother onearmed and implacable cruising through the black drains under the city with silver coins for eyes Yet when Stan did not answer immediately she asked again What was it Speaking carefully Stan said I was over in that little park where the Standpipe is Oh God I dont like that place Eddie said dolefully If theres a haunted house in Derry thats it Dont you know about that place Eddie asked My mom wouldnt let me go near there even before the kids started getting killed She she takes real good care of me He offered them an uneasy grin and held his aspirator tighter in his lap You see some kids have been drowned in there Three or four TheyStan Stan are you all right Stan Uriss face had gone a leaden gray His mouth worked soundlessly His eyes rolled up until the others could only see the bottommost curves of his irises One hand clutched weakly at empty air and then fell against his thigh Eddie did the only thing he could think of He leaned over put one thin arm around Stans slumping shoulders jammed his aspirator into Stans mouth and triggered off a big blast Stan began to cough and choke and gag He sat up straight his eyes back in focus again He coughed into his cupped hands At last he uttered a huge burping gasp and slumped back against his chair They all laughed at this but it was nervous laughter The others were looking nervously at Stan Thin color now burned in his cheeks Yeah but is it kosher Stan said and they all laughed again although none of them including Stan really knew what kosher meant Stan stopped laughing first and looked at Eddie intently Tell me what you know about the Standpipe he said Eddie started but both Ben and Beverly also contributed The Derry Standpipe stood on Kansas Street about a mile and a half west of downtown near the southern edge of the Barrens At one time near the end of the previous century it had supplied all of Derrys water holding one and threequarter million gallons Because the circular openair gallery just below the Standpipes roof offered a spectacular view of the town and the surrounding countryside it had been a popular place until or so Families would come out to tiny Memorial Park on a Saturday or Sunday forenoon when the weather was fine climb the one hundred and sixty stairs inside the Standpipe to the gallery and take in the view More often than not they spread and ate a picnic lunch while they did so The stairs were between the Standpipes outside which was shingled a blinding white and its inner sleeve a great stainlesssteel cylinder standing a hundred and six feet high These stairs wound to the top in a narrow spiral Just below the gallery level a thick wooden door in the Standpipes inner jacket gave on a platform over the water itselfa black gently lapping tarn lit by naked magnesium bulbs screwed into reflective tin hoods The water was exactly one hundred feet deep when the supply was all the way up Bev Eddie and Stan looked at each other None of them knew They were only a bit clearer on that It seemed that in those days olden days Ben called them solemnly as he took up this part of the tale the door leading to the platform over the water had always been left unlocked One night a couple of kids or maybe just one or as many as three had found the groundlevel door also unlocked They had gone up on a dare They found their way out onto the platform over the water instead of onto the gallery by mistake In the darkness they had fallen over the edge before they quite knew where they were I heard it from this kid Vic Crumly who said he heard it from his dad Beverly said so maybe its true Vie said his dad said that once they fell into the water they were as good as dead because there was nothing to hold onto The platform was just out of reach He said they paddled around in there yelling for help all night long probably Only no one heard them and they just got tireder and tireder until She trailed off feeling the horror of it sink into her She could see those boys in her minds eye real or madeup paddling around like drenched puppies Going under coming up sputtering Splashing more and swimming less as panic set in Soggy sneakers treading water Fingers scrabbling uselessly for any kind of purchase on the smooth steel walls of the sleeve She could taste the water they must have swallowed She could hear the flat echoing quality of their cries How long Fifteen minutes Half an hour How long before the cries had ceased and they had simply floated facedown strange fish for the caretaker to find the next morning I heard there was a woman who lost her baby too Eddie said suddenly That was when they closed the place for good At least thats what I heard They did use to let people go up I know that But then one time there was this lady and her baby I dont know how old the baby was But this platform its supposed to go right out over the water And the lady went to the railing and she was you know holding the baby and either she dropped it or maybe it just wriggled I heard this guy tried to save it Doing the hero bit you know He jumped right in but the baby was gone Maybe he was wearing a jacket or something When your clothes get wet they drag you down Eddie abruptly put his hand into his pocket and brought out a small brown glass bottle He opened it took out two white pills and swallowed them dry Aspirin Ive got a headache He looked at her defensively but Beverly said nothing more Ben finished After the incident of the baby he himself he said had heard that it was actually a kid a little gjrl of about three the Town Council had voted to lock the Standpipe both downstairs and up and stop the daytrips and picnics on the gallery It had remained locked from then until now Oh the caretaker came and went and the maintenance men once in awhile and once every season there were guided tours Interested citizens could follow a lady from the Historical Society up the spiral of stairs to the gallery at the top where they could ooh and aah over the view and snap Kodaks to show their friends But the door to the inner sleeve was always locked now I guess so Ben said Ive seen firetrucks filling up there during grassfire season They hook a hose to the pipe at the bottom Stanley was looking at the dryer again watching the rags go around and Mound The clump had broken up now and some of them floated like parachutes For a moment it seemed he would not answer at all Then he drew a deep shuddering breath and said something that at first struck them all as being far from the point They named it Memorial Park after the rd Maine in the Civil War The Derry Blues they were called There used to be a statue but it blew down during a storm in the forties They didnt have money enough to fix the statue so they put in a birdbath instead A big stone birdbath They were all looking at him Stan swallowed There was an audible click in his throat I watch birds you see I have an album a pair of ZeissIkon binoculars and everything He looked at Eddie do you have any more aspirins Eddie handed him the bottle Stan took two hesitated then took another He gave the bottle back and swallowed the pills one after another grimacing Then he went on with his story Stans encounter had happened on a rainy April evening two months ago He had donned his slicker put his birdbook and his binoculars in a waterproof sack with a drawstring at the top and set out for Memorial Park He and his father usually went out together but his father had had to work over that night and had called specially at suppertime to talk to Stan One of his customers at the agency another birdwatcher had spotted what he believed to be a male cardinalFringillidae Richmondenadrinking from the birdbath in Memorial Park he told Stan They liked to eat drink and bathe right around dusk It was very rare to spot a cardinal this far north of Massachusetts Would Stan like to go down there and see if he could collect it He knew the weather was pretty foul but Stan had been agreeable His mother made him promise to keep the hood of his slicker up but Stan would have done that anyway He was a fastidious boy There were never any fights about getting him to wear his rubbers or his snowpants in the winter He walked the mile and a half to Memorial Park in a ram so fine and hesitant that it really wasnt even a drizzle it was more like a constant hanging mist The air was muted but somehow exciting just the same In spite of the last dwindling piles of snow under bushes and in groves of trees to Stan they looked like piles of dirty castoff pillowcases there was a smell of new growth in the air Looking at the branches of elms and maples and oaks against the leadwhite sky Stan thought that their silhouettes looked mysteriously thicker They would burst open in a week or two unrolling leaves of a delicate almost transparent green The air smells green tonight he thought and smiled a little He walked quickly because the light would be gone in an hour or even less He was as fastidious about his sightings as he was about his dress and study habits and unless there was enough light left for him to be absolutely sure he would not allow himself to collect the cardinal even if he knew in his heart he had really seen it He cut across Memorial Park on a diagonal The Standpipe was a white bulking shape to his left Stan barely glanced at it He had no interest whatsoever in the Standpipe Memorial Park was a rough rectangle which sloped downhill The grass white and dead at this time of year was kept neatly cut in the summertime and there were circular beds of flowers There was no playground equipment however This was considered a grownups park At the far end the grade smoothed out before dropping abruptly down to Kansas Street and the Barrens beyond The birdbath his father had mentioned stood on this flat area It was a shallow stone dish set into a squat masonry pedestal that was really much too big for the humble function it fulfilled Stans father had told him that before the money ran out they had intended to put the statue of the soldier back up here again Mr Uris ruffled his hair Me too son he said More baths and less bullets thats my motto At the top of this pedestal a motto had been carved in the stone Stanley read it but did not understand it the only Latin he understood was the genus classifications of the birds in his book Stan sat down on a bench took his birdalbum out of the bag and turned over to the picture of the cardinal one more time going over it familiarizing himself with the recognizable points A male cardinal would be hard to mistake for something elseit was as red as a fireengine if not so largebut Stan was a creature of habit and convention these things comforted him and reinforced his sense of place and belonging in the world So he gave the picture a good threeminute study before closing the book the moisture in the air was making the corners of the pages turn up and putting it back into the bag He uncased his binoculars and put them to his eyes There was no need to adjust the field of focus because the last time he had used the glasses he had been sitting on this same bench and looking at that same birdbath Fastidious boy patient boy He did not fidget He did not get up and walk around or swing the binoculars here and there to see what else there might be to be seen He sat still field glasses trained on the birdbath and the mist collected in fat drops on his yellow slicker He was not bored He was looking down into the equivalent of an avian conventionsite Four brown sparrows sat there for awhile dipping into the water with their beaks flicking droplets casually back over their shoulders and onto their backs Then a bluejay came hauling in like a cop breaking up a gaggle of loiterers The jay was as big as a house in Stans glasses his quarrelsome cries absurdly thin by comparison after you looked through the binoculars steadily for awhile the magnified birds you saw began to seem not odd but perfectly correct The sparrows flew off The jay now in charge strutted bathed grew bored departed The sparrows returned then flew off again as a pair of robins cruised in to bathe and perhaps to discuss matters of importance to the hollowboned set Stans father had laughed at Stans hesitant suggestion that maybe birds talked and he was sure his dad was right when he said birds werent smart enough to talkthat their brainpans were too smallbut by gosh they sure looked like they were talking A new bird joined them It was red Stan hastily adjusted the field of focus on the binoculars a bit Was it No It was a scarlet tanager a good bird but not the cardinal he was looking for It was joined by a flicker that was a frequent visitor to the Memorial Park birdbath Stan recognized him by the tattered right wing As always he speculated on how that might have happeneda close call with some cat seemed the most likely explanation Other birds came and went Stan saw a grackle as clumsy and ugly as a flying boxcar a bluebird another flicker He was finally rewarded by a new birdnot the cardinal but a cowbird that looked vast and stupid in the eyepieces of the binoculars He dropped them against his chest and fumbled the birdbook out of the bag again hoping that the cowbird wouldnt fly away before he could confirm the sighting He would have something to take home to his father at least And it was time to go The light was fading fast He felt cold and damp He checked the book then looked through the glasses again It was still there not bathing but only standing on the rim of the birdbath looking dumb It was almost surely a cowbird With no distinctive markingsat least none he could pick up at this distanceand in the fading light it was hard to be one hundred percent sure but maybe he had just enough time and light for one more check He looked at the picture in the book studying it with a fierce frown of concentration and then picked up the glasses again He had only fixed them on the birdbath when a hollow rolling boom sent the cowbirdif it had been a cowbirdwinging Stan tried to follow it with the glasses knowing how slim his chances were of picking it up again He lost it and made a hissing sound of disgust between his teeth Well if it had come once it would perhaps come again And it had only been a cowbird Stan recased his binoculars and put away his birdalbum Then he got up and looked around to see if he could tell what had been responsible for that sudden loud noise It hadnt sounded like a gun or a car backfire More like a door being thrown open in a spooky movie about castles and dungeons complete with hokey echo effects He got up and started toward the slope down to Kansas Street The Standpipe was now on his right a chalky white cylinder phantomlike in the mist and the growing darkness It seemed almost to to float That was an odd thought He supposed it must have come from his own headwhere else could a thought come frombut it somehow did not seem like his own thought at all He looked at the Standpipe more closely and then veered in that direction without even thinking about it Windows circled the building at intervals rising around it in a spiral that made Stan think of the barber pole in front of Mr Aurlettes shop where he and his dad got their haircuts The bonewhite shingles bulged out over each of those dark windows like brows over eyes Wonder how they did that Stan thoughtnot with as much interest as Ben Hanscom would have felt but with someand that was when he saw there was a much larger space of darkness at the foot of the Standpipea clear oblong in the circular base He stopped frowning thinking that was a funny place for a window it was completely out of symmetry with the others Then he realized it wasnt a window It was a door The noise I heard he thought It was that door blowing open He looked around Early gloomy dusk White sky now fading to a dull dusky purple mist thickening a bit more toward the steady rain which would fall most of the night Dusk and mist and no wind at all So if it hadnt blown open had someone pushed it open Why And it looked like an awfully heavy door to slam open hard enough to make a noise like that boom He supposed a very big person maybe The door was bigger than he had first supposedsix feet high and two feet thick the boards which composed it bound with brass strips Stan swung it halfclosed It moved smoothly and easily on its hinges in spite of its size It also moved silentlythere was not a single squeak He had moved it to see how much damage it had done to the shingles blasting open like that There was no damage at all not so much as a single mark Weirdsville as Richie would say Well it wasnt the door you heard thats all he thought Maybe a jet from Loring boomed over Derry or something Door was probably open all al His foot struck something Stan looked down and saw it was a padlock correction It was the remains of a padlock It had been burst wide open It looked in fact as if someone had rammed the Locks keyway full of gunpowder and then set a match to it Flowers of metal deadly sharp stood out from the body of the lock in a stiff spray Stan could see the layers of steel inside The thick hasp hung askew by one bolt which had been yanked threeuarters of the way out of the wood The other three haspbolts lay on the wet grass They had been twisted like pretzels Narrow stairs led upward circling around and out of sight The outer wall of the staircase was bare wood supported by giant crossbeams which had been pegged together rather than nailed To Stan some of the pegs looked thicker than his own upper arm The inner wall was steel from which gigantic rivets swelled like boils He hesitated then stepped inside so he could see up the narrow throat of the staircase a little better Nothing And it was Creep City in here As Richie would also say He turned to leave and heard music He cocked his head listening the frown on his face starting to dissolve a little Calliope music all right the music of carnivals and county fairs It conjured up trace memories which were as delightful as they were ephemeral popcorn cotton candy doughboys frying in hot grease the chaindriven clatter of rides like the Wild Mouse the Whip the KoasterKups Now the frown had become a tentative grin Stan went up one step then two more head still cocked He paused again As if thinking about carnivals could actually create one he could now actually smell the popcorn the cotton candy the doughboys and more Peppers chilidogs cigarette smoke and sawdust There was the sharp smell of white vinegar the kind you could shake over your french fries through a hole in the tin cap He could smell mustard bright yellow and stinging hot that you spread on your hotdog with a wooden paddle He took another step up and that was when he heard the rustling eager footsteps above him descending the stairs He cocked his head again The calliope music had gotten suddenly louder as if to mask the sound of the footsteps He could recognize the tune nowit was Camptown Races Footsteps yeah but they werent exactly rustling footsteps were they They actually sounded kind of squishy didnt they The sound was like people walking in rubbers full of water The terror leaped down Stans throat all at onceit was like swallowing something hot and horrible bad medicine that suddenly galvanized you like electricity It was the shadows that did it He saw them only for a moment He had just that small bit of time to observe that there were two of them that they were slumped and somehow unnatural He had only that moment because the light in here was fading fading too fast and as he turned the heavy Standpipe door swung ponderously shut behind him Stanley ran back down the stairs somehow he had climbed more than a dozen although he could only remember climbing two three at most very much afraid now It was too dark in here to see anything He could hear his own breathing he could hear die calliope tootling away somewhere above him whats a calliope doing up there in the dark whos playing it and he could hear those wet footsteps Approaching him now Getting closer He hit the door with his hands splayed out in front of him hit it hard enough to send sparkly tingles of pain all the way up to his elbows It had swung so easily before and now it would not move at all No that was not quite true At first it had moved just a bit just enough for him to see a mocking strip of gray light running vertically down its left side Then gone again As if someone was on the other side of it holding the door closed Panting terrified Stan pushed against the door with all of his strength He could feel the brass bindings digging into his hands Nothing He whirled around now pressing his back and his splayed hands against the door He could feel sweat oily and hot running down his forehead The calliope music had gotten louder yet It drifted and echoed down the spiral staircase There was nothing cheery about it now It had changed It had become a dirge It screamed like wind and water and in his minds eye Stan saw a county fair at the end of autumn wind and rain blowing up a deserted midway pennons flapping tents bulging falling over wheeling away like canvas bats He saw empty rides standing against the sky like scaffolds the wind drummed and hooted in the weird angles of their struts He suddenly understood that death was in this place with him that death was coming for him out of the dark and he could not run A sudden rush of water spilled down the stairs Now it was not popcorn and doughboys and cotton candy he smelled but wet decay the stench of dead pork which has exploded in a fury of maggots in a place hidden away from the sun He was answered by a low bubbling voice that seemed choked with mud and old water The dead ones Stanley Were the dead ones We sank but now we float and youll float too He could feel water washing around his feet He cringed back against the door in an agony of fear They were very close now He could feel their nearness He could smell them Something was digging into his hip as he struck the door again and again in a mindless useless effort to get away Were dead but sometimes we clown around a little Stanley Sometimes we Without thinking Stan grabbed for it It was stuck in his slicker pocket and wouldnt come out One of them was down now he could hear it shuffling across the little stone areaway where he had come in It would reach for him in a moment and he would feel its cold flesh He gave one more tremendous yank and the birdbook was in his hands He held it in front of him like a puny shield not thinking of what he was doing but suddenly sure that this was right Robins he screamed into the darkness and for a moment the thing approaching it was surely less than five steps away now hesitatedhe was almost sure it did And for a moment hadnt he felt some give in the door against which he was now cringing But he wasnt cringing anymore He was standing up straight in the darkness When had that happened No time to wonder Stan licked his dry lips and began to chant Robins Gray egrets Loons Scarlet tanagers Crackles Hammerhead woodpeckers Redheaded woodpeckers Chickadees Wrens Peli The door opened with a protesting scream and Stan took a giant step backward into thin misty air He fell sprawling on the dead grass He had bent the birdbook nearly in half and later that night he would see the clear impressions of his fingers sunken into its cover as if it had been bound in PlayDoh instead of hard pressboard He didnt try to get up but began to dig in with his heels instead his butt grooving through the slick grass His lips were pulled back over his teeth Inside that dim oblong he could see two sets of legs below the diagonal shadowline thrown by the door which now stood halfopen He could see jeans that had decayed to a purplishblack Orange threads lay plastered limply against the seams and water dripped from the cuffs to puddle around shoes that had mostly rotted away revealing swelled purple toes within Their hands lay limply at their sides too long too waxywhite Depending from each finger was a small orange pompom Holding his bent birdbook in front of him his face wet with drizzle sweat and tears Stan whispered in a husky monotone Chickenhawks grosbeaks hummingbirds albatrosses kiwis One of those hands turned over showing a palm from which endless water had eroded all the lines leaving something as idiotsmooth as the hand of a departmentstore dummy One finger unrolled then rolled up again The pompom bounced and Stan Uris who would die in a bathtub with crosses slashed into his forearms twentyseven years later got to his knees then to his feet then ran He ran across Kansas Street without looking either way for traffic and paused panting on the far sidewalk to look back From this angle he couldnt see the door in the base of the Standpipe only the Standpipe itself thick and yet somehow graceful standing in the murk They were dead Stan whispered to himself shocked He wheeled suddenly and ran for home The three others only looked at him for a long moment His skin was nearly as gray as the April evening of which he had just told them Wow Ben said at last He let out his breath in a ragged whistling sigh Its true Stan said in a low voice I swear to God it is I believeyou Beverly said After what happened at my house Id believe anything She got up suddenly almost knocking over her chair and went to the dryer She began to pull out the rags one by one folding them Her back was turned but Ben suspected she was crying He wanted to go to her and lacked the courage We gotta talk to Bill about this Eddie said Bill will know what to do Do Stan said turning to look at him What do you mean do I dont want to do anything Stan said He was looking at Eddie with such a hard fierce stare that Eddie squirmed in his chair I want to forget about it Thats all I want to do Not that easy Beverly said quietly turning around Ben had been right the hot sunlight slanting in through the Washaterias dirty windows reflected off bright lines of tears on her cheeks Its not just us I heard Ronnie Grogan And the little boy I heard first I think maybe it was that little Clements kid The one who disappeared off his trike So what if it gets more she asked What if it gets more kids His eyes a hot brown locked with her blue ones answering the question without speaking So what if it does But Beverly did not look down or away and at last Stan dropped his own eyes perhaps only because she was still crying but perhaps because her concern somehow made her stronger Eddies right she said We ought to talk to Bill Then maybe to the Police Chief Right Stan said If he was trying to sound contemptuous it didnt work His voice came out sounding only tired dead kids in the Standpipe Blood that only kids can see not grownups Clowns walking on the Canal Balloons that blow against the wind Mummies Lepers under porches Chief Bortonll laugh his bum off and then stick us in the loonybin If we all went to him Ben said troubled If we all went together Sure Stan said Right Tell me more Haystack Write me a book He got up and went to the window hands in pockets looking angry and upset and scared He stared out for a moment shoulders stiff and rejecting beneath his neat shirt Without turning back to them he repeated Write me a frigging book Stan wheeled back surprised and the others looked at him There was a shocked look on Ben Hanscoms face as if he had suddenly and unexpectedly slapped himself Eddie was looking at Stan You got out by yelling birds names at them Maybe Stan said reluctantly Or maybe the door was just stuck and finally popped open Stan shrugged It was not a sullen shrug it only said he didnt know I think it was the birds you shouted at them Eddie said But why In the movies you hold up a cross I know the Twentythird Psalm Stan said angrily but I wouldnt do so good with the old crucifix business Im Jewish remember They looked away from him embarrassed either for his having been born that way or for their having forgotten it Birds Eddie said again Jesus Then he glanced guiltily at Stan again but Stan was looking moodily across the street at the Bangor Hydro office Bill will know what to do Ben said suddenly as if finally agreeing with Bev and Eddie Betcha anything Betcha any amount of money Look Stan said looking at all of them earnestly Thats okay We can talk to Bill about it if you want But thats where things stop for me You can call me a chicken or yellow I dont care Im not a chicken I dont think Its just that those things in the Standpipe If you werent afraid of something like that youd have to be crazy Stan Beverly said softly Yeah I was scared but thats not the problem Stan said hotly Its not even what Im talking about Dont you see They were looking at him expectantly their eyes both troubled and faintly hopeful but Stan found he could not explain how he felt The words had run out There was a brick of feeling inside him almost choking him and he could not get it out of his throat Neat as he was sure as he was he was still only an elevenyearold boy who had that year finished the fourth grade He wanted to tell them that there were worse things than being frightened You could be frightened by things like almost having a car hit you while you were riding your bike or before the Salk vaccine getting polio You could be frightened of that crazyman Khrushchev or of drowning if you went out over your head You could be frightened of all those things and still function He wanted to tell them that those dead boys who had lurched and shambled their way down the spiral staircase had done something worse than frighten him they had offended him Offended yes It was the only word he could think of and if he used it they would laughthey liked him he knew that and they had accepted him as one of them but they would still laugh All the same there were things that were not supposed to be They offended any sane persons sense of order they offended the central idea that God had given the earth a final tilt on its axis so that twilight would only last about twelve minutes at the equator and linger for an hour or more up where the Eskimos built their icecube houses that He had done that and He then had said in effect Okay if you can figure out the tilt you can figure out any damn thing you choose Because even light has weight and when the note of a trainwhistle suddenly drops its the Doppler effect and when an airplane breaks the sound barrier that bang isnt the applause of the angels or the flatulence of demons but only air collapsing back into place I gave you the tilt and then I sat back about halfway up the auditorium to watch the show I got nothing else to say except that two and two makes four the lights in the sky are stars if theres blood grownups can see it as well as kids and dead boys stay dead You can live with fear I think Stan would have said if he could Maybe not forever but for a long long time Its offense you maybe cant live with because it opens up a crack inside your thinking and if you look down into it you see there are live things down there and they have little yellow eyes that dont blink and theres a stink down in that dark and after awhile you think maybe theres a whole other universe down there a universe where a square moon rises in the sky and the stars laugh in cold voices and some of the triangles have four sides and some have five and some of them have five raised to the fifth power of sides In this universe there might grow roses which sing Everything leads to everything he would have told them if he could Go to your church and listen to your stories about Jesus walking on the water but if I saw a guy doing that Id scream and scream and scream Because it wouldnt look like a miracle to me It would look like an offense Because he could say none of these things he just reiterated Being scared isnt the problem I just dont want to be involved in something that will land me in the nuthatch Will you at least go with us to talk to him Bev asked Listen to what he says Sure Stan said and then laughed Maybe I ought to bring my birdbook Beverly left them outside the KleenKloze and took the rags back home by herself The apartment was still empty She put them under the kitchen sink and closed the cupboard She stood up and looked down toward the bathroom Im not going down there she thought Im going to watch Bandstand on TV See if I cant learn how to do the Dog So she went into the living room and turned on the TV and five minutes later she turned it off while Dick Clark was showing how much oil just one StriDex medicated pad could take off the face of your average teenager If you think you can get clean with just soap and water Dick said holding the dirty pad up to the glassy eye of the camera so that every teenager in America could get a good look you ought to take a good look at this She went back to the kitchen cupboard over the sink where her father kept his tools Among them was a pocket tape the kind that runs out a long yellow tongue of inches She folded this into one cold hand and went down to the bathroom It was sparkling clean silent Somewhere far distant it seemed she could hear Mrs Doyon yelling for her boy Jim to get in out of the road right now She went to the bathroom basin and looked down into the dark eye of the drain She stood there for some time her legs as cold as marble inside her jeans her nipples feeling sharp enough and hard enough to cut paper her lips dead dry She waited for the voices A little shuddery sigh came from her and she began to feed the thin steel tape into the drain It went down smoothlylike a sword into the gullet of a county fair sideshow performer Six inches eight inches ten It stopped bound up in the elbowbend under the sink Beverly supposed She wiggled it pushing gently at the same time and eventually the tape began to feed into the drain again Sixteen inches now then two feet then three She watched the yellow tape slipping out of the chromedsteel case which had been worn black on the sides by her fathers big hand In her minds eye she saw it sliding through the black bore of the pipe picking up some muck scraping away flakes of rust Down there where the sun never shines and the night never stops she thought She imagined the head of the tape with its small steel buttplate no bigger than a fingernail sliding farther and farther into the darkness and part of her mind screamed What are you doing She did not ignore that voice but she seemed helpless to heed it She saw the end of the tape going straight down now descending into the cellar She saw it striking the sewage pipe and even as she saw it the tape bound up again She wiggled it again and the tape thin enough to be limber made a faint eerie sound that reminded her a little bit of the way a saw sounds when you bend it back and forth across your legs She could see its tip wiggling against the bottom of this wider pipe which would have a baked ceramic surface She could see it bending and then she was able to push it forward again And suddenly the tape began to run through her hands by itself as if something down there was pulling the other end Not just pulling it running with it She stared at the flowing tape her eyes wide her mouth a sagging O of fearfear yes but no surprise Hadnt she known Hadnt she known something like this was going to happen The tape ran out to its final stop Eighteen feet an even six yards A soft chuckle came wafting out of the drain followed by a low whisper that was almost reproachful Beverly Beverly Beverly you cant fight us youll die if you try die if you try die if you try Beverly Beverly Beverly lylyly Something clicked inside the tapemeasures housing and it suddenly began to run rapidly back into its case the numbers and hashmarks blurring by Near the endthe last five or six feetthe yellow became a dark dripping red and she screamed and dropped it on the floor as if the tape had suddenly turned into a live snake Fresh blood trickled over the clean white porcelain of the basin and back down into the drains wide eye She bent sobbing now her fear a freezing weight in her stomach and picked the tape up She tweezed it between the thumb and first finger of her right hand and holding it in front of her took it into the kitchen As she walked blood dripped from the tape onto the faded linoleum of the hall and the kitchen She steadied herself by thinking of what her father would say to herwhat he would do to herif he found that she had gotten his measuring tape all bloody Of course he wouldnt be able to see the blood but it helped to think that She took one of the clean ragsstill as warm as fresh bread from the dryerand went back into the bathroom Before she began to clean she put the hard rubber plug in the drain closing that eye The blood was fresh and it cleaned up easily She went up her own trail wiping away the dunesized drops on the linoleum then rinsing the rag wringing it out and putting it aside She got a second rag and used it to clean her fathers measuring tape The blood was thick viscous In two places there were clots of the stuff black and spongy Although the blood only went back five or six feet she cleaned the entire length of the tape removing from it all traces of pipemuck That done she put it back into the cupboard over the sink and took the two stained rags out in back of the apartment Mrs Doyon was yelling at Jim again Her voice was clear almost belllike in the still hot late afternoon In the back yard which was mostly bare din weeds and clotheslines there Was a rusty incinerator Beverly threw the rags into it then sat down on the back steps Tears came suddenly with surprising violence and this time she made no effort to hold them back She put her arms on her knees her head in her arms and wept while Mrs Doyon called for Jim to come out of that road did he want to get hit by a car and be killed Two more disappearances in the past weekboth children Just as I was beginning to relax One of them a sixteenyearold boy named Dennis Torrio the other a girl of just five who was out sledding in back of her house on West Broadway The hysterical mother found her sled one of those blue plastic flying saucers but nothing else There had been a fresh fall of snow the night beforefour inches or so No tracks but hers Chief Rademacher said when I called him He is becoming extremely annoyed with me I think Not anything thats going to keep me awake nights I have worse things to do than that dont I Asked him if I could see the police photos He refused Asked him if her tracks led away toward any sort of drain or sewer grating This was followed by a long period of silence Then Rademacher said Im beginning to wonder if maybe you shouldnt see a doctor Hanlon The headpeeper kind of doctor The kid was snatched by her father Dont you read the papers Give it a rest Hanlon he said Give me a rest Of course I read the papersdont I put them out in the Reading Room of the Public Library each morning myself The little girl Laurie Ann Winterbarger had been in the custody of her mother following an acrimonious divorce proceeding in the spring of The police are operating on the theory that Horst Winterbarger who is supposedly working as a machinery maintenance man somewhere in Florida drove up to Maine to snatch his daughter They further theorize that he parked his car beside the house and called to his daughter who then joined himhence the lack of any tracks other than the little girls They have less to say about the fact that the girl had not seen her father since she was two Part of the deep bitterness which accompanied the Winterbargers divorce came from Mrs Winterbargers allegations that on at least two occasions Horst Winterbarger had sexually molested the child She asked the court to deny Winterbarger all visitation rights a request the court granted in spite of Winterbargers hot denials Rademacher claims the courts decision which had the effect of cutting Winterbarger off completely from his only child may have pushed Winterbarger into taking his daughter That at least has some dun plausibility but ask yourself this would little Laurie Ann have recognized him after three years and run to him when he called her Rademacher says yes even though she was two the last time she saw him I dont think so And her mother says Laurie Ann had been well trained about not approaching or talking to strangers a lesson most Derry children learn early and well Rademacher says hes got Florida State Police looking for Winterbarger and that his responsibility ends there Matters of custody are more the province of the lawyers than that of the police this pompous overweight asshole is quoted as saying in last Fridays Derry News But the Torrio boy thats something else Wonderful home life Played football for the Derry Tigers Honor Roll student Had gone through the Outward Bound Survival School in the summer of and passed with flying colors No history of drug use Had a girlfriend that he was apparently headoverheels about Had everything to live for Everything to stay in Derry for at least for the next couple of years What happened to him A sudden attack of wanderlust A drunk driver who maybe hit him killed him and buried him Or is he maybe still in Derry is he maybe on the nightside of Derry keeping company with folks like Betty Ripsom and Patrick Hockstetter and Eddie Corcoran and all the rest Is it Im doing it again Going over and over the same ground doing nothing constructive only cranking myself up to the screaming point I jump when the iron stairs leading up to the stacks creak I jump at shadows I find myself wondering how Id react if I was shelving books up therein the stacks pushing my little rubberwheeled trolley in front of me and a hand reached from between two leaning rows of books a groping hand Had again a wellnigh insurmountable desire to begin calling them this afternoon At one point I even got as far as dialing the Atlanta area code with Stanley Uriss number in front of me Then I just held the phone against my ear asking myself if I wanted to call them because I was really sureone hundred percent sureor simply because Im now so badly spooked that I cant stand to be alone that I have to talk to someone who knows or will know what it is I am spooked about For a moment I could hear Richie saying Batches BATCHES We doan need no stinkin batches senhorr in his Pancho Vanilla Voice as clearly as if he were standing beside me and I hung up the phone Because when you want to see someone as badly as I wanted to see Richieor any of themat that moment you just cant trust your own motivations We lie best when we lie to ourselves The fact is Im still not one hundred percent sure If another body should turn up I will call but for now I must suppose that even such a pompous ass as Rademacher may be right She could have remembered her father there may have been pictures of him And I suppose a really persuasive adult could talk a kid into coming to his car no matter what that child had been taught Theres another fear that haunts me Rademacher suggested that I might be going crazy I dont believe that but if I call them now they may think Im crazy Worse than that what if they should not remember me at all Mike Hanlon Who I dont remember any Mike Hanlon I dont remember you at all What promise I feel that there will come a right time to call them and when that time comes Ill know that its right Their own circuits will open at the same time Its as if there are two great wheels slowly coming into some sort of powerful convergence with each other myself and the rest of Derry on one and all my childhood friends on the other When the time comes they will hear the voice of the Turtle So Ill wait and sooner or later Ill know I dont believe its a question anymore of calling them or not calling them A perfect example of how the Chamber of Commerce will try to rewrite history Mike old Albert Carson would have told me probably cackling as he said it Theyll try and sometimes they almost succeed but the old people remember how things really went They always remember And sometimes theyll tell you if you ask them right There are people who have lived in Derry for twenty years and dont know that there was once a special barracks for noncoms at the old Derry Army Air Corps Base a barracks that was a good half a mile from the rest of the baseand in the middle of February with the temperature standing right around zero and a fortymileanhour wind howling across those flat runways and whopping the windchill factor down to something you could hardly believe that extra half a mile became something that could give you frostfreeze or frostbite or maybe even kill you The other seven barracks had oil heat storm windows and insulation They were toasty and cozy The special barracks which housed the twentyseven men of Company E was heated by a balky old wood furnace Supplies of wood for it were catchascatchcan The only insulation was the deep bank of pine and spruce boughs the men laid around the outside One of the men promoted a complete set of storm windows for the place one day but the twentyseven inmates of the special barracks were detailed up to Bangor that same day to help with some work at the base up there and when they came back that night tired and cold all of those windows had been broken Every one This was in when half of Americas air force still consisted of biplanes In Washington Billy Mitchell had been courtmartialed and demoted to flying a desk because his gadfly insistence on trying to build a more modern air force had finally irritated his elders enough for them to slap him down hard Not long after he would resign So there was precious little flying that went on at the Derry base in spite of its three runways one of which was actually paved Most of the soldiering that went on there was of the makework variety One of the Company E soldiers who returned to Derry after his service tour came to an end in was my dad He told me this story One day in the spring of this was about six months before the fire at the Black SpotI was coming back with four of my buddies from a threeday pass we had spent down in Boston When we come through the gate there was this big old boy standing just inside the checkpoint leaning on a shovel and picking the seat of his suntans out of his ass A sergeant from someplace down south Carrotyred hair Bad teeth Pimples Not much more than an ape without the body hair if you know what I mean There were a lot of them like that in the army during the Depression So here we come four young guys back from leave all of us still feeling fine and we could see in his eyes that he was just looking for something to bust us with So we snapped him salutes as if he was General Black Jack Pershing himself I guess we might have been all right but it was one fine lateApril day sun shining down and I had to shoot off my lip A good afternoon to you Sergeant Wilson sir said I and he landed on me with both feet Did I give you any permission to speak to me he asks He looks around at the rest of themTrevor Dawson Carl Roone and Henry Whitsun who was killed in the fire that falland he says to them This here smart nigger is in hack with me If the rest of you jigaboos dont want to join him in one hardworking dirty bitch of an afternoon you get over to your barracks stow your gear and get your asses over to the OD You understand Well they got going and Wilson hollers Doubletime you fuckers Lemme see the soles of your eightyfuckingnines So they doubletimed off and Wilson took me over to one of the equipment sheds and he got me a spade He took me out into the big field that used to be just about where the Northeast Airlines Airbus terminal stands today And he looks at me kind of grinning and he points at the ground and he says You see that hole there nigger There was no hole there but I figured it was best for me to agree with whatever he said so I looked down at the ground where he was pointing and said I sure did see it So then he busted me one in the nose and knocked me over and there I was on the ground with blood running down over the last fresh shirt I had You dont see it because some bigmouth jig bastard filled it up he shouted at me and he had two big blotches of color on his cheeks But he was grinning too and you could tell he was enjoying himself So what you do Mr A Good Afternoon To You what you do is you get the dirt out of my hole Doubletime So I dug for most two hours and pretty soon I was in that hole up to my chin The last couple of feet was clay and by the time I finished I was standing in water up to my ankles and my shoes were soaked right through Get out of there Hanlon Sergeant Wilson said He was sitting there on the grass smoking a cigarette He didnt offer me any help I was dirt and muck from top to bottom not to mention the blood drying on the blouse of my suntans He stood up and walked over He pointed at the hole Yeah well I decided I dont want it he says I dont want no hole dug by a nigger Put my dirt back in Private Hanlon So I filled it back in and by the time I was done the sun was going down and it was getting cold He comes over and looks at it after I finished patting down the last of the dirt with the flat of the spade Bunch of dirt sir I said and he hit me again My God Mikey I came this close to just bouncing up off n the ground and splitting his head open with the edge of that shovel But if Id done that I never would have looked at the sky again except through a set of bars Still there were times when I almost think it would have been worth it I managed to hold my peace somehow though That aint a bunch of dirt you stupid coontail nightfighter he screams at me the spit flying offn his lips Thats MY HOLE and you best get the dirt out of it right now Doubletime So I dug the dirt out of his hole and then I filled it in again and then he asks me why I went and filled in his hole just when he was getting ready to take a crap in it So I dug it out again and he drops his pants and hangs his skinnyshanks cracker redneck ass over the hole and he grins up at me while hes doing his business and says How you doin Hanlon I am doing just fine sir I says right back because I had decided I wasnt going to give up until I fell unconscious or dropped dead I had my dander up Well I aim to fix that he says To start with you better just fill that hole in Private Hanlon And I want to see some life Youre slowin down So I got her filled in again and I could see by the way he was grinning that he was only warming up But just then this friend of his came humping across the field with a gas lantern and told him thered been a surprise inspection and Wilson was in hack for having missed it My friends covered for me and I was okay but Wilsons friendsif thats what he called themcouldnt be bothered He let me go then and I waited to see if his name would go up on the Punishment Roster the next day but it never did I guess he must have just told the Loot he missed the inspection because he was teaching a smartmouth nigger who it was owned all the holes at the Derry army basethose that had already been dug and those that hadnt been They probably gave him a medal instead of potatoes to peel And thats how things were for Company E here in Derry It was right around that my father told me the story and I guess he was pushing fifty although my mother was only forty or so I asked him if that was the way Derry was why had he come back Well I was only sixteen when I joined the army Mikey he said Lied about my age to get in Wasnt my idea either My mother told me to do it I was big and thats the only reason the lie stuck I guess I was born and grew up in Burgaw North Carolina and the only time we saw meat was right after the tobacco was in or sometimes in the winter if my father shot a coon or a possum The only good thing I remember about Burgaw is possum pie with hoecakes spread around her just as pretty as you could want So when my dad died in an accident with some farm machinery my ma said she was going to take Philly Loubird up to Corinth where she had people Philly Loubird was the baby of the family You mean my Uncle Phil I asked smiling to think of anybody calling him Philly Loubird He was a lawyer in Tucson Arizona and had been on the City Council there for six years When I was a kid I thought Uncle Phil was rich For a black man in I suppose he was He made twenty thousand dollars a year Thats who I mean my dad said But in those days he was just a twelveyearold kid who wore a ricepaper sailor hat and mended biballs and had no shoes He was the youngest I was the second youngest All the others were gonetwo dead two married one in jail That was Howard He never was any good You are goan join the army your gramma Shirley told me I dunno if they start paying you right away or not but once they do youre goan send me a lotment every month I hate to send you away son but if you dont take care of me and Philly I dont know whats going to become of us She gave me my birth certificate to show the recruiter and I seen she fixed the year on it somehow to make me eighteen So I went to the courthouse where the army recruiter was and asked about joining up He showed me the papers and the line where I could make my mark I kin write my name I said and he laughed like he didnt believe me Well then you go on and write it black boy he says Hang on a minute I says back I want to ast you a couple of questions Fire away then he says I can answer anything you can ask do they have meat twice a week in the army I asked My mamma says they do but she is powerful set on me joining up Well thats about what I thought I says thinking that the man surely does seem like a booger but at least hes an honest booger Then he says They got it ever night making me wonder how I ever could have thought he was honest Well if I join up I got to do something for my mamma and Philly Loubird I says Mamma says its a lotment Thats this here he says and taps the allotment form Now what else He threw his head back when I said that and laughed until I thought he was gonna choke on his own spit Then he says Son the day they got nigger officers in this mans army will be the day you see the bleedin Jesus Christ doing the Charleston at Birdland Now you sign or you dont sign Im out of patience Also youre stinkin the place up So I signed and watched him staple the allotment form to my mustersheet and then he give me the oath and then I was a soldier I was thinking that theyd send me up to New Jersey where the army was building bridges on account of there being no wars to fight Instead I got Derry Maine and Company E He sighed and shifted in his chair a big man with white hair that curled close to his skull At that time we had one of the bigger farms in Derry and probably the best roadside produce stand south of Bangor The three of us worked hard and my father had to hire on extra help during harvesting time and we made out He said I came back because Id seen the South and Id seen the North and there was the same hate in both places It wasnt Sergeant Wilson that convinced me of that He was nothing but a Georgia cracker and he took the South with him wherever he went He didnt have to be south of the MasonDixon line to hate niggers He just did No it was the fire at the Black Spot that convinced me of that You know Mikey in a way He glanced over at my mother who was knitting She hadnt looked up but I knew she was listening closely and my father knew it too I think In a way it was the fire made me a man There was sixty people killed in that fire eighteen of them from Company E There really wasnt any company left when that fire was over Henry Whitsun Stork Anson Alan Snopes Everett McCaslin Horton Sartoris all my friends all dead in that fire And that fire wasnt set by old Sarge Wilson and his gritsandcornpone friends It was set by the Derry branch of the Maine Legion of White Decency Some of the kids you go to school with son their fathers struck the matches that lit the Black Spot on fire And Im not talking about the poor kids neither Well part of it was just Derry my father said frowning He lit his pipe slowly and shook out the wooden match I dont know why it happened here I cant explain it but at the same time I aint surprised by it The Legion of White Decency was the Northerners version of the Ku Klux Klan you see They marched in the same white sheets they burned the same crosses they wrote the same hatenotes to black folks they felt were getting above their station or taking jobs that were meant for white men In churches where the preachers talked about black equality they sometimes planted charges of dynamite Most of the history books talk more about the KKK than they do about the Legion of White Decency and a lot of people dont even know there was such a thing I think it might be because most of the histories have been written by Northerners and theyre ashamed It was most poplar in the big cities and the manufacturin areas New York New Jersey Detroit Baltimore Boston Portsmouththey all had their chapters They tried to organize in Maine but Derry was the only place they had any real success Oh for awhile there was a pretty good chapter in Lewistonthis was around the same time as the fire at the Black Spotbut they werent worried about niggers raping white women or taking jobs that should have belonged to white men because there werent any niggers to speak of up here In Lewiston they were worried about tramps and hobos and that something called the bonus army would join up with something they called the Communist riffraff army by which they meant any man who was out of work The Legion of Decency used to send these fellows out of town just as fast as they came in Sometimes they stuffed poison ivy down the backs of their pants Sometimes they set their shirts on fire Well the Legion was pretty much done up here after the fire at the Black Spot Things got out of hand you see The way things seem to do in this town sometimes Its like the Legion of White Decency was just another seed Mikey and it found some earth that nourished it well here It was a regular richmans club And after the fire they all just laid away their sheets and lied each other up and it was papered over Now there was a kind of vicious contempt in his voice that made my mother look up frowning After all who got killed Eighteen army niggers fourteen or fifteen town niggers four members of a nigger jazzband and a bunch of niggerlovers What did it matter Its getting to be your bedtime Mikey he said ruffling my hair with his big hard hand I just want to tell you one thing more and I dont think youll understand it because Im not sure I understand it myself What happened that night at the Black Spot bad as it was I dont really think it happened because we was black Not even because the Spot was close behind West Broadway where the rich whites in Derry lived then and still live today I dont think that the Legion of White Decency happened to get along so well here because they hated black people and bums more in Derry than they did in Portland or Lewiston or Brunswick Its because of that soil It seems that bad things hurtful things do right well in the soil of this town Ive thought so again and again over the years I dont know why it should be but it is But there are good folks here too and there were good folks here then When the funerals were held afterward thousands of people turned out and they turned out for the blacks as well as the whites Businesses closed up for most of a week The hospitals treated the hurt ones free of charge There were food baskets and letters of condolence that were honestly meant And there were helping hands held out I met my friend Dewey Conroy during that time and you know hes just as white as vanilla ice cream but I feel like hes my brother Id die for Dewey if he asked me to and although no man really knows another mans heart I think hed die for me if it came to that Anyway the army sent away those of us that were left after that fire like they were ashamed and I guess they were I ended up down at Fort Hood and I stayed there for six years I met your mother there and we were married in Galveston at her folks house But ail through the years between Derry never escaped my mind And after the war I brought your mom back here And we had you And here we are not three miles from where the Black Spot stood in And I think its your bedtime Mr Man I want to hear about the fire I yelled Tell me about it Daddy And he looked at me in that frowning way that always shut me up maybe because he didnt look that way often Mostly he was a smiling man Thats no story for a boy he said Another time Mikey When weve both walked around a few more years As it turned out we both walked around another four years before I heard the story of what happened at the Black Spot that night and by then my fathers walking days were all done He told me from the hospital bed where he lay full of dope dozing in and out of reality as the cancer worked away inside of his intestines eating him up I got reading over what I had written last in this notebook and surprised myself by bursting into tears over my father who has now been dead for twentythree years I can remember my grief for himit lasted for almost two years Then when I graduated from high school in and my mother looked at me and said How proud your father would have been we cried in each others arms and I thought that was the end that we had finished the job of burying him with those late tears But who knows how long a grief may last Isnt it possible that even thirty or forty years after the death of a child or a brother or a sister one may halfwaken thinking of that person with that same lost emptiness that feeling of places which may never be filled perhaps not even in death He left the army in with a disability pension By that year my fathers army had become a good deal more warlike anyone with half an eye he told me once could see by then that soon all the guns would be coming out of storage again He had risen to the rank of sergeant in the interim and he had lost most of his left foot when a new recruit who was so scared he was almost shitting peachpits pulled the pin on a hand grenade and then dropped it instead of throwing it It rolled over to my father and exploded with a sound that was he said like a cough in the middle of the night A lot of the ordnance those longago soldiers had to train with was either defective or had sat so long in almost forgotten supply depots that it was impotent They had bullets that wouldnt fire and rifles that sometimes exploded in their hands when the bullets did fire The navy had torpedoes that usually didnt go where they were aimed and didnt explode when they did The Army Air Corps and the Navy Air Arm had planes whose wings fell off if they landed hard and at Pensacola in I have read a supply officer discovered a whole fleet of government trucks that wouldnt run because cockroaches had eaten the rubber hoses and the fanbelts So my fathers life was saved including of course the part of him that became Your Obdt Servant Michael Hanlon by a combination of bureaucratic porkbarrelling folderol and defective equipment The grenade only halfexploded and he just lost part of one foot instead of everything from the breastbone on down Because of the disability money he was able to marry my mother a year earlier than he had planned They didnt come to Derry at once they moved to Houston where they did war work until My father was a foreman in a factory that made bombcasings My mother was a Rosie the Riveter But as he told me that night when I was eleven the thought of Derry never escaped his mind And now I wonder if that blind thing might not have been at work even thendrawing nun back so I could take my place in that circle in the Barrens that August evening If the wheels of the universe are in true then good always compensates for evilbut good can be awful as well My father had a subscription to the Derry News He kept his eye on the ads announcing land for sale They had saved up a good bit of money At last he saw a farm for sale that looked like a good proposition on paper at least The two of them rode up from Texas on a Trailways bus looked at it and bought it the same day The First Merchants of Penobscot County issued my father a tenyear mortgage and they settled down We had some problems at first my father said another time There were people who didnt want Negroes in the neighborhood We knew it was going to be that wayI hadnt forgotten about the Black Spotand we just hunkered down to wait it out Kids would go by and throw rocks or beer cans I must have replaced twenty windows that first year And some of them werent just kids either One day when we got up there was a swastika painted on the side of the chickenhouse and all the chickens were dead Someone had poisoned their feed Those were the last chickens I ever tried to keep But the County Sheriffthere wasnt any police chief in those days Derry wasnt quite big enough for such a thinggot to work on the matter and he worked hard Thats what I mean Mikey when I say there is good here as well as bad It didnt make any difference to that man Sullivan that rny skin was brown and my hair was kinky He come out half a dozen times he talked to people and finally he found out who done it And who do you think it was Ill give you three guesses and the first two dont count My father laughed until tears spouted out of his eyes He took a big white handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped them away Why it was Butch Bowers thats who The father of the kid you say is the biggest bully at your school The fathers a turd and the sons a little fart There are kids at school who say Henrys father is crazy I told him I think I was in the fourth grade at that timefar enough along to have had my can righteously kicked by Henry Bowers more than once anyway and now that I think about it most of the pejorative terms for black or Negro Ive ever heard I heard first from the lips of Henry Bowers between grades one and four Well Ill tell you he said the idea that Butch Bowers is crazy might not be far wrong People said he was never right after he come back from the Pacific He was in the Marines over there Anyway the Sheriff took him into custody and Butch was hollering that it was a putup job and they were all just a bunch of niggerlovers Oh he was gonna sue everybody I guess he had a list that would have stretched from here to Witcham Street I doubt if he had a single pair of underdrawers that was whole in the seat but he was going to sue me Sheriff Sullivan the Town of Derry the County of Penobscot and God alone knows who else As to what happened next well I cant swear its true but this is how I heard it from Dewey Conroy Dewey said the Sheriff went in to see Butch at the jail up in Bangor And Sheriff Sullivan says Its time for you to shut your mouth and do some listening Butch That black guy he dont want to press charges He dont want to send you to Shawshank he just wants the worth of his chickens He figures two hundred dollars would do her Butch tells the Sheriff he can put his two hundred dollars where the sun dont shine and Sheriff Sullivan he tells Butch They got a lime pit down at the Shank Butch and they tell me after youve been workin there about two years your tongue goes as green as a lime Popsicle Now you pick Two years peelin lime or two hundred dollars What do you think No jury in Maine will convict me Butch says not for killing a niggers chickens Then what the Christ are we chinnin about Butch asts him You better wake up Butch They wont put you away for the chickens but they will put you away for the swastiker you painted on the door after you killed em Well Dewey said Butchs mouth just kind of dropped open and Sullivan went away to let him think about it About three days later Butch told his brother the one that froze to death couple of years after while out hunting drunk to sell his new Mercury which Butch had bought with his musterout pay and was mighty sweet on So I got my two hundred dollars and Butch swore he was going to burn me out He went around telling all his friends that So I caught up with him one afternoon Hed bought an old prewar Ford to replace the Merc and I had my pickup I cut him off out on Witcham Street by the trainyards and got out with my Winchester rifle Any fires out my way and you got one bad black man gunning for you old boss I told him You cant talk to me that way nigger he said and he was damn near to blubbering between being mad and being scared You cant talk to no white man that way not a jig like you Well Id had enough of the whole thing Mikey And I knew if I didnt scare him off for good right then Id never be shed of him There wasnt nobody around I reached in that Ford with one hand and caught him by the hair of the head I put the stock of my rifle against the buckle of my belt and got the muzzle right up under his chin I said The next time you call me a nigger or a jig your brains are going to be dripping off the domelight of your car And you believe me Butch any fires out my way and Im gunning for you I may come gunning for your wife and your brat and your nocount brother as well I have had enough Then he did start to cry and I never saw an uglier sight in my life Look what things has come to here he says when a nih when a jih when a feller can put a gun to a workingmans head in broad daylight by the side of the road Yeah the world must be going to a campmeeting hell when something like that can happen I agreed But that dont matter now All that matters now is do we have an understanding here or do you want to see if you can learn how to breathe through your forehead He allowed as how we had an understanding and that was the last bit of trouble I ever had with Butch Bowers except for maybe when your dog Mr Chips died and Ive got no proof that was Bowerss doing Chippy might have just got a poison bait or something Since that day weve been pretty much left alone to make our way and when I look back on it there aint much I regret Weve had a good life here and if there are nights when I dream about that fire well there isnt nobody that can live a natural life without having a few bad dreams Its been days since I sat down to write the story of the fire at the Black Spot as my father told it to me and I havent gotten to it yet Its in The Lord of the Rings I think where one of the characters says that way leads on to way that you could start at a path leading nowhere more fantastic than from your own front steps to the sidewalk and from there you could go well anywhere at all Its the same way with stories One leads to the next to the next and to the next maybe they go in the direction you wanted to go but maybe they dont Maybe in the end its the voice that tells the stories more than the stories themselves that matters Its his voice that I remember certainly my fathers voice low and slow how he would chuckle sometimes or laugh outright The pauses to light his pipe or to blow his nose or to go and get a can of Narragansett Nasty Gansett he called it from the icebox That voice which is for me somehow the voice of all voices the voice of all years the ultimate voice of this placeone thats in none of the Ives interviews nor in any of the poor histories of this place nor on any of ray own tapes Now its ten oclock the library closed an hour ago and a proper old jeezer is starting to crank up outside I can hear tiny spicules of sleet striking the windows in here and in the glassedin corridor which leads to the Childrens Library I can hear other sounds toostealthy creaks and bumps outside the circle of light where I sit writing on the lined yellow pages of a legal pad Just the sounds of an old building settling I tell myself but I wonder As I wonder if somewhere out in this storm there is a clown selling balloons tonight Well never mind I think Ive finally found my way to my fathers final story I heard it in his hospital room no more than six weeks before he died I went to see him with my mother every afternoon after school and alone every evening My mother had to stay home and do the chores then but she insisted that I go I rode my bike She wouldnt let me hook rides not even four years after the murders had ended That was a hard six weeks for a boy who was only fifteen I loved my father but I came to hate those evening visitswatching him shrink and shrivel watching the painlines spread and deepen on his face Sometimes he would cry although he tried not to And going home it would be getting dark and I would think back to the summer of and Id be afraid to look behind me because the clown might be there or the werewolf or Bens mummy or my bird But I was mostly afraid that no matter what shape It took It would have my fathers cancerraddled face So I would pedal as fast as I could no matter how hard my heart thundered in my chest and come in flushed and sweatyhaired and out of breath and my mother would say Why do you want to ride so fast Mikey Youll make yourself sick And Id say I wanted to get back in time to help you with the chores and shed give me a hug and a kiss and tell me I was a good boy As time went on it got so I could hardly think of things to talk about with him anymore Riding into town Id rack my brain for subjects of conversation dreading the moment when both of us would run out of things to say His dying scared me and enraged me but it embarrassed me too it seemed to me then and it seems to me now that when a man or woman goes it should be a quick thing The cancer was doing more than killing him It was degrading him demeaning him We never spoke of the cancer and in some of those silences I thought that we must speak of it that there would be nothing else and we would be stuck with it like kids caught without a place to sit in a game of musical chairs when the piano stops and I would become almost frantic trying to think of somethinganythingto say so that we would not have to acknowledge the thing which was now destroying my daddy who had once taken Butch Bowers by the hair and jammed his rifle into the shelf of his chin and demanded of Butch to be left alone We would be forced to speak of it and if we were I would cry I wouldnt be able to help it And at fifteen I think the thought of crying in front of my father scared and distressed me more than anything else It was during one of those interminable scary pauses that I asked him again about the fire at the Black Spot Theyd filled him full of dope that evening because the pain was very bad and he had been drifting in and out of consciousness sometimes speaking clearly sometimes speaking in that exotic language I think of as Sleepmud Sometimes I knew he was talking to me but at other times he seemed to have me confused with his brother Phil I asked hull about the Black Spot for no real reason it had just jumped into my mind and I seized on it His eyes sharpened and he smiled a little You aint never forgot that have you Mikey No sir I said and although I hadnt thought about it in three years or better I added what he sometimes said It hasnt ever escaped my mind Well Ill tell you now he said Fifteen is old enough I guess and your mother aint here to stop me Besides you ought to know I think something like it could only have happened in Derry and you need to know that too So you can beware The conditions for such things have always seemed right here Youre careful arent you Mikey Good he said and his head dropped back on his pillow Thats good I thought he was going to drift off againhis eyes had slipped closedbut instead he began to talk When I was at the army base here in and  he said there was an NCO Club up there on the hill where Derry Community College is now It was right behind the PX where you used to be able to get a pack of Lucky Strike Greens for seven cents The NCO Club was only a big old quonset hut but they had fixed it up nice insidecarpet on the floor booths along the walls a jukeboxand you could get soft drinks on the weekend if you were white that was They would have bands in most Saturday nights and it was quite a place to go It was just pop over the bar it being Prohibition but we heard you could get stronger stuff if you wanted it and if you had a little green star on your army card That was like a secret sign they had Homebrew beer mostly but on weekends you could sometimes get stronger stuff If you were white Us Company E boys werent allowed any place near it of course So we went on the town if we had a pass in the evening In those days Derry was still something of a logging town and there were eight or ten bars most of em down in a part of town they called Hells HalfAcre They wasnt speakeasies that was too grand a name for em Wasnt anybody in em spoke very easy anyhow They was what folks called blind pigs and that was about right because most of the customers acted like pigs when they were in there and they was about blind when they turned em out The Sheriff knew and the cops knew but those places roared all night long same as theyd done since the logging days in the s I suppose palms got greased but maybe not as many or with so much as you might think in Derry people have a way of looking the odier way Some served hard stuff as well as beer and by all accounts I ever heard the stuff you could get in town was ten times as good as the rotgut whiskey and bathtub gin you could get at the white boys NCO on Friday and Saturday nights The downtown hooch came over the border from Canada in pulp trucks and most of them bottles had what the labels said The good stuff was expensive but there was plenty of furnaceoil too and it might hang you over but it didnt kill you and if you did go blind it didnt last On any given night youd have to duck your head when the bottles came flying by There was Nans the Paradise Wallys Spa the Silver Dollar and one bar the Powderhorn where you could sometimes get a whore Oh you could pick up a woman at any pig you didnt even have to work at it that hardthere was a lot of them wanted to find out if a slice off n the rye loaf was any differentbut to kids like me and Trevor Dawson and Carl Roone my friends in those days the thought of buying a whorea white whorethat was something you had to sit down and consider As Ive told you he was heavily doped that night I dont believe he would have said any of that stuffnot to his fifteenyearold sonif he had not been Well it wasnt very long before a representative of the Town Council showed up wanting to see Major Fuller He said he wanted to talk about some problems between the townspeople and the enlisted men and concerns of the electorate and questions of propriety but what he really wanted Fuller to know was as clear as a windowpane They didnt want no army niggers in their pigs botherin white women and drinkin illegal hoochat a bar where only white men was supposed to be standin and drinkin illegal hooch All of which was a laugh all right The flower of white womanhood they were so worried about was mostly a bunch of barbags and as far as getting in the way of the men Well all I can say is that I never saw a member of the Derry Town Council down in the Silver Dollar or in the Powderhorn The men who drank in those dives were pulpcutters in those big redandblackchecked lumbermans jackets scars and scabs all over their hands some of em missing eyes or fingers all of em missing most of then teeth all of em smellin like woodchips and sawdust and sap They wore green flannel pants and green gumrubber boots and tracked snow across the floor until it was black with it They smelled big Mikey and they walked big and they talked big They were big I was in Wallys Spa one night when I saw a fella split his shirt right down one arm while he was armrassling this other fella It didnt just ripyou probably think thats what I mean but it aint Arm of that mans shirt damn near explodedsort of blew off his arm in rags And everybody cheered and applauded and somebody slapped me on the back and said Thats what you call an armrasslers fart blackface What Im telling you is that if the men who used those blind pigs on Friday and Saturday nights when they come out of the woods to drink whiskey and fuck women instead of knotholes greased up with lard if those men hadnt wanted us there they would have thrown us out on our asses But the fact of it was Mikey they didnt seem to give much of a toot one way or the other One of em took me aside one nighthe was six foot which was damn big for those days and he was dead drunk and he smelled as high as a basket of monthold peaches If hed stepped out of his clothes I think they would have stood up alone He looks at me and says Mister I gonna ast you sumpin me Are you be a Negro Commen ca va he says in the Saint John Valley French that sounds almost like Cajun talk and grins so big I saw all four of his teeth I knew you was me Hey I seen one in a book once Had the same and he couldnt think how to say what was on his mind so he reaches out and flaps at my mouth Yeah yeah he says laughin like a kid Beeg leeps Epais levres Beeg leeps Gonna buy you a beer me Buy away I says not wanting to get on his bad side He laughed at that too and clapped me on the backalmost knocking me on my faceand pushed his way up to the plankwood bar where there must have been seventy men and maybe fifteen women lined up I need two beers fore I tear this dump apart he yells at the bartender who was a big lug with a broken nose named Romeo Dupree One for me and one pour Ihomme avec les epais levres And they all laughed like hell at that but not in a mean way Mikey So he gets the beers and gives me mine and he says Whats your name I dont want to call you Beeg Leeps me Dont sound good No heres you I says Youre the first white man who ever bought me a drink Which was true So we drank those beers down and then we had two more and he says You sure youre a Negro Except for them epais leeps you look just like a white man with brown skin to me My father got to laughing at this and so did I He laughed so hard his stomach started to hurt him and he held it grimacing his eyes turned up his upper plate biting down on his lower lip You want me to ring for the nurse Daddy I asked alarmed No no Im goan be okay The worst thing of this Mikey is that you cant even laugh anymore when you feel like it Which is damn seldom He fell silent for a few moments and I realize now that that was the only time we came close to talking about what was killing him Maybe it would have been betterbetter for both of usif we had done more Anyway it wasnt the few women who travelled the pigs and it wasnt the lumberjacks that made up their main custom who wanted us out It was those five old men on the Town Council who were really offended them and the dozen or so men that stood behind themDerrys old line you know None of them had ever stepped a foot inside of the Paradise or Wallys Spa they did their boozing at the country club which then stood over on Derry Heights but they wanted to make sure that none of those barbags or peaveyswingers got polluted by the blacks of Company E So Major Fuller says I never wanted them here in the first place I keep thinking its an oversight and theyll get sent back down south or maybe to New Jersey Thats not my problem this old fart tells him Mueller I think his name was Sally Muellers father I asked startled Sally Mueller was in the same highschool class with me My father grinned a sour crooked little grin No this would have been her uncle Sally Muellers dad was off in college somewhere then But if hed been in Derry he would have been there I guess standing with his brother And in case youre wondering how true this part of the story is all I can tell you is that the conversation was repeated to me by Trevor Dawson who was swabbing the floors over there in officers country that day and heard it all Where the government sends the black boys is your problem not mine Mueller tells Major Fuller My problem is where youre letting them go on Friday and Saturday nights If they go on whooping it up downtown theres going to be trouble Weve got the Legion in this town you know Well but I am in a bit of a tight here Mr Mueller he says I cant let them drink over at the NCO Club Not only is it against the regulations for the Negroes to drink with the whites they couldnt anyway Its an NCO club dont you see Every one of those black boys is a buckytail private Thats not my problem either I simply trust you will take care of the matter Responsibility accompanies rank And off he goes Well Fuller solved the problem The Derry Army Base was a damn big patch of land in those days although there wasnt a hell of a lot on it Better than a hundred acres all told Going north it ended right behind West Broadway where a sort of greenbelt was planted Where Memorial Park is now that was where the Black Spot stood It was just an old requisition shed in early when all of this happened but Major Fuller mustered in Company E and told us it was going to be our club Acted like he was Daddy Warbucks or something and maybe he even felt that way giving a bunch of black privates their own place even if it was nothing but a shed Then he added like it was nothing that the pigs downtown were offlimits to us There was a lot of bitterness about it but what could we do We had no real power It was this young fellow a Pfc named Dick Hallorann who was a messcook who suggested that maybe we could fix it up pretty nice if we really tried So we did We really tried And we made out pretty well all things considered The first time a bunch of us went in there to look it over we were pretty depressed It was dark and smelly full of old tools and boxes of papers that had gone moldy There was only two little windows and no lectricity The floor was dirt Carl Roone laughed in a kind of bitter way I remember that and said The ole Maje he a real prince aint he Give us our own club Sho And George Brannock who was also killed in the fire that fall he said Yeah its a hell of a black spot all right And the name just stuck Hallorann got us going though Hallorann and Carl and me I guess God will forgive us for what we did thoughcause He knows we had no idea how it would turn out After awhile the rest of the fellows pitched in With most of Derry offlimits there wasnt much else we could do We hammered and nailed and cleaned Trev Dawson was a pretty good jackleg carpenter and he showed us how to cut some more windows along the side and damned if Alan Snopes didnt come up with panes of glass for them that were different colorssort of a cross between carnival glass and the sort you see in church windows Whered you get this I asked him Alan was the oldest of us he was about fortytwo old enough so that most of us called him Pop Snopes He stuck a Camel in his mouth and tipped me a wink Midnight Requisitions he says and would say no more So the place come along pretty good and by the middle of the summer we was using it Trev Dawson and some of the others had partitioned off the back quarter of the building and got a little kitchen set up in there not much more than a grill and a couple of deepfryers so that you could get a hamburg and some french fries if you wanted There was a bar down one side but it was just meant for sodas and drinks like Virgin Marysshit we knew our place Hadnt we been taught it If we wanted to drink hard wed do it in the dark The floor was still dirt but we kept it oiled down nice Trev and Pop Snopes ran in a lectric linemore Midnight Requisitions I imagine By July you could go in there any Saturday night and sit down and have a cola and a hamburgeror a slawdog It was nice It never really got finishedwe was still working on it when the fire burned it down It got to be a kind of hobby or a way of thumbing our noses at Fuller and Mueller and the Town Council But I guess we knew it was ours when Ev McCaslin and I put up a sign one Friday night that said THE BLACK SPOT and just below that COMPANY E AND GUESTS Like we were exclusive you know It got looking nice enough that the white boys started to grumble about it and next thing you know the white boys NCO was looking finer than ever They was adding on a special lounge and a little cafeteria It was like they wanted to race But that was one race that we didnt want to run We were young except for Snopesy but we werent entirely foolish We knew that the white boys let you race against them but if it starts to look like you are getting ahead why somebody just breaks your legs so you cant run as fast We had what we wanted and that was enough But then something happened He fell silent frowning We found out that we had a pretty decent jazzband among us he said slowly Martin Devereaux who was a corporal played drums Ace Stevenson played cornet Pop Snopes played a pretty decent barrelhouse piano He wasnt great but he wasnt no slouch either There was another fellow who played clarinet and George Brannock played the saxophone There were others of us who sat in from time to time playing guitar or harmonica or juiceharp or even just a comb with waxed paper over it This didnt all happen at once you understand but by the end of that August there was a pretty hot little Dixieland combo playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Black Spot They got better and better as the fall drew on and while they were never greatI dont want to give you that ideathey played in a way that was different hotter somehow it He waved his skinny hand above the bedclothes Thats right he exclaimed grinning back You got it They played bodacious Dixieland And the next thing you know people from town started to show up at our club Even some of the white soldiers from the base It got so the place was getting crowded a right smart every weekend That didnt happen all at once either At first those white faces looked like sprinkles of salt in a pepperpot but more and more of them turned up as time went on When those white people showed up thats when we forgot to be careful They were bringin in their own booze in brown bags most of it the finest hightension stuff there ismade the stuff you could get in the pigs downtown look like soda pop Countryclub booze is what I mean Mikey Rich peoples booze Chivas Glenfiddich The kind of champagne they served to firstclass passengers on ocean liners Champers some of em called it same as we used to call uglyminded mules back home We should have found a way to stop it but we didnt know how They was town Hell they was white And like I said we were young and proud of what wed done And we underestimated how bad things might get We all knew that Mueller and his friends must have known what was going on but I dont think any of us realized that it was drivin em crazyand I mean what I say crazy There they were in their grand old Victorian houses on West Broadway not a quarter of a mile away from where we were listening to things like Aunt Hagars Blues and Diggin My Potatoes That was bad Knowing that their young people were there too whooping it up right cheek by jowl with the blacks that must have been ever so much worse Because it wasnt just the lumberjacks and the barbags that were turning up as September came into October It got to be kind of a thing in town Young folks would come to drink and to dance to that noname jazzband until one in the morning came and shut us down They didnt just come from Derry either They come from Bangor and Newport and Haven and Cleaves Mills and Old Town and all the little burgs around these parts You could see fraternity boys from the University of Maine at Orono cutting capers with their sorority girlfriends and when the band learned how to play a ragtime version of The Maine Stein Song they just about ripped the roof off Of course it was an enlistedmens clubtechnically at leastand offlimits to civilians who didnt have an invitation But in fact Mikey we just opened the door at seven and let her stand open until one By the middle of October it got so that any time you went out on the dancefloor you were standing hip to hip with six other people There wasnt no room to dance so you had to just sort of stand there and wiggle but if anyone minded I never heard him let on By midnight it was like an empty freightcar rocking and reeling on an express run He paused took another drink of water and then went on His eyes were bright now Well well Fuller would have put an end to it sooner or later If it had been sooner a lot less people would have died All you had to do was send in MPs and have them confiscate all the bottles of liquor that people had brought in with them That would have been good enoughjust what he wanted in fact It would have shut us down good and proper There would have been courtmartials and the stockade in Rye for some of us and transfers for all the rest But Fuller was slow I think he was afraid of the same thing some of us was afraid ofthat some of the townies would be mad Mueller hadnt been back to see him and I think Major Fuller must have been scared to go downtown and see Mueller He talked big Fuller did but he had all the spine of a jellyfish So instead of the thing ending in some putup way that would have at least left all those that burned up that night still alive the Legion of Decency ended it They came in their white sheets early that November and cooked themselves a barbecue He fell silent again not sipping at his water this time only looking moodily into the far corner of his room while outside a bell dinged softly somewhere and a nurse passed the open doorway the soles of her shoes squeaking on the linoleum I could hear a TV someplace a radio someplace else I remember that I could hear the wind blowing outside snuffling up the side of the building And although it was August the wind made a cold sound It knew nothing of Cains Hundred on the television or the Four Seasons singing Walk Like a Man on the radio Some of them came through that greenbelt between the base and West Broadway he resumed at last They must have met at someones house over there maybe in the basement to get their sheets on and to make the torches that they used Ive heard that others came right onto the base by Ridgeline Road which was the main way onto the base back then I heardI wont say wherethat they came in a brandnew Packard automobile dressed in their white sheets with their white goblinhats on their laps and torches on the floor The torches were Louisville Sluggers with big hunks of burlap snugged down over the fat parts with red rubber gaskets the kind ladies use when they put up preserves There was a booth where Ridgeline Road branched off Witcham Road and came onto the base and the OD passed that Packard right along It was Saturday night and the joint was jumping going round and round There might have been two hundred people there maybe three And here came these white men six or eight in their bottlegreen Packard and more coining through the trees between the base and the fancy houses on West Broadway They wasnt young not many of them and sometimes I wonder how many cases of angina and bleeding ulcers there were the next day I hope there was a lot Those dirty sneaking murdering bastards The Packard parked on the hill and flashed its lights twice About four men got out of it and joined the rest Some had those twogallon tins of gasoline that you could buy at service stations back in those days All of them had torches One of em stayed behind the wheel of that Packard Mueller had a Packard you know Yes he did A green one They got together at the back of the Black Spot and doused their torches with gas Maybe they only meant to scare us Ive heard it the other way but Ive heard it that way too Id rather believe thats how they meant it because I aint got feeling mean enough even yet to want to believe the worst It could have been that the gas dripped down to the handles of some of those torches and when they lit them why those holding them panicked and threw them any whichway just to get rid of them Whatever that black November night was suddenly blazing with torches Some was holding em up and waving em around little flaming pieces of burlap falling off n the tops of em Some of them were laughing But like I say some of the others up and threw em through the back windows into what was our kitchen The place was burning merry hell in a minute and a half The men outside they were all wearing their peaky white hoods by then Some of them were chanting Come out niggers Come out niggers Come out niggers Maybe some of them were chanting to scare us but I like to believe most of em were trying to warn ussame way as I like to believe that maybe those torches going into the kitchen the way they did was an accident Either way it didnt much matter The band was playing loudern a factory whistle Everybody was whooping it up and having a good time Nobody inside knew anything was wrong until Gerry McCrew who was playing assistant cook that night opened the door to the kitchen and damn near got blowtorched Flames shot out ten feet and burned his messjacket right off Burned most of his hair off as well I was sitting about halfway down the east wall with Trev Dawson and Dick Hallorann when it happened and at first I had an idea the gas stove had exploded Id no more than got on my feet when I was knocked down by people headed for the door About two dozen of em went marchin right up my back an I guess that was the only time during the whole thing when I really felt scared I could hear people screamin and tellin each other they had to get out the place was on fire But every time I tried to get up someone footed me right back down again Someone landed his big shoe square on the back of my head and I saw stars My nose mashed on that oiled floor and I snuffled up dirt and began to cough and sneeze at the same time Someone else stepped on the small of my back I felt a ladys high heel slam down between the cheeks of my butt and son I never want another halfass enema like that one If the seat of my khakis had ripped I believe Id be bleedin down there to this day It sounds funny now but I damn near died in that stampede I was whopped whapped stomped walked on and kicked in so many places I couldnt walk tall the next day I was screaming and none of those people topside heard me or paid any mind It was Trev saved me I seen this big brown hand in front of me and I grabbed it like a drownin man grabs a life preserver I grabbed and he hauled and up I came Someones foot got me in the side of my neck right here He massaged that area where the jaw turns up toward the ear and I nodded and it hurt so bad that I guess I blacked out for a minute But I never let go of Trevs hand and he never let go of mine I got to my feet finally just as the wall wed put up between the kitchen and the hall fell over It made a noise likefloompthe noise a puddle of gasoline makes when you light it I saw it go over in a big bundle of sparks and I saw the people running to get out of its way as it fell Some of em made it Some didnt One of our fellasI think it might have been Hort Sartoriswas buried under it and for just one second I seen his hand underneath all those blazing coals openin and closin There was a white girl surely no more than twenty and the back of her dress went up She was with a college boy and I heard her screamin at him beggin him to help her He took just about two swipes at it and then ran away with the others She stood there screamin as her dress went up on her It was like hell out where the kitchen had been The flames was so bright you couldnt look at them The heat was bakin hot Mikey roastin hot You could feel your skin going shiny You could feel the hairs in your nose gettin crispy We gotta break outta here Trev yells and starts to drag me along the wall Come on Then Dick Hallorann catches hold of him He couldnt have been no more than nineteen and his eyes was as big as bilard balls but he kept his head better than we did He saved our lives Not that way he yells This way And he pointed back toward the bandstand toward the fire you know Youre crazy Trevor screamed back He had a big bull voice but you could barely hear him over the thunder of the fire and the screaming people Die if you want to but me and Willy are gettin out He still had me by the hand and he started to haul me toward the door again although there were so many people around it by then you couldnt see it at all I would have gone with him I was so shellshocked I didnt know what end was up All I knew was that I didnt want to be baked like a human turkey Dick grabbed Trev by the hair of the head just as hard as he could and when Trev turned back Dick slapped his face I remember seeing Trevs head bounce offthe wall and thinking Dick had gone crazy Then he was hollerin in Trevs face You go that way and you goan die They jammed up against that door nigger You dont know that Trev screamed back at him and then there was this loud BANG like a firecracker only what it was it was the heat exploding Marty Devereauxs bass drum The fire was runnin along the beams overhead and the oil on the floor was catchin He grabbed my other hand and for a minute there I felt like the rope in a tugowar game Then Trev took a good look at the door and went Dicks way Dick got us down to a window and grabbed a chair to bust it out but before he could swing it the heat blew it out for him Then he grabbed Trev Dawson by the back of his pants and hauled him up Climb he shouts Climb motherfucker And Trev went head up and tail over the dashboard He boosted me next and I went up I grabbed the sides of the window and hauled I had a good crop of blisters all over my palms the next day that wood was already smokin I come out headfirst and if Trev hadnt grabbed me I mighta broke my neck We turned back around and it was like something from the worst nightmare you ever had Mikey That window was just a yellow blazin square of light Flames was shoo tin up through that tin roof in a dozen places We could hear people screamin inside I saw two brown hands waving around in front of the fireDicks hands Trev Dawson made me a step with his own hands and I reached through that window and grabbed Dick When I took his weight my gut went against the side of the building and it was like having your belly against a stove thats just starting to get real good and hot Dicks face came up and for a few seconds I didnt think we was going to be able to get him Hed taken a right smart of smoke and he was close to passing out His lips had cracked open The back of his shirt was smoldering And then I damn near let go because I could smell the people burning inside Ive heard people say that smell is like barbecuing pork ribs but it aint like that Its more like what happens sometimes after they geld hosses They build a big fire and throw all that shit into it and when the fire gets hot enough you can hear them hossballs poppin like chestnuts and thats what people smell like when they start to cook right inside their cloes I could smell that and I knew I couldnt take it for long so I gave one more great big yank and out came Dick He lost one of his shoes I tumbled off Trevs hands and went down Dick come down on top of me and Im here to tell you that niggers head was hard I lost most of my breath and just laid there on the dirt for a few seconds rolling around and holding my bellyguts Presently I was able to get to my knees then to my feet And I seen these shapes running off toward the greenbelt At first I thought they were ghosts and then I seen shoes By then it was so bright around the Black Spot it was like daylight I seen shoes and understood it was men wearin sheets One of them had fallen a little bit behind the others and I saw I did He drank most of it and then got coughing A passing nurse looked in and said do you need anything Mr Hanlon New set of testines my dad said You got any handy Rhoda She smiled a nervous doubtful smile and passed on My dad handed the glass to me and I put it back on his table Its longer tellin than it is rememberin he said You goan fill that glass up for me before you leave I opened my mouth to lie and then thought better of it And I think now that if I had lied he would have stopped right there He was far gone by then but maybe not that far gone Thats not such a bad thing he said to me In nightmares we can think the worst Thats what theyre for I guess He reached out his hand and I took it and we held hands while he finished I looked around just in time to see Trev and Dick goin around the front of the building and I chased after them still trying to catch mwind There was maybe forty or fifty people out there some of them cryin some of them pukin some of them screamin some of them doing all three things at once it seemed like Others were layin on the grass fainted dead away with the smoke The door was shut and we heard people screamin on the other side screamin to let them out out for the love of Jesus they were burning up It was the only door except for the one that went out through the kitchen to where the garbage cans and things were you see To go in you pushed the door open To go out you had to pull it Some people had gotten out and then they started to jam up at that door and push The door got slammed shut The ones in the back kept pushin forward to get away from the fire and everybody got jammed up The ones right up front were squashed Wasnt no way they could get that door open against the weight of all those behind So there they were trapped and the fire raged It was Trev Dawson that made it so it was only eighty or so that died instead of a hundred or maybe two hundred and what he got for his pains wasnt a medal but two years in the Rye stockade See right about then this big old cargo truck pulled up and who should be behind the wheel but my old friend Sergeant Wilson the fella who owned all the holes there on the base He gets out and starts shoutin orders that didnt make much sense and which people couldnt hear anyway Trev grabbed my arm and we run over to him Id lost all track of Dick Hallorann by then and didnt even see him until the next day Sergeant I have to use your truck Trev yells in his face Get out of my way nigger Wilson says and pushes him down Then he starts yelling all that confused shit again Wasnt nobody paying any attention to him and he didnt go on for long anyway because Trevor Dawson popped up like a jackinthebox and decked him Trev could hit damned hard and almost any other man would have stayed down but that cracker had a hard head He got up blood pouring out of his mouth and nose and he said Im goan kill you for that Well Trev hit him in the belly just as hard as he could and when he doubled over I put my hands together and pounded the back of his neck just as hard as could It was a cowardly thing to do hitting a man from behind like that but desperate times call for desperate measures And I would be lyin Mikey if I didnt tell you that hitting that poormouth sonofabitch didnt give me a bit of pleasure Down he went just like a steer hit with a poleaxe Trev run to the truck fired it up and drove it around so it was facin the front of the Black Spot but to the left of the door He thowed it into first popped the clutch on that cocksucker and here he come Look out there I shouted at that crowd of people standing around Ware that truck They scattered like quail and for a wonder Trev didnt hit none of em He hit the side of the building going maybe thirty and cracked his face a good one on the steerin wheel of the truck I seen the blood fly from his nose when he shook his head to clear it He punched out reverse backed up fifty yards and come down on her again WHAM The Black Spot wasnt nothing but corrugated tin and that second hit did her The whole side of that oven fell in and the flames come roarin out How anything could have still been alive in there I dont know but there was People are a lot tougher than youd believe Mikey and if you dont believe it just take a look at me slidin off the skin of the world by my fingernails That place was like a smelting furnace it was a hell of flames and smoke but people came running out in a regular torrent There were so many that Trev didnt even dare back the truck up again for fear he would run over some of them So he got out and ran back to me leaving it where it was We stood there watching it end It hadnt been five minutes all told but xxxit felt like forever The last dozen or so that made it out were on fire People grabbed em and started to roll em around on the ground trying to put em out Looking in we could see other people trying to come and we knew they wasnt never going to make it Trev grabbed my hand and I grabbed him back twice as hard We stood there holding hands just like you and me are doing now Mikey him with his nose broke and blood running down his face and his eyes puffing shut and we watched them people They were the real ghosts we saw that night nothing but shimmers shaped like men and women in that fire walking toward the opening Trev had bashed with Sergeant Wilsons truck Some of em had their arms held out like they expected someone to save them The others just walked but they didnt seem to get nowhere Their cloes were blazin Their faces were runnin And one after another they just toppled over and you didnt see them no more The last one was a woman Her dress had burned off her and there she was in her slip She was burnin like a candle She seemed to look right at me at the end and I seen her eyelids was on fire When she fell down it was over The whole place went up in a pillar of fire By the time the base firetrucks and two more from the Main Street fire station got there it was already burning itself out That was the fire at the Black Spot Mikey He drank the last of his water and handed me the glass to fill at the drinking fountain in the hall Goan piss the bed tonight I guess Mikey I kissed his cheek and then went out into the hall to fill his glass When I returned he was drifting away again his eyes glassy and contemplative When I put the glass on the nighttable he mumbled a thankyou I could barely understand I looked at the Westclox on his table and saw it was almost eight Time for me to go home I leaned over to kiss him goodbye and instead heard myself whisper What did you see His eyes which were now slipping shut barely turned toward the sound of my voice He might have known it was me or he might have believed he was hearing the voice of his own thoughts Hunk The thing you saw I whispered I didnt want to hear but I had to hear I was both hot and cold my eyes burning my hands freezing But I had to hear As I suppose Lots wife had to turn back and look at the destruction of Sodom Twas a bird he said Right over the last of those runnin men A hawk maybe What they call a kestrel But it was big Never told no one Would have been locked up That bird was maybe sixty feet from wingtip to wingtip It was the size of a Japanese Zero But I seen seen its eyes and I think it seen me His head slipped over to the side toward the window where the dark was coming It swooped down and grabbed that last man up Got him right by the sheet it did xxxand I heard that birds wings The sound was like fire and it hovered and I thought Birds cant hover but this one could because because I sat there in silence thinking he had gone to sleep for sure this time I had never been so afraid in my life because four years before I had seen that bird Somehow in some unimaginable way I had nearly forgotten that nightmare It was my father who brought it back It didnt hover he said It floated It floated There were big bunches of balloons tied to each wing and it floated Its come again I know that now Ill wait but in my heart I know it Im not sure I can stand it As a kid I was able to deal with it but its different with kids In some fundamental way its different I wrote all of that last night in a kind of frenzynot that I could have gone home anyway Derry has been blanketed in a thick glaze of ice and although the sun is out this morning nothing is moving I wrote until long after three this morning pushing the pen faster and faster trying to get it all out I had forgotten about seeing the giant bird when I was eleven It was my fathers story that brought it back and I never forgot it again Not any of it In a way I suppose it was his final gift to me A terrible gift you would say but wonderful in its way I slept right where I was my head in my arms my notebook and pen on the table in front of me I woke up this morning with a numb ass and an aching back but feeling free somehow purged of that old story And then I saw that I had had company in the night as I slept The tracks drying to faint muddy impressions led from the front door of the library which I locked I always lock it to the desk where I slept Whatever it was it came to me in the night left its talisman and then simply disappeared Tied to my reading lamp was a single balloon Filled with helium it floated in a morning sunray which slanted in through one of the high windows On it was a picture of my face the eyes gone blood running down from the ragged sockets a scream distorting the mouth on the balloons thin and bulging rubber skin I looked at it and I screamed The scream echoed through the library echoing back vibrating from the circular iron staircase leading to the stacks The descent made up of despairs and without accomplishment realizes a new awakening which is a reversal of despair For what we cannot accomplish what is denied to love what we have lost in the anticipationa descent follows endless and indestructible The telephone was ringing bringing him up and out of a sleep too deep for dreams He groped for it without opening his eyes without coming more than halfway awake If it had stopped ringing just then he would have slipped back down into sleep without a hitch he would have done it as simply and easily as he had once slipped down the snowcovered hills in McCarron Park on his Flexible Flyer You ran with the sled threw yourself onto it and down you wentseemingly at the speed of sound You couldnt do that as a grownup it racked the hell out of your balls His fingers walked over the telephones dial slipped off climbed it again He had a dim premonition that it would be Mike Hanlon Mike Hanlon calling from Derry telling him he had to come back telling him he had to remember telling him they had made a promise Stan Uris had cut their palms with a sliver of Coke bottle and they had made a promise He had gotten in late yesterday afternoonjust before PM actually He supposed that if he had been the last call on Mikes list all of them must have gotten in at varying times some might even have spent most of the day here He himself had seen none of them felt no urge to see any of them He had simply checked in gone up to his room ordered a meal from room service which he found he could not eat once it was laid out before him and then had tumbled into bed and slept dreamlessly until now Bill cracked one eye open and fumbled for the telephones handset It fell off onto the table and he groped for it opening his other eye He felt totally blank inside his head totally unplugged running on batteries He finally managed to scoop up the phone He got up on one elbow and put it against his ear Hello Bill It was Mike Hanlons voicehed had at least that much right Last week he didnt remember Mike at all and now a single word was enough to identify him It was rather marvellous but in an ominous way Yeah you did Thats okay On the wall above the TV was an abysmal painting of lobstermen in yellow slickers and rainhats pulling lobster traps Looking at it Bill remembered where he was the Derry Town House on Upper Main Street Half a mile farther up and across the street was Bassey Park the Kissing Bridge the Canal What time is it Mike Ive arranged a little reunion Mike said He sounded diffident now Yeah Bill swung his legs out of bed They all came All but Stan Uris Mike said Now there was something in his voice that Bill couldnt read Bev was the last one She got in late last evening Why do you say the last one Mike Stan might show up today Nothing like that Mike said Look if its all the same to you I think it ought to wait until we get together It would be better if I could tell all of you at the same time Yes I think so Mike paused briefly Im sure it does Bill felt the familiar weight of dread settle around his heart againwas it something you could get used to so quickly then Or had it been something he had carried all along simply unfelt and unthoughtof like the inevitable fact of his own death He reached for his cigarettes lit one and blew out the match with the first Youre behind the times old chum Thats Mall Road these days Weve got the thirdbiggest shopping mall in the state out there Fortyeight Different Merchants Under One Roof for Your Shopping Convenience Yes But his heart was beating too fast the tip of his cigarette jittering a tiny bit He had stuttered Mike had heard it There was a moment of silence and then Mike said Just out past the mall theres a restaurant called Jade of the Orient They have private rooms for parties I arranged for one of them yesterday We can have it the whole afternoon if we want it All right Bill said He wrote the name of the restaurant down on the pad by the phone Why there Because its new I guess Mike said slowly It seemed like I dont know Bill chuffed out smoke and halflaughed halfcoughed It aint so good ole pal More like one I guess Well let Beverly catch a few more zs Just like when you go back to your highschool reunion ten years later huh Bill said You get to see who got fat who got bald who got kkids He hung up the phone took a long shower and ordered a breakfast that he didnt want and which he only picked at No his appetite was really not much good at all Bill dialed the Big Yellow Cab Company and asked to be picked up at quarter of one thinking that fifteen minutes would be plenty of time to get him out to Pasture Road he found himself totally unable to think of it as Mall Road even when he actually saw the mall but he had underestimated the lunchhour trafficflow and how much Derry had grown In it had been a big town not much more There were maybe thirty thousand people inside the Derry incorporated city limits and maybe another seven thousand beyond that in the surrounding burgs Now it had become a citya very small city by London or New Yorkstandards but doing just fine by Maine standards where Portland the states largest could boast barely three hundred thousand As the cab moved slowly down Main Street were over the Canal now Bill thought cant see it but its down there running in the dark and then turned up Center his first thought was predictable enough how much had changed But the predictable thought was accompanied by a deep dismay that he never would have expected He remembered his childhood here as a fearful nervous time not only because of the summer of when the seven of them had faced the terror but because of Georges death the deep dream his parents seemed to have fallen into following that death the constant ragging about his stutter Bowers and Huggins and Criss constantly on the prod for them after the rockfight in the Barrens Bowers and Huggins and Criss oh my Bowers and Huggins and Criss oh my and just a feeling that Derry was cold that Derry was hard that Derry didnt much give a shit if any of them lived or died and certainly not if they triumphed over Pennywise the Clown Derry folk had lived with Pennywise in all his guises for a long time and maybe in some mad way they had even come to understand him To like him need him Love him Maybe Yes maybe that too Perhaps only because it seemed such dull change somehow Or perhaps because Derry seemed to have lost its essential face for him The Bijou Theater was gone replaced with a parking lot BY PERMIT ONLY the sign over the ramp announced VIOLATORS SUBJECT TO TOW The Shoeboat and Bailleys Lunch which had stood next to it were also gone They had been replaced by a branch of the Northern National Bank A digital readout jutted from the front of the bland cinderblock structure showing the time and the temperaturethe latter in both degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius The Center Street Drug lair of Mr Keene and the place where Bill had gotten Eddie his asthma medicine that day was also gone Richards Alley had become some strange hybrid called a minimall Looking inside as the cab idled at a stoplight Bill could see a record shop a naturalfoods store and a toysandgames shop which was featuring a clearance sale on ALL DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS SUPPLIES The cab pulled forward with a jerk Gonna take awhile the driver said I wish all these goddam banks would stagger their lunchhours Pardon my French if youre a religious man Thats all right Bill said It was overcast outside and now a few splatters of rain hit the cabs windshield The radio muttered about an escaped mental patient from somewhere who was supposed to be very dangerous and then began muttering about the Red Sox who werent Showers early then clearing When Barry Manilow began moaning about Mandy who came and who gave without taking the cabbie snapped the radio off Bill asked When did they go up Oh late sixties early sebnies most of em the cabbie said He was a big man with a thick neck He wore a redandblackchecked hunters jacket A fluorescentorange cap was jammed down squarely on his head It was smudged with engineoil They got this urbanrenewal money Reb nue Sharin they call it So how they shared it was rip down everythin And the banks come in I guess that was all that could afford to come in Hell of a note aint it Urban renewal says they Shit for dinner says I Pardon my French if youre a religious man There was a lot of talk about how they was gonna revitalize the downtown Ayup they revitalized it just fine Tore down most the old stores and put up a lot of banks and parking lots And you know you still cant find a fucking slot to park your car in Ought to string the whole City Council up by their cocks Except for that Polock woman thats on it String her up by her tits On second thought it dont seem like shes got any Flat as a fuckin board Pardon my French if youre a religious man Then get outta my cab and go to fucking church the cabbie said and they both burst out laughing My whole life Born in Derry Home Hospital and theyll bury my fuckin remains out in Mount Hope Cemetery Yeah right the cabbie said He hawked rolled down his window and spat an extremely large yellowgreen lunger into the rainy air His attitude contradictory but somehow attractivealmost piquantwas one of glum good cheer Guy who catches that wont have to buy no fuckin chewing gum for a week Pardon my French if youre a religious man It hasnt all changed Bill said The depressing promenade of banks and parking lots was slipping behind them as they climbed Center Street Over the hill and past the First National they began to pick up some speed The Aladdins still there Yeah the cabbie conceded But just barely Suckers tried to tear that down too For another bank Bill asked a pan of him amused to find that another part of him stood aghast at the idea He couldnt believe that anyone in his right mind would want to tear down that stately pleasure dome with its glittering glass chandelier its sweeping rightandleft staircases which spiraled up to the balcony and its mammoth curtain which did not simply pull apart when the show started but which instead rose in magical folds and tucks and gathers all underlit in fabulous shades of red and blue and yellow and green while pullies off stage ratcheted and groaned Not the Aladdin that shocked part of him cried out How could they ever even think of tearing down the Aladdin for a BANK Oh ayup a bank the cabbie said Youre fuckingA pardon my French if youre a religious man It was the First Merchants of Penobscot County had its eye on the laddin Wanted to pull it down and put up what they called a complete banking mall Got all the papers from the City Council and the Aladdin was condemned Then a bunch of folks formed a committeefolks that had lived here a long timeand they petitioned and they marched and they hollered and finally they had a public City Council meeting about it and Hanlon blew those suckers out The cabbie sounded extremely satisfied Ayup the cabbie said He twisted around briefly to look at Bill revealing a round chapped face and hornrimmed glasses with old specks of white paint on the bows Librarian Black fella You know him I did Bill said remembering how he had met Mike back in July It had been Bowers and Huggins and Criss again of course Bowers and Huggins and Criss at every turn playing their own part unwitting visegrips driving the seven of them togethertight tighter tightest We played together when we were kids Before I moved away Well there you go the cabbie said Its a small fucking world pardon my There you go the cabbie repeated comfortably and they rode in silence for awhile before he said Its changed a lot Derry has but yeah a lot of its still here The Town House where I picked you up The Standpipe in Memorial Park You remember that place mister When we were kids we used to think that place was haunted They were passing the Derry Home Hospital on the right now Behind it the Penobscot flowed toward its meetingplace with the Kenduskeag Under the rainy spring sky the river was dull pewter The hospital that Bill remembereda white woodframe building with two wings three stories highwas still there but now it was surrounded dwarfed by a whole complex of buildings maybe a dozen in all He could see a parkinglot off to the left and what looked like better than five hundred cars parked there My God thats not a hospital thats a fucking college campus Bill exclaimed The cabdriver cackled Not bein a religious man Ill pardon your French Yeah its almost as big as the Eastern Maine up in Bangor now They got radiation labs and a therapy center and six hundred rooms and their own laundry and God knows what else The old hospitals still there but its all administration now Bill felt a queer doubling sensation in his mind the sort of sensation he remembered getting the first time he watched a D movie Trying to bring together two images that didnt quite jibe You could fool your eyes and your brain into doing that trick he remembered but you were apt to end up with a whopper of a headache and he could feel his own headache coming on now New Derry fine But the old Derry was still here like the wooden Home Hospital building The old Derry was mostly buried under all the new construction but your eye was somehow dragged helplessly back to look at it to look for it The cabbie laughed again delighted For someone who moved away when he was just a kid you got a good memory mister Bill thought You should have met me last week my Frenchspeaking friend Its all still out there but its nothing but ruins and rusty tracks now The freights dont even stop no more Fella wanted to buy the land and put up a whole roadside entertainment thing pitch n putt batting cages driving ranges mini golf gokarts little shack fulla video games I dont know whatallbut theres some kind of big mixup about who owns the land now I guess hell get it eventuallyhes a persistent fellabut right now its in the courts And the Canal Bill murmured as they turned off Outer Center Street and onto Pasture Roadwhich as Mike had said was now marked with a green roadsign reading MALL ROAD The Canals still here Now the Derry Mall was on Bills left and as they rolled past it he felt that queer doubling sensation again When they had been kids all of this had been a great long field full of rank grasses and gigantic nodding sunflowers which marked the northeastern end of the Barrens Behind it to the west was the Old Cape lowincome housing development He could remember them exploring this field being careful not to fall into the gaping cellarhold of the Kitchener Ironworks which had exploded on Easter Sunday in the year The field had been full of relics and they had unearthed them with all the solemn interest of archaeologists exploring Egyptian ruins bricks dippers chunks of iron with rusty bolts hanging from them panes of glass bottles full of unnamable gunk that smelled like the worst poison in the world Something bad had happened near here too in the gravelpit close to the dump but he could not remember it yet He could only remember a name Patrick Humboldt and that it had something to do with a refrigerator And something about a bird that had chased Mike Hanlon What He shook his head Fragments Straws in the wind That was all The field was gone now as were the remains of the Ironworks Bill remembered the great chimney of the Ironworks suddenly Faced with tile caked black with soot for the final ten feet of its length it had lain in the high grass like a gigantic pipe They had scrambled up somehow and had walked along it arms held out like tightwire walkers laughingHe shook his head as if to dismiss the mirage of the mall an ugly collection of buildings with signs that said SEARS and J C PENNEY and WOOLWORTH s and CVS and YORKs STEAK HOUSE and WALDENBOOKS and dozens of others Roads wove in and out of parking lots The mall did not go away because it was no mirage The Kitchener Ironworks was gone and the field that had grown up around its rums was likewise gone The mall was the reality not the memories Here you go mister the cabbie said He pulled into the parkinglot of a building that looked like a large plastic pagoda A little late but better late than never am I right Indeed you are Bill said He gave the cabdriver a five Keep the change Good fucking deal the cabbie exclaimed You need someone to drive you call Big Yellow and ask for Dave Ask for me by name Ill just ask for the religious fella Bill said grinning The one whos got his plot all picked out in Mount Hope You got it Dave said laughing Have a good one mister He stood in the light rain for a moment watching the cab draw away He realized that he had meant to ask the driver one more question and had forgottenperhaps on purpose He had meant to ask Dave if he liked living in Derry Abruptly Bill Denbrough turned and walked into the Jade of the Orient Mike Hanlon was in the lobby sitting in a wicker chair with a huge flaring back He got to his feet and Bill felt deep unreality wash over himthrough him That sensation of doubling was back but now it was much much worse He remembered a boy who had been about five feet three trim and agile Before him was a man who stood about fiveseven He was skinny His clothes seemed to hang on him And the lines in his face said that he was on the darker side of forty instead of only thirtyeight or so Bills shock must have shown on his face because Mike said quietly I know how I look Bill flushed and said Its not that bad Mike its just that I remember you as a kid Thats all it is I am a little tired Mike said but Ill make it I guess He smiled then and the smile lit his face In it Bill saw the boy he had known twentyseven years ago As the old woodframe Home Hospital had been overwhelmed with modern glass and cinderblock so had the boy that Bill had known been overwhelmed with the inevitable accessories of adulthood There were wrinkles on his forehead lines had grooved themselves from the comers of his mouth nearly to his chin and his hair was graying on both sides above the ears But as the old hospital although overwhelmed was still there still visible so was the boy Bill had known Mike stuck out his hand and said Welcome back to Derry Big Bill Bill ignored the hand and embraced Mike Mike hugged him back fiercely and Bill could feel his hair stiff and kinky against his own shoulder and the side of his neck Whatevers wrong Mike well take care of it Bill said He heard the rough sound of tears in his throat and didnt care We beat it once and we can bbeat it aaagain Mike pulled away from him held him at arms length although he was still smiling there was too much sparkle in his eyes He took out his handkerchief and wiped them sure Bill he said You bet Would you gentlemen like to follow me the hostess asked She was a smiling Oriental woman in a delicate pink kimono upon which a dragon cavorted and curled its plated tail Her dark hair was piled high on her head and held with ivory combs Very good Mr Hanlon She smiled at both of them You are well met in friendship I think He led him down a dim corridor past the main dining room and toward a door where a beaded curtain hung Bill hesitated for a moment outside the door suddenly frightened It was not the unknown that scared him not the supernatural it was the simple knowledge that he was fifteen inches taller than he had been in and minus most of his hair He was suddenly uneasyalmost terrifiedat the thought of seeing them all again their childrens faces almost worn away almost buried under change as the old hospital had been buried Banks erected inside their heads where once magic picturepalaces had stood We grew up he thought We didnt think it would happen not then not to us But it did and if I go in there it will be real were all grownups now He looked at Mike suddenly bewildered and timid How do they look he heard himself asking in a faltering voice Mike how do they look Come in and find out Mike said kindly enough and led Bill into the small private room Perhaps it was simply the dimness of the room that caused the illusion which lasted for only the briefest moment but Bill wondered later if it wasnt some sort of message meant strictly for him that fate could also be kind In that brief moment it seemed to him that none of them had grown up that his friends had somehow done a Peter Pan act and were all still children Richie Tozier was rocked back in his chair so that he was leaning against the wall caught in the act of saying something to Beverly Marsh who had a hand cupped over her mouth to hide a giggle Richie had a wiseass grin on his face that was perfectly familiar There was Eddie Kaspbrak sitting on Beverlys left and in front of him on the table next to his waterglass was a plastic squeezebottle with a pistolgrip handle curving down from its top The trimmings were a little more stateoftheart but the purpose was obviously the same it was an aspirator Sitting at one end of the table watching this trio with an expression of mixed anxiety amusement and concentration was Ben Hanscom Bill found his hand wanting to go to his head and realized with a sorry kind of amusement that in that second he had almost rubbed his pate to see if his haur had magically come backthat red fine hair that he had begun to lose when he was only a college sophomore That broke the bubble Richie was not wearing glasses he saw and thought He probably has contacts nowhe would He hated those glasses The teeshirts and cord pants hed habitually worn had been replaced by a suit that hadnt been purchased off any rackBill estimated that he was looking at nine hundred dollars worth of tailormade on the hoof Beverly Marsh if her name still was Marsh had become a stunningly beautiful woman Instead of the casual ponytail her hairwhich was almost exactly the same shade his own had beenspilled over the shoulders of her plain white Ship n Shore blouse in a torrent of subdued color In this dim light it merely glowed like a wellbanked bed of embers In daylight even the light of such a subdued day as this one Bill imagined it would flame And he found himself wondering what it would feel like to plunge his hands into that hair The worlds oldest story he thought wryly I love my wife but oh you kid Eddieit was weird but truehad grown up to look quite a little bit like Anthony Perkins His face was prematurely lined although in his movements he seemed somehow younger than either Richie or Ben and made older still by the rimless spectacles he worespectacles you would imagine a British barrister wearing as he approached the bench or leafed through a legal brief His hair was short worn in an outofdate style that had been known as Ivy League in the late fifties and early sixties He was wearing a loud checked sportcoat that looked like something grabbed from the Distress Sale rack of a mens clothing store that would shortly be out of business but the watch on one wrist was a Patek Philippe and the ring on the little finger of his right hand was a ruby The stone was too hugely vulgar and too ostentatious to be anything but real Ben was the one who had really changed and looking at him again Bill felt unreality wash easily over him His face was the same and his hair although graying and longer was combed in the same unusual rightside part But Ben had gotten thin He sat easily enough in his chair his unadorned leather vest open to show the blue chambray workshirt beneath He wore Levis with straight legs cowboy boots and a wide belt with a beatensilver buckle These clothes clung easily to a body which was slim and narrowhipped He wore a bracelet with heavy links on one wristnot gold links but copper ones He got thin Bill thought Hes a shadow of his former self so to speak Ole Ben got thin Wonders never cease There was a moment of silence among the six of them that was beyond description It was one of the strangest moments Bill Denbrough ever passed in his life Stan was not here but a seventh had come nonetheless Here in this private restaurant dining room Bill felt its presence so fully that it was almost personifiedbut not as an old man in a white robe with a scythe on his shoulder It was the white spot on the map which lay between and  an area an explorer might have called the Great Dont Know Bill wondered what exactly was there Beverly Marsh in a short skirt which showed most of her long coltish legs a Beverly Marsh in white gogo boots her hair parted in the middle and ironed Richie Tozier carrying a sign which said STOP THE WAR on one side and GET ROTC OFF CAMPUS on the other Ben Hanscom in a yellow hardhat with a flag decal on the front running a bulldozer under a canvas parasol his shirt off showing a stomach which protruded less and less over the waistband of his pants Was this seventh creature black No relation to either H Rap Brown or Grandmaster Flash not this fellow this fellow wore plain white shirts and fadeintothewoodwork J C Penney slacks and he sat in a library carrell at the University of Maine writing papers on the origin of footnotes and the possible advantages of ISBN numbers in book cataloguing while the marchers marched outside and Phil Ochs sang Richard Nixon find yourself another country to be part of and men died with their stomachs blown out for villages whose names they could not pronounce he sat there studiously bent over his work Bill saw him which lay in a slant of crisp white winterlight his face sober and absorbed knowing that to be a librarian was to come as close as any human being can to sitting in the peakseat of eternitys engine Was he the seventh Or was it a young man standing before his mirror looking at the way his forehead was growing looking at a combful of pulledout red hairs looking at a pile of university notebooks on the desk reflected in the mirror notebooks which held the completed messy first draft of a novel entitled Joanna which would be published a year later Some of the above all of the above none of the above It didnt matter really The seventh was there and in that one moment they all felt it and perhaps understood best the dreadful power of the thing that had brought them back It lives Bill thought cold inside his clothes Eye of newt tail of dragon Hand of Glory whatever It was Its here again in Derry It And he feltsuddenly that It was the seventh that It and time were somehow interchangeable that It wore all their faces as well as the thousand others with which It had terrified and killed and the idea that It might be them was somehow the most frightening idea of all How much of us was left behind here he thought with sudden rising terror How much of us never left the drains and the sewers where It lived and where It fed Is that why we forgot Because part of each of us never had any future never grew never left Derry Is that why He saw no answers on their faces only his own questions reflected back at him Thoughts form and pass in a matter of seconds or milliseconds and create their own timeframes and all of this passed through Bill Denbroughs mind in a space of no more than five seconds Then Richie Tozier leaning back against the wall grinned again and said Oh my look at thisBill Denbrough went for the chrome dome look How long you been Turtle Waxing your head Big Bill And Bill with no idea at all of what might come out opened his mouth and heard himself say Fuck you and the horse you rode in on Trashmouth There was a moment of silenceand then the room exploded with laughter Bill crossed to them and began to shake hands and while there was something horrible in what he now felt there was also something comforting about it this sensation of having come home for good Mike Hanlon ordered drinks and as if to make up for the prior silence everyone began to talk at once Beverly Marsh was now Beverly Rogan it turned out She said she was married to a wonderful man in Chicago who had turned her whole life around and who had by some benign magic been able to transform his wifes simple talent for sewing into a successful dress business Eddie Kaspbrak owned a limousine company in New York For all I know my wife could be in bed with Al Pacino right now he said smiling mildly and the room broke up They all knew what Bill and Ben had been up to but Bill had a peculiar sense that there had been no personal association of their namesBen as an architect himself as a writerwith people they had known as children until very very recently Beverly had paperback copies of Joanna and The Black Rapids in her purse and asked him if he would sign them Bill did so noticing as he did that both books were in mint conditionas if they had been purchased in the airport newsstand as she got off the plane In like fashion Richie told Ben how much he had admired the BBC communications center in London but there was a puzzled son of light in his eyes as if he could not quite reconcile that building with this man or with the fat earnest boy who had showed them how to flood out half the Barrens with scrounged boards and a rusty car door Richie was a disc jockey in California He told them he was known as the Man of a Thousand Voices and Bill groaned God Richie your Voices were always so terrible When Beverly asked him if he wore contacts now Richie said in a low voice Come a little closer baybee Look in my eyes Beverly did and exclaimed delightedly as Richie tilted his head a little so she could see the lower rims of the Hydromist soft lenses he wore Mike took out his wallet and produced a snap of the library taken from above He did it with the proud air of a man producing snapshots of his kids when asked about his family Guy in a light plane took this he said as the picture went from hand to hand Tve been trying to get either the City Council or some wellheeled private donor to supply enough cash to get it blown up to mural size for the Childrens Library So far no soap But its a good picture huh They all agreed that it was Ben held it longest looking at it fixedly Finally he tapped the glass corridor which connected the two buildings do you recognize this from anywhere else Mike Mike smiled Its your communications center he said and all six of them burst out laughing That silence sudden awkward and perplexing fell again They looked at Well Beverly asked in her sweet slightly husky voice What do we drink to To us Richie said suddenly And now he wasnt smiling His eyes caught Bills and with a force so great he could barely deal with it Bill remembered himself and Richie in the middle of Neibolt Street after the thing which might have been a clown or which might have been a werewolf had disappeared embracing each other and weeping When he picked up his glass his hand was trembling and some of his drink spilled on the napery Richie rose slowly to his feet and one by one the others followed suit Bill first then Ben and Eddie Beverly and finally Mike Hanlon To us Richie said and like Bills hand his voice trembled a little To the Losers Club of The Losers Eddie said His face was pale and old behind his rimless glasses The Losers Ben agreed A faint and painful smile ghosted at the corners of his mouth That silence fell again and this time Richie did not break it This time the silence seemed necessary They sat back down and Bill said so spill it Mike Tell us whats been happening here and what we can do So they ate and they ate long and well Like that old joke about the condemned man Bill thought but his own appetite was better than it had been in ages since he was a kid he was tempted to think The food was not stunningly good but it was far from bad and there was a lot of it The six of them began trading stuff back and forthspareribs moo goo gaipan chicken wings that had been delicately braised egg rolls water chestnuts wrapped in bacon strips of beef that had been threaded onto wooden skewers They began with pupu platters and Richie made a childish but amusing business of broiling a little bit of everything over the flaming pot in the center of the platter he was sharing with Beverlyincluding half an egg roll and a few red kidney beans Flambe at my table I love it he told Ben Id eat shit on a shingle if it was flambe at my table And probably has Bill remarked Beverly laughed so hard at this she had to spit a mouthful of food into her napkin Oh God I think Im gonna ralph Richie said in an eerily exact imitation of Don Pardo and Beverly laughed harder blushing a bright red Rose herself brought them their desserta great mound of baked Alaska vhich she ignited at the head of the table where Mike sat More flambe at my table Richie said in the voice of a man who has died and gone to heaven This may be the best meal Ive ever eaten in my life If I blow that out do I get my wish he asked her Richies smile faltered suddenly I applaud the sentiment he said but you know I really doubt the veracity They almost demolished the baked Alaska As Bill sat back his belly straining the waistband of his pants he happened to notice the glasses on the table There seemed to be hundreds of them He grinned a little realizing that he himself had sunk two martinis before the meal and God knew how many bottles of Kirin beer with it The others had done about as well In their state fried chunks of bowling pin would probably have tasted okay And yet he didnt feel drunk I havent eaten like that since I was a kid Ben said They looked at him and a faint flush of color tinged his cheeks I mean it literally That may be the biggest meal Ive eaten since I was a sophomore in high school You dont want to hear all that ancient history Ben shifted uncomfortably I dont know about the rest of them Bill said but I do Come on Ben Give What turned Haystack Calhoun into the magazine model we see before us today Its not much of a story Ben said No story at all really After that summerafter we stayed in Derry another two years Then my mom lost her job and we ended up moving to Nebraska because she had a sister there who offered to take us in until my mother got on her feet again It wasnt so great Her sister my aunt Jean was a miserly bitch who had to keep telling you what your place in the great scheme of things was how lucky we were that my mom had a sister who could give us charity how lucky we were not to be on welfare all that sort of thing I was so fat I disgusted her She couldnt leave it alone Ben you ought to get more exercise Ben youll have a heart attack before youre forty if you dont lose weight Ben with little children starving in the world you ought to be ashamed of yourself He paused for a moment and sipped some water The thing was she also trotted the starving children out if I didnt clean my plate Anyway the country was just pulling out of a recession and my mother was almost a year finding steady work By the time we moved out of aunt Jeans place in La Vista and got our own in Omaha Id put on about ninety pounds over when you guys knew me I think I put on most of it just to spite my Aunt Jean At about two hundred and ten Ben said gravely Anyway I was going to East Side High School in Omaha and the physedPeriods were well pretty bad The other kids called me Jugs That ought to give you the idea The ragging went on for about seven months and then one day while we were getting dressed in the locker room after the period two or three of the guys started to to kind of slap my gut They called it fatpaddling Pretty soon two or three others got in on it Then four or five more Pretty soon it was all of them chasing me around the locker room and up the hall whacking my gut my butt my back my legs I got scared and started to scream That made the rest of them laugh like crazy You know he said looking down and carefully rearranging his silverware thats the last time I can remember thinking of Henry Bowers until Mike called me two days ago The kid who started it was a farmboy with these big old hands and while they were chasing after me I remember thinking that Henry had come back I thinkno I knowthats when I panicked They chased me up the hall past the lockers where the guys who played sports kept their stuff I was naked and red as a lobster Id lost any sense of dignity or or of myself I guess youd say Where myself was I was screaming for help And here they came after me screaming Fatpaddling Fatpaddling Fatpaddling There was a bench Ben you dont have to put yourself through this Beverly said suddenly Her face had gone ashypale She toyed with her waterglass and almost spilled it Ben looked at him for a moment and then nodded There was a bench at the end of the corridor I fell over it and hit my head They were all around me in another minute or two and then this voice said Okay Thats enough You guys go change up It was Coach standing there in the doorway wearing his blue sweatpants with the white stripe up the sides and his white teeshirt There was no way of telling how long hed been standing there They all looked at him some of them grinning some of them guilty some of them just looking sort of vacant They went away And I burst into tears Coach just stood there in the doorway leading back to the gym watching me watching this naked fat boy with his skin all red from the fatpaddling watching this fat kid crying on the floor And finally he said Benny why dont you just fucking shut up It shocked me so much to hear a teacher use that word that I did I looked up at him and he came over and sat down on the bench Id fallen over He leaned over me and the whistle around his neck swung out and bonked me on the forehead For a second I thought he was going to kiss me or something and I shrank back from him but what he did was grab one of my tits in each hand and squeeze Then he took his hands away and rubbed them on his pants like hed touched something dirty You think Im going to comfort you he asked me Im not You disgust them and you disgust me as well We got different reasons but thats because theyre kids and Im not They dont know why you disgust them I do know Its because I see you burying the good body God gave you in a great big mess of fat Its a lot of stupid selfindulgence and it makes me want to puke Now listen to me Benny because this is the only tune Im going to say it to you I got a football team to coach and basketball and track and somewhere in between Ive got swimming team So Ill just say it once Youre fat up here And he tapped my forehead right where his damned whistle had bonked me Thats where everybodys fat You put whats between your ears on a diet and youre going to lose weight But guys like you never do Yeah Ben said grinning But he didnt know he was a bastard thats how dumb he was Hed probably seen Jack Webb in that movie The DI about sixty times and he actually thought he was doing me a favor And as it turned out he was Because I thought of something right then I thought He looked away frowningand Bill had the strangest feeling that he knew what Ben was going to say before he said it I told you that the last time I can remember thinking of Henry Bowers was when the other boys were chasing after me and fatpaddling Well when the Coach was getting up to go that was the last time I really thought of what wed done in the summer of I thought He hesitated again looking at each of them in turn seeming to search their faces He went on carefully I thought of how good we were together I thought of what we did and how we did it and all at once it hit me that if Coach had to face anything like that his hair would probably have turned white all at once and his heart would have stopped dead in his chest like an old watch It wasnt fair of course but he hadnt been fair to me What happened was simple enough He turned around and looked at me You say you coach track I asked him You listen to me you stupid stonebrained son of a bitch I said and his mouth dropped open and his eyes bugged out Ill be out there for the track team in March What do you think about that I think you better shut your mouth before it gets you into big trouble he said Im going to run down everyone you get out I said Im going to run down your best And then I want a fucking apology from you His fists clenched and for a minute I thought he was going to come back in there and let me have it Then they unclenched again You just keep talking fatboy he said softly You got the motormouth But the day you can outrun my best will be the day I quit this place and go back to picking corn on the circuit And he left Well I did Ben said But Coach was wrong It didnt start in my head It started with my mother I went home that night and told her I wanted to lose some weight We ended up having a hell of a fight both of us crying She started out with that same old song and dance I wasnt really fat I just had big bones and a big boy who was going to be a big man had to eat big just to stay even It was a a kind of security thing with her I think It was scary for her trying to raise a boy on her own She had no education and no real skills just a willingness to work hard And when she could give me a second helping or when she could look across the table at me and see that I was looking solid Uhhuh Ben drank off the last of his beer and wiped a small mustache of foam off his upper lip with the heel of his hand so the biggest fight wasnt with my head it was with her She just wouldnt accept it not for months She wouldnt take in my clothes and she wouldnt buy me new ones I was running by then I ran everywhere and sometimes my heart pounded so hard I felt like I was going to pass out The first of my mile runs I finished by puking and then fainting Then for awhile I just puked And after awhile I was holding up my pants while I ran I got a paperroute and I ran with the bag around my neck bouncing against my chest while I held up my pants My shirts started to look like sails And nights when I went home and would only eat half the stuff on my plate my mother would burst into tears and say that I was starving myself killing myself that I didnt love her anymore that I didnt care about how hard she had worked for me Christ Richie muttered lighting a cigarette I dont know how you handled it Ben I just kept the Coachs face in front of me Ben said I just kept remembering the way he looked after he grabbed my tits in the hallway to the boys locker room that time Thats how I did it I got myself some new jeans and stuff with the paperroute money and the old guy in the firstfloor apartment used his awl to punch some new holes in my beltabout five of them as I remember I think that I might have remembered the other time I had to buy a pair of new jeansthat was when Henry pushed me into the Barrens that day and they just about got torn off my body Yeah Eddie said grinning And you told me about the chocolate milk Remember that Ben nodded If I did remember he went on it was just for a secondthere and gone About that same time I started taking Health and Nutrition at school and I found out you could eat just about all the raw green stuff you wanted and not gain weight So one night my mother put on a salad with lettuce and raw spinach in it chunks of apple and maybe a little leftover ham Now Ive never liked rabbitfood that much but I had three helpings and just raved on and on to my mother about how good it was That went a long way toward solving the problem She didnt care so much what I ate as long as I ate a lot of it She buried me in salads I ate them for the next three years There were times when I had to look in the mirror to make sure my nose wasnt wriggling So what happened about the Coach Eddie asked did you go out for track He touched his aspirator as if the thought of running had reminded him of it Oh yeah I went out Ben said The twotwenty and the fourforty By then Id lost seventy pounds and Id sprung up two inches so that what was left was better distributed On the first day of trials I won the twotwenty by six lengths and the fourforty by eight Then I went over to Coach who looked mad enough to chew nails and spit out staples and I said Looks like its time you got out on the circuit and started picking corn When are you heading down Kansas way He didnt say a thing at firstjust swung a roundhouse and knocked me flat on my back Then he told me to get off the field Said he didnt want a smartmouth bastard like me on his track team I wouldnt be on it if President Kennedy appointed me to it I said wiping blood out of the corner of my mouth And since you got me going I wont hold you to it but the next time you sit down to a big plate of corn on the cob spare me a thought He told me if I didnt get out right then he was going to beat the living crap out of me Ben was smiling a little but there was nothing very pleasant about that smile certainly nothing nostalgic Those were his exact words Everyone was watching us including the kids Id beaten They looked pretty embarrassed So I just said Ill tell you what Coach You get one free on account of youre a sore loser but too old to learn any better now But you put one more on me and Ill try to see to it that you lose your job Im not sure I can do it but I can make a good try I lost the weight so I could have a little dignity and a little peace Those are things worth fighting for Bill said All of that sounds wonderful Ben but the writer in me wonders if any kid ever really talked like that Ben nodded still smiling that peculiar smile I doubt if any kid who hadnt been through the things we went through ever did he said But I said them The Coach stood back with his hands on the hips of his sweatpants Ben said He opened his mouth and then he closed it again Nobody said anything I walked off and that was the last I had to do with Coach Woodleigh When my homeroom teacher handed me my course sheet for my junior year someone had typed the word excused next to phys ed and hed initialed it You beat him Richie exclaimed and shook his clenched hands over his head Way to go Ben Ben shrugged I think what I did was beat part of myself Coach got me going I guess but it was thinking of you guys that made me really believe that I could do it And I did do it Ben shrugged charmingly but Bill believed he could see fine drops of sweat at his hairline End of True Confessions Except I sure could use another beer Talkings thirsty work All six of them ended up ordering another round and they talked of light matters until the drinks came Bill looked into his beer watching the way the bubbles crawled up the sides of the glass He was both amused and appalled to realize he was hoping someone else would begin to story about the years betweenthat Beverly would tell them about the wonderful man she had married even if he was boring as most wonderful men were or that Richie Tozier would begin to expound on Funny Incidents in the Broadcasting Studio or that Eddie Kaspbrak would tell them what Teddy Kennedy was really like how much Robert Redford tipped or maybe offer some insights into why Ben had been able to give up the extra pounds while he had needed to hang onto his aspirator The fact is Bill thought Mike is going to start talking any minute now and Im not sure I want to hear what he has to say The fact is my heart is beating just a little too fast and my hands are just a little too cold The fact is Im just about twentyfive years too old to be this scared We all are So say something someone Lets talk of careers and spouses and what its like to look at your old playmates and realize that youve taken a few really good shots in the nose from time itself Lets talk about sex baseball the price of gas the future of the Warsaw Pact nations Anything but what we came here to talk about So say something some body Someone did Eddie Kaspbrak did But it was not what Teddy Kennedy was really like or how much Redford tipped or even why he had found it necessary to keep what Richie had sometimes called Eddies lungsucker in the old days He asked Mike when Stan Uris had died I could beg the question and say that since he didnt leave a note no one can know for sure Mike answered but since it happened almost immediately after I called him I think the assumption is safe enough He killed himself didnt he Beverly said dully Oh Godpoor Stan The others were looking at Mike who finished his drink and said He committed suicide yes Apparently went up to the bathroom shortly after I called him drew a bath got into it and cut his wrists Bill looked down the table which seemed suddenly lined with shocked pale facesno bodies only those faces like white circles Like white balloons moon balloons tethered here by an old promise that should have long since lapsed How did you find out Richie asked Was it carried in the papers up here No For some time now Ive subscribed to the newspapers of those towns closest to all of you I have kept tabs over the years Poor Stan Beverly repeated She seemed stunned unable to cope with the news But he was so brave back then So determined do they Bill asked stan was He moved his hands on the tablecloth trying to catch the right words He was an ordered person The kind of person who has to have his books divided up into fiction and nonfiction on his shelves and then wants to have each section in alphabetical order I can remember something he said onceI dont remember where we were or what we were doing at least not yet but I think it was toward the end of things He said he could stand to be scared but he hated being dirty That seemed to me the essence of Stan Maybe it was just too much when Mike called He saw his choices as being only two stay alive and get dirty or die clean Maybe people really dont change as much as we think Maybe they just maybe they just stiffenup There was a moment of silence and then Richie said All right Mike Whats happening in Derry Tell us I can tell you some Mike said I can tell you for instance whats happening nowand I can tell you some things about yourselves But I cant tell you everything that happened back in the summer of and I dont believe Ill ever have to Eventually youll remember it for yourselves And I think if I told you too much before your minds were ready to remember what happened to Stan He looked up and down the table and then his eyes fixed on Bills The first of the new murdersif youll allow me that rather grisly conceitbegan on the Main Street Bridge and ended underneath it The victim was a gay and rather childlike man named Adrian Mellon He had a bad case of asthma Eddies hand stole out and touched the side of his aspirator It happened last summer on July st the last night of the Canal Days Festival which was a kind of celebration a a A Derry ritual Bill said in a low voice His long fingers were slowly massaging his temples and it was not hard to guess he was thinking about his brother George George who had almost certainly opened the way the last time this had happened He told them the story of what had happened to Adrian Mellon quickly watching with no pleasure as their eyes got bigger and bigger He told them what the News had reported and what it had not the latter including the testimony of Don Hagarty and Christopher Unwin about a certain clown which had been under the bridge like the troll in the fabled story of yore a clown which had looked like a cross between Ronald McDonald and Bozo according to Hagarty It was him Ben said in a sick hoarse voice It was tHat fucker Penny Theres one other thing Mike said looking at Bill One of the investigating officersthe one who actually pulled Adrian Mellon out of the Canalwas a town cop named Harold Gardener Bill Beverly looked at him then put a hand on his arm Her voice was full of startled concern Bill whats wrong Harold would have been about five then Bill said His stunned eyes searched Mikes face for confirmation HHHarold Gardener was the sson of Dave Gardener Bill said dave lived down the street from us back then when George was kkilled He was the one who got to Juh juh to my brother first and brought him up to the house wrapped in a piece of ququilt They sat silently saying nothing Beverly put a hand briefly over her eyes It all fits rather too well doesnt it Mike said finally Yes Bill said in a low voice It fits all right Id kept tabs on the six of you over the years as I said Mike went on but it wasnt until then that I began to understand just why I had been doing it that it had a real and concrete purpose Still I held off waiting to see how things would develop You see I felt that I had to be absolutely sure before I disturbed your lives Not ninety percent not even ninetyfive percent One hundred was all that would do it In December of last year an eightyearold boy named Steven Johnson was found dead in Memorial Park Like Adrian Mellon he had been badly mutilated just before or just after his death but he looked as if he could have died of just plain fright How many in all Eddie asked not looking as if he really wanted to know It cant be Beverly cried I would have read about it in the paper seen it on the news When that crazy cop killed all those women in Castle Rock Maine and those children that were murdered in Atlanta Yes that Mike said Ive thought about that a lot Its really the closest correlative to whats going on here and Bevs right that really was coasttocoast news In some ways the Atlanta comparison is the thing about all of this that frightens me the most The murder of nine children we should have TV news correspondents here and phony psychics and reporters from The Atlantic Monthly and Rolling Stone the whole media circus in short No Mike answered it hasnt Oh there was a Sundaysupplement piece about it in the Portland Sunday Telegram and another one in the Boston Globe after the last two A Bostonbased television program called Good Day did a segment this February on unsolved murders and one of the experts mentioned the Derry murders but only passingly and he certainly gave no indication of knowing there had been a similar batch of murders in and another in  There are some ostensible reasons of course Atlanta New York Chicago Detroit those are big media towns and in big media towns when something happens it makes a bang There isnt a single TV or radio station in Derry unless you count the little FM the English and Speech Department runs up at the high school Bangors got the corner on the market when it comes to the media Except for the Derry News Eddie said and they all laughed But we all know that doesnt really cut it with the way the world is today The communication web is there and at some point the story should have broken nationally But it didnt And I think the reason is just this It doesnt want it to It Mike agreed If we have to call It something it might as well be what we used to call It Ive begun to think you see that It has been here so long whatever It really is that Its become a part of Derry something as much a part of the town as the Standpipe or the Canal or Bassey Park or the library Only Its not a matter of outward geography you understand Maybe that was true once but now Its inside Somehow Its gotten inside Thats the only way I know to understand all of the terrible things that have happened herethe nominally explicable as well as the utterly inexplicable There was a fire at a Negro nightclub called the Black Spot in A year before that a bunch of halfbright Depression outlaws was gunned down on Canal Street in the middle of the afternoon Thats what the histories say but thats not precisely true So far as Ive been able to find outand Id give a lot to believe that it wasnt so because I love this townthe Bradley Gang all seven of them were actually gunned down by the good citizens of Derry Ill tell you about it sometime There was the explosion at the Kitchener Ironworks during an Easteregg hunt in There was a horrible series of animal mutilations that same year that was finally traced to Andrew Rhulin the granduncle of the man who now runs the Rhulin Farms He was apparently bludgeoned to death by the three deputies who were supposed to bring him in None of the deputies were ever brought to trial Mike Hanlon produced a small notebook from an inner pocket and paged through it talking without looking up In there were four lynchings inside the incorporated town limits One of those that climbed a rope was the lay preacher of the Methodist Church who apparently drowned all four of his children in the bathtub as if they were kittens and then shot his wife in the head He put the gun in her hand to make it look like suicide but no one was fooled A year before that four loggers were found dead in a cabin downstream on the Kenduskeag literally torn apart Disappearances of children of whole families are recorded in old diary extracts but not in any public document It goes on and on but perhaps you get the idea I get the idea all right Ben said somethings going on here but its private Mike closed his notebook replaced it in his inner pocket and looked at them soberly If I were an insurance man instead of a librarian Id draw you a graph maybe It would show an unusually high rate of every violent crime we know of not excluding rape incest breaking and entering auto theft child abuse spouse abuse assault Theres a mediumsized city in Texas where the violentcrimerate is far below what youd expect for a city of its size and mixed racial makeup The extraordinary placidity of the people who live there has been traced to something in the water a natural trank of some kind The exact opposite holds true here Derry is a violent place to live in an ordinary year But every twentyseven yearsalthough the cycle has never been perfectly exactthat violence has escalated to a furious peak and it has never been national news Not at all An untreated cancer invariably kills Derry hasnt died on the contrary it has thrived in an unspectacular unnewsworthy way of course It is simply a fairly prosperous small city in a relatively unpopulous state where bad things happen too often and where ferocious things happen every quarter of a century or so Mike nodded All down the line  until roughly that must have been a bad one and on and on Right up to the present time I have a feeling that its been getting steadily worse maybe because there have been more people in Derry at the end of each cycle maybe for some other reason And in  the cycle appears to have come to a premature endFor which we were responsible Bill Denbrough leaned forward his eyes suddenly bright Youre sure of that Sure Yes Mike said All the other cycles reached their peak around September and then ended in a big way Life usually took on its more or less normal tenor by Christmas Easter at the latest In other words there were bad years of fourteen to twenty months every twentyseven years But the bad year that began when your brother was killed in October of ended quite abruptly in August of  Why Eddie asked urgently His breath had thinned Bill remembered that high whistle as Eddie inhaled breath and knew that he would soon be tooting on the old lungsucker What did we do The question hung there Mike seemed to regard it and at last he shook his head Youll remember he said In time youll remember Lisa Albrecht and Steven Johnson in late Mike said In February a boy named Dennis Torrio disappeared A highschool boy His body was found in midMarch in the Barrens Mutilated This was nearby He took a photograph from the same pocket into which he had replaced the notebook It made its way around the table Beverly and Eddie looked at it puzzled but Richie Tozier reacted violently He dropped it as if it were hot Jesus Jesus Mike He looked up his eyes wide and shocked A moment later he passed the picture to Bill Bill looked at it and felt the world swim into gray tones all around him For a moment he was sure he would pass out He heard a groan and knew he had made the sound He dropped the picture What is it he heard Beverly saying What does it mean Bill Its my brothers school picture Bill said at last Its JuhGeorgie The picture from his album The one that moved The one that winked They handed it around again then while Bill sat as still as stone at the head of the table looking out into space It was a photograph of a photograph The picture showed a tattered school photo propped up against a white backgroundsmiling lips parted to exhibit two holes where new teeth had never grown unless they grow in your coffin Bill thought and shuddered On the margin below Georges picture were the words SCHOOL FRIENDS It was found this year Beverly asked again Mike nodded and she turned to Bill When did you last see it Bill He wet his lips tried to speak Nothing came out He tried again hearing the words echo in his head aware of the stutter coming back fighting it fighting the terror I havent seen that picture since That spring the year after George died When I tried to show it to Richie it was ggone There was an explosive gasping sound that made them all look around Eddie was setting his aspirator back on the table and looking slightly embarrassed Eddie Kaspbrak blasts off Richie cried cheerfully and then suddenly and eerily the Voice of the MovieTone Newsreel Narrator came from Richs mouth Today in Derry a whole city turns out for Asthmatics on Parade and the star of the show is Big Ed the Snothead known all over New England as He stopped abruptly and one hand moved toward his face as if to cover his eyes and Bill suddenly thought Nono thats not it Not to cover his eyes but to push his glasses up on his nose The glasses that arent even there anymore Oh dear Christ whats going on here Eddie Im sorry Rich said That was cruel I dont know what the hell I was thinking about He looked around at the others bewildered Id promised myself after Steven Johnsons body was discovered that if anything else happenedif there was one more clear caseI would make the calls that I ended up not making for another two months It was as if I was hypnotized by what was happening by the consciousness of itthe deliberateness of it Georges picture was found by a fallen log less than ten feet from the Torrio boys body It wasnt hidden quite the contrary It was as if the killer wanted it to be found As Im sure the killer did How did you get the police photo Mike Ben asked Thats what it is isnt it Yes thats what it is Theres a fellow in the Police Department who isnt averse to making a little extra money I pay him twenty bucks a monthall that I can afford Hes a pipeline The body of Dawn Roy was found four days after the Torrio boy McCarron Park Thirteen years old Decapitated April rd of this year Adam Terrault Sixteen Reported missing when he didnt come home from band practice Found the next day just off the path that runs through the greenbelt behind West Broadway Also decapitated May th Frederick Cowan Two and a half Found in an upstairs bathroom drowned in the toilet Yeah its bad he said almost angrily dont you think I know that The police are convinced that it couldnt have beenwell some kind of accident Bev asked Mike shook his head His mother was hanging clothes in the back yard She heard sounds of a struggleheard her son screaming She ran as fast as she could As she went up the stairs she says she heard the sound of the toilet flushing repeatedlythat and someone laughing She said it didnt sound human Her son Mike said simply His back had been broken his skull fractured The glass door of the showerstall was broken There was blood everywhere The mother is in the Bangor Mental Health Institute now My my Police Department source says shes quite lost her mind Beverly gave him one Rich lit it with hands that shook badly The police line is that the killer came in through the front door while the Cowan boys mother was hanging her clothes in the back yard Then when she ran up the back stairs he supposedly jumped from the bathroom window into the yard shed just left and got away clean But the window is only one of those halfsized jobs a kid of seven would have to wriggle to get through it And the drop was twentyfive feet to a stoneflagged patio Rademacher doesnt like to talk about those things and no one in the presscertainly no one at the Newshas pressed him about them Mike took a drink of water and then passed another picture down the line This was not a police photograph it was another school picture It showed a grinning boy who was maybe thirteen He was dressed in his best for the school photo and his hands were clean and folded neatly in his lap but there was a devilish little glint in his eyes He was black Jeffrey Holly Mike said May th A week after the Cowan boy was killed Torn open He was found in Bassey Park by the Canal Nine days after that May nd a fifthgrader named John Feury was found dead out on Neibolt Street Eddie uttered a high quavering scream He groped for his aspirator and knocked it off the table It rolled down to Bill who picked it up Eddies face had gone a sickish yellow color His breath whistled coldly in his throat Get him something to drink Ben roared somebody get him But Eddie was shaking his head He triggered the aspirator down his throat His chest heaved as he tore in a gulp of air He triggered the aspirator again and then sat back eyes halfclosed panting Ill be all right he gasped Gimme a minute Im with you Eddie are you sure Beverly asked Maybe you ought to lie down Ill be all right he repeated querulously It was just the shock You know The shock Id forgotten all about Neibolt Street No one replied no one had to Bill thought You believe your capacity has been reached and then Mike produces another name and yet another like a black magician with a hatful of malign tricks and youre knocked onyour ass again It was too much to face all at once this outpouring of inexplicable violence somehow directly aimed at the six people hereor so Georges photograph seemed to suggest Both of John Feurys legs were gone Mike continued softly but the medical examiner says that happened after he died His heart gave out He seems to have quite literally died of fear He was found by the postman who saw a hand sticking out from under the porch It was wasnt it Rich said and Bill looked at him quickly Rich glanced back at him nodded slightly and then looked at Mike again Twentynine Neibolt Street Oh yes Mike said in that same calm voice It was number He drank more water Are you really all right Eddie Rademacher made an arrest the day after Feurys body was discovered Mike said There was a frontpage editorial in the News that same day calling for his resignation incidentally After eight murders Ben said Pretty radical of them wouldnt you say A guy who lives in a little shack way out on Route almost over the town line and into Newport Mike said Kind of a hermit Burns scrapwood in his stove roofed the place with scavenged shingles and hubcaps Name of Harold Earl Probably doesnt see two hundred dollars in cash money over the course of a year Someone driving by saw him standing out in his dooryard just looking up at the sky on the day John Feurys body was discovered His clothes were covered with blood He had three butchered deer in his shed Mike said Hed been jacking over in Haven The blood on his clothes was deerblood Rademacher asked him if he killed John Feury and Earl is supposed to have said Oh ayuh I killed a lot of people I shot most of them in the war He also said hed seen things in the woods at night Blue lights sometimes floating just a few inches off the ground Corpselights he called them And Bigfoot They sent him up to the Bangor Mental Health According to the medical report his livers almost entirely gone Hes been drinking paintthinner and is prone to hallucinations Theyve been holding on to him and until three days ago Rademacher was sticking to his idea that Earl was the most likely suspect He had eight guys out there digging around his shack and looking for the missing heads lampshades made out of human skin God knows what Mike paused head lowered and then went on His voice was slightly hoarse now Id held off and held off But when I saw this last one I made the calls I wish to God Id made them sooner The victim was another fifthgrader Mike said A classmate of the Feury boy He was found just off Kansas Street near where Bill used to hide his bike when we were in the Barrens His name was Jerry Bellwood He was torn apart What what was left of him was found at the foot of a cement retaining wall that was put in along most of Kansas Street about twenty years ago to stop the soil erosion This police photograph of the section of that wall where Bellwood was found was taken less than half an hour after the body was removed Here He passed the picture to Rich Tozier who looked and passed it on to Beverly She glanced at it briefly winced and passed it on to Eddie who gazed at it long and raptly before handing it on to Ben Ben passed it to Bill with barely a glance Printing straggled its way across the concrete retaining wall It said image of the handwritten words COME HOME COME HOME COME HOME Bill looked up at Mike grimly He had been bewildered and frightened now he felt the first stirrings of anger He was glad Angry was not such a great way to feel but it was better than the shock better than the miserable fear Is that written in what I think its written in Yes Mike said Jerry Bellwoods blood Mike had taken his photographs back He had an idea that Bill might ask for the one of Georges last school picture but Bill did not He put them in his inside jacket pocket and when they were out of sight all of themMike includedfelt a sense of relief Nine children Beverly was saying softly I cant believe it I mean I can believe it but I cant believe it Nine kids and nothing Nothing at all Its not quite like that Mike said People are angry people are scared or so it seems Its really impossible to tell which ones really feel that way and which ones are faking Beverly do you remember when we were kids the man who just folded his newspaper and went inside his house while you were screaming at him for help For a moment something seemed to jump in her eyes and she looked both terrified and aware Then she only looked puzzled No when was that Mike Never mind It will come to you in time All I can say now is that everything iooks the way it should in Derry Faced with such a grisly string of murders people are doing all the things youd expect them to do and most of them are the same things that went on while kids were disappearing and getting murdered back in The Save Our Children Committee is meeting again only this time at Derry Elementary School instead of Derry High There are sixteen detectives from the State Attorney Generals office in town and a contingent of FBI agents as wellI dont know how many and although Rademacher talks big I dont think he does either The curfews back in effect Oh yes The curfew Ben was rubbing the side of his neck slowly and deliberately That did wonders back in I remember that much and there are Mothers Walker Groups to make sure that every child who goes to school grades K through eight is chaperoned home The News has gotten over two thousand letters demanding a solution in the last three weeks alone And of course the outmigration has begun again I sometimes think thats the only way to really tell whos sincere about wanting it stopped and who isnt The really sincere ones get scared and leave It happens each time the cycle cranks up again Its impossible to tell just how many go because the cycle hasnt fallen squarely in a census year since or so But its a fairish number They run like kids who just found out the house was haunted for real after all Come home come home come home Beverly said softly When she looked up from her hands it was Bill she looked at not Mike It wanted us to come back Why It may want us all back Mike said a little cryptically sure It may It may want revenge After all we balked It once before revenge or just to set things back in order Bill said Mike nodded Things are out of order with your own lives too you know None of you left Derry untouched without Its mark on you All of you forgot what happened here and your memories of that summer are still only fragmentary And then theres the passingly curious fact that youre all rich Be soft be soft Mike said holding his hand up and smiling faintly Im not accusing you of anything just trying to get the facts out on the table You are rich by the standards of a smalltown librarian who makes just under eleven grand a year after taxes okay Rich shrugged the shoulders of his expensive suit uncomfortably Ben appeared deeply absorbed in tearing small strips from the edge of his napkin No one was looking directly at Mike except Bill None of you are in the H L Hunt class certainly Mike said but you are all welltodo even by the standards of the American uppermiddle class Were all friends here so fess up if theres one of you who declared less than ninety thousand dollars on his or her tax return raise your hand They glanced around at each other almost furtively embarrassed as Americans always seem to be by the raw fact of their own successas if cash were hardcooked eggs and affluence the farts that inevitably follow an overdose of same Bill felt hot blood in his cheeks and was helpless to stop its rise He had been paid ten thousand more than the sum Mike had mentioned just for doing the first draft of the Attic Room screenplay He had been promised an additional twenty thousand dollars each for two rewrites if needed Then there were royalties and the hefty advance on a twobook contract just signed how much had he declared on his tax return Just about eight hundred thousand dollars right Enough anyway to seem almost monstrous in light of Mike Hanlons stated income of just under eleven thousand a year So thats how much they pay you to keep the lighthouse Mike old kid Bill thought Jesus Christ somewhere along the line you should have asked for a raise Mike said Bill Denbrough a successful novelist in a society where there are only a few novelists and fewer still lucky enough to be making a living from the craft Beverly Rogan whos in the rag trade a field to which more are called but even fewer chosen She is in fact the most soughtafter designer in the middle third of the country right now Oh its not me Beverly said She uttered a nervous little laugh and lit a fresh cigarette from the smoldering stub of the old one Its Tom Toms the one Without him Id still be relining skirts and sewing up hems I dont have any business sense at all even Tom says so Its just you know Tom And luck She took a single deep drag from her cigarette and then snuffed it She turned quickly in her seat and gave him a hard look her color high Just whats that supposed to mean Richie Tozier Doan hits me Miz Scawlett Richie cried in a high trembling Pickaninny Voiceand in that moment Bill could see with an eerie clarity the boy he had known he was not just a superseded presence lurking under Rich Toziers grownup exterior but a creature almost more real than the man himself doan hits me Lemme bring you anothuh mint joolip Miz Scawlett Youse goan drink hit out on de poch where its be a little bit cooluh Doan whup disyere boy Youre impossible Richie Beverly said coldly You ought to grow up Richie looked at her his grin fading slowly into uncertainty Until I came back here he said I thought I had Rich you may just be the most successful disc jockey in the United States Mike said Youve certainly got LA in the palm of your hand On top of that there are two syndicated programs one of them a straight topforty countdown show the other one something called The Freaky Forty You better watch out fool Richie said in a gruff Mr T Voice but he was blushing Ill make your front and back change places Ill give you brainsurgery with my fist Ill Eddie Mike went on ignoring Richie youve got a healthy limousine service in a city where you just about have to elbow long black cars out of your way when you cross the street Two limo companies a week go smash in the Big Apple but youre doing fine Ben youre probably the most successful young architect in the world Ben opened his mouth probably to protest and then closed it again abruptly Mike smiled at them spread his hands I dont want to embarrass anyone but I do want all the cards on the table There are people who succeed young and there are people who succeed in highly specialized jobsif there werent people who bucked the odds successfully I guess everybody would give up If it was just one or two of you we could pass it off as coincidence But its not just one or two its all of you and that includes Stan Uris who was the most successful young accountant in Atlanta which means in the whole South My conclusion is that your success stems from what happened here twentyseven years ago If you had all been exposed to asbestos at that time and had all developed lung cancer by now the correlative would be no less clear or persuasive Do any of you want to dispute it You kept the lighthouse Ben said Bill jerked around and looked at him startled but Ben was staring hard at Mike and didnt see That doesnt make me feel so good Mike In fact it makes me feel sort of like a bugturd Mike shook his head patiently You have nothing to feel guilty about any of you Do you think it was my choice to stay here any more than it was your choiceany of youto leave Hell we were kids For one reason or another your parents moved away and you guys were part of the baggage they took along My parents stayed And was it really their decisionany of them I dont think so How was it decided who would go and who would stay Was it luck Fate It Some Other I dont know But it wasnt us guys So quit it Ive been too busy to be bitter Mike said Ive spent a long time watching and waiting I was watching and waiting even before I knew it I think but for the last five years or so Ive been on what you might call red alert Since the turn of the year Ive been keeping a journal And when a man writes he thinks harder or maybe just more specifically And one of the things Ive spent time writing and thinking about is the nature of It It changes we know that I think It also manipulates and leaves Its marks on people just by the nature of what It isthe way you can smell a skunk on you even after a long bath if it lets go its bag of scent too near you The way a grasshopper will spit bug juice into your palm if you catch it in your hand Mike slowly unbuttoned his shirt and spread it wide They could all see the pinkish scrawls of scar across the smooth brown skin of his chest between the nipples The werewolf Richie almost moaned Oh Christ Big Bill the werewolf When we went back to Neibolt Street What Bill asked He sounded like a man called out of a dream What Richie I I almost do Looking both confused and scared Richie subsided Are you saying this thing isnt evil Eddie asked Mike abruptly He was staring at the scars as if hypnotized That its just some part of the the natural order Its no part of a natural order we understand or condone Mike said rebuttoning his shirt and I see no reason to operate on any other basis than the one we do understand that It kills kills children and thats wrong Bill understood that before any of us Do you remember Bill I remember that I wanted to kill It Bill said and for the first time and ever after he heard the pronoun gain propernoun status in his own voice But I didnt have much of a worldview on the subject if you see what I meanI just wanted to kill It because It killed George Bill considered this carefully He looked down at his spread hands on the table and remembered George in his yellow slicker his hood up the paper boat with its thin glaze of paraffin in one hand He looked up at Mike Mike nodded as if this were exactly what he had expected It left Its mark on us It worked Its will on us just as It has worked Its will on this whole town day in and day out even during those long periods when It is asleep or hibernating or whatever It does between Its more more lively periods But if It worked Its will on us at some point in some way we aho worked our will on It We stopped It before It was doneI know we did Did we weaken It Hurt It Did we in fact almost kill It I think we did I think we came so close to killing It that we went away thinking we had But you dont remember that part either do you Ben asked No I can remember everything up until August th with almost perfect clarity But from then until September th or so when school was called in again everything is a total blank It isnt murky or hazy it is just completely gone With one exception I seem to remember Bill screaming about something called the deadlights Bills arm jerked convulsively It struck one of his empty beer bottles and the bottle shattered on the floor like a bomb No he said His voice was harsh and dry His arms had broken out in gooseflesh It seemed that his skull had somehow grown he could feel it pressing out against the stretched skin of his face in steady numbing throbs No just sit down He wanted to look at her and couldnt He couldnt take No he said His mouth felt the way it did when the dentist got a little too enthusiastic with the novocaine You will anyway Mike said But for now no Not me either Do any of you But we did something Mike said quietly At some point we were able to exercise some sort of group will At some point we achieved some special understanding whether conscious or unconscious He stirred restlessly God wish Stan was here I have a feeling that Stan with his ordered mind might have had some idea Maybe he did Beverly said Maybe thats why he killed himself Maybe he understood that if there was magic it wouldnt work for grownups I think it could though Mike said Because theres one other thing we six have in common I wonder if any of you have realized what that is It was Bills turn to open his mouth and then shut it again Go on Mike said You know what it is I can see it on your face Im not sure I know Bill replied but I think wwere all childless Is that ihit Jesus Christ Almighty Eddie spoke up indignantly What in the world does that have to do with the price of beans in Peru What gave you the idea that everyone in the world has to have kids Thats nuts If youve been keeping track of us all the way you said then you know goddam well we dont But I still say it doesnt mean a damn thing We dont use birth control if thats what you mean Eddie spoke with an oddly moving dignity but his cheeks were flushed It just so happens that my wife is a little Oh hell Shes a lot overweight We went to see a doctor and she told us my wife might never have kids if she didnt lose some weight Does that make us criminals Dont call me Eds and dont you dare pinch my cheek he cried rounding on Richie You know I hate that I always hated it No children she said Also no birth control Tom wants kids and so do I of course she added hastily glancing around at them quickly Bill thought her eyes seemed overbright almost the eyes of an actress giving a good performance It just hasnt happened yet Oh yes of course she said and uttered a light laugh that was almost a titter And in one of those leaps of comprehension that sometimes come to people who are gifted with both curiosity and insight Bill suddenly understood a great deal about Beverly and her husband Tom alias the Greatest Man in the World Beverly had gone to have fertility tests His guess was that the Greatest Man in the World had refused to entertain even for a moment the notion that there might be something wrong with the sperm being manufactured in the Sacred Sacs What about you and your wife Big Bill Rich asked Been trying They all looked at him curiously because his wife was someone they knew Audra was by no means the bestknown or the bestloved actress in the world but she was certainly part of the celebrity coinage that had somehow replaced talent as a medium of exchange in the latter half of the twentieth century there had been a picture of her in People magazine when she cut her hair short and during a particularly boring stretch in New York the play she had been planning to do Off Broadway fell through she had done a weeklong stint on Holly wood Squares over her agents strenuous objections She was a stranger whose lovely face was known to them He thought Beverly looked particularly curious Weve been trying off and on for the last six years Bill said For the last eight months or so its been off because of the movie we were doingAttic Room its called You know we run a little entertainment syndic every day from fivefifteen in the afternoon until fivethirty Richie said seein Stars its called They had a feature on that damned movie just last weekHusband and Wife Working Happily Together kind of thing They said both of your names and I never made the connection Funny isnt it Very Bill said Anyway Audra said it would be just our luck if she caught pregnant while we were in preproduction and she had to do ten weeks of strenuous acting and being morningsick at the same time But we want kids yes And weve tried quite hard Had fertility tests Ben asked Uhhuh Four years ago in New York The doctors discovered a very small benign tumor in Audras womb and they said it was a lucky thing because although it wouldnt have prevented her from getting pregnant it might have caused a tubal pregnancy She and I are both fertile though No little accidents on your front Ben Bill asked He was shocked and amused to find that his mouth had very nearly called Ben Haystack instead Ive never been married Ive always been careful and there have been no paternity suits Ben said Beyond that I dont think theres any real way of telling You want to hear a funny story Richie asked He was smiling but there was no smile in his eyes Sure Bill said You were always good at the funny stuff Richie Your face and me own buttocks boyo Richie said in the Irish Cops Voice It was a great Irish Cops Voice Youve improved out of all measure Richie Bill thought As a kid you couldnt do an Irish Cop no matter how you busted your brains Except once or twice when Your face and me own buttocks just keep rememb rin that compayrison me foine bucko Ben Hanscom suddenly held his nose and cried in a high quavering boyish voice Beepbeep Richie Beepbeep Beepbeep After a moment laughing Eddie held his own nose and joined in Beverly did the same Awright Awright Richie cried laughing himself Awright I give up Chrissake Oh man Eddie said He collapsed back in his chair laughing so hard he was almost crying We gotcha that time Trashmouth Way to go Ben Beepbeep Bev said and giggled I forgot all about that We always used to beep you Richie You guys never appreciated true talent thats all Richie said comfortably As in the old days you could knock him offbalance but he was like one of those inflatable Joe Palooka dolls with sand in the basehe floated upright again almost at once That was one of your little contributions to the Losers Club wasnt it Haystack What a man Richie said in a trembling awestruck voice and then began to salaam over the table nearly sticking his nose in his teacup each time he went down What a man Oh chillun what a man Beepbeep Richie Ben said solemnly and then exploded laughter in a hearty baritone utterly unlike his wavering childhood voice Youre the same old roadrunner You guys want to hear this story or not Richie asked I mean no big deal one way or the other Beep away if you want to I can take abuse I mean youre looking at a man who once did an interview with Ozzy Osbourne Tell it Bill said He glanced over at Mike and saw that Mike looked happieror more at restsince the luncheon had begun Was it because he saw the almost unconscious knittingtogether that was happening the sort of easy fallingback into old roles that almost never happened when old chums got together Bill thought so And he thought If there are certain preconditions for the belief in magic that makes it possible to use the magic then maybe those preconditions will inevitably arrange themselves It was not a very comforting thought It made him feel like a man strapped to the nosecone of a guided missile Well Richie was saying I could make this long and sad or I could give you the Blondie and Dagwood comicstrip version but Ill settle for something in the middle The year after I moved out to California I met a girl and we fell pretty hard for each other Started living together She was on the pill at first but it made her feel sick almost all the time She talked about getting an IUD but I wasnt too crazy about thatthe first stories about how they might not be completely safe were just starting to come out in the papers We had talked a lot about kids and had pretty well decided we didnt want them even if we decided to legalize the relationship Irresponsible to bring kids into such a shitty dangerous overpopulated world and blahblahblah babblebabblebabble lets go out and put a bomb in the mens room of the Bank of America and then come on back to the crashpad and smoke some dope and talk about the difference between Maoism and Trotskyism if you see what I mean Or maybe Im being too hard on both of us Shit we were young and reasonably idealistic The upshot was that I got my wires cut as the Beverly Hills crowd puts it with their unfailing vulgar chic The operation went with no problem and I had no adverse aftereffects There can be you know I had a friend whose balls swelled up to roughly the size of the tires on a Cadillac I was gonna give him a pair of suspenders and a couple of barrels for his birthdaysort of a designer trussbut they went down before then All put with your customary tact and dignity Bill remarked and Beverly began to laugh again Richie offered a large sincere smile Thank you Bill for those words of support The word fuck was used two hundred and six times in your last book I counted Beepbeep Trashmouth Bill said solemnly and they all laughed Bill found it nearly impossible to believe they had been talking about dead children less than ten minutes ago Sandy and I lived together for two and a half years Richie went on Came really close to getting married twice As things turned out I guess we saved ourselves a lot of heartache and all that communityproperty bullshit by keeping it simple She got an offer to join a corporate lawfirm in Washington around the same time I got an offer to come to KLAD as a weekend jocknot much but a foot in the door She told me it was her big chance and I had to be the most insensitive male chauvinist oinker in the United States to be dragging my feet and furthermore shed had it with California anyway I told her I also had a chance So we thrashed it out and we trashed each other out and at the end of all the thrashing and trashing Sandy went About a year after that I decided to try and get the vasectomy reversed No real reason for it and I knew from the stuff Id read that the chances were pretty spotty but I thought what the hell Nothats the funny part of it Richie said frowning I just woke up one day with this I dunno this hobbyhorse about getting it reversed You must have been nuts Eddie said General anesthetic instead of a local Surgery Maybe a week in the hospital afterward Yeah the doctor told me all of that stuff Richie replied And I told him I wanted to go ahead anyway I dont know why The doc asked me if I understood the aftermath of the operation was sure to be painful while the result was only going to be a cointoss at best I said I did He said okay and I asked him whenmy attitude being the sooner the better you know So he says hold your horses son hold your horses the first step is to get a sperm sample just to make sure the reversal operation is necessary I said Come on I had the exam after the vasectomy It worked He told me that sometimes the vasa reconnected spontaneously Yo mamma I says Nobody ever told me that He said the chances were very smallinfinitesimal reallybut because the operation was so serious we ought to check it out So I popped into the mens room with a Fredericks of Hollywood catalogue and jerked off into a Dixie cup Yeah youre right Richie said The part about the Fredericks catalogue is a lieyou never find anything that good in a doctors office Anyway the doc called me three days later and asked me which I wanted first the good news or the bad news The good news is the operation wont be necessary he said The bad news is that anybody youve been to bed with over the last two or three years could hit you with a paternity suit pretty much at will Are you saying what I think youre saying I asked him Im telling you that you arent shooting blanks and havent been for quite awhile now he said Millions of little wigglies in your sperm sample Your days of going gaily in bareback with no questions asked have temporarily come to an end Richard I thanked him and hung up Then I called Sandy in Washington Rich she says to me and Richies voice suddenly became the voice of this girl Sandy whom none of them had ever met It was not an imitation or even a likeness exactly it was more like an auditory painting Its great to hear from you I got married Yeah thats great I said You should have let me know I would have sent you a blender So I said Sure same old Richie always full of gags By the way Sandy you didnt happen to have a kid or anything after you left LA did you Or maybe an unscheduled d and c or something That gag isnt so funny Rich she said and I had a brainwave that she was getting ready to hang up on me so I told her what happened She started laughing only this time it was real hardshe was laughing the way I always used to laugh with you guys like somebody had told her the worlds biggest bellybuster So when she finally starts slowing down I ask her what in Gods name is funny Its just so wonderful she said This time the jokes on you After all these years the joke is finally on Records Tozier How many bastards have you sired since I came east Rich I take it that means you still havent experienced the joys of motherhood I ask her Im due in July she says Were there any more questions Yeah I go When did you change your mind about the immorality of bringing children into such a shitty world When I finally met a man who wasnt a shit she answers and hangs up Bill began to laugh He laughed until tears rolled down his cheeks Yeah Richie said I think she cut it off quick so shed really get the last word but she could have hung on the line all day I know when Ive been aced I went back to the doctor a week later and asked him if he could be a little clearer on the odds against that sort of spontaneous regeneration He said hed talked with some of his colleagues about the matter It turned out that in the threeyear period the California branch of the AMA logged twentythree reports of spontaneous regeneration Six of those turned out to be simply botched operations Six others were either hoaxes or consguys looking to take a bite out of some doctors bank account So eleven real ones in three years So I went and beat Irish Sweepstakes odds Richie said and still no kid to show for it That give you any good chucks Eds No Bill said it doesnt prove a thing But it certainly suggests a link The question is what do we do now Have you thought about that Mike Ive thought about it sure Mike said but it was impossible to decide anything until you all got together again and talked the way youve been doing There was no way I could predict how this reunion would go until it actually happened Ive got one idea he said but before I tell you what it is I think we have to agree on whether or not we have business to do here Do we want to try again to do what we tried to do once before Do we want to try to kill It again Or do we just divide the check up six ways and go back to what we were doing It seems as if Beverly began but Mike shook his head at her He wasnt done You have to understand that our chances of success are impossible to predict I know theyre not good just as I know they would have been a little better if Stan was here too Still not real good but better With Stan gone the circle we made that day is broken I dont really think we can destroy Itf or even send It away for a little while as we did before with a broken circle I think It will kill us one by one by one and probably in some extremely horrible ways As children we made a complete circle in some way I dont understand even now I think that if we agree to go ahead well have to try to form a smaller circle I dont know if that can be done I believe it might be possible to think wed done it only to discoverwhen it was too latewell that it was too late Mike regarded them again eyes sunken and tired in his brown face so I think we need to take a vote Stay and try it again or go home Those are the choices I got you here on the strength of an old promise I wasnt even sure youd remember but I cant hold you here on the strength of that promise The results of that would be worse and more of it He looked at Bill and in that moment Bill understood what was coming He dreaded it was helpless to stop it and then with the same feeling of relief he imagined must come to a suicide when he takes his hands off the wheel of the speeding car and simply uses them to cover his eyes he accepted it Mike had gotten them here Mike had laid it all neatly out for them and now he was relinquishing the mantle of leadership He intended that mantle to go back to the person who had worn it in Before I do Bill said ddoes everyone understand the question You were going to say something Bev All right I gguess the question is do we stay and fight or do we forget the whole thing Those in favor of staying No one at the table moved at all for perhaps five seconds and Bill was reminded of auctions he had attended where the price on an item suddenly soared into the stratosphere and those who didnt want to bid anymore almost literally played statues one was afraid to scratch an itch or wave a fly off the end of ones nose for fear the auctioneer would take it for another five grand or twentyfive Bill thought of Georgie Georgie who had meant no one any harm who had only wanted to get out of the house after being cooped up all week Georgie with his color high his newspaper boat in one hand snapping the buckles of his yellow rainslicker with die other Georgie thanking him and then bending over and kissing Bills feverheated cheek Thanks Bill Its a neat boat He felt the old rage rise in him but he was older now and his perspective was wider It wasnt just Georgie now A horrid slew of names marched through his head Betty Ripsom found frozen into the ground Cheryl Lamonica fished out of the Kenduskeag Matthew Clements torn from his tricycle Veronica Grogan nine years old and found in a sewer Steven Johnson Lisa Albrecht all the others and God only knew how many of the missing He raised his hand slowly and said Lets kill It This time lets really kill It For a moment his hand hung there alone like the hand of the only kid in class who knows the right answer the one all the other kids hate Then Richie sighed raised his own hand and said What the hell It cant be any worse than interviewing Ozzy Osbourne Beverly raised her hand Her color was back now but in hectic patches that flared along her cheekbones She looked both tremendously excited and scared to death Eddie Kaspbrak sat back in his chair looking as if he wished he could actually melt into it and thus disappear His face thin and delicatelooking was miserably afraid as he looked first right and then left and then back to Bill For a moment Bill felt sure Eddie was simply going to push back his chair rise and bolt from the room without looking back Then he raised one hand in the air and grasped his aspirator tightly in the other Way to go Eds Richie said Were really gonna have ourselves some chucks this time I bet So whats your one idea Mike Bill asked The mood had been broken by Rose the hostess who had come in with a dish of fortune cookies She looked around at the six people who had their hands in the air with a carefully polite lack of curiosity They lowered them hastily and no one said anything until Rose was gone again Its simple enough Mike said but it might be pretty damn dangerous too I think we ought to split up for the rest of the day I think each of us ought to go back to the place in Derry he or she remembers best outside the Barrens that is I dont think any of us should go therenot yet Think of it as a series of walkingtours if you like Im not entirely sure You have to understand that Im going pretty much on intuition here But this has got a good beat and you can dance to it Richie said The others smiled Mike did not he nodded instead Thats as good a way of putting it as any Going on intuition is like picking up a beat and dancing to it Using intuition is a hard thing for grownups to do and thats the main reason I think it might be the right thing for us to do Kids after all operate on it about eighty percent of the time at least until theyre fourteen or so I suppose so Anyway thats my idea If no specific place to go comes to you just follow your feet and see where they take you Then we meet tonight at the library and talk over what happened Mike shook his head I have no idea I think whatever happens is apt to be unpleasant I think its even possible that one of us may not turn up at the library tonight No reason for thinking that except that intuition thing again Why alone Beverly asked finally If were supposed to do this as a group why do you want us to start alone Mike Especially if the risk really turns out to be as high as you think it might be It started alone for each of us Bill said to Beverly I dont remember everythingnot yetbut I sure remember that much The picture in Georges room that moved Bens mummy The leper that Eddie saw under the porch on Neibolt Street Mike finding the blood on the grass near the Canal in Bassey Park And the bird there was something about a bird wasnt there Mike Yes but not as friendly as the one on Sesame Street Richie cackled wildly derrys answer to James Brown Gets Off A Good One Oh chillun is we blessed or is we blessed For you it was the voice from the pipe and the blood that came out of the drain Bill said to Beverly And for Richie But here he paused puzzled I must be the exception that proves the rule Big Bill Richie said The first time I came in contact with anything that summer that was weirdI mean really bigleague weirdwas in Georges room with you When you and I went back to your house that day and looked at his photo album The picture of Center Street by the Canal started to move Do you remember Yes Bill said But are you sure there was nothing before that Richie Nothing at all I Something flickered in Richies eyes He said slowly Well there was the day Henry and his friends chased mebefore the end of school this was and I got away from them in the toy department of Freeses I went up by City Center and sat down on a park bench for awhile and I thought I saw but that was just something I dreamed Nothing Richie said almost brusquely A dream Really He looked at Mike I dont mind taking a walk though Itll kill the afternoon Views of the old homestead And well meet at the library tonight at when do you suggest Mike Seven oclock Ring the bell if youre late The libe closes at seven on weekdays until summer vacation starts for the kids Seven it is Bill said and let his eyes range soberly over them And be careful You want to remember that none of us really knows what were dddoing Think of this as reconnaissance If you should see something dont fight Run Im a lover not a fighter Richie said in a dreamy Michael Jackson Voice Well if were going to do it we ought to get going Ben said A small smile pulled up the left corner of his mouth It was more bitter than amused Although Ill be damned if I could tell you right this minute where Im going to go if the Barrens are out That was the best of it for megoing down there with you guys His eyes moved to Beverly held there for a moment moved away I cant think of anyplace else that means very much to me Probably Ill just wander around for a couple of hours looking at buildings and getting wet feet Youll find a place to go Haystack Richie said Visit some of your old foodstops and gas up Ben laughed My capacitys gone down a lot since I was eleven Im so full you guys may just have to roll me out of here Wait a sec Beverly cried as they began to push back from their chairs The fortune cookies Dont forget those Yeah Richie said I can see mine now YOU WILL SOON BE EATEN UP BY A LARGE MONSTER HAVE A NICE DAY They laughed and Mike passed the little bowl of fortune cookies to Richie who took one and then sent it on around the table Bill noticed that no one opened his or her cookie until each had one they sat with the little hatshaped cookies either in front of them or held in their hands and even as Beverly still smiling picked hers up Bill felt a cry rising in his throat No No dont do that its part of it put it back dont open it But it was too late Beverly had broken hers open Ben was doing the same to his Eddie was cutting into his with the edge of his fork and just before Beverlys smile turned to a grimace of horror Bill had time to think We knew somehow we knew because no one simply bit into his or her fortune cookie That would have been the normal thing to do but no one did it Somehow some pan of us still remembers everything And he found that insensate underknowledge somehow the most horrifying realization of all it spoke more eloquently than Mike could have about how surely and deeply It had touched each one of them and how Its touch was still upon them Blood spurted up from Beverlys fortune cookie as if from a slashed artery It splashed across her hand and then gouted onto the white napery which covered the table staining it a bright red that sank in and then spread out in grasping pink fingers Eddie Kaspbrak uttered a strangled cry and pushed himself away from the table with such a sudden revolted confusion of arms and legs that his chair nearly tipped over A huge bug its chitinous carapace an ugly yellowbrown was pushing its way out of his fortune cookie as if from a cocoon Its obsidian eyes stared blindly forward As it lurched onto Eddies breadandbutter plate cookie crumbs fell from its back in a little shower that Bill heard clearly and which came back to haunt his dreams when he slept for awhile later that afternoon As it freed itself entirely it rubbed its thin rear legs together producing a dry reedy hum and Bill realized it was some sort of terribly mutated cricket It lumbered to the edge of the dish and tumbled onto the tablecloth on its back Oh God Richie managed in a choked voice Oh God Big Bill its an eye dear God its an eye a fucking eye Bills head snapped around and he saw Richie staring down at his fortune cookie his lips drawn back from his teeth in a kind of sickened leer A chunk of his cookies glazed surface had fallen onto the tablecloth revealing a hole from which a human eyeball stared with glazed intensity Cookie crumbs were scattered across its blank brown iris and embedded in its sclera Ben Hanscom threw hisnot a calculated throw but the startled reaction of a person who has been utterly surprised by some piece of nasty work As his fortune cookie rolled across the table Bill saw two teeth inside its hollow their roots dark with clotted blood They raided together like seeds in a hollow gourd He looked back at Beverly and saw she was hitching in breath to scream Her eyes were fixed on the thing that had crawled out of Eddies cookie the thing that was now kicking its sluggish legs as it lay overturned on the tablecloth Bill got moving He was not thinking only reacting Intuition he thought crazily as he lunged out of his seat and clapped his hand over Beverlys mouth just before she could utter the scream Here I am acting on intuition Mike should be proud of me What came out of Beverlys mouth was not a scream but a strangled Mmmmph Eddie was making those whistling sounds that Bill remembered so well No problem there a good honk on the old lungsucker would set Eddie right Right as a trivet Freddie Firestone would have said and Bill wonderednot for the first timewhy a person had such weird thoughts at times like these He glanced around fiercely at the others and what came out was something else from that summer something that sounded both impossibly archaic and exactly right dummy up All of you Not one sound Just dummy up Rich wiped a hand across his mouth Mikes complexion had gone a dirty gray but he nodded at Bill All of them moved away from the table Bill had not opened his own fortune cookie but now he could see its sides moving slowly in and outbulge and relax bulge and relax bulge and relaxas his own partyfavor tried to escape Mmmmmph Beverly said against his hand again her breath tickling his palm Her face seemed to be all eyes Her mouth twitched Bill Bill did you see Her eyes strayed back to the cricket and then fixed there The cricket appeared to be dying Its rugose eyes stared back at her and presently Beverly began to moan You can You hhave to He heard footsteps light and quick coming up the short hall on the other side of the beaded curtain He looked around at the others All of you Pull up to the table Talk Look natural Beverly looked at him eyes pleading and Bill shook his head He sat down and pulled his chair in trying not to look at the fortune cookie on his plate It had swelled like some unimaginable boil which was filling with pus And still it pulsed slowly in and out I could have bitten into that he thought faintly Eddie triggered his aspirator down his throat again gasping mist into his lungs in a long thin screaming sound So who do you thinks going to win the pennant Bill asked Mike smiling insanely Rose came through the curtain just then her face politely questioning Out of the corner of his eye Bill saw that Bev had pulled up to the table again Good girl he thought FFine Bill said He cocked a thumb in Eddies direction Our friend had an asthma attack He took his medication Hes better now Was good Her eyes surveyed the table again a bit of doubt overlaying a deep well of serenity She did not see the cricket the eye the teeth or the way Bills fortune cookie appeared to be breathing Her eye similarly passed over the bloodstain splotched on the tablecloth without trouble Everything was very good Beverly said and smileda more natural smile than either Bills or Mikes It seemed to set Roses mind at rest convinced her that if something had gone wrong in here it had been the fault of neither Roses service nor her kitchen Girls got a lot of guts Bill thought Well Richie said I dont know about the others but I for one got a real eyeful Bill heard a minute cracking sound He looked down at his plate and saw a leg poking blindly out of his fortune cookie It scraped at his plate I could have bitten into that he thought again but held onto his smile Very fine he said Richie was looking at Bills plate A great grayishblack fly was slowing birthing itself from the collapsing remains of his cookie It buzzed weakly Yellowish goo flowed sluggishly out of the cookie and puddled on the tablecloth There was a smell now the bland thick smell of an infected wound Well if I can help you in no way at this moment Not right now Ben said A wonderful meal Most most unusual I leave you then she said and bowed out through the beaded curtain The beads were still swaying and clacking together when all of them pushed away from the table again What is it Ben asked huskily looking at the thing on Bills plate A fly Bill said A mutant fly Courtesy of a writer named George Langlahan I think He wrote a story called The Fly A movie was made out of itnot a terribly good one But the story scared the bejesus out of me Its up to Its old tricks all right That fly business has been on my mind a lot lately because Ive sort of been planning this novelRoadbugs Ive been thinking of calling it I know the title sounds ppretty stupid but you see Excuse me Beverly said distantly I have to vomit I think Bill shook out his napkin and threw it over the fly which was the size of a baby sparrow Nothing so large could have come from something as small as a Chinese fortune cookie but it had It buzzed twice under the napkin and then fell silent Lets get the righteous fuck out of here Mike said We can meet Bev in the lobby Beverly was just coming out of the womens room as they gathered by the cash register She looked pale but composed Mike paid the check kissed Roses cheek and then they all went out into the rainy afternoon Im staying she said Bill what did you mean when you said Its up to Its old tricks Ive been thinking about writing a bug story he said That Langlahan story had woven itself into my thinking And so I saw a fly Yours was blood Beverly Why was blood on your mind I guess because of the blood from the drain Beverly said at once The blood that came out of the bathroom drain in the old place when I was eleven But was that really it She didnt really think so Because what had flashed immediately to mind when the blood spurted across her fingers in a warm little jet had been the bloody footprint she had left behind her after stepping on the broken perfume bottle Tom And Not just a bug Eddie said A cricket There are crickets in our basement Twohundredthousanddollar house and we cant get rid of the crickets They drive us crazy at night A couple of nights before Mike called I had a really terrible nightmare I dreamed I woke up and my bed was full of crickets I was trying to shoot them with my aspirator but all it would do when I squeezed it was make crackling noises and just before I woke up I realized it was full of crickets too The hostess didnt see any of it Ben said He looked at Beverly Like your folks never saw the blood that came out of the drain even though it was everywhere They stood looking at each other in the fine spring rain Mike looked at his watch Therell be a bus in twenty minutes or so he said or I can take four of you in my car if we cram Or I can call some cabs Whatever way you want to do it I think Im going to walk from here Bill said I dont know where Im going but a little fresh air seems like a great idea along about now Ill share it with you if youll drop me off downtown Richie said Seven tonight Mike reminded And be careful all of you They agreed to be careful although Bill did not know how you could truthfully make a promise like that when dealing with such a formidable array of unknown factors He started to say so then looked at their faces and saw that they knew it already He walked away instead raising one hand briefly in farewell The misty air felt good against his face The walk back to town would be a long one but that was all right He had a lot to think about He was glad that the reunion was over and the business had begun Richie Tozier got out of the cab at the threeway intersection of Kansas Street Center Street and Main Street and Ben dismissed it at the top of UpMile Hill The driver was Bills religious fella but neither Richie nor Ben knew it Dave had lapsed into a morose silence Ben could have gotten off with Richie he supposed but it seemed better somehow that they all start off alone He stood on the corner of Kansas Street and Daltrey Close watching the cab pull back into traffic hands stuffed deeply into his pockets trying to get the lunchs hideous conclusion out of his mind He couldnt do it his thoughts kept returning to that blackgray fly crawling out of the fortune cookie on Bills plate its veined wings plastered to its back He would try to divert his mind from this unhealthy image think he had succeeded only to discover five minutes later that his mind was back at it Im trying to justify it somehow he thought meaning it not in the moral sense but rather in the mathematical one Buildings are built by observing certain natural laws natural laws may be expressed by equations equations must be justified Where was the justification in what had happened less than half an hour ago Let it alone he told himself not for the first time You cant justify it so let it alone Very good advice the problem was that he couldnt take it He remembered that the day after he had seen the mummy on the icedup Canal his life had gone on as usual He had known that whatever it had been had come very close to getting him but his life had gone on he had attended school taken an arithmetic test visited the library when school was over and eaten with his usual heartiness He had simply incorporated the thing he had seen on the Canal into his life and if he had almost been killed by it well kids were always almost getting killed They dashed across streets without looking they got horsing around in the lake and suddenly realized they had floated far past their depth on their rubber rafts and had to paddle back they fell off monkeybars on their asses and out of trees on their heads Now standing here in the fading drizzle in front of a Trustworthy Hardware Store that had been a pawnshop in Frati Brothers Ben recalled the double windows always full of pistols and rifles and straightrazors and guitars hung up by their necks like exotic animals it occurred to him that kids were better at almost dying and they were also better at incorporating the inexplicable into their lives They believed implicitly in the invisible world Miracles both bright and dark were to be taken into consideration oh yes most certainly but they by no means stopped the world A sudden upheaval of beauty or terror at ten did not preclude an extra cheesedog or two for lunch at noon But when you grew up all that changed You no longer lay awake in your bed sure something was crouching in the closet or scratching at the window but when something did happen something beyond rational explanation the circuits overloaded The axons and dendrites got hot You started to jitter and jive you started to shake rattle and roll your imagination started to hop and bop and do the funky chicken all over your nerves You couldnt just incorporate what had happened into your life experience It didnt digest Your mind kept coming back to it pawing it lightly like a kitten with a ball of string until eventually of course you either went crazy or got to a place where it was impossible for you to function And if that happens Ben thought Its got me Us Cold He started to walk up Kansas Street not conscious of heading anyplace in particular And thought suddenly What did we do with the silver dollar The silver dollar Ben Beverly saved your life with it Yours maybe all the others and especially Bills It almost ripped my guts out before Beverly did what What did she do And how was it able to work She backed it off and we all helped her But how A word came to him suddenly a word that meant nothing at all but which tightened his flesh Chud He looked down at the sidewalk and for a moment saw the shape of a turtle chalked there and the world seemed to swim before his eyes He shut them tightly and when he opened them saw it was not a turtle only a hopscotch grid halferased by the light rain I dont know he said aloud and when he looked around quickly to see if anyone had heard him talking to himself he saw that he had turned off Kansas Street and onto Costello Avenue At lunch he had told the others that the Barrens were the only place in Derry where he had felt happy as a kid but that wasnt quite true was it There had been another place Either accidentally or unconsciously he had come to that other place the Derry Public Library He stood in front of it for a minute or two hands still in his pockets It hadnt changed he admired its lines as much now as he had as a child Like so many stone buildings that had been welldesigned it succeeded in confounding the closely observing eye with contradictions its stone solidity was somehow balanced by the delicacy of its arches and slim columns it looked both banksafe squat and yet slim and clean well it was slim as city buildings went especially those erected around the turn of the century and the windows crisscrossed with narrow strips of iron were graceful and rounded These contradictions saved it from ugliness and he was not entirely surprised to feel a wave of love for the place Nothing much had changed on Costello Avenue Glancing along it he could see the Derry Community House and he found himself wondering if the Costello Avenue Market was still there at the point where the avenue which was semicircular rejoined Kansas Street He walked across the library lawn barely noticing that his dress boots were getting wet to have a look at that glassedin passageway between the grownups library and the Childrens Library It was also unchanged and from here standing just outside the bowed branches of a weeping willow tree he could see people passing back and forth The old delight flooded him and he really forgot what had happened at the end of the reunion lunch for the first time He could remember walking around to this very same spot as a kid only in the winter plowing his way through snow that was almost hipdeep and then standing for as long as fifteen minutes He would come at dusk he remembered and again it was the contrasts that drew him and held him there with the tips of his fingers going numb and snow melting inside his green gumrubber boots It would be drawingdowndark out where he was the world going purple with early winter shadows the sky the color of ashes in the east and embers in the west It would be cold where he was ten degrees perhaps and chillier than that if the wind was blowing across from the frozen Barrens as it so often did But there less than forty yards from where he stood people walked back and forth in their shirtsleeves There less than forty yards from where he stood was a tubeway of bright white light thrown by the overhead fluorescents Little kids giggled together highschool sweethearts held hands and if the librarian saw them she would make them stop It was somehow magical magical in a good way that he had been too young to account for with such mundane things as electric power and oil heat The magic was that glowing cylinder of light and life connecting those two dark buildings like a lifeline the magic was in watching people walk through it across the dark snowfield untouched by either the dark or the cold It made them lovely and Godlike Eventually he would walk away as he was doing now and circle the building to the front door as he was doing now but he would always pause and look back once as he was doing now before the bulking stone shoulder of the adult library cut off the sightline to that delicate umbilicus Ruefully amused at the ache of nostalgia around his heart Ben went up the steps to the door of the adult library paused for a moment on the narrow verandah just inside the pillars always so high and cool no matter how hot the day Then he pulled open the ironbound door with the bookdrop slot in it and went into the quiet The force of memory almost dizzied him for a moment as he stepped into the mild light of the hanging glass globes The force was not physicalnot like a shot to the jaw or a slap It was more akin to that queer feeling of time doubling back on itself that people call for want of a better term deja vu Ben had had the feeling before but it had never struck him with such disorienting power for the moment or two he stood inside the door he felt literally lost in time not really sure how old he was Was he thirtyeight or eleven Here was the same murmuring quiet broken only by an occasional whisper the faint thud of a librarian stamping books or overdue notices the hushed riffle of newspaper or magazine pages being turned He loved the quality of the light as much now as then It slanted through the high windows gray as a pigeons wing on this rainy afternoon a light that was somehow somnolent and dozey He walked across the wide floor with its redandblack linoleum pattern almost completely worn away trying as he had always tried back then to hush the sound of his footfallsthe adult library rose up to a dome in the middle and all sounds were magnified He saw that the circular iron staircases leading to the stacks were still there one on either side of the horseshoeshaped main desk but he also saw that a tiny cagework elevator had been added at some point in the twentyfive years since he and his mamma had moved away It was something of a reliefit drove a wedge into that suffocating feeling of dejavu He felt like an interloper crossing the wide floor a spy from another country He kept expecting the librarian at the desk to raise her head look at him and then challenge him in clear ringing tones that would shatter the concentration of every reader here and focus every eye upon him You Yes you What are you doing here You have no business here Youre from Outside Youre from Before Go back where you came from Go back right now before I call the police She did look up a young girl pretty and for one absurd moment it seemed to Ben that the fantasy was really going to come true and his heart rose into his throat as her paleblue eyes touched his Then they passed on indifferently and Ben found he could walk again If he was a spy he hadnt been found out He passed under the coil of one of the narrow and almost suicidally steep wroughtiron staircases on his way to the corridor leading to the Childrens Library and was amused to realize only after he had done it that he had run down another old track of his childhood behavior He had looked up hoping as he had hoped as a kid to see a girl in a skirt coming down those steps He could remember now he could remember glancing up there for no reason at all one day when he was eight or nine and looking right up the chino skirt of a pretty highschool girl and seeing her clean pink underwear As the sudden sunlit glint of Beverly Marshs anklebracelet had shot an arrow of something more primitive than simple love or affection through his heart on the last day of school in so had the sight of the highschool girls panties affected him he could remember sitting at a table in the Childrens Library and thinking of that unexpected view for perhaps as long as twenty minutes his cheeks and forehead hot a book about the history of trains open and unread before him his penis a hard little branch in his pants a branch that had sunk its roots all the way up into his belly He had fantasized the two of them married living in a small house on the outskirts of town indulging in pleasures he did not in the least understand The feelings had passed off almost as suddenly as they had come but he had never walked under the stairway again without glancing up He hadnt ever seen anything else as interesting or affecting once a fat lady working her way down with ponderous care but he had looked away from that sight hastily feeling ashamed like a violator but the habit persistedhe had done it again now as a grown man He walked slowly down the glassedin passageway noticing other changes now Yellow decals that said OPEC LOVES IT WHEN YOU WASTE ENERGY so SAVE A WATT had been plastered over the switchplates The framed pictures on the far wall when he entered this scaleddown world of blondewood tables and small blondewood chairs this world where the drinking fountain was only four feet high were not of Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon but of Ronald Reagan and George BushReagan Ben recalled had been host of GE Theater in the year that Ben had graduated from the fifth grade and George Bush would not have seen thirty yet That feeling of deja vu swept him again He was helpless before it and this time he felt the numb horror of a man who finally realizes after half an hour of helpless splashing that the shore is growing no closer and he is drowning It was story hour and over in the corner a group of roughly a dozen little ones sat solemnly on their tiny chairs in a semicircle listening Who is that triptrapping upon my bridge the librarian said in the low growling tones of the troll in the story and Ben thought When she raises her head Ill see that its Miss Dames yes itll be Miss Davies and she wont look a day older But when she did raise her head he saw a much younger woman than Miss Davies had been even then Some of the children covered their mouths and giggled but others only watched her their eyes reflecting the eternal fascination of the fairy story would the monster be bested or would it feed It is I Billy Goat Gruff triptrapping on your bridge the librarian went on and Ben pale walked past her How can it be the same story The very same story Am I supposed to believe thats just coincidence Because I dont goddammit I just dont He bent to the drinking fountain bending so far he felt like Richie doing one of his salamisalamibaloney routines I ought to talk to someone he thought panicked Mike Bill someone Is something really stapling the past and present together here or am I only imagining it Because if Im not Im not sure I bargained for this much I He looked at the checkout desk and his heart seemed to stop in his chest for a moment before beginning to race doubletime The poster was simple stark and familiar It said simply In that instant it all seemed to come clear to himit came in a grisly flash of light and he realized that the vote they had taken was a joke There was no turning back never had been They were on a track as preordained as the memorytrack which had caused him to look up when he passed under the stairway leading to the stacks There was an echo here in Derry a deadly echo and all they could hope for was that the echo could be changed enough in their favor to allow them to escape with their lives Christ he muttered and scrubbed a palm up one cheek hard Can I help you sir a voice at his elbow asked and he jumped a little It was a girl of perhaps seventeen her darkblonde hair held back from her pretty highschoolers face with barrettes A library assistant of course theyd had them in too highschool girls and boys who shelved books showed kids how to use the card catalogue discussed book reports and school papers helped bewildered scholars with their footnotes and bibliographies The pay was a pittance but there were always kids willing to do it It was agreeable work On the heels of this reading the girls pleasant but questioning look a little more closely he remembered that he no longer really belonged herehe was a giant in the land of little people An intruder In the adults library he had felt uneasy about the possibility of being looked at or spoken to but here it was something of a relief For one thing it proved he was still an adult and the fact that the girl was clearly braless under her thin Westernstyle shirt was also more relief than turnon if proof that this was and not  was needed the clearly limned points of her nipples against the cotton of her shirt was it No thank you he said and then for no reason at all that he could understand he heard himself add I was looking for my son Oh Whats his name Maybe Ive seen him She smiled I know most of the kids His name is Ben Hanscom he said But I dont see him here Tell me what he looks like and Ill give him a message if there is one Well Ben said uncomfortable now and beginning to wish he had never started this hes on the stout side and he looks a little bit like me But its no big deal miss If you see him just tell him his dad popped by on his way home I will she said and smiled but the smile didnt reach her eyes and Ben suddenly realized that she hadnt come over and spoken to him out of simple politeness and a wish to help She happened to be a library assistant in the Childrens Library in a town where nine children had been slain over a span of eight months You see a strange man in this scaleddown world where adults rarely come except to drop their kids off or pick them up Youre suspicious of course Thank you he said gave her a smile he hoped was reassuring and then got the hell out He walked back through the corridor to the adults library and went to the desk on an impulse he didnt understand but of course they were supposed to follow their impulses this afternoon werent they Follow their impulses and see where they led The name plate on the circulation desk identified the pretty young librarian as Carole Banner Behind her Ben could see a door with a frostedglass panel lettered on this was MICHAEL HANLON HEAD LIBRARIAN I think so Ben said That is I hope so Id like to get a library card Very good she said and took out a form Are you a resident of Berry Rural Star Route Hemingford Home Nebraska He paused for a moment a little amused by her stare and then reeled off the Zip Code  This is a long way to come to borrow books isnt it Dont they have libraries in Nebraska Its kind of a sentimental thing Ben said He would have thought telling a stranger this would be embarrassing but he found it wasnt I grew up in Berry you see This is the first time Ive been back since I was a kid Ive been walking around seeing whats changed and what hasnt And all at once it occurred to me that I spent about ten years of my life here between ages three and thirteen and I dont have a single thing to remember those years by Not so much as a postcard I had some silver dollars but I lost one of them and gave the rest to a friend I guess what I want is a souvenir of my childhood Its late but dont they say better late than never Carole Banner smiled and the smile changed her pretty face into one that was beautiful I think thats very sweet she said If youd like to browse for ten or fifteen minutes Ill have the card made up for you when you come back to the desk Ben grinned a little I guess therell be a fee he said Outoftowner and all I sure did Ben smiled Except for my friends I guess that library card was the most important Ben would you come up here a voice called suddenly cutting across the library hush like a scalpel He turned around jumping guiltily the way people do when someone shouts in a library He saw no one he knew and realized a moment later that no one had looked up or shown any sign of surprise or annoyance The old men still read their copies of the Berry News the Boston Globe National Geographic Time Newsweek US News amp World Report At the tables in the Reference Room two highschool girls still had their heads together over a stack of papers and a pile of filecards Several browsers went on looking through the books on the shelves marked CURRENT FICTIONSEVENDAYLOAN An old man in a ridiculous drivingcap a cold pipe clenched between his teeth went on leafing through a folio of Luis de Vargas sketches He turned back to the young woman who was looking at him puzzled No Ben said smiling I thought I heard something I guess Im more jetlagged than I thought What were you saying Well actually you were saying But I was about to add that if you had a card when you were a resident your name will still be in the files she said We keep everything on microfiche now Some change from when you were a kid here I guess Yes he said A lot of things have changed in Derry but a lot of things also seem to have remained the same Anyway I can just look you up and give you a renewal card No charge Thats great Ben said and before he could add thanks the voice cut through the librarys sacramental silence again louder now ominously jolly Come on tip Ben Come on up you fat little fuck This Is Your Life Ben Hanscom Dont mention it She cocked her head at him Has it gotten warm outside Ben Hanscom did it the voice screamed It was coming from abovecoming from the stacks Ben Hanscom killed the children Get him Grab him She headed for the old Royal typewriter at the corner of her desk Ben walked slowly away his heart a thudding drum in his chest Yes he was sweating he could feel it trickling down from his forehead his armpits matting the hair on his chest He looked up and saw Pennywise the Clown standing at the top of the lefthand staircase looking down at him His face was white with greasepaint His mouth bled lipstick in a killers grin There were empty sockets where his eyes should have been He held a bunch of balloons in one hand and a book in the other Not he Ben thought It I am standing here in the middle of the Derry Public Librarys rotunda on a latespring afternoon in I am a grown man and I am face to face with my childhoods greatest nightmare I am face to face with It Come on up Ben Pennywise called down I wont hurt you Ive got a book for you A book and a balloon Come on up Ben opened his mouth to call back Youre insane if you think Im going up there and suddenly realized that if he did that everyone here would be looking at him everyone here would be thinking Who is that crazyman Oh I know you cant answer Pennywise called down and giggled Almost fooled you there for a minute though didnt I Pardon me sir do you have Prince Albert in a can You do Better let the poor guy out Pardon me maam is your refrigerator running It is Then hadnt you better go catch it The clown on the landing threw its head back and shrieked laughter It roared and echoed in the dome of the rotunda like a flight of black bats and Ben was only able to keep from clapping his hands over his ears with a tremendous effort of will Come on up Ben Pennywise called down Well talk Neutral ground What do you say Im not coming up there Ben thought When I finally come to you you wont want to see me I think Were going to kill you The clown shrieked laughter again Kill me Kill me And suddenly horribly the voice was Richie Toziers voice not his voice precisely but Richie Tozier doing his Pickaninny Voice doan kill me massa I be a good nigguh doan kill thisyere black boy Haystack Then that shrieking laughter again Trembling whitefaced Ben walked across the echoing center of the adults library He felt that soon he would vomit He stood in front of a shelf of books and took one down at random with a hand that trembled badly His cold fingers flittered the pages This is your one chance Haystack the voice called from behind and above him Get out of town Get out before it gets dark tonight Ill be after you tonight you and the others Youre too old to stop me Ben Youre all too old Too old to do anything but get yourselves killed Get out Ben Do you want to see this tonight He turned slowly still holding the book in his icy hands He didnt want to look but it were as if there were an invisible hand under his chin tilting his head up and up and up The clown was gone Dracula was standing at the top of the lefthand stairway but it was no movie Dracula it was not Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee or Frank Langella or Francis Lederer or Reggie Nalder An ancient manthing with a face like a twisted root stood there Its face was deadly pale its eyes purplishred the color of bloodclots Its mouth dropped open revealing a mouthful of Gillette BlueBlades that had been set in the gums at angles it was like looking into a deadly mirrormaze where a single misstep could get you cut in half KEEERUNCH it screamed and its jaws snapped closed Blood gouted from its mouth in a redblack flood Chunks of its severed lips fell to the glowing white silk of its formal shirt and slid down its front leaving snailtrails of blood behind What did Stan Uris see before he died the vampire on the landing screamed down at him laughing through the bloody hole of its mouth Was it Prince Albert in a can Was it Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier What did he see Ben Do you want to see it too What did he see What did he see Then that shrieking laughter again and Ben knew that he would scream now himself yes there was no way to stop the scream it was going to come Blood was pattering down from the landing in a grisly shower One drop had landed on the arthritisbunched hand of an old man who was reading The Wall Street Journal It was running down between his knuckles unseen and unfelt Ben hitched in breath sure the scream would follow unthinkable in the quiet of this softly drizzling spring afternoon as shocking as the slash of a knife or a mouthful of razorblades Instead what came out in a shaky uneven rush spoken instead of screamed spoken low like a prayer were these words We made slugs out of it of course We made the silver dollar into silver slugs The gentleman in the drivingcap who had been perusing the de Vargas sketches looked up sharply Nonsense he said Now people did look up someone hissed shhh at the old man in an annoyed voice Im sorry Ben said in a low trembling voice He was faintly aware that his face was now running with sweat and that his shirt was plastered to his body I was thinking aloud Nonsense the old gentleman repeated in a louder voice Cant make silver bullets from silver dollars Common misconception Pulp fiction Problem is with specific gravity Suddenly the woman Ms Danner was there Mr Brockhill youll have to be quiet she said kindly enough People are reading Mans sick Brockhill said abruptly and went back to his book Give him an aspirin Carole Carole Danner looked at Ben and her face sharpened with concern Are you ill Mr Hanscom I know its terribly impolite to say so but you look terrible Ben said I I had Chinese food for lunch I dont think its agreed with me If you want to lie down theres a cot in Mr Hanlons office You could No Thanks but no What he wanted was not to lie down but to get the hell out of the Derry Public Library He looked up at the landing The clown was gone The vampire was gone But tied to the low wroughtiron railing which surrounded the landing was a balloon Written on its bulging skin were the words HAVE A GOOD DAY TONIGHT YOU DIE Ive got your library card she said putting a tentative hand on his arm do you still want it Yes thanks Ben said He drew a deep shuddery breath Im very sorry about this Wouldnt work Mr Brockhill said without looking up from de Vargas or removing his dead pipe from the corner of his mouth device of pulp fiction Bullet would tumble And speaking again with no foreknowledge that he was going to speak Ben said slugs not bullets We realized almost right away that we couldnt make bullets I mean we were just kids It was my idea to Brockhill gave Ben a slightly startled look seemed about to speak then went back to the sketches At the desk Carole Danner handed him a small orange card with DERRY PUBLIC LIBRARY stamped across the top Bemused Ben realized it was the first adult librarycard he had owned in his whole life The one hed had as a kid had been canaryyellow Are you sure you dont want to lie down Mr Hanscom You do look a little better she said but she said it doubtfully as if understanding that this was the proper thing to say but not really believing it Then she was holding a book under the microfilm gadget they used these days to record bookloans and Ben felt a touch of almost hysterical amusement Its the book I grabbed off the shelf when the clown started to do its Pickaninny Voice he thought She thought I wanted to borrow it Ive made my first withdrawal from the Demy Public Library in twentyfive years and I dont even know what the book is Furthermore I dont care Just let me out of here okay Thatll be enough Youre more than welcome Mr Hanscom Are you sure you wouldnt like an aspirin Quite sure he saidand then hesitated You wouldnt by any chance know what happened to Mrs Starrett would you Barbara Starrett She used to be the head of the Childrens Library She died Carole Danner said Three years ago It was a stroke I understand It was a great shame She was relatively young fiftyeight or nine I think Mr Hanlon closed the library for the day Oh Ben said and felt a hollow place open in his heart Thats what happened when you got back to your usedtobe as the song put it The frosting on the cake was sweet but the stuff underneath was bitter People forgot you or died on you or lost their hair and teeth In some cases you found that they had lost their minds Oh it was great to be alive Boy howdy All the kids liked Mrs Starrett Ben said and was alarmed to realize that tears were now very close If she asks me if Im all right one more time I really am going to cry I think Or scream Or something He glanced at his watch and said I really have to run Thanks for being so nice He tipped a finger her way and started back across the floor Mr Brockhill glanced up at him once sharply and suspiciously He looked up at the landing which topped the lefthand staircase The balloon still floated there tied by its string to lacy wroughtiron But now the printing on its side read He looked away feeling the pulse in his throat starting to run again He let himself out and was startled by sunlightthe clouds overhead were coming unravelled and a warm lateMay sun was shafting down making the grass look impossibly green and lush Ben felt something start to lift from his heart It seemed to him that he had left some insupportable burden behind in the library and then he looked down at the book he had inadvertently withdrawn and his teeth clamped together with sudden painful force It was Bulldozer by Stephen W Meader one of the books he had withdrawn from the library on the day he had dived into the Barrens to get away from Henry Bowers and his friends And speaking of Henry the track of his engineer boot was still on the books cover Shaking fumbling at the pages he turned to the back The library had gone over to a microfilm checkout system he had seen that Bat there was still a pocket in the back of this book with a card tucked into it There was a name written on each line of the card followed by the librarians returndate stamp Looking at the card Ben saw this And on the last line of the card his own childish signature written in heavy pencilstrokes Stamped across this card stamped across the books flyleaf stamped across the thickness of the pages stamped again and again in smeary red ink that looked like blood was one word CANCEL Oh dear God Ben murmured He did not know what else to say that seemed to cover the entire situation Oh dear God dear God He stood in the new sunlight suddenly wondering what was happening to the others Eddie got off the bus at the corner of Kansas Street and Kossuth Lane Kossuth was a street that ran a quarter of a mile downhill before deadending abruptly where the crumbling earth sloped into the Barrens He had absolutely no idea why he had chosen this place to leave the bus Kossuth Lane meant nothing to him and he had known no one on this particular section of Kansas Street But it seemed like the right place That was all he knew but at this point it seemed to be enough Beverly had climbed off the bus with a little wave at one of the Lower Main Street stops Mike had taken his car back to the library Now watching the small and somehow absurd Mercedes bus pull away he wondered exactly what he was doing here standing on an obscure streetcorner in an obscure town nearly five hundred miles away from Myra who was undoubtedly worried to tears about him He felt an instant of almost painful vertigo touched his jacket pocket and remembered that he had left his Dramamine back at the Town House along with the rest of his pharmacopeia He had aspirin though He would no more have gone out sans aspirin than he would have gone out sans pants He chugged a couple dry and began to walk along Kansas Street thinking vaguely that he might go to the Public Library or perhaps cross over to Costello Avenue It was beginning to clear now and he supposed he could even walk across to West Broadway and admire the old Victorian houses that stood there along the only two really handsome residential blocks in Derry He used to do that sometimes when he was a kidjust walk along West Broadway sort of casual like he was on his way to somewhere else There was the Muellers near the corner of Witcham and West Broadway a red house with turrets on either side and hedges in front The Muellers had a gardener who always looked at Eddie with suspicious eyes until he had passed on his way Then there was the Bowies house which was four down from the Muellers on the same sideone of the reasons he supposed that Greta Bowie and Sally Mueller had been such great friends in grammar school It was greenshingled and also had turrets but while the turrets on the Muellers house were squared off those on the Bowies house were capped with funny coneshaped things that looked to Eddie like squatty duncecaps In the summer there was always lawnfurniture on the side lawna table with a sporty yellow umbrella over it wicker chairs a rope hammock stretched between two trees There was always a croquet game set up out back too Eddie knew this although he had never been invited over to Gretas house to play croquet Walking by casually like he was on his way to somewhere else Eddie would sometimes hear the click of the balls laughter groans as someones ball was sent away Once he had seen Greta herself a lemonade in one hand and her croquet mallet in the other looking slim and pretty beyond the words of all the poets even her sunburned shoulders seemed wonderfully pretty to Eddie Kaspbrak who had at that time been nine going after her ball which had been sent away it had ricocheted off a tree and had thus brought Greta into Eddies view He fell in love with her a little that dayher shining blonde hair falling to the shoulders of her culotte dress which was a cool blue She glanced around and for a moment he thought she had seen him but that proved not to be so because when he raised his hand in a timid hello she did not raise hers in return but only whacked her ball back onto the rear lawn and then ran after it He had walked on with no resentment at the unreturned hello he genuinely believed she must not have see him or at the fact that he had never been invited to attend one of the Saturdayafternoon croquet games why would a beautiful girl like Greta Bowie want to invite a kid like him He was thinchested asthmatic and had the face of a drowned waterrat Yeah he thought walking aimlessly back down Kansas Street I should have gone over to West Broadway and looked at all those houses again the Muellers the Bowies Dr Holes place the Trackers His thoughts broke off abruptly at that last name becausespeak of the devilhere he was standing in front of Tracker Brothers Truck Depot Still right here Eddie said aloud and laughed son of a gun The house on West Broadway which belonged to Phil and Tony Tracker a pair of lifelong bachelors was probably the loveliest of the large houses on that street a spotlessly white midVictorian with green lawns and great beds of flowers that rioted in a neatly landscaped way of course all the spring and summer long Their driveway was freshly sealed each fall so that it always remained as black as a dark mirror the slate shingles on the many slants of the roof were always a perfect mint green that almost exactly matched the lawn and people sometimes stopped to take pictures of the mullioned windows which were very old and quite remarkable Any two men who bother keeping a house so nice must be queers Eddies mother had once said in a disgruntled sort of way and Eddie hadnt dared ask for clarification The Truck Depot was the exact opposite of the Tracker house on West Broadway It was a low brick structure the bricks were old and crumbling in places their dirtyorange hue shading to a sooty black at the buildings footings The windows were uniformly filthy except for a small circular place on one of the lower panes of the starters office This one pane had been kept spotlessly clean by kids before Eddie and those who came after because the starter kept a Playboy calendar over his desk No boy came to play scratch baseball in the back lot without first stopping to wipe at the glass with his ballglove and examine that months pinup The depot was surrounded by a waste of gravel on three sides Longdistance haulersJimmyPetes and Kenworths and Riosall painted with the words TRACKER BROS DERRY NEWTON PROVIDENCE HARTFORD NEW YORK sometimes stood here in tangled disordered profusion Sometimes they were put together and sometimes there were just cabs or bodyboxes standing silent on their rear wheels and supportstruts The brothers kept their trucks out of the lot at the back of the building as much as they could because they were both avid baseball fans and liked the kids to come and play Phil Tracker drove freight himself so the boys rarely saw him but Tony Tracker a man with huge slab arms and a gut to match kept the books and the accounts and Eddie who never playedhis mother would have killed him if she had heard he was playing baseball racing around and getting dust in his delicate lungs risking broken legs concussions and God alone knew what else got used to seeing him He was a summer fixture his voice as much a part of the game to Eddie then as Mel Aliens later became Tony Tracker large but somehow ghostlike his white shirt glimmering as summer dusk drew down and fireflies began to loom the air with their lace of lights yelling You got to get under that bawl before you can catch it Red You took your eye off n the bawl HalfPint You cant hit the goddam thing if you aint looking at it Slide Horsefoot You get the soles of them Keds in that secondbasemans face he aint never goan tag you out Never called any of them by name Eddie remembered It was always hey Red hey Blondie hey FourEyes hey HalfPint It was never a ball it was always a bawl It was never a bat it was always something Tony Tracker called an ashhandle as in You aint never goan hit that bawl if you dont choke up on the ashhandle Horsefoot Grinning Eddie walked a little closer and then the grin faded The long brick building where orders had been processed trucks repaired and goods stored on a shortterm basis was now dark and silent Weeds were growing up through the gravel and there were no trucks in either side yard only a single box its sides rusty and dull Getting closer still he saw that there was a realtors FOR SALE sign in the window Trackers out of business he thought and was surprised at the sadness the thought carried with it as if someone had died He was glad now he hadnt walked over to West Broadway If Tracker Brothers could have gone underTracker Brothers which had seemed eternalwhat might have happened on that street he had liked so much to walk down as a kid He realized uneasily that he didnt want to know He didnt want to see Greta Bowie with gray in her hair her hips and legs thickened with much sitting and much eating and much drinking it was bettersaferto just stay away Thats what we all should have done just stayed away Weve got no business here Coming back to where you grew up is like doing some crazy yoga trick putting your feet in your own mouth and somehow swallowing yourself so theres nothing left it cant be done and any sane person ought to be fucking glad it cant what do you suppose happened to Tony and Phil Tracker anyway A heart attack for Tony perhaps he had been carrying maybe seventyfive extra pounds of meat on his bones You had to watch out for what your heart might be up to The poets might romance about broken hearts and Barry Manilow sing about them and that was fine by Eddie he and Myra had every album Barry Manilow had ever recorded but he himself preferred a good solid EKG every year Sure Tonys heart had probably given it up as a bad job And Phil Bad luck on the highway maybe Eddie who made his living behind the wheel himself or had these days he only drove the celebs and spent the rest of his tune driving a desk knew about bad luck on the highway Old Phil might have jackknifed a rig somewhere in New Hampshire or in the Hainesville Woods up north in Maine when the going was icy or maybe he had lost his brakes on some long hill south of Derry heading into Haven in a driving springtime rain Those things or any of the others you heard in those shitkicking country songs about truckdrivers who wore Stetson hats and had cheating on their minds Driving a desk was sometimes lonely but Eddie had been in the drivers seat himself more than once his aspirator riding there with him on the dashboard its trigger reflected ghostly in the windshield and a bucketload of pills in the glove compartment and he knew that real loneliness was a smeary red the color of the taillights of the car ahead of you reflected on wet hottop in a driving rain Oh shit the time goes by Eddie Kaspbrak said in a sighing sort of whisper and was not even aware that he had spoken aloud Feeling both mellow and unhappya state more common to him than he ever would have believedEddie skirted the building Gucci loafers crunching in the gravel to look at the lot where the baseball games had been played when he was a kidwhen it seemed ninety percent of the world had been made up of kids The lot wasnt much changed but a look was enough to convince him beyond doubt that the games had stoppeda tradition that had simply died out at some point in the years between for reasons of its own In the diamond shape of the infield had been defined not by limed basepaths but in ruts made by running feet They had no actual bases those boys who had played baseball here boys who were all older than the Losers although Eddie remembered now that Stan Uris had sometimes played his batting was only fair but in the outfield he could run fast and he had the reflexes of an angel but four pieces of dirty canvas were always kept under the loadingbay behind the long brick building to be ceremonially taken out when enough kids had drifted into the back lot to play ball and just as ceremonially returned when the shades of evening had fallen thickly enough to end further play Standing here now Eddie could see no trace of those rutted basepaths Weeds had grown up through the gravel in patchy profusion Broken soda and beer bottles twinkled here and there in the old days such shards of broken glass had been religiously removed The only thing that was the same was the chainlink fence at the back of the lot twelve feet high and as rusty as dried blood It framed the sky in droves of diamond shapes That was homerun territory Eddie thought standing bemused with his hands in his pockets at the place where home plate had been twentyseven years ago Over the fence and down into the Barrens They used to call it The Automatic He laughed out loud and then looked around nervously as if it were a ghost who had laughed out loud instead of a guy in sixtydollar slacks a guy as solid as well as solid as as Get off it Eds Richies voice seemed to whisper You aint solid at all and in the last few years the chucks have been few and far between Right Yeah right Eddie said in a low voice and kicked a few loose stones away in a rattle In truth he had only seen two balls go over the fence at the back of the lot behind Tracker Brothers both of them hit by the same kid Belch Huggins Belch had been almost comically big already six feet tall at twelve weighing maybe a hundred and seventy He had gotten his nickname because he was able to articulate belches of amazing length and loudnessat his best he sounded like a cross between a bullfrog and a cicada Sometimes he would pat a hand rapidly across his open mouth while belching emitting a sound like a hoarse Indian Belch had been big and not really fat Eddie remembered now but it was as if God had never really intended for a boy of twelve to attain such remarkable size if he had not died that summer he might have grown to sixsix or better and might have learned along the way how to maneuver his outsized body through a world of smaller denizens He might even Eddie thought have learned gentleness But at twelve he had been both clumsy and mean not retarded but almost seeming so because all his bodys actions seemed so amazingly graceless and lunging He had none of Stanleys builtin rhythms it was as if Belchs body did not talk to his brain at all but existed in its own cosmos of slow thunder Eddie could remember the evening a long slow fly ball had been hit directly to Belchs position in the outfieldBelch didnt even have to move He stood looking up raised his glove in an almost aimless punching gesture and instead of settling into his glove the ball had struck him squarely on top of the head producing a hollow bonk sound It was as if the ball had been dropped from three stories up onto the roof of a Ford sedan It bounced up a good four feet and came down neatly into Belchs glove An unfortunate kid named Owen Phillips had laughed at that bonking sound Belch had walked over to him and had kicked his ass so hard that the Phillips kid had run screaming for home with a hole in the seat of his pants No one else laughed at least not on the outside Eddie supposed that if Richie Tozier had been there he wouldnt have been able to help it and Belch probably would have put him in the hospital Belch was similarly slow at the plate He was easy to strike out and if he hit a grounder even the most fumblefingered infielders had no trouble throwing him out at first But when he got all of one it went a long long way The two balls Eddie had seen Belch hit over the fence had both been wonders The first had never been recovered although more than a dozen boys had tramped back and forth over the steeply slanting slope which plunged down into the Barrens looking for it The second however had been recovered The ball belonged to another sixthgrader Eddie could not now remember what his real name had been only that all the other kids called him Snuffy because he always had a cold and had been in use for most of the late spring and early summer of As a result it was no longer the nearly perfect spherical creation of white horsehide and red stitching that it had been when it came out of the box it was scuffed grassstained and cut in several places by its hundreds of bouncing trips over the gravel in the outfield Its stitching was beginning to come unravelled in one place and Eddie who shagged foul balls when his asthma wasnt too bad relishing every casual Thanks kid when he threw the ball back to the playing field knew that soon someone would produce a roll of Black Cat friction tape and embalm it so they could get another week or so out of it But before that day came a seventhgrader with the unlikely name of Stringer Dedham tossed what he fancied a change of speed pitch to Belch Huggins Belch timed the pitch perfectly the slow ones were you should pardon the pun just his speed and hit Snuffys elderly Spalding so hard that the cover came right off and fluttered down just a few feet shy of second base like a big white moth The ball itself had continued up and up into a gorgeous twilit sky unravelling and unravelling as it went kids turning to follow its progress in dumb wonder up and over the chainlink fence it went still rising and Eddie remembered Stringer Dedham had said Holy shit in a soft and awestruck voice as it went riding a track into the sky and they had all seen the unwinding string and maybe even before it hit six boys had been monkeying up that fence and Eddie could remember Tony Tracker laughing in an amazed loonlike way and crying That one would have been out of Yankee Stadium Do you hear me That one would have been out of fucking Yankee Stadium It had been Peter Gordon who found the ball not far from the stream the Losers Club would dam up less than three weeks later What was left was not even three inches through the center it was some kind of cockeyed miracle that the twine had never broken By unspoken consent the boys had brought the remains of Snuffys ball back to Tony Tracker who examined it without saying a word surrounded by boys who were likewise silent Seen from a distance that circle of boys standing around the tall man with the big sloping belly might have seemed almost religious in its intentthe veneration of a holy object Belch Huggins had not even run around the bases He only stood among the others like a boy who had no precise idea of where he was What Tony Tracker handed him that day was smaller than a tennis ball Eddie lost in these memories walked from the place where home had been across the pitchers mound only it had never been a mound it had been a depression from which the gravel had been scraped clean and out into shortstop country He paused briefly struck by the silence and then strolled on out to the chainlink fence It was rustier than ever and overgrown by some sort of ugly climbing vine but still there Looking through it he could see how the ground sloped away aggressively green The Barrens were more junglelike than ever and for the first time he found himself wondering why a stretch of such tangled and virulent growth should have been called the Barrens at all it was many things but barren was not one of them Why not the Wilderness Or the Jungle It had an ominous almost sinister sound but what it conjured up in the mind were not tangles of shrubs and trees so thick they had to fight for sunspace it called up pictures of sand dunes shifting away endlessly or gray slate expanses of hardpan and desert Barren Mike had said earlier that they were all barren and it seemed true enough Seven of them and not a kid among them Even in these days of planned parenthood that was bucking the odds He looked through the rusty diamondshapes hearing the faraway drone of cars on Kansas Street the faraway trickle and rush of water down below He could see glints of it in the spring sunshine like flashes of glass The bamboo stands were still down there looking unhealthily white like patches of fungus in all the green Beyond them in the marshy stretches of ground bordering the Kenduskeag there was supposed to have been quickmud I spent the happiest times of my childhood down there in that mess he thought and shivered He was about to turn away when something else caught his eye a cement cylinder with a heavy steel cap on the top Morlock holes Ben used to call them laughing with his mouth but not quite laughing with his eyes If you went over to one it would stand maybe waisthigh on you if you were a kid and you would see the words DERRY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS stamped in raised metal in a semicircle And you could hear a humming noise from deep inside Some sort of machinery Thats where we went In August In the end We went into one of Bens Morlock holes into the sewers but after awhile they werent sewers anymore They were were what Patrick Hockstetter was down there Before It took him Beverly saw him doing something bad It made her laugh but she knew it was bad Something to do with Henry Bowers wasnt it Yes I think so And He turned away suddenly and started back toward the abandoned depot not wanting to look down into the Barrens anymore not liking the thoughts they conjured up He wanted to be home with Myra He didnt want to be here He He turned toward the sound of the voice and here came some sort of a ball right over the fence and toward him It struck the gravel and bounced Eddie stuck out his hand and caught it In his unthinking reflex the catch was so neat it was almost elegant He looked down at what was in his hand and everything inside him went cool and loose Once it had been a baseball Now it was only a stringwrapped sphere because the cover had been knocked off He could see the string trailing away It went over the top of the fence like a strand of spiderweb and disappeared into the Barrens Oh Jesus he thought Oh Jesus Its here Its here with me NOW Come on down and play Eddie the voice on the other side of the fence said and Eddie realized with a fainting sort of horror that it was the voice of Belch Huggins who had been murdered in the tunnels under Derry in August of And now here was Belch himself struggling up and over the bank on the other side of the fence He wore a pinstriped New York Yankees baseball uniform that was flecked with bits of autumn leaves and smeared with green He was Belch but he was also the leper a creature hideously arisen from long years in a wet grave The flesh of his heavy face hung in putrescent strings and runners One eyesocket was empty Things squirmed in his hair He wore a mossslimed baseballglove on one hand He poked the rotting fingers of his right hand through the diamonds of the chainlink fence and when he curled them Eddie heard a dreadful squirting sound which he thought might drive him mad That one would have been out of Yankee Stadium Belch said and grinned A toad noxiously white and squirming dropped from his mouth and tumbled to the ground do you hear me That one would have been out of fucking Yankee Stadium And by the way Eddie do you want a blow job Ill do it for a dime Hell Ill do it for free Belchs face changed The jellylike bulb of nose fell in revealing two raw red channels that Eddie had seen in his dreams His hair coarsened and drew back from his temples turned cobwebwhite The rotting skin on his forehead split open revealing white bone covered with a mucusy substance like the bleared lens of a searchlight Belch was gone the thing which had been under the porch at Neibolt Street was here now Bobby blows me for a dime it crooned beginning to climb the fence It left little pieces of its flesh in the diamond shapes the crisscrossing wires made The fence jingled and rattled with its weight When it touched the climbing vinelike weeds they turned black He will do it anytime Fifteen cents for overtime Eddie tried to scream Nothing but a dry senseless squeak came out of him His lungs felt like the worlds oldest ocarinas He looked down at the ball in his hand and suddenly blood began to sweat up from between the wrapped strings It pattered to the gravel and splashed on his loafers He threw it down and took two lurching staggersteps backward his eyes bulging from his face rubbing his hands on the front of his shirt The leper had reached the top of the fence Its head swayed in silhouette against the sky a nightmare shape like a bloated Halloween jackolantern Its tongue lolled out four feet long perhaps six It twined its way down the fence like a snake from the lepers grinning mouth It did not fade like a ghost in a movie it simply winked out of existence But Eddie heard a sound which confirmed its essential solidity a pop sound like a cork blowing out of a champagne bottle It was the sound of air rushing in to fill the place where the leper had been He turned and began to run but before he had gone ten feet four stiff shapes flew out from the shadows under the loadingbay of the abandoned brick depot He thought at first they were bats and he screamed and covered his head Then he saw that they were squares of canvasthe squares of canvas that had been the bases when the big kids played here They whirled and twirled in the still air he had to duck to avoid one of them They settled in their accustomed places all at once kicking up little puffs of grit home first second third Gasping his breath short in his throat Eddie ran past home plate his lips drawn back his face as white as cottage cheese WHACK The sound of a bat hitting a phantom ball And then Eddie stopped the strength going out of his legs a groan passing his lips The ground was bulging in a straight line from home to first as if a gigantic gopher was tunneling rapidly just below the surface of the ground Gravel rolled off to either side The shape under the earth reached the base and the canvas flipped up into the air It went up so hard and fast it made a popping soundthe sound a shoeshine kid makes when hes feeling good and pops the rag The ground began to ridge between first and second racing and racing Second base flew into the air with a similar popping sound and had barely settled back before the shape under the ground had reached third and was racing for home Home plate flew up as well but before it could come down the thing had popped out of the ground like some grisly partyfavor and the thing was Tony Tracker his face a skull to which a few blackened chunks of flesh still clung his white shirt a mess of rotted linen strings He poked out of the earth at home plate from the waist up swaying back and forth like a grotesque worm Dont matter how much you choke up on that ashhandle Tony Tracker said in a gritty grinding voice Exposed teeth grinned in lunatic chumminess dont matter Wheezy Well get you You and your friends Well have a BAWL Eddie shrieked and staggered away There was a hand on his shoulder He shrank away from it The hand tightened for a moment then gave way He turned It was Greta Bowie She was dead Half of her face was gone maggots crawled in the churned red meat that was left She held a green balloon in one hand Car crash the recognizable half of her mouth said and grinned The grin caused an unspeakable ripping sound and Eddie could see raw tendons moving like terrible straps I was eighteen Eddie Drunk and done up on reds Your friends are here Eddie Eddie backed away from her his hands held up in front of his face She walked toward him Blood had splashed then dried on her legs in long splotches She was wearing pennyloafers And now beyond her he saw the ultimate horror Patrick Hockstetter was shambling toward him across the outfield He too was wearing a New York Yankees uniform Eddie ran Greta clutched at him again tearing his shirt and spilling some terrible liquid down the back of his collar Tony Tracker was pulling himself out of his mansized gopherrun Patrick Hockstetter stumbled and staggered Eddie ran not knowing where he was finding the breath to run but running somehow anyway And as he ran he saw words floating in front of him the words that had been printed on the side of the green balloon Greta Bowie had been holding Eddie ran He ran and ran and at some point he collapsed in a dead faint near McCarron Park and some kids saw him and steered clear of him because he looked like a wino to them like he might have some kind of weird disease for all they knew he might even be the killer and they talked about reporting him to the police but in the end they didnt Beverly walked absently down Main Street from the Derry Town House where she had gone to change into a pair of bluejeans and a bright yellow smockblouse She was not thinking about where she was going Instead she thought this She had hidden that in her bottom drawer beneath her underwear Her mother might have seen it but that was all right The important thing was that was one drawer her father never looked in If he had seen it he might have looked at her with that bright almost friendly and utterly paralyzing stare of his and asked in his almost friendly way You been doing something you shouldnt be doing Bev You been doing something with some boy And if she said yes or if she said no there would be a quick whambam so quick and so hard it didnt even hurt at firstit took a few seconds for the vacuum to dissipate and the pain to fill the place were the vacuum had been Then his voice again almost friendly I worry a lot about you Beverly I worry an awful lot You got to grow up isnt that so Her father might still be living here in Derry He had been living here the last time she had heard from him but that had been how long ago Ten years Long before she had married Tom anyway She had gotten a postcard from him not a plain postcard like the one the poem had been written on but one showing the hideous plastic statue of Paul Bunyan which stood in front of City Center The statue had been erected sometime in the fifties and it had been one of the landmarks of her childhood but her fathers card had called up no nostalgia or memories for her it might as well have been a card showing Gateway Arch in Saint Louis or the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco Hope you are doing well and being good the card read Hope you will send me something if you can as I dont have much I love you Bevvie Dad He had loved her and in some ways she supposed that had everything to do with why she had fallen so desperately in love with Bill Denbrough that long summer of because of all the boys Bill was the one who projected the sense of authority she associated with her father but it was a different sort of authority somehowit was authority that listened She saw no assumption in either his eyes or his actions that he believed her fathers kind of worrying to be the only reason authority needed to exist as if people were pets to be both cosseted and disciplined Whatever the reasons by the end of their first meeting as a complete group in July of that year that meeting of which Bill had taken such complete and effortless charge she had been madly headoverheels in love with him Calling it a simple schoolgirl crush was like saying a RollsRoyce was a vehicle with four wheels something like a haywagon She did not giggle wildly and blush when she saw him nor did she chalk his name on trees or write it on the walls of the Kissing Bridge She simply lived with his face in her heart all the time a kind of sweet hurtful ache She would have died for him It was natural enough she supposed for her to want to believe it had been Bill who sent her the lovepoem although she had never gotten so far gone as to actually convince herself it was so No she had known who wrote the poem And later onat some pointhadnt its author admitted this to her Yes Ben had told her so although she could not now remember not for the life of her just when or under what circumstances he had actually said it out loud and although his love for her had been almost as well hidden as the love she had felt for Bill but you told him Bevvie you did you told him you loved it was obvious to anyone who really looked and who was kindit was in the way he was always careful to keep some space between them in the draw of his breath when she touched his arm or his hand in the way he dressed when he knew he was going to see her Dear sweet fat Ben It had ended somehow that difficult preadolescent triangle but just how it had ended was one of the things she still couldnt remember She thought that Ben had confessed authoring and sending the little lovepoem She thought she had told Bill she loved him that she would love him forever And somehow those two tellings had helped save all of their lives or had they She couldnt remember These memories or memories of memories that was really closer to what they were were hike islands that were not really islands at all but only knobs of a single coral spine which happened to poke up above the waterline not separate at all but one piece Yet whenever she tried to dive deep and see the rest a maddening image intervened the grackles which came back each spring to New England crowding the telephone lines trees and rooftops jostling for places and filling the thawing lateMarch air with their raucous gossip This image came to her again and again foreign and disturbing like a heavy radio beam that blankets the signal you really want to pick up She realized with sudden shock that she was standing outside of the KleenKloze Washateria where she and Stan Uris and Ben and Eddie had taken the rags that day in late Junerags stained with blood which only they could see The windows were now soaped opaque and there was a handlettered FOR SALE BY OWNER sign taped to the door Peering between the swashes of soap she could see an empty room with lighter squares on the dirty yellow walls where the washers had stood This neighborhood hadnt changed much A few more of the trees were gone probably elms felled by disease The houses looked a little tackier broken windows seemed slightly more common than they had been when she was a girl Some of the broken panes had been replaced with cardboard Some hadnt And here she stood in front of the apartment house Lower Main Street Still here The peeling white she remembered had become a peeling chocolate brown at some point during the years between but it was still unmistakable There was the window which looked in on what had been their kitchen there was the window of her bedroom Jim Doyon you come out of that road Come out right now you want to get run over and killed She shivered hugging her arms across her breasts in an X cupping her elbows in her palms Daddy could still be living here oh yes he could He wouldnt move unless he had to Just walk on up there Beverly Look at the mailboxes Three boxes for three apartments just like in the old days And if theres one which says MARSH you can ring the bell and pretty soon therell be the shuffle of slippers down the hall and the door will open and you can look at him the man whose sperm made you redheaded and lefthanded and gave you the ability to draw remember how he used to draw He could draw anything he wanted If he felt like it that is He didnt feel like it often I guess he had too many things to worry about But when he did you used to sit for hours and watch while he drew cats and dogs and horses and cows with MOO coming out of their mouths in balloons Youd laugh and hed laugh and then hed say Now you Bevvie and when you held the pen hed guide your hand and youd see the cow or the cat or the smiling man unspooling beneath your own fingers while you smelled his Mennen Skin Bracer and the warmth of his skin Go on up Beverly Ring the bell Hell come and hell be old the lines will be drawn deep in his face and his teeththose that are leftwill be yellow and hell look at you and hell say Why its Bevvie Bevvies come home to see her old dad come on in Bevvie Im so glad to see you Im glad because I worry about you Bevvie I worry a LOT She walked slowly up the path and the weeds growing up between the cracked concrete sections brushed at the legs of her jeans She looked closely at the firstfloor windows but they were curtained off She looked at the mailboxes Third floor STARKWEATHER Second floor BURKE First floorher breath caughtMARSH But I wont ring I dont want to see him I wont ring the bell This was a firm decision at last The decision that opened the gate to a full and useful lifetime of firm decisions She walked down the path Back to downtown Up to the Derry Town House Packed Cabbed Flew Told Tom to bug out Lived successfully Died happily She heard the familiar chimes from the living roomchimes that had always sounded to her like a Chinese name ChingChong Silence No answer She shifted on the porch from one foot to the other suddenly needing to pee Instead she rang again ChingChong No answer She thought of Bens lovely little poem and tried to remember exactly when and how he had confessed its authorship and why for a brief second it called up an association with having her first menstrual period Had she begun menstruating at eleven Surely not although her breasts had begun their first achy growth around midwinter Why Then intervening a mental picture of thousands of grackles on phone lines and rooftops all babbling at a white spring sky Now she heard someone approaching and the sound was just as she had imagined the tired whisper of old slippers She looked around wildly and came very very close to just taking to her heels Could she make it down the cement walk and around the corner leaving her father to think it had been nothing but kids playing pranks Hey mister you got Prince Albert in a can She let out a sudden sharp breath and had to tighten her throat because what wanted to come out was a laugh of relief It wasnt her father at all Standing in the doorway and looking out at her was a tall woman in her late seventies Her hair was long and gorgeous mostly white but shot through with lodes of purest gold Behind her rimless spectacles were eyes as blue as the water in the fjords her ancestors had perhaps hailed from She wore a purple dress of watered silk It was shabby but still dignified Her wrinkled face was kind Im sorry Beverly said The urge to laugh had passed as swiftly as it had come She noticed that the old woman wore a cameo at her throat It was almost certainly real ivory surrounded by a band of gold so thin it was nearly invisible I must have rung the wrong bell Or rang the wrong bell on purpose her mind whispered I meant to ring for Marsh The old womans hand rose to the cameo and touched it She peered more closely at Beverly making her feel ridiculously young as if she should perhaps have a box of Girl Scout cookies in her hands or maybe some tagssupport the Derry High School Tigers Then the old woman smiled a kind smile that was nonetheless sad Why you have fallen out of touch miss I dont want to be the one who tells you this a stranger but your father has been dead these last five years But on the bell She looked again and uttered a small bewildered sound that was not quite a laugh In her agitation in her subconscious but rocksolid certainty that her old man would still be here she had read KERSH as MARSH Youre Mrs Kersh she asked She was staggered by this news of her father but she also felt stupid about the mistakethe lady would think her little more Very little did I know him Mrs Kersh said She sounded a little like Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back and Beverly felt like laughing again When had her emotions gone whipsawing so violently back and forth The truth was she couldnt remember a time but she was dismally afraid she would before much longer He rented the groundfloor apartment before me We saw each other me coming and him going over a space of a few days He moved down to Reward Lane Do you know it Yes Beverly said Roward Lane branched off from Lower Main Street four blocks farther down where the apartment buildings were smaller and even more desperately shabby I used to see him at the Costello Avenue Market sometimes Mrs Kersh said and at the Washateria before they closed it We passed a word from time to time Wegirl youre pale Im sorry Come in and let me give you tea No I couldnt Beverly said weakly but in fact she actually felt pale like clouded glass that you could nearly look through She could use tea and a chair in which to sit and drink it You could and you will Mrs Kersh said warmly Its the least I can do for having told you such unpleasant news Before she could protest Beverly found herself being led up the gloomy hall and into her old apartment which now seemed much smaller but safe enoughsafe she supposed because almost everything was different Instead of the pinktopped Formica table with its three chairs there was a small round table really not much bigger than an endtable with silk flowers in a pottery vase Instead of the old Kelvinator refrigerator with the round drum on top her father tinkered with it constantly to keep it going there was a coppercolored Frigidaire The stove was small but efficientlooking There was an Amana Radar Range above it Bright blue curtains hung in the windows and she could see flowerboxes outside them The floor linoleum when she was a girl here had been stripped to its original wood Many applications of oil made it glow mellowly Mrs Kersh looked around from the stove where she was placing a teapot You grew up here Yes Beverly said But its very different now so trim and tidy wonderful How kind you are Mrs Kersh said and her smile made her younger It was radiant I have a little money you see Not much but with my Social Security I am comfortable Once I was a girl in Sweden I came to this country in a girl of fourteen with no moneywhich is the best way to learn the value of money would you agree At the hospital I worked Mrs Kersh said Many yearsfrom I worked there I rose to the position of head housekeeper All the keys I had My husband invested our money quite well Now I have reached a little harbor Look around miss while the water boils And so she did look Her parents bedroom was now Mrs Kershs bedroom and the difference was profound The room seemed brighter and airier now A large cedar chest the initials RG inlaid into it breathed its gentle aroma into the air A gigantic surprisequilt lay on the bed On it she could see women drawing water boys driving cattle men building haystacks A wonderful quilt Her room had become a sewing room A black Singer machine stood on a wroughtiron table under a pair of starkly efficient Tensor lamps A picture of Jesus hung on one wall a picture of John F Kennedy on another A beautiful breakfront stood below the picture of JFKit was filled with books instead of china but seemed none the worse for that It had been redone in a rose color that was too low and pleasant to seem gaudy All of the fixtures were new and yet she approached the basin feeling that the old nightmare had gripped her again she would peer down into that black and lidless eye the whispering would begin and then the blood She leaned over the sink catching a glimpse of her pallid face and dark eyes in the mirror over the basin and then she stared into that eye waiting for the voices the laughter the groans the blood How long might she have stood there bent over the sink waiting for the sights and sounds twentyseven years gone she didnt know it was Mrs Kershs voice that bid her return Tea miss She jerked back the semihypnosis broken and left the bathroom If there had been dark magic somewhere down in that drain it was gone now or was sleeping Mrs Kersh looked up at her brightly smiling a little O miss if you knew how seldom company calls these days youd not say so Why I put on more than this for the man from the Bangor Hydro who comes to read my meter Im making him fat Delicate cups and saucers stood on the round kitchen table a clean bonewhite edged with blue There was a plate of small cakes and cookies Beside the sweets a pewter teapot chuffed mild steam and pleasant fragrance Bemused Bev thought that the only things missing were the tiny sandwiches with the crusts cut off auntsandwiches shed thought them always one word Three main types of auntsandwichescream cheese and olive watercress and egg salad Sit down said Mrs Kersh sit down miss and Ill pour out Im not a miss Beverly said and raised her left hand so that her ring would show Mrs Kersh smiled and pushed a hand through the airpshaw the gesture said I call all the pretty young girls miss she said Just a habit Dont take offense No Beverly said not at all But for some reason she felt a feathertouch of unease there was something in the old womans smile that had seemed a little what Unpleasant False Knowing But that was ridiculous wasnt it Do you Mrs Kersh said and poured out The tea looked dark muddy Beverly wasnt sure she wanted to drink it and suddenly she wasnt sure she wanted to be here at all It did say Marsh under the doorbell her mind whispered suddenly and she was frightened Thank you Beverly said The look of it might have been muddy the aroma however was wonderful She tasted It was fine Stop jumping at shadows she told herself That cedar chest in particular is a wonderful piece An antique that one Mrs Kersh said and laughed Beverly noticed that the old womans beauty was flawed on only one score and that was common enough here in the northlands Her teeth were very badstronglooking but bad all the same They were yellow and the front two had crossed each other The canines seemed very long almost like tusks They were white when she came to the door she smiled and you thought to yourself how white they were Suddenly she was not just a little frightened Suddenly she wantedneededto be away from here Very old oh yes Mrs Kersh exclaimed and drank her cup of tea off at a single gulp with a sudden shocking slurping sound She smiled at Beverlygrinned at herand Beverly saw that the womans eyes had changed too The corneas were now yellow ancient threaded with bleary stitches of red Her hair was thinner the braid looked malnourished no longer silver shot with bright yellow but a dull gray Very old Mrs Kersh reminisced over her empty cup looking slyly at Beverly from her yellowed eyes Her snaggle teeth showed in that repulsive almost leering grin From home with me it came The RG carved into it You noticed Yes Her voice came from far away and a part of her brain yammered If she doesnt know youve seen the change perhaps youre still all right if she doesnt know doesnt see My father she said pronouncing it fodder and Beverly saw that her dress had also changed It had become a scabrous peeling black The cameo was a skull its jaw hung in a diseased gape His name was Robert Gray better known as Bob Gray better known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown Although that was not his name either But he did love his joke my fadder She laughed again Some of her teeth had turned as black as her dress The wrinkles in her skin now cut deep Her milkrose skin had gone a sickly yellow Her ringers were claws She grinned at Beverly Have something to eat dear Her voice had risen half an octave but the octave was cracked in this register and her voice was the sound of a crypt door swinging mindlessly on hinges clogged with black earth No thank you Beverly heard her mouth say in a childs high ohImustbegoing voice The words did not seem to originate in her brain rather they came out of her mouth and then had to travel around to her ears before she was aware of what she had said No the witch asked and grinned Her claws scrabbled on the plate and she began to cram thin molasses cookies and delicate frosted slices of cake into her mouth with both hands Her horrid teeth plunged and reared plunged and reared her fingernails long and dirty dug into the sweets crumbs tumbled down the bony slab of her chin Her breath was the smell of longdead things burst wide open by the gases of their own decay Her laugh was now a dead cackle Her hair was thinner Scaly scalp showed in patches Oh he loved his joke my fadder This is a joke miss if you enjoy them my fadder bore me rather than my mutter He shat me from his asshole Hee Hee Hee I ought to go Beverly heard herself say in that same high wounded voicethe voice of a small girl who has been viciously embarrassed at her first party There was no strength in her legs She was dimly aware that it was not tea in her cup but shit liquid shit a little partyfavor from the sewers under the city She had drunk some of that not much but a sip oh God oh God oh blessed Jesus please please The woman was shrinking before her eyes thinning it was now a crone with an appledolls face who sat across from her giggling in a high squealing voice and rocking back and forth Oh my fadder and I are one she said just me just him and dear if you are wise you will run run back to where you came from run quickly because to stay will mean worse than your death No one who dies in Derry really dies You knew that before believe it now In slow motion Beverly gathered her legs under her As if from outside she saw herself gaining her feet and backing away from the table and from the witch in an agony of horror and disbelief disbelief because she realized for the first time that the neat little diningroom table was not dark oak but fudge Even as she watched the witch still giggling her ancient yellow eyes slanted slyly off into the corner of the room broke a piece of it off and stuffed it avidly into the blackringed trap that was her mouth The cups she saw were white bark that had been carefully looped with bluedyed frosting The pictures of Jesus and John Kennedy were creations of nearly transparent spun sugar and as she looked at them Jesus stuck out His tongue and Kennedy dropped a stinky wink Were all waiting for you the witch screamed and her fingernails scrabbled over the surface of the fudge table drawing deep scars in its shining surface Oh yes Oh yes The overhead lights were globes of hard candy The wainscotting was caramel taffy She looked down and saw that her shoes were leaving prints on the floorboards which were not boards at all but slices of chocolate The smell of candy was cloying Oh God its Hansel and Gretel its the witch the one that always scared me the worst because she ate the children You and your friends the witch screamed laughing You and your friends In the cage In the cage until the ovens hot She screamed laughter and Beverly ran for the door but she ran as if in slow motion The witchs laughter beat and swirled around her head a cloud of bats Beverly shrieked The hall stank of sugar and nougat and toffee and sickening synthetic strawberries The doorknob mock crystal when she came in was now a monstrous sugar diamond She turned swirls of red hair floating around her face to see her father staggering toward her down the hallway wearing the witchs black dress and skull cameo her fathers face hung with doughy running flesh his eyes as black as obsidian his hands clenching and unclenching his mouth grinning with soupy fervor I beat you because I wanted to FUCK you Bevvie thats all I wanted to do I wanted to FUCK you I wanted to EAT you I wanted to eat your PUSSY I wanted to SUCK your CLIT up between my teeth YUMYUM Bevvie oooohhhhh YUMMY IN MY TUMMY I wanted to put you in the cage and get the oven hot and feel your CUNT your plump CUNT and when it was plump enough to eat to eat EAT Screaming she grasped the sticky doorknob and bolted out onto a porch that was decorated with praline doodads and floored with fudge Far away dim seeming to swim in her vision she saw cars passing back and forth and a woman pushing a cartful of groceries back from Costellos I have to get out there she thought just barely coherent Thats reality out there if I can only get out to the sidewalk told her laughing Weve waited a long time for this This is going to be fun This is going to be YUMMY in our TUMMIES She looked back again and now her dead father was not wearing the witchs black dress but the clown suit with the big orange buttons There was a style coonskin cap the kind popularized by Fess Parker in the Disney movie about Davy Crockett perched on its head In one hand it held a bunch of balloons In the other it held the leg of a child like a chicken drumstick Written on each balloon was the legend IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE Tell your friends I am the last of a dying race it said grinning its sunken grin as it staggered and lurched down the porch steps after her The only survivor of a dying planet I have come to rob all the women rape all the men and learn to do the Peppermint Twist It began to do a mad shuckandjive balloons in one hand severed bleeding leg in the other The clown costume writhed and flapped but Beverly felt no wind Her legs tangled in each other and she spilled to the pavement throwing out her palms to take up the shock which went all the way to her shoulders The woman pushing the grocery cart paused and looked back doubtfully then hurried on a little faster The clown came toward her again casting the severed leg aside It landed on the lawn with an indescribable thud Beverly only lay sprawled on the pavement for a moment sure somewhere inside that she must wake soon this couldnt be real had to be a dream She realized that wasnt true a moment before the clowns crooked longclawed fingers touched her It was real it could kill her As it had killed the children The grackles know your real name she screamed at it suddenly It recoiled and it seemed to her that for a moment the grin on the lips inside the great red grin that had been painted on and around them became a grimace of hate and pain and perhaps of fear as well It might only have been her imagination and she certainly had no idea why she had said such a crazy thing but it bought her an instant of time She was on her feet and running Brakes squealed and a hoarse voice both mad and scared yelled Why dont you look where youre going you dumb quiff She had a blurred impression of the bakery truck that had almost hit her when she bolted into the street like a child after a rubber ball and then she was standing on the opposite sidewalk panting a hot stitch in her left side The bakery truck went on down Lower Main The clown was gone The leg was gone The house still stood there but she saw now that it was crumbling and deserted the windows boarded up the steps leading up to the porch cracked and broken Was I really in there or did I dream it all But her jeans were dirty her yellow blouse smeared with dust She rubbed them on the legs of her jeans and walked away fast her face hot her back cold as ice her eyeballs seeming to pulse in and out with the rapid thud of her heart We cant beat It Whatever It is we cant beat It It even wants us to tryIt wants to settle the old score Cant be happy with a draw I guess We ought to get out of here just leave Something brushed against her calf light as a cats questing paw She jerked away from it with a little shriek She looked down and cringed one hand against her mouth It was a balloon as yellow as her blouse Written on the side of it in electric blue were the words THATs WIGHT WABBIT As she watched it went bouncing lightly up the street urged by the pleasant latespring breeze Well there was the day Henry and his friends chased mebefore the end of school this was Richie was walking along Outer Canal Street past Bassey Park Now he stopped hands stuffed in his pockets looking toward theKissing Bridge but not really seeing it I got away from them in the toy department of Freeses Since the mad conclusion of the reunion lunch he had been walking aimlessly trying to make his peace with the awful things which had been in the fortune cookies or the things which had seemed to be in the cookies He thought that most likely nothing at all had come out of them It had been a group hallucination brought on by all the spooky shit they had been talking about The best proof of the hypothesis was that Rose had seen nothing at all Of course Beverlys parents had never seen any of the blood that came out of the bathroom drain either but this wasnt the same Because were grownups now he muttered and discovered the thought had absolutely no power or logic at all it might as well have been a nonsense line from a kids skiprope chant I went up by City Center and sat down on a park bench for awhile and I thought I saw He looked to the left and saw the big glassbrickandsteel building that had looked so modern in the late fifties and now looked rather antique and tacky And here I am he thought Right back to fucking City Center Scene of that other hallucination Or dream Or whatever it was The others saw him as the Klass Klown the Krazy Kutup and he had fallen neatly and easily into that role again Ah we all fell neatly and easily back into our old roles again didnt you notice But was there anything very unusual about that He thought you would probably see much the same thing at any tenth or twentieth high school reunionthe class comedian who had discovered a vocation for the priesthood in college would after two drinks revert almost automatically to the wiseacre he had been the Great English Brain who had wound up with a GM truck dealership would suddenly begin spouting off about John Irving or John Cheever the guy who had played with the Moondogs on Saturday nights and who had gone on to become a mathematics professor at Cornell would suddenly find himself on stage with the band a Fender guitar strapped over his shoulder whopping out Gloria or surfin Bird with gleeful drunken ferocity What was it Springsteen said No retreat baby no surrender but it was easier to believe in the oldies on the recordplayer after a couple of drinks or some pretty good Panama Red But Richie believed it was the reversion that was the hallucination not the present life Maybe the child was the father of the man but fathers and sons often shared very different interests and only a passing resemblance They But you say grownups and now it sounds like nonsense it sounds like so much bibblebabble Why is that Richie Why Because Derry is as weird as ever Why dont we just leave it at that As a kid he had been a goofoff a sometimes vulgar sometimes amusing comedian because it was one way to get along without getting killed by kids like Henry Bowers or going absolutely loonytunes with boredom and loneliness He realized now that a lot of the problem had been his own mind which was usually moving at a speed ten or twenty times that of his classmates They had thought him strange weird or even suicidal depending on the escapade in question but maybe it had been a simple case of mental overdriveif anything about being in constant mental overdrive was simple Anyway it was the sort of thing you got under control after awhileyou got it under control or you found outlets for it guys like Kinky Briefcase or Buford Kissdrivel for instance Richie had discovered that in the months after he had wandered into the college radio station pretty much on a whim and had discovered everything he had ever wanted during his first week behind the microphone He hadnt been very good at first he had been too excited to be good But he had understood his potential not to be just good at the job but great at it and just that knowledge had been enough to put him over the moon on a cloud of euphoria At the same time he had begun to understand the great principle that moved the universe at least that part of the universe which had to do with careers and success you found the crazy guy who was running around inside of you fucking up your life You chased him into a corner and grabbed him But you didnt kill him Oh no Killing was too good for the likes of that little bastard You put a harness over his head and then started plowing The crazy guy worked like a demon once you had him in the traces And he supplied you with a few chucks from time to tune That was really all there was And that was enough He had been funny all right a laugh a minute but in the end he had outgrown the nightmares that were on the dark side of all those laughs Or he thought he had Until today when the word grownup suddenly stopped making sense to his own ears And now here was something else to cope with or at least think about here was the huge and totally idiotic statue of Paul Bunyan in front of City Center I must be the exception that proves the rule Big Bill Sharp pain needled at his eyes for the second time that day and he clutched at them a startled moan coming out of him Then it was gone again as quickly as it had come But he had also smelled something hadnt he Something that wasnt really there but something that had been there something that made him think of Im right here with you Richie hold my hand can you catch hold Mike Hanlon It was smoke that had made his eyes sting and water Twentyseven years ago they had breathed that smoke in the end there had just been Mike and himself left and they had seen He took a step closer to the plastic Paul Bunyan statue as amazed by its cheerful vulgarity now as he had been overwhelmed by its size as a child The mythical Paul stood twenty feet high and the base added another six feet He stood smiling down at the car and pedestrian traffic on Outer Canal Street from the edge of the City Center lawn City Center had been erected in the years for a minorleague basketball team that had never materialized The Derry City Council had voted money for the statue a year later in  I had been hotly debated both in the councils public meetings and in the letterstotheeditor columns of the Derry News Many thought it would be a perfectly lovely statue certain to become a tourist attraction of note There were others who found the idea of a plastic Paul Bunyan horrible garish and unbelievably gauche The art teacher at Derry High School Richie remembered had written a letter to the News saying that if such a monstrosity were actually to be erected in Derry she would blow it up Grinning Richie wondered if that babes contract had been renewed The controversywhich Richie recognized now as an utterly typical bigtownsmallcity tempest in a teapothad raged for six months and of course it had been entirely meaningless the statue had been purchased and even if the City Council had done something as aberrant especially for New England as deciding not to use an item for which money had been paid where in Gods name could it have been stored Then the statue not really sculpted at all but simply cast in some Ohio plastics plant had been set in place still shrouded in a whack of canvas big enough to serve as a clippership sail It had been unveiled on May th which was the incorporated townships onehundredandfiftieth birthday One faction gave voice to predictable moans of outrage the other to equally predictable moans of rapture When Paul was revealed that day he was wearing his bib overalls and a redandwhitechecked shirt His beard was splendidly black splendidly full splendidly lumber jacky A plastic axe surely the Godzilla of all plastic axes was slung over one shoulder and he grinned unceasingly at the northern skies which on the day of the unveiling had been as blue as the skin of Pauls reputed companion Babe was not present at the unveiling however the cost estimate of adding a blue ox to the tableau had been prohibitive The children who attended the ceremonies there were hundreds of them and tenyearold Richie Tozier in the company of his dad had been among them were totally and uncritically delighted by the plastic giant Parents boosted toddlers up onto the square pedestal on which Paul stood took photos and then watched with mixed apprehension and amusement as the kids climbed and crawled laughing over Pauls huge black boots correction huge black plastic boots It had been March of the following year when Richie exhausted and terrified had finished up on one of the benches in front of the statue after eludingby the barest of marginsMessrs Bowers Criss and Huggins in a chase that had led from Derry Elementary School across most of the downtown area He had finally ditched them in the toy department of Freeses Department Store The Derry branch of Freeses was a poor thing compared with the grand downtown department store in Bangor but Richie had been far past caring about such thingsby then it was a case of any port in a storm Henry Bowers had been right behind him and by then Richie had been flagging badly He had dodged into the mouth of the department stores revolving door as a last resort Henry who apparently didnt understand the physics of such devices had nearly lost the tips of his fingers trying to grab Richie as Richie trundled around and into the store Pelting downstairs shirttail flying out behind him he had heard the revolving door give off a series of reports almost as loud as TV gunfire and understood that Larry Moe and Curly were still after him He was laughing as he went down the stairs to the basement level but that was only a nervous tic he was as full of terror as a rabbit caught in a wire snare They really meant to beat him up good this time he had no idea that in another ten weeks or so he would believe the three of them Henry in particular capable of anything short of murder and he surely would have whitened with shock if he had known of the apocalyptic rockfight in July when even that last qualification would disappear from his mind And the whole thing had been so utterly typically stupid Richie and the other boys in his fifthgrade class had been filing into the gym A sixthgrade class Henry hulking among them like an ox among cows had been coming out Although he was still in the fifth grade Henry went to gym with the older boys The overhead pipes had been dripping again and Mr Fazio hadnt yet gotten around to putting up his CAUTION WET FLOOR sign on its little easel Henry had slipped in a puddle and had landed on his keister Before he could stop it Richies traitor mouth had bugled Way to go bananaheels There had been an explosion of laughter from both Henrys classmates and Richies but there had been no laughter on Henrys face as he picked himself uponly a dull flush the color of freshly fired brick The laughter died at once The boys in the hall looked at Richie as one already dead Henry did not pause to check reactions he simply walked off head down elbows red from catching the fall a large wet place on the seat of his pants Looking at that wet spot Richie felt his suicidally witty mouth drop open again but this time he snapped it shut again so fast he almost amputated the tip of his tongue with the falling gate of his teeth Well but hell forget he told himself uneasily as he changed up for gym Sure he will Ole Hank just hasnt got that many memory circuits working Every time he takes a shit he probably has to look up the directions in the instruction booklet haha Youre dead Trashmouth Vince Boogers Taliendo told him pulling his jock up over a dork roughly the size and shape of an anemic peanut He said it with a certain sad respect dont worry though Ill bring flowers Cut off your ears and bring cauliflowers Richie had come back smartly and everyone laughed even ole Boogers Taliendo laughed why not they could all afford to laugh What me worry They would all be home watching Jimmy Dodd and the Mouseketeers on the Mickey Mouse Club or Frankie Lymon singing Im Not a Juvenile Delinquent on American Bandstand while Richie went shagging ass through ladies lingerie and housewares on his way to the toy department with sweat pouring down his back into the crack of his ass and his terrified balls strung up so high they felt like they might be hung over his bellybutton Sure they could laugh Hardeharharhar Henry hadnt forgotten Richie had left by the door at the kindergarten end of the school building just in case but Henry had stuck Belch Huggins there also just in case Hardeharharhar Richie saw Belch first or there would have been no contest at all Belch was looking out toward Derry Park holding an unlit cigarette in one hand and dreamily picking the seat of his chinos out of his ass with the other Heart pounding hard Richie had walked quietly across the playground and was most of the way down Charter Street before Belch turned his head and saw him He yelled for Henry and Victor and since then the chase had been on When Richie reached the toy department it had been utterly horribly deserted There wasnt even a sales clerk hanging outa welcome adult to put a stop to things before they got entirely out of hand He could hear the three dinosaurs of the apocalypse closing in now And he simply couldnt run anymore Each breath produced a deep hurting stitch in his left side His eye fixed on a door which read EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY ALARM WILL SOUND Hope kindled in his chest Richie ran down an aisle crammed with Donald Duck jackintheboxes United States Army tanks made in Japan Lone Ranger cap pistols windup robots He reached the door and slammed the pushbar as hard as he could The door opened letting in cool midMarch air The alarm went off with a strident bray Richie immediately doubled back and dropped to his hands and knees in the next aisle over He was down before the door could settle closed again Henry Belch and Victor thundered into the toy department just as the door clicked shut and the alarm cut off They raced for it Henry in the lead his face set and intent A sales clerk finally appeared coming on the run He wore a blue nylon duster over a plaid sportcoat of excruciating ugliness The rims of his spectacles were as pink as the eyes of a white rabbit Richie thought he looked like Wally Cox in his Mr Peepers role and he had to slam his traitor mouth into the fat part of his forearm to keep from screaming out gales of exhausted laughter You boys Mr Peepers exclaimed You boys cant go out there Thats an emergency exit You Hey You boys Victor glanced at him a little nervously but Henry and Belch never turned from their course and Victor followed them The alarm brayed again longer this time as they charged into the alley Before it stopped clanging Richie was on his feet and trotting back toward ladies lingerie You boys will be barred from the store the clerk yelled after him Looking back over his shoulder Richie squealed in his Granny Grunt Voice did anyone ever tell you you look just like Mr Peepers young man And so he had escaped And so he had finished up almost a mile from Freeses in front of City Center and he devoutly hoped out of harms way At least for the time being He was spent He sat down on a bench just to the left of the Paul Bunyan statue wanting only a little peace while he got himself back together In a bit he would get up and head home but for now it felt too good to just sit here in the afternoon sun The day had opened in a cold drizzly gloom but now you could believe spring might actually be on the way Farther up the lawn he could see the City Center marquee which on that March day bore this message in large blue translucent letters That was a show Richie really wanted to see but he knew there wasnt a chance His mothers idea of wholesome entertainment did not include Jerry Lee Lewis telling the young people of America we got chicken in the barn whose barn what barn my barn Nor for that matter did it include Freddy Cannon whose Tallahassee lassie had a hifi chassis She was willing to admit that she had done her share of screaming for Frank Sinatra whom she now called Frankie the Snot as a bobbysoxer but like Bill Denbroughs mother she was death on rock and roll Chuck Berry terrified her and she declared that Richard Penniman better known to his teen and subteen constituency as Little Richard made her want to barf like a chicken This was a phrase for which Richie had never asked a translation His dad was neutral on the subject of rock and roll and could perhaps have been swayed but Richie knew in his heart that his mothers wishes would rule on this subjectuntil he was sixteen or seventeen anywayand by then his mother was firmly convinced the countrys rock and roll mania would have passed Richie thought Danny and the Juniors were more right on that subject than his momrock and roll would never die He himself loved it although his sources were really only twoAmerican Bandstand on Channel in the afternoon and WMEX out of Boston at night when the air had thinned and the hoarse enthusiastic voice of Arnie Ginsberg came wavering in and out like the voice of a ghost called up at a seance The beat did more than make him happy It made him feel bigger stronger more there When Frankie Ford sang sea Cruise or Eddie Cochran sang summertime Blues Richie was actually transported with joy There was power in that music a power which seemed to most rightfully belong to all the skinny kids fat kids ugly kids shy kidsthe worlds losers in short In it he felt a mad hilarious voltage which had the power to both kill and exalt He idolized Fats Domino who made even Ben Hanscom look sum and trim and Buddy Holly who like Richie wore glasses and Screaming Jay Hawkins who popped out of a coffin at his concerts or so Richie had been told and the Dovells who danced as good as black guys He would have his rock and roll someday if he wanted ithe was confident it would still be there for him when his mother finally gave in and let him have itbut that would not be on March th or in  or His eyes had drifted away from the marquee and then well then he must have fallen asleep It was the only explanation that made sense What had happened next could only happen in dreams And now here he was again a Richie Tozier who had finally gotten all the rock and roll he had ever wanted and who had found happily that it still wasnt enough His eyes went to the marquee in front of City Center and saw that with a hideous kind of serendipity those same blue letters spelled out Somewhere along the way they dropped the wholesome entertainment line thought Richie but as far as I can tell thats just about the only difference And heard Danny and the Juniors dim and distant like voices heard down a long corridor coming out of a cheap radio Rock and roll will never die Ill dig it to the end Itll go down in history just you watch my friend Richie looked back at Paul Bunyan patron saint of DerryDerry which had come into being according to the stories because this was where the logs fetched up when they came downriver There had been a time when in the spring both the Penobscot and the Kenduskeag would have been solid logs from one side to the other their black bark hides glistening in the spring sun A fellow who was fast on his feet could walk from Wallys Spa in Hells HalfAcre over to Rampers in Brewster Rampers was a tavern of such horrible repute that it was commonly called the Bucket of Blood without getting his boots wet over the third crossing of his rawhide laces Or so it had been storied in Richies youth and he supposed there was a bit of Paul Bunyan in all such stories Old Paul he thought looking up at the plastic statue What you been doing since Ive been gone Made any new riverbeds coming home tired and dragging your axe behind you Made any new lakes on account of wanting a bathtub big enough so you could sit in water up to your neck Scared any more little kids the way you scared me that day Ah and suddenly he remembered it all the way you will sometimes suddenly remember a word which has been dancing on the tip of your tongue There he had been sitting in that mellow March sunshine drowsing a little thinking about going home and catching the last half hour of Bandstand and suddenly there had been a warm swash of air into his face It blew his hair back from his forehead He looked up and Paul Bunyans huge plastic face had been right in front of his bigger than a face on a movie screen filling everything The rush of air had been caused by Paul bending down although he did not precisely look like Paul anymore The forehead was now low and beetling tufts of wiry hair poked from a nose as red as the nose of a longtime drunkard his eyes were bloodshot and one had a slight cast to it The axe was no longer on his shoulder Paul was leaning on its haft and the blunt end of its head had crushed a trench in the concrete of the sidewalk He was still grinning but there was nothing cheery about it now From between gigantic yellow teeth there drifted a smell like small animals rotting in hot underbrush Im going to eat you up the giant had said in a low rumbling voice It was the sound of boulders rocking against each other during an earthquake Unless you give me back my hen and my harp and my bags of gold Im going to eat you right the fuck up The breath of these words made Richies shirt flutter and flap like a sail in a hurricane He shrank back against the bench eyes bugging hair standing out to all sides like quills wrapped in a pocket of carrionstink The giant began to laugh It settled its hands on the haft of its axe the way Ted Williams might have laid hold of his favorite baseball bat or ashhandle if you prefer and pulled it out of the hole it had made in the sidewalk The axe began to rise into the air It made a low lethal rushing sound Richie suddenly understood that the giant meant to split him right down the middle But he felt that he could not move a logy sort of apathy had stolen over him What did it matter He was dozing having a dream Any moment now some driver would blow his horn at a kid running across the street and he would wake up Thats right the giant had rumbled youll wake up in hell And at the last instant as the axe slowed to its apogee and balanced there Richie understood that this wasnt a dream at all and if it was it was a dream that could kill Trying to scream but making no sound at all he rolled off the bench and onto the raked gravel plot which surrounded what had been a statue and was now only a base with two huge steel bolts sticking out of it where the feet had been The sound of the descending axe filled the world with its pressing insistent whisper the giants grin had become a murderers grimace Its lips had pulled back so far from its teeth that its plastic red gums hideously red gleamed The blade of the axe struck the bench where Richie had been only an instant before The edge was so sharp that there was almost no sound at all but the bench was sheared instantly in two The halves sagged away from each other the wood inside the greenpainted skin a bright and somehow sickening white Richie was on his back Still trying to scream he pushed himself with his heels Gravel went down the collar of his shirt down the back of his pants And there was Paul towering above him looking down at him with eyes the size of manhole covers there was Paul looking down at one small boy cowering on the gravel The giant took a step toward him Richie felt the ground shudder when the black boot came down Gravel spumed up in a cloud Richie rolled over onto his stomach and staggered to his feet His legs were already trying to run before he was balanced and as a result he fell flat on his belly again He heard the wind whoof out of his lungs His hair fell in his eyes He could see the traffic going back and forth on Canal and Main Streets as it did every day as if nothing was happening as if no one in any of those cars could see or care that Paul Bunyan had come to life and stepped down from its pedestal in order to commit murder with an axe roughly the size of a deluxe motor home The sunshine was blotted out Richie lay in a patch of shade that looked like a man He scrambled to his knees almost fell over sideways managed to get to his feet and ran as fast as he couldhe ran with his knees popping almost all the way up to his chest and his elbows pistoning Behind him he could hear that awful persistent whisper building again a sound that seemed to be not really sound at all but pressure on the skin and eardrums Swiiipppppp The earth shook Richies upper and lower teeth rattled against each other like china plates in an earthquake He did not have to look to know that Pauls axe had buried itself haftdeep in the sidewalk inches behind his feet Madly in his mind he heard the Dovells Oh the kids in Bristol are sharp as a pistol When they do the Bristol Stomp He passed out of the giants shadow into sunlight again and as he did he began to laughthe same exhausted laughter that had come from him when he bolted downstairs in Freeses Panting that hot stitch in his side again he had at last risked a glance back over his shoulder There was the statue of Paul Bunyan standing on its pedestal where it always stood axe on its shoulder head cocked toward the sky lips parted in the eternal optimistic grin of the mythhero The bench which had been sheared in two was whole and intact thank you very much The gravel where Tall Paul Hesa my all Annette Funicello sang maniacally in Richies head had planted his huge foot was raked and immaculate except for the scuffed spot where Richie had fallen off while he was dreaming There was no footprint no axeslash in the concrete There was nothing here but a boy who had been chased by other boys bigger boys and so had had himself a very small but very potent dream about a homicidal Colossus the Giant EconomySize Henry Bowers if you pleased Shit Richie said in a tiny wavering voice and then uttered an uncertain laugh He stood there awhile longer waiting to see if the statue would move againperhaps wink perhaps shift its axe from one shoulder to the other perhaps come down and have at him again But of course none of those things happened But as Abraham Lincoln or Socrates or someone like that had once observed enough was enough It was time to go home and cool out to make like Kookie on Sunset Strip and just lay chilly And although it would have been quicker to cut through the City Center grounds he decided not to He didnt want to get close to that statue again So he had gone the long way around and by that evening he had nearly forgotten the incident Here sits a man he thought here sits a man dressed in a mossygreen sportcoat purchased at one of the best shops on Rodeo Drive here sits a man with Bass Weejuns on his feet and Calvin Klein underwear to cover his ass here sits a man with soft contact lenses resting easily on his eyes here sits a man remembering the dream of a boy who thought an Ivy League shin with a fruitloop on the back and a pair of Snap Jack shoes was the height of fashion here sits a grownup looking at the same old statue and hey Paul Tall Paul Im here to say youre the same in every way you aint aged a motherfucking day The old explanation still rang true in his mind a dream He supposed he could believe in monsters if he had to monsters were no big deal Hadnt he sat in radio studios at one time or another reading news copy about such fellows as Idi Amin Dada and Jim Jones and that guy who had blown away all those folks in a McDonalds just down the road apiece Shitfire and save matches monsters were cheap Who needed a fivebuck movie ticket when you could read about them in the paper for thirtyfive cents or hear about them on the radio for free And he supposed if he could believe in the Jim Jones variety he could believe in Mike Hanlons version at least for awhile It even had Its own sorry charm because It came from Outside and no one had to claim responsibility for It He could believe in a monster that had as many faces as there are rubber masks in a novelty shop if youre gonna have one you might as well have a pack of em he thought cheaper by the dozen right gang at least for the sake of argument but a thirtyfoothigh plastic statue that stepped off its pedestal and then tried to carve you up with its plastic axe That was just a little too ripe As Abraham Lincoln or Socrates or someone had also said Ill eat fish and Ill eat meat but there is some shit I will not eat It just wasnt That sharp needling pain struck his eyes again without warning jerking a dismayed cry from him This was the worst yet going deeper and lasting longer scaring the bejesus out of him He clapped his hands to his eyes and then groped instinctively for the bottom lids with his forefingers meaning to pop his contacts out Its maybe some kind of infection he thought dimly But Jesus it hurts He pulled the lids down and was ready to give the single practiced blink that would send them tumbling out and he would spend the next fifteen minutes grovelling myopically for them in the gravel surrounding the bench but Jesus God who gave a shit right now it felt like there were nails in his eyes when the pain disappeared It did not dwindle it just went One moment there the next moment gone His eyes teared briefly and then stopped He lowered his hands slowly his heart running fast in his chest ready to blink them out the instant the pain started again It didnt And suddenly he found himself thinking about the only horror movie that had ever really scared him as a kid possibly because he had taken so much shit about his glasses and had spent so much time thinking about his eyes That movie had been The Crawling Eye with Forrest Tucker Not very good The other kids had laughed themselves into hysterics over it but Richie had not laughed Richie had been rendered cold and white and dumb for once with not a single Voice to command as that gelatinous tentacled eye came out of the manufactured fog of some English movie set waving its fibrous tentacles in front of it The sight of that eye had been very bad the embodiment of a hundred notquiterealized fears and disquiets On some night not long after he had dreamed of looking at himself in a mirror and bringing a large pin up and sticking it slowly into the black iris of his eye and feeling a numb watery springiness as the bottom of his eye filled up with blood He rememberednow he rememberedwaking up and discovering that he had wet the bed The best indicator of how gruesome that dream had been was that his primary feeling had been not shame at his nocturnal indiscretion but relief he had embraced the warm wet patch with his body and blessed the reality of his sight Fuck this Richie Tozier said in a low voice that was not quite steady and started to get up He would go back to the Derry Town House and take a nap If this was Memory Lane he preferred the LA Freeway at rushhour The pain in his eyes was probably no more than a signal of exhaustion and jetlag plus the stress of meeting the past all at once in one afternoon Enough shocks enough exploring He didnt like the way his mind was skittering from one subject to the next What was that Peter Gabriel tune shock the Monkey Well this monkey had been shocked enough It was time to catch some zs and maybe gain a little perspective As he rose his eyes went to the marquee in front of City Center again All at once the strength ran out of his legs and he sat down again Hard He felt as if someone had whopped all the breath out of him and then he heard that sound again that sound that was half pressure on the skin and eardrums that keen homicidal whispering rushSwiipppp He rolled off the bench onto the gravel thinking So this is what they mean by deja vu now you know youll never have to ask anybody again He hit on his shoulder and rolled looking up at the Paul Bunyan statueonly it was no longer Paul Bunyan The clown stood there instead resplendent and evident fantastic in plastic twenty feet of DayGlo colors its painted face surmounting a cosmic comic ruff Orange pompom buttons cast in plastic each as big as a volleyball ran down the front of the silvery suit Instead of an axe it held a huge bunch of plastic balloons Engraved on each were two legends ITS STILL ROCK AND ROLL TO ME and RICHIE TOZIERS ALLDEAD ROCK SHOW He scrambled backward using his heels and his palms Gravel went down the back of his pants He heard a seam tear loose in die underarm of his Rodeo Drive sportcoat He rolled over gamed his feet staggered looked back The down looked down at him Its eyes rolled wetly in their sockets And Richie heard his mouth say quite independently of his frozen brain Cheap thrills in the back of my car Bozo Thats all The clown grinned and nodded as if it had expected no more Red paintbleeding lips parted to show teeth like fangs each one coming to a razor point I could have you now if I wanted you now it said But this is going to be too much fun Fun for me too Richie heard his mouth say The most fun of all when we come to take your fucking head off baby The clowns grin spread wider and wider It raised one hand clad in a white glove and Richie felt the wind of the movement blow the hair off his forehead as it had on that day twentyseven years ago The clowns index finger popped out at him It was as big as a beam Big as a bea Richie thought and then the pain struck again It drove nisty spikes into the soft jelly of his eyes He screamed and clutched at his face Before removing the mote from thy neighbors eye attend the beam in thine own the clown intoned its words rumbling and vibrating and Richie was again enveloped in the sweet stink of its carrion breath He looked up and took half a dozen hurried steps backward The clown was bending down its gloved hands on its gaily pantalooned knees Want to play some more Richie How about if I point at your pecker and give you prostate cancer Or I could point at your head and give you a good old brain tumoralthough Im sure some people would say that would only be adding to what was already there I can point at your mouth and your stupid flapping tongue will turn into so much running pus I can do it Richie Want to see Its eyes were widening widening and in those black pupils each as big as a softball Richie saw the mad darkness that must exist over the rim of the universe he saw a shitty happiness that he felt would drive him insane In that moment he understood It could do any of these things and more And yet again he heard his mouth but this time it was not his voice or any of his created Voices past or present it was a Voice he had never heard before Later he would tell the others hesitantly that it was a kind of Mr Jiveass Nigger Voice loud and proud selfparodying and screechy Git off man case you big ole honky clown he shouted and suddenly he was laughing again No shit an no shine muhfuh I got dwalk I got dtalk and I got dbig boppin cock I got d time I got d mine Im a man wit a plan an if you doan shit you goan git You hear me you whiteface bunghole Richie thought the clown recoiled but he did not stick around to find out for sure He ran elbows pumping sportcoat flying out in wings behind him not caring that a father who had stopped so his toddler could admire Paul was now staring warily at him as if he had gone crazy As a matter of fact folks Richie thought I feel like Ive gone crazy Oh God do I ever And that had to have been the shiniest Grandmaster Flash imitation in history but somehow it did the trick somehow And then the clowns voice thundered after him The father of the little boy did not hear it but the toddlers face suddenly pinched in upon itself and he began to wail The dad picked his son up and hugged him bewildered Even through his own terror Richie observed this little sideshow closely The voice of the clown was perhaps angrily gleeful perhaps just angry Weve got the eye down here Richie you hear me The one that crawls If you dont want to fly dont wanna say goodbye you come on down under this here town and give a great big hi to one great big eye You come down and see it anytime Just any old time you like You hear me Richie Bring your yoyo Have Beverly wear a big full skin with four or five petticoats underneath Have her wear her husbands ring around her neck Get Eddie to wear his saddleshoes Well play some bop Richie Well play AAALLLL THE HITS Reaching the sidewalk Richie dared to look back over his shoulder and what he saw was in no way comforting Paul Bunyan was still gone and now the clown was gone too Where they had stood there was now a twentyfoothigh plastic statue of Buddy Holly He was wearing a button on one of the narrow lapels of his plaid sportcoat RICHIE TOZIERs ALLDEAD ROCK SHOW the button read One bow of Buddys glasses had been mended with adhesive tape The little boy was still crying hysterically his father was walking rapidly back toward downtown with the weeping child in his arms He gave Richie a wide berth what had just happened All he wanted to think about was the monster jolt of Scotch he was going to have in the Derry Town House bar before he went up to take that nap The thought of a drinkjust your ordinary gardenvariety drinkmade him feel a little better He looked over his shoulder one more time and the fact that Paul Bunyan was back grinning at the sky plastic axe over his shoulder made him feel better still Richie began to walk faster making tracks putting distance between himself and that statue He had even begun to think about the possibility of hallucinations when the pain struck his eyes again deep and agonizing causing him to cry out hoarsely A pretty young girl who had been walking ahead of him looking dreamily up at the breaking clouds looked back at him hesitated then hurried over Its my contacts he said in a strained voice My damned contact leoh my God that hurts This time he got his forefingers up so quickly he almost jabbed them into his eyes He pulled down the lower lids and thought I wont be able to blink them out thats whats going to happen I wont be able to blink them out and its just going to go on hurting and hurting and hurting until I go blind go blind go blBut one blink did it as one blink always had The sharp and denned world where colors stayed inside the lines and where faces that you saw were clear and obvious simply fell away Wide bands of pastel fuzz took their place And although he and the highschool girl who was both helpful and concerned searched the paving of the sidewalk for almost fifteen minutes neither could find even a single lens In the back of his head Richie seemed to hear the clown laughing Bill did not see Pennywise that afternoonbut he did see a ghost A real ghost So Bill believed then and no subsequent event caused him to change his mind He had walked up Witcham Street and paused for some time by the drain where George met his end on that rainy October day in He squatted down and peered into the drain which was cut into the stonework of the curbing His heart was beating hard but he looked anyway Come out why dont you he said in a low voice and he had the notquitemad idea that his voice was floating along dark and dripping passageways not dying out but continuing onward and onward feeding on its own echoes bouncing off mosscovered stone walls and longdead machinery He felt it float over still and sullen waters and perhaps issue softly from a hundred different drains in other parts of the city at the same time Come out of there or well come in and gget you He waited nervily for a response crouched down with his hands between his thighs like a catcher between pitches There was no response He was about to stand up when a shadow fell over him Bill looked up sharply eagerly ready for anything but it was only a little kid maybe ten maybe eleven He was wearing faded Boy Scout shorts which displayed his scabby knees to good advantage He had a FreezePop in one hand and a Fiberglas skateboard which looked almost as battered as his knees in the other The FreezePop was a fluorescent orange The skateboard was a fluorescent green They looked at each other solemnly for a moment and then burst into laughter at the same time The kid looked at Bill as though he had flipped out He started to walk away and had gotten maybe twelve stepshe was headed up the hill vaguely thinking he would take a look at the home placewhen the kid called Mister Bill turned back He had his sportcoat hooked on his finger and slung over his shoulder His collar was unbuttoned his tie loosened The boy was watching him carefully as if already regretting his decision to speak further Then he shrugged as if saying Oh what the hell I dont know It talked some foreign language I heard it coming out of one of those pumpin stations down in the Barrens One of those pumpin stations they look like pipes coming out of the ground I know what you mean Was it a kid you heard At first it was a kid then it sounded like a man The boy paused I was some scared I ran home and told my father He said maybe it was an echo or something coming all the way down the pipes from someones house The boy smiled charmingly I read in my Ripleys Believe It or Not book that there was this guy he got music from his teeth Radio music His fillings were like little radios I guess if I believed that I could believe anything Once when I was taking a bath the boy said It was a girls voice Just crying No words I was ascared to pull the plug when I was done because I thought I might you know drownd her The kid was looking at Bill openly now his eyes shining and fascinated You know about those voices mister I heard them Bill said A long long time ago Did you know any of the kkids that have been murdered here son The shine went out of the kids eyes it was replaced by caution and disquiet My dad says Im not supposed to talk to strangers He says anybody could be that killer He took an additional step away from Bill moving into the dappled shade of an elm tree that Bill had once driven his bike into twentyseven years ago He had taken a spill and bent his handlebars Not me kid he said Ive been in England for the last four months I just got into Derry yesterday I still dont have to talk to you the kid replied He paused and then said I used to pal around with Johnny Feury some of the time He was a good kid I cried the boy finished matteroffactly and slurped down the rest of his FreezePop As an afterthought he ran out his tongue which was temporarily bright orange and lapped off his arm Keep away from the sewers and drains Bill said quietly Keep away from empty places and deserted places Stay out of trainyards But most of all stay away from the sewers and the drains The shine was back in the kids eyes and he said nothing for a very long time Then Mister You want to hear something funny You know that movie where the shark ate all the people up Well I got this friend you know His names Tommy Vicananza and hes not that bright Toys in the attic you get what I mean He thinks he saw that shark in the Canal He was up there by himself in Bassey Park a couple of weeks ago and he said he seen this fin He says it was eight or nine feet tall Just the fin was that tall you get me He goes Thats what killed Johnny and the other kids It was Jaws I know because I saw it So I go That Canals so polluted nothing could live in it not even a minnow And you think you saw Jaws in there You got toys in the attic Tommy Tommy says it reared right out of the water like it did at the end of that movie and tried to bite him and he just got back in time Pretty funny huh mister Bill hesitated stay away from the Canal too son You follow The kid let out his breath in a low hissing rush He hung his head as if ashamed Yeah Sometimes I think I must have toys in the attic I know what you mean Bill walked over to the kid who glanced up at him solemnly but didnt shy away this time Youre killing your knees on that board son The kid glanced down at his scabby knees and grinned Yeah I guess so I bail out sometimes The kid looked at him gapemouthed at first then laughing Thatd be funny he said I never saw a grownup on a skateboard Never take money or ccandy from strangers Good advice Ill still give you a qquarter What do you say Just to the corner of JuhJackson Street Never mind the quarter the kid said He burst into laughter againa gay and uncomplicated sound A fresh sound I dont need your quarter I got two bucks Im practically rich I got to see this though Just dont blame me if you break something He turned one of the skateboards scuffed wheels with his finger liking the speedy ease with which it turnedit sounded like there was about a million ballbearings in there It was a good sound It called up something very old in Bills chest Some desire as warm as want as lovely as love He smiled I think Im ggonna kill myself Bill said and the kid laughed Bill put the skateboard on the sidewalk and put one foot on it He rolled it back and forth experimentally The kid watched In his mind Bill saw himself rolling down Witcham Street toward Jackson on the kids avocadogreen skateboard the tails of his sportcoat ballooning out behind him his bald head gleaming in the sun his knees bent in that fragile way snowbunnies bend their knees their first day on the slopes It was a posture that told you that in their heads they were already falling down He bet the kid didnt ride the board like that He bet the kid rode That good feeling died out of his chest He saw all too clearly the board going out from under his feet shooting unencumbered down the street an improbable fluorescent green a color that only a child could love He saw himself coming down on his ass maybe on his back Slow dissolve to a private room at the Derry Home Hospital like the one they had visited Eddie in after his arm had been broken Bill Denbrough in a full bodycast one leg held up by pullies and wires A doctor comes in looks at his chart looks at him and then says You were guilty of two major lapses Mr Denbrough The first was mismanagement of a skateboard The second was forgetting that you are now approaching forty years of age He bent picked the skateboard back up and handed it back to the kid I Bill hooked his thumbs into his armpits and flapped his elbows Buckbuck You cant be careful on a skateboard the kid replied looking at Bill as if he might be the one with toys in the attic Right Bill said Okay As we say in the movie biz I hear you But stay away from drams and sewers And stay with your friends The kid put one foot on the board and pushed off with the other Once he was rolling he put the other foot on the board as well and went thundering down the street at what seemed to Bill a suicidal pace But he rode as Bill had suspected he would with lazy hipshot grace Bill felt love for the boy and exhilaration and a desire to be the boy along with an almost suffocating fear The boy rode as if there were no such things as death or getting older The boy seemed somehow eternal and ineluctable in his khaki Boy Scout shorts and scuffed sneakers his ankles sockless and quite dirty his hair flying back behind him Watch out kid youre not going to make the comer Bill thought alarmed but the kid shot his hips to the left like a breakdancer his toes revolved on the green Fiberglas board and he zoomed effortlessly around the corner and onto Jackson Street simply assuming no one would be there to get in his way Kid Bill thought it wont always be that way He walked up to his old house but did not stop he only slowed his walk down to an idlers pace There were people on the lawna mother in a lawn chair a sleeping baby in her arms watching two kids maybe ten and eight play badminton in grass that was still wet from the rain earlier The younger of the two a boy managed to hit the bird back over the net and the woman called Good one Scan The house was the same darkgreen color and the fanlight was still over the door but his mothers flowerbeds were gone So from what he could see was the junglegym his father had built from scavenged pipes in the back yard He remembered the day Georgie had fallen off the top and chipped a tooth How he had screamed He saw these things the ones there and the ones gone and thought of walking over to the woman with the sleeping baby in her arms He thought of saying Hello my name is Bill Denbrough I used to live here And the woman saying Thats nice What else could there be Could he ask her if the face he had carved carefully in one of the attic beamsthe face he and Georgie sometimes used to throw darts atwas still there Could he ask her if her kids sometimes slept on the screenedin back porch when the summer nights were especially hot talking together in low tones as they watched heatlightning dance on the horizon He supposed he might be able to ask some of those things but he felt he would stutter quite badly if he tried to be charming and did he really want to know the answers to any of those questions After Georgie died it had become a cold house and whatever he had come back to Derry for was not here So he went on to the corner and turned right not looking back Soon he was on Kansas Street headed back downtown He paused for awhile at the fence which bordered the sidewalk looking down into the Barrens The fence was the same rickety wood covered with fading whitewash and the Barrens looked the same wilder if anything The only differences he could see were that the dirty smudge of smoke which had always marked the town dump was gone the dump had been replaced with a modern wastetreatment plant and a long overpass marched across the tangled greenery nowthe turnpike extension Everything else was so similar that he might last have seen it the previous summer weeds and bushes sloping down to that flat marshy area on the left and to dense copses of junkyscrubby trees on the right He could see the stands of what they had called bamboo the silverywhite stalks twelve and fourteen feet high He remembered that Richie had once tried to smoke some of it claiming it was like the stuff jazz musicians smoked and could get you high All Richie had gotten was sick Bill could hear the trickle of water running in many small streams could see the sun heliographing off the broader expanse of the Kenduskeag And the smell was the same even with the dump gone The heavy perfume of growing things at the height of their spring strut did not quite mask the smell of waste and human offal It was faint but unmistakable A smell of corruption a whiff of the underside Thats where it ended before and thats where its going to end this time Bill thought with a shiver In there under the city He stood awhile longer convinced that he must see somethingsome manifestationof the evil he had come back to Derry to fight There was nothing He heard water running a springlike and vital sound that reminded him of the dam they had built down there He could see trees and bushes ruffling in the faint breeze There was nothing else No sign He walked on dusting a faint whitewash stain from his hands as he went He kept heading downtown halfremembering halfdreaming and here came another kidthis one a little girl of about ten in highwaisted corduroy pants and a faded red blouse She was bouncing a ball with one hand and holding a babydoll by its blonde Arnel hair in the other Sure she said looking at Bill as though he might well be enfeebled secondhand Rose Secondhand Clothes My mom says its a junkshop but I like it They have old things Like records you never heard of Also postcards It smells like a attic I have to go home now Bye She walked on not looking back bouncing her ball and holding her dolly by the hair She looked back over her shoulder and said Just the way youre going Its at the bottom of UpMile Hill Bill felt that sense of the past folding in on itself folding in on him He hadnt meant to ask that little girl anything the question had popped out of his mouth like a cork flying from the neck of a champagne bottle He descended UpMile Hill toward downtown The warehouses and packing plants he remembered from childhoodgloomy brick buildings with duty windows from which titanic meaty smells issuedwere mostly gone although the Armour and the Star Beef meatpacking plants were still there But Hemphill was gone and there was a drivein bank and a bakery where Eagle Beef and Kosher Meats had been And there where the Tracker Brothers Annex had stood was a sign painted in oldfashioned letters which read just as the girl with the doll had said SECONDHAND ROSE SECONDHAND CLOTHES The red brick had been painted a yellow which had perhaps been jaunty ten or twelve years ago but was now dingya color Audra called urineyellow Bill walked slowly toward it feeling that sense of deja vu settle over nun again Later he told the others he knew what ghost he was going to see before he actually saw it The showwindow of Secondhand Rose Secondhand Clothes was more than dingy it was filthy No Downcast antique shop this with nifty little spoolbeds and Hoosier cabinets and sets of Depression glassware highlighted by hidden spotlights this was what his mother called with utter disdain a Yankee pawnshop The items were strewn in rickrack profusion heaped aimlessly here there and everywhere Dresses slumped off coathangers Guitars hung from their necks like executed criminals There was a box of rpm records c APIECE the sign read TWELVE FOR A BUCK ANDREWS SISTERS PERRY COMO JIMMY ROGERS OTHERS There were kids outfits and dreadfullooking shoes with a card in front of them which read SECONDS BUT NOT BAD  A PAIR There were two TVs that looked blind A third was casting bleared images of The Brady Bunch out toward the street A box of old paperbacks most with stripped covers  FOR A QUARTER  FOR A DOLLAR more inside SOME HOT sat atop a large radio with a filthy white plastic case and a tuning dial as big as an alarm clock Bunches of plastic flowers sat in dirty vases on a chipped gouged dusty diningroom table All of these things Bill saw as a chaotic background to the thing his eyes had fixed upon immediately He stood staring at it with wide unbelieving eyes Gooseflesh ran madly up and down his body His forehead was hot his hands cold and for a moment it seemed that all the doors inside would swing wide and he would remember everything His kickstand was still gone and rust had flowered on the front and back fenders but the oogahhorn was still there on the handlebars its rubber bulb now glazed with cracks and age The horn itself which Bill had always kept neatly polished was dull and pitted The flat package carrier where Richie had often ridden double was still on the back fender but it was bent now hanging by a single bolt At some point someone had covered the seat with imitation tigerskin which was now rubbed and frayed to a point where the stripes were almost indistinguishable Bill raised an absent hand to wipe away the tears that were running slowly down his cheeks After he had done a better job with his handkerchief he went inside The atmosphere of Secondhand Rose Secondhand Clothes was musty with age It was as the girl had said a attic smellbut not a good smell as some attic smells are This was not the smell of linseed oil rubbed lovingly into the surface of old tables or of ancient plush and velvet In here was a smell of rotting bookbindings dirty vinyl cushions that had been halfcooked in the hot suns of summers past dust mouseturds From the TV in the window the Brady Bunch cackled and whooped Competing with them from somewhere in the back was the radio voice of a disc jockey identifying himself as your pal Bobby Russell promising the new album by Prince to the caller who could give the name of the actor who had played Wally on Leave It to Beaver Bill knewit had been a kid named Tony Dowbut he didnt want the new Prince album The radio was sitting on a high shelf amid a number of nineteenthcentury portraits Below it and them sat the proprietor a man of perhaps forty who was wearing designer jeans and a fishnet teeshirt His hair was slicked back and he was thin to the point of emaciation His feet were cocked up on his desk which was piled high with ledgers and dominated by an old scrolled cash register He was reading a paperback novel which Bill thought had never been nominated for the Pulitzer Prize It was called Construction Site Studs On the floor in front of the desk was a barber pole its stripe revolving up and up into infinity Its frayed cord wound across the floor to a baseboard plug like a tired snake The sign in front of it read A DYEING BREED When the bell over the door jingled the man behind the desk marked his place with a matchbook cover and looked up Help you Yes Bill said and opened his mouth to ask about the bike in the window But before he could speak his mind was suddenly filled with a single haunting sentence words that drove away all other thought He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts Looking for anything in particular the proprietor asked His voice was polite enough but he was looking at Bill closely Hes looking at me Bill thought amused in spite of his distress as if hes got an idea Ive been smoking some of that stuff that gets the jazz musicians high The barber pole you mean The proprietors eyes now showed Bill something which even in his present confused state he remembered and hated from his childhood the anxiety of a man or woman who must listen to a stutterer the urge to jump in quickly and finish the thought thus shutting the poor bastard up But I dont stutter I beat it I DONT FUCKING STUTTER I The words were so clear in his mind that it seemed someone else must be speaking in there that he was like a man possessed by demons in Biblical timesa man invaded by some presence from Outside And yet he recognized the voice and knew it was his own He felt sweat pop out warmly on his face a deal on that post the proprietor was saying Tell you the truth I cant move it at twofifty Id give it to you for oneseventyfive hows that Its the only real antique in the place POLE Bill almost screamed and the proprietor recoiled a little Not the pole Im interested in Are you okay mister the proprietor asked His solicitous tone belied the expression of hard wariness in his eyes and Bill saw his left hand leave the desk He knew with a flash of something that was really more inductive reasoning than intuition that there was an open drawer below Bills own sightline and that the proprietor had almost surely put his hand on a pistol of some type He was maybe worried about robbery more likely he was just worried He was after all clearly gay and this was the town where the local juveniles had given Adrian Mellon a terminal bath he thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts It drove out all thought it was like being insane Where had it come from With a sudden titanic effort Bill attacked it He did this by forcing his mind to translate the alien sentence into French It was the same way he had beaten the stutter as a teenager As the words marched across his field of thought he changed them and suddenly he felt the grip of the stutter loosen I said if youre going to have a fit take it out on the street I dont need shit like that in here Okay the proprietor said agreeably enough You just came in Now what The bbike in the window Bill said How much do you want for the bike Take twenty bucks He sounded easier now but his left hand still hadnt come back into view I think it was a Schwinn at one time but its a mongrel now His eye measured Bill Big bike You could ride it yourself Thinking of the kids green skateboard Bill said I think my bikeriding days are ooover The proprietor shrugged His left hand finally came up again Got a boy Long as its no more than ten bucks over the amount of the purchase I can give you a twenty Bill said Mind if I make a phone call Bill called the Derry Public Library Mike was there Where are you Bill he asked and then immediately Are you all right No Well see them tonight There was a brief pause That is I presume What can I do you for Big Bill Im buying a bike Bill said calmly I wondered if I could wheel it up to your house Do you have a garage or something I could store it in Bill looked at the proprietor He was reading his book again or maybe All right Mike said My place is Palmer Lane Youd want to go up No problem Carole will cover for me Mike hesitated again she said that a fellow was in about an hour before I got back here Said he left looking like a ghost I got her to describe him It was Ben Yeah And the bike Thats part of it too isnt it Shouldnt wonder Bill said keeping an eye on the proprietor who still Ill see you at my place Mike said Number Dont forget Bill hung up The proprietor promptly closed his book again Got you some storage space my friend Yeah Bill took out his travellers checks and signed his name to a twenty The proprietor examined the two signatures with a care that in less distracted mental circumstances Bill would have found rather insulting At last the proprietor scribbled a bill of sale and popped the travellers check into his old cash register He got up put his hands on the small of his back and stretched then walked to the front of the store He picked his way around the heaps of junk and almostjunk merchandise with an absent delicacy Bill found fascinating He lifted the bike swung it around and rolled it to the edge of the display space Bill laid hold of the handlebars to help him and as he did another shudder whipped through him Silver Again It was Silver in his hands and he thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts he had to force the thought away because it made him feel faint and strange That back tires a little soft the proprietor said it was in fact as flat as a pancake The front tire was up but so bald the cord was showing through in places I used to be able to handle it just fine now I dont know Sure And if you want to talk about that barber pole come back The proprietor held the door for him Bill walked the bike out turned left and started toward Main Street People glanced with amusement and curiosity at the man with the bald head pushing the huge bike with the flat rear tire and the oogahhorn protruding over the rusty bikebasket but Bill hardly noticed them He was marvelling at how well his grownup hands still fitted the rubber handgrips was remembering how he had always meant to knot some thin strips of plastic different colors into the holes in each grip so they would flutter in the wind He had never gotten around to that He stopped at the corner of Center and Main outside of Mr Paperback He leaned the bike against the building long enough to strip off his sportcoat Pushing a bike with a flat tire was hard work and the afternoon had come off hot He tossed the coat into the basket and went on Chains rusty he thought Whoever had it didnt take very good care of He stopped for a moment frowning trying to remember just what had happened to Silver Had he sold it Given it away Lost it perhaps He couldnt remember Instead that idiotic sentence resurfaced as strange and out of place as an easy chair on a battlefield a recordplayer in a fireplace a row of pencils protruding from a cement sidewalk Bill shook his head The sentence broke up and dispersed like smoke He pushed Silver on to Mikes place But first he made supperhamburgers with sauteed mushrooms and onions and a spinach salad They had finished working on Silver by then and were more than ready to eat The house was a neat little Cape Cod white with green trim Mike had just been arriving when Bill pushed Silver up Palmer Lane He was behind the wheel of an old Ford with rusty rocker panels and a cracked rear window and Bill remembered the fact Mike had so quietly pointed out the six members of the Losers Club who left Derry had quit being losers Mike had stayed behind and was still behind Bill rolled Silver into Mikes garage which was floored with oiled dirt and was every bit as neat as the house proved to be Tools hung from pegs and the lights shielded with tin cones looked like the lights which hang over pool tables Bill leaned the bike against the wall The two of them looked at it without speaking for a bit hands in pockets Its Silver all right Mike said at last I thought you might have been wrong But its him What are you going to do with him Yeah I think Ive got a tirepatching kit too Are those tubeless tires They always were Bill bent down to look at the flat tire Yeah Tubeless Of ccourse not Bill said sharply I just dont like to see it sihihitting there on a flat Bill looked around sharply at that but Mike had gone to the garages back wall and was taking down a tirepump He got a tin tirepatching kit from one of the cabinets and handed it to Bill who looked at it curiously It was as he remembered such things from his childhood a small tin box of about the same size and shape as those kept by men who roll their own cigarettes except the top was bright and pebbledyou used it for roughing the rubber around the hole before you put on the patch The box looked brandnew and there was a Woolco price sticker on it that said It seemed to him that when he was a kid such a kit had gone for about a bucktwentyfive You didnt just have this hanging around Bill said It wasnt a question No Mike agreed I bought it last week Out at the mall as a matter of fact Just got the urge Mike agreed his eyes still on Bills Woke up thinking it might come in handy The thought kept coming back all day So I got the kit And here you are to use it Here I am to use it Bill agreed But like they say on the soaps what does it all mean dear I dont know Big Bill He paused and added I think theres a chance that all of them wont be One or two of them may decide to just creep out of town Or He shrugged I dont know Mike pointed to the tirepatching kit I paid seven bucks for that thing Are you going to do something with it or just look at it Bill took his sportcoat out of the basket and hung it carefully on an unoccupied wallpeg Then he turned Silver upside down so that he rested on his seat and began to carefully rotate the rear tire He didnt like the rusty way the axle squeaked and remembered the almost silent click of the ballbearings in the kids skateboard A little in oil would fix that right up he thought Wouldnt hurt to oil the chain either Its rusty as hell And playing cards It needs playing cards on the spokes Mike would have cards I bet The good ones Bikes with the celluloid coating that made them so stiff and so slippery that the first time you tried to shuffle them they always sprayed all over the floor Playing cards sure and clothespins to hold them Nothing His fingers touched something small and round and hard He got his nails under it and pulled A small tack came out of the tire Heres the cuhcuhculprit he said and it rose in his mind again strange unbidden and powerful He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts But this time the voice his voice was followed by his mothers voice saying Try again Billy You almost had it that time And Andy Devine as Guy Madisons sidekick Jingles yelling Hey Wild Bill wait for me He shook his head I couldnt say that without stuttering even now he thought and for just a moment he felt that he was on the edge of understanding it all He opened the tirepatching kit and went to work It took a long time to get it just right Mike leaned against the wall in a bar of lateafternoon sun the sleeves of his shirt rolled up and his tie yanked down whistling a tune which Bill finally identified as she Blinded Me with Science While he waited for the tire cement to set Bill hadjust for something to do he told himselfoiled Silvers chain sprocket and axles It didnt make the bike look any better but when he spun the tires he found that the squeak was gone and that was satisfying Silver never would have won any beautycontests anyway His one virtue was that he could go like a blue streak By that tune fivethirty in the afternoon he had nearly forgotten Mike was there he had become completely absorbed in small yet utterly satisfying acts of maintenance He screwed the nozzle of the pump onto the rear tires valve and watched the tire fatten shooting for the right pressure by guess and by gosh He was pleased to see that the patch was holding nicely When he thought he had it right he unscrewed the pumpnozzle and was about to turn Silver over when he heard the rapid snapflutter of playing cards behind him He whirled almost knocking Silver over Mike was standing there with a deck of bluebacked Bicycle playing cards in one hand Want these Bill let out a long shaky sigh Youve got clothespins too I suppose Mike took four from the flap pocket of his shirt and held them out Bill took the cards and tried to shuffle them His hands shook and the cards sprayed out of his hands They went everywhere but only two landed faceup Bill looked at them then up at Mike Mikes gaze was frozen on the littered playing cards His lips had pulled back from his teeth Thats impossible Mike said I just opened that deck Look He pointed at the swillcan just inside the garage door and Bill saw the cellophane wrapper How can one deck of cards have two aces of spades Bill bent down and picked them up How can you spray a deck of cards all over the floor and have only two of them land face up he asked Thats an even better que He turned the aces over looked and then showed them to Mike One of them was a blueback the other a redback What are you going to do with those Mike asked in a numb voice Why put them on Bill said and suddenly he began to laugh Thats what Im supposed to do isnt it If there are certain preconditions for the use of magic those preconditions will inevitably arrange themselves Right Mike didnt reply He watched as Bill went to Silvers rear wheel and attached the playing cards His hands were still shaking and it took awhile but he finally got it done drew in one tight breath held it and spun the rear wheel The playing cards machinegunned loudly against the spokes in the garages silence Come on Mike said softly Come on in Big Bill Ill make us some chow They had scoffed the burgers and now sat smoking watching dark begin to unfold from dusk in Mikes back yard Bill took out his wallet found someones business card and wrote upon it the sentence that had plagued him ever since he had seen Silver in the window of Secondhand Rose Secondhand Clothes He showed it to Mike who read it carefully lips pursed He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts He nodded Yes I know what that is Well then tell me Or are you going to give me some more cuhcuhcrap about figuring it out for myself No Mike said in this case I think its okay to tell you The phrase goes back to English times Its a tonguetwister that became a speech exercise for lispers and stutterers Your mother kept trying to get you to say it that summer The summer of You used to go around mumbling it to yourself I did Bill said and then slowly answering his own question I did Bill who suddenly felt he might cry only nodded He didnt trust himself to speak You never made it Mike told him I remember that You tried like hell but your tang kept getting all tungled up Bill brought his fist down on the picnic table hard enough to hurt I dont remember he shouted And then dully he said it again I just dont remember On the day after Mike Hanlon made his calls Henry Bowers began to hear voices Voices had been talking to him all day long For awhile Henry thought they were coming from the moon In the late afternoon looking up from where he was hoeing in the garden he could see the moon in the blue daytime sky pale and small A ghostmoon That in fact was why he believed it was the moon that was talking to him Only a ghostmoon would talk in ghostvoicesthe voices of his old friends and the voices of those little kids who had played down in the Barrens so long ago Those and another voice one he did not dare name Victor Criss spoke from the moon first They comin back Henry All of em man They comin back to Derry Then Belch Huggins spoke from the moon perhaps from the dark side of the moon Youre the only one Henry The only one of us left Youll have to get em for me and Vie Aint no little kids can rank us out like that Why I hit a ball one time down to Trackers and Tony Tracker said that ball would have been out of Yankee Stadium He hoed looking up at the ghostmoon in the sky and after awhile Fogarty came over and hit him in the back of the neck and knocked him flat on his face Youre hoein up the peas right along with the weeds you ijit Henry got up brushing dirt off his face and out of his hair There stood Fogarty a big man in a white jacket and white pants his belly swelled out in front of him It was illegal for the guards who were called counsellors here at Juniper Hill to carry billyclubs so a number of themFogarty Adler and Koontz were the worstcarried rolls of quarters in their pockets They almost always hit you with them in the same place right in the back of the neck There was no rule against quarters Quarters were not considered a deadly weapon at Juniper Hill an institution for the mentally insane which stood on the outskirts of Augusta near the Sidney town line Im sorry Mr Fogarty Henry said and offered a big grin which showed an irregular line of yellow teeth They looked like the pickets in a fence outside a haunted house Henry had begun to lose his teeth when he was fourteen or so Yeah youre sorry Fogarty said Youll be a lot sorrier if I catch you doing it again Henry Fogarty walked away his black shoes leaving big brown tracks in the dirt of West Garden Because Fogartys back was turned Henry took a moment to look around surreptitiously They had been shooed out to hoe as soon as the clouds cleared everyone from the Blue Wardwhich was where they put you if you had once been very dangerous but were now considered only moderately dangerous Actually all the patients at Juniper Hill were considered moderately dangerous it was a facility for the criminally insane Henry Bowers was here because he had been convicted of killing his father in the late fall of it had been a famous year for murder trials all right when it came to murder trials had been a pip Only of course it wasnt just his father they thought he had killed if it had only been his father Henry would not have spent twenty years in the Augusta State Mental Hospital much of that time under physical and chemical restraint No not just his father the authorities thought he had killed all of them or at least most of them Following the verdict the News had published a frontpage editorial titled The End of Derrys Long Night In it they had recapped the salient points the belt in Henrys bureau that belonged to the missing Patrick Hockstetter the jumble of schoolbooks some signed out to the missing Belch Huggins and some to the missing Victor Criss both known chums of the Bowers boy in Henrys closet most damning of all the panties found tucked into a slit in Henrys mattress panties which had been identified by laundrymark as having belonged to Veronica Grogan deceased Henry Bowers the News declared had been the monster haunting Derry in the spring and summer of But then the News had proclaimed the end of Derrys long night on the front page of its December th edition and even an ijit like Henry knew that in Derry night never ended They had bullied him with questions had stood around him in a circle had pointed fingers at him Twice the Chief of Police had slapped him across the face and once a detective named Lottman had punched him in the gut telling him to fess up and be quick Theres people outside and they aint happy Henry this Lottman had said There aint been a lynching in Derry for a long tune but that dont mean there couldnt be one He supposed they would have kept it up as long as necessary not because any of them really believed the good Derryfolk were going to break into the Police station carry Henry out and hang him from a sourapple tree but because they were desperate to close the books on that summers blood and horror they would have but Henry didnt make them They wanted him to confess to everything he understood after awhile Henry didnt mind After the horror in the sewers after what had happened to Belch and Victor he didnt seem to mind about anything Yes he said he had killed his father This was true Yes he had killed Victor Criss and Belch Huggins This was also true at least in the sense that he had led them into the tunnels where they had been murdered Yes he had killed Patrick Yes Veronica Yes one yes all Not true but it didnt matter Blame needed to be taken Perhaps that was why he had been spared And if he refused He understood about Patricks belt He had won it from Patrick playing seal one day in April discovered it didnt fit and tossed it in his bureau He understood about the books toohell the three of them chummed around together and they cared no more for their summer textbooks than they had for their regular ones which is to say they cared for them about as much as a woodchuck cares for tapdancing There were probably as many of his books in their closets and the cops probably knew it too The panties no he didnt know how Veronica Grogans panties had come to be in his mattress But he thought he knew whoor whathad taken care of it So they sent him to Augusta and finally in they had transferred him to Juniper Hill and he had only run into trouble once here and that was because at first no one understood A guy had tried to turn off Henrys nightlight The nightlight was Donald Duck doffing his little sailor hat Donald was protection after the sun went down With no light things could come in The locks on the door and the wire mesh did not stop them They came like mist Things They talked and laughed and sometimes they clutched Hairy things smooth things things with eyes The sort of things that had really killed Vie and Belch when the three of them had chased the kids into the tunnels under Derry in August of  Looking around now he saw the others from the Blue Ward There was George DeVille who had murdered his wife and four children one winter night in Georges head was studiously bent his white hair blowing in the breeze snot running gaily out of his nose his huge wooden crucifix bobbing and dancing as he hoed There was Jimmy Donlin and all they said in the papers about Jimmy was that he had killed his mother in Portland during the summer of  but what they hadnt said in the papers was that Jimmy had tried a novel experiment in bodydisposal by the time the cops came Jimmy had eaten more than half of her including her brains They made me twice as smart Jimmy had confided to Henry one night after lightsout In the row beyond Jimmy hoeing fanatically and singing the same line over and over as always was the little Frenchman Benny Beaulieu Benny had been a firebuga pyromaniac Now as he hoed he sang this line from the Doors over and over Try to set the night on fire try to set the night on fire try to set the night on fire try to Beyond Benny was Franklin DCruz who had raped over fifty women before being caught with his pants down in Bangors Terrace Park The ages of his victims ranged from three to eightyone Not very particular was Frank DCruz Beyond him but way back was Arlen Weston who spent as much time looking dreamily at his hoe as he did using it Fogarty Adler and John Koontz had all tried the rollofquartersinthefist trick on Weston to try and convince him he could move a bit faster and one day Koontz had hit him maybe a little too hard because blood came not only from Arlen Westons nose but also from Arlens ears and that night he had a convulsion Not a big one just a little one But since then Arlen had drifted further and further into his own interior blackness and now he was a hopeless case almost totally unplugged from the world Beyond Arlen was You want to pick it up or Ill give you some more help Henry Fogarty bawled over and Henry began to hoe again He didnt want any convulsions He didnt want to end up like Arlen Weston Soon the voices started in again But this tune they were the voices of the others the voices of the kids that had gotten him into this in the first place whispering down from the ghostmoon You couldnt even catch a fatboy Bowers one of them whispered Now Im rich and youre hoeing peas Haha on you asshole BBBowers you cccouldnt ccatch a cccold Read aany gggood bbbooks since youve been in ththere I ruhruhwrote lots Im ruhruhrich andyyoure in JuhJuhhooniper Hill Haha on you you stupid asshole Shut up Henry whispered to the ghostvoices hoeing faster beginning to hoe up the new peaplants along with the weeds Sweat rolled down his cheeks like tears We couldve taken you We couldve We got you locked up you asshole another voice laughed You chased me and couldnt catch me and I got rich too Way to go bananaheels Did you want to get in my panties Henry another voice teased Too bad I let all of them do me I was nothing but a slut but now Im rich too and were all together again and were doing it again but you couldnt do it now even if I let you because you couldnt get it up so haha on you Henry haha all OVER you He hoed madly weeds and dirt and peaplants flying the ghostvoices from the ghostmoon were very loud now echoing and flying in his head and Fogarty was running toward him bellowing but Henry could not hear Because of the voices Couldnt even get hold of a nigger like me could you another jeering ghostvoice chimed in We killed you guys in that rockfight We fucking killed you Haha asshole Haha all over you Then they were all babbling together laughing at him calling him bananaheels asking him how hed liked the shocktreatments theyd given him when he came up here to the Red Ward asking him if he liked it here at JuhJuhhooniper Hill asking and laughing laughing and asking and Henry dropped his hoe and began to scream up at the ghostmoon in the blue sky and at first he was screaming in fury and then the moon itself changed and became the face of the clown its face a rotted pocked cheesy white its eyes black holes its red bloody grin turned up in a smile so obscenely ingenuous that it was insupportable and so then Henry began to scream not in fury but in mortal terror and the voice of the clown spoke from the ghostmoon now and what it said was You have to go back Henry You have to go back and finish the job You have to go back to Derry and kill them all For Me For Then Fogarty who had been standing nearby and yelling at Henry for almost two minutes while the other inmates stood in their rows hoes grasped in their hands like comic phalluses their expressions not exactly interested but almost yes almost thoughtful as if they understood that this was all a part of the mystery that had put them here that Henry Bowerss sudden attack of the screaming meemies in West Garden was interesting in some more than technical way got tired of shouting and gave Henry a real blast with his quarters and Henry went down like a ton of bricks the voice of the clown following him down into that terrible whirlpool of darkness chanting over and over again Kill them all Henry kill them all kill them all kill them all The moon was down and he felt a sharp sense of gratitude for that The moon was less ghostly at night more real and if he should see that dreadful clownface in the sky riding over the hills and fields and woods he believed he would die of terror He lay on his side staring at his nightlight intently Donald Duck had burned out he had been replaced by Mickey and Minnie Mouse dancing a polka they had been replaced with the greenglowing face of Oscar the Grouch from Sesame Street and late last year Oscar had been replaced by the face of Fozzie Bear Henry had measured out the years of his incarceration with burnedout nightlights instead of coffeespoons At exactly AM on the morning of May th his nightlight went out A little moan escaped himno more Koontz was on the door of the Blue Ward tonightKoontz who was the worst of the lot Worse even than Fogarty who had hit him so hard in the afternoon that Henry could barely turn his head Sleeping around him were the other Blue Ward inmates Benny Beaulieu slept in elastic restraints He had been allowed to watch an Emergency rerun on the wardroom TV when they came in from hoeing and around six oclock had begun jerking off constantly and without letup screaming Try to set the night on fire Try to set the night on fire Try to set the night on fire He had been sedated and that was good for about four hours and then he had started in again around eleven when the Elavil wore off whipping his old dingus so hard it had started to bleed through his fingers shrieking Try to set the night on fire So they sedated him again and put him in restraints Now he slept his pinched little face as grave in the dim light as Aristotles From around his bed Henry could hear low snores and loud ones grunts an occasional bedfart He could hear Jimmy Donlins breathing it was unmistakable even though Jimmy slept five beds over Rapid and faintly whistling for some reason it always made Henry think of a sewing machine From beyond the door giving on the hall he could hear the faint sound of Koontzs TV He knew that Koontz would be watching the late movies on Channel drinking Texas Driver and eating his lunch Koontz favored sandwiches made out of chunky peanutbutter and Bermuda onions When Henry heard this he had shuddered and thought And they say all the crazy people are locked up Henry recognized the voice at once It was Victor Criss whose head had been torn off somewhere beneath Derry twentyseven years ago It had been torn off by the Frankensteinmonster Henry had seen it happen and afterward he had seen the monsters eyes shift and had felt its watery yellow gaze on him Yes the Frankensteinmonster had killed Victor and then it had killed Belch but here was Vie again like the almost ghostly rerun of a blackandwhite program from the Nifty Fifties when the President was bald and the Buicks had portholes And now that it had happened now that the voice had come Henry found that he was calm and unafraid Relieved even Benny Beaulieu snorted and muttered in his sleep Jimmys neat nasal sewingmachine inhales and exhales paused for a moment In the hall the volume on Koontzs small Sony was turned down and Henry Bowers could sense him head cocked to one side one hand on the TVs volume knob the fingers of the other hand touching the cylinder which bulged in the righthand pocket of his whitesthe roll of quarters You dont have to talk out loud Henry Vie said I can hear you if you just think And they cant hear me at all There was no reply for a long time Henry thought that maybe Vie had gone away Outside the door the volume of Koontzs TV went up again Then there was a scratching noise from under the bed the springs squealed slightly as a dark shadow pulled itself out from under Vie looked up at him and grinned Henry grinned back uneasily Ole Vie was looking a little bit like the Frankensteinmonster himself these days A scar like a hangrope tattoo circled his neck Henry thought maybe that was where his head had been sewed back on His eyes were a weird graygreen color and the corneas seemed to float on a watery viscous substance I want the same thing you want Vie said I want to pay em back But youll have to get out of here to do it Vie said Youll have to go back to Derry I need you Henry We all need you They cant hurt You Henry said understanding he was talking to more than Vie They cant hurt Me if they only halfbelieve Vie said But there have been some distressing signs Henry We didnt think they could beat us back then either But the fatboy got away from you in the Barrens The fatboy and the smartmouth and the quiff got away from us that day after the movies And the rockfight when they saved the nigger Dont talk about that Henry shouted at Vie and for a moment all of the peremptory hardness that had made him their leader was in his voice Then he cringed thinking Vie would hurt himsurely Vie could do whatever he wanted since he was a ghostbut Vie only grinned I can take care of them if they only halfbelieve he said but youre alive Henry You can get them no matter if they believe halfbelieve or dont believe at all You can get them one by one or all at once You can pay em back Pay em back Henry repeated Then he looked at Vie doubtfully again But I cant get out of here Vie Theres wire on the windows and Koontz is on the door tonight Koontz is the worst Maybe tomorrow night dont worry about Koontz Vie said standing up Henry saw he was still wearing the jeans he had been wearing that day and that they were still splattered with drying sewermuck Ill take care of Koontz Vie held out his hand After a moment Henry took it He and Vie walked toward the Blue Ward door and the sound of the TV They were almost there when Jimmy Donlin who had eaten his mothers brains woke up His eyes widened as he saw Henrys latenight visitor It was his mother Her slip was showing just a quarterinch or so as it always had The top of her head was gone Her eyes horribly red rolled toward him and when she grinned Jimmy saw the lipstick smears on her yellow horsy teeth as he always had Jimmy began to shriek No Ma No Ma No Ma The TV went off at once and even before the others could begin to stir Koontz was jerking the door open and saying Okay asshole get ready to catch your head on the rebound Ive had it Koontz came rushing in First he saw Bowers standing tall and paunchy and nearly ridiculous in his johnny his loose flesh doughy in the light spilling in from the corridor Then he looked left and screamed out two lungfuls of silent spun glass Standing by Bowers was a thing in a clown suit It stood perhaps eight feet tall Its suit was silvery Orange pompoms ran down the front There were oversized funny shoes on its feet But its head was not that of a man or a clown it was the head of a Doberman pinscher the only animal on Gods green earth of which John Koontz was frightened Its eyes were red Its silky muzzle wrinkled back to show huge white teeth A cylinder of quarters fell from Koontzs nerveless fingers and rolled across the floor and into the corner Late the following day Benny Beaulieu who slept through the whole thing would find them and hide them in his footlocker The quarters bought him cigarettestailormadesfor a month Koontz hitched in breath to scream again as the clown lurched toward him Its time for the circus the clown screamed in a growling voice and its whitegloved hands fell on Koontzs shoulders For the third time that daythat long long dayKay McCall went to the telephone She got further this time than she had on the first two occasions this time she waited until the phone had been picked up on the other end and a hearty Irish cops voice said sixth Street Station Sergeant OBannon how may I help you before hanging up Oh youre doing fine Jesus yes By the eighth or ninth time youll have mustered up guts enough to give him your name She went into the kitchen and fixed herself a weak Scotchandsoda although she knew it probably wasnt a good idea on top of the Darvon She recalled a snatch of folksong from the college coffeehouses of her youthGot a headful of whiskey and a bellyful of gin Doctor say it kill me but he dont say whenand laughed jaggedly There was a mirror running along the top of the bar She saw her reflection in it and stopped laughing abruptly Nose the color of a drunken knights after thirty or so years of tilting at ginmills and puffed to a grotesque size Who is that battered woman who looks like the ones who drag themselves to a womens shelter after they finally get frightened enough or brave enough or just plain mad enough to leave the man who is hurting them who has systematically hurt them week in and week out month in and month out year in and year out Here she is Miss America she sang wanting her voice to come out tough and cynical It started out that way but warbled on the seventh syllable and cracked on the eighth It was not a tough voice It was a scared voice She knew it she had been scared before and had always gotten over it She thought she would be a long time getting over this The doctor who had treated her in one of the little cubicles just off Emergency Admitting at Sisters of Mercy half a mile down the road had been young and not badlooking Under different circumstances she might have idly or not so idly considered trying to get him home and take him on a sexual tour of the world But she hadnt felt in the least bit horny Pain wasnt conducive to horniness Neither was fear His name was Geffin and she didnt care for the fixed way he was looking at her He took a small white paper cup to the rooms sink halffilled it with water produced a pack of cigarettes from the drawer of his desk and offered them to her She took one and he lit it for her He had to chase the tip for a second or two with the match because her hand was shaking He tossed the match in a paper cup Fssss He nodded and then there was silence He kept looking at her She got the feeling he was expecting her to cry and it made her mad because she felt she might just do that She hated to be emotionally preguessed and most of all by a man Didnt your mother ever tell you it was impolite to stare She wanted it to come out hardedged but it sounded like a plea Stop looking at me I know how I look I saw This thought was followed by another one she suspected her friend Beverly must have had more than once that the worst of the beating took place inside where you were apt to suffer something that might be called interspiritual bleeding She knew what she looked like yes Worse still she knew what she felt like She felt yellow It was a dismal feeling Ill say this just once Geffin said His voice was low and pleasant When I work ERmy turn in the barrel you might sayI see maybe two dozen battered women a week The interns treat two dozen more So looktheres a telephone right here on the desk Its my dime You call Sixth Street give them your name and address tell them what happened and who did it Then you hang up and Ill take the bottle of bourbon I keep over there in the file cabinetstrictly for medicinal purposes you understandand well have a drink on it Because I happen to think this is just my personal opinion that the only lower form of life than a man who would beat up a woman is a rat with syphilis Kay smiled wanly I appreciate the offer she said but Ill pass For the time being Uhhuh he said But when you go home take a good look at yourself in the mirror Ms McCall Whoever it was he jobbed you good Tom Rogan had called around noon of the day after she had seen Beverly safely off wanting to know if Kay had been in touch with his wife He sounded calm reasonable not the least upset Kay told him she hadnt seen Beverly in almost two weeks Tom thanked her and hung up Around one the doorbell rang while she was writing in her study She went to the door Cragins Flowers maam a high voice said and how stupid she had been not to realize it had been Tom doing a bad falsetto how stupid she had been to believe that Tom had given up so easily how stupid she had been to take the chain off before opening the door In he had come and she had gotten just this far You get out of h before Toms fist came flying out of nowhere slamming into her right eye closing it and sending a bolt of incredible agony through her head She had gone reeling backward down the hallway clutching at things to try and stay upright a delicate onerose vase that had gone smashing to the tiles a coattree that had tumbled over She fell over her own feet as Tom closed the front door behind him and walked toward her As soon as you tell me where she is Tom said walking down the hall toward her She was dimly aware that Tom didnt look very goodwell actually terrible might have been a better wordand she felt a dim but ferocious gladness skyrocket through her Whatever Tom had done to Bev it looked as if Bev had given it back in spades It had been enough to keep him off his feet for one whole day anyhowand he still didnt look as if he belonged anywhere but in a hospital Kay scrambled to her feet and backed away keeping her eyes on him as you might keep your eyes on a wild animal that had escaped its cage I told you I havent seen her and that was the truth she said Now get out of here before I call the police Youve seen her Tom said His swollen lips were trying to grin She saw that his teeth had a strange jagged look Some of the front ones had been broken I call up tell you I dont know where Bev is You say you havent seen her in two weeks Never a single question Never a discouraging word even though I know damn well that you hate my guts So where is she you numb cunt Tell me Kay turned then and ran for the end of the hall wanting to get into the parlor rake the sliding mahogany doors closed on their recessed tracks and turn the thumbbolt She got there ahead of himhe was limpingbut before she could slam the doors shut he had inserted his body between He gave one convulsive lunge and pushed through She turned to run again he caught her by her dress and yanked her so hard he tore the entire back of it straight down to her waist Your wife made that dress you shit she thought incoherently and then she was twisted around Kay brought her hand up in a walloping slap that rocked his head back and started the cut on the left side of his face bleeding again He grabbed her hair and pulled her head forward into his fist It felt to her for a moment as if her nose had exploded She screamed inhaled to scream again and began to cough on her own blood She was in utter terror now She had not known there could be so much terror in all the wide world The crazy son of a bitch was going to kill her She screamed she screamed and then his fist looped into her belly driving the air out of her and she could only gasp She began to cough and gasp at the same time and for one terrifying moment she thought she was going to choke Kay shook her head Havent seen her she gasped Police youll go to jail asshole He jerked her to her feet and she felt something give in her shoulder More pain so strong it was sickening He whirled her around still holding onto her arm and now he twisted her arm up behind her and she bit down on her lower lip promising herself that she would not scream again He jerked her arm up again jerked it so hard that she heard him grunt His warm breath puffed against her ear She felt her closed right fist strike her own left shoulderblade and she screamed again as that thing in her shoulder gave some more He let go of her and gave her a push She collapsed to the floor sobbing snot and blood running out of her nose There was an almost musical crash and when she looked around Tom was bending over her He had broken the top off another vase this one of Waterford crystal He held the base The jagged neck was only inches from her face She stared at it hypnotized Let me tell you something he said the words coming out in little pants and blows of warm air youre going to tell me where she went or youre going to be picking your face up off the floor Youve got three seconds maybe less When Im mad it seems like time goes a lot faster My face she thought and that was what finally caused her to give in or cave in if you liked that better the thought of this monster using the jagged neck of the Waterford vase to cut her face apart She went home Kay sobbed Her home town Derry Its a place called Derry in Maine She took a bbbus to Milwaukee She was going to fly from there That shitty little cooze Tom cried straightening up He walked around in a large aimless semicircle running his hands through his hair so that it stood up in crazy spikes and whorls That cunt that cooze that nickelplated crotch He picked up a delicate wood sculpture of a man and woman making loveshed had it since she was twentytwoand threw in into the fireplace where it shattered to splinters He came face to face with himself for a moment in the mirror over the fireplace and stood wideeyed as if looking at a ghost Then he whirled on her again He had taken something from the pocket of the sportcoat he was wearing and she saw with a stupid kind of wonder that it was a paperback novel The cover was almost completely black except for the redfoil letters which spelled out the title and a picture of several young people standing on a high bluff over a river The Black Rapids Denbrough Denbrough He shook the book impatiently in front of her face then suddenly slapped her with it Her cheek flared with pain and then dull red heat like stovecoals Who is he They were friends When they were children They both grew up in Derry He whacked her with the book again this time from the other side He pulled an Early American chair with spindly graceful legs over to her turned it around and sat down on it His jackolantern face looked down at her over the chairback Listen to me he said You listen to your old uncle Tommy Can you do that you braburning bitch She nodded She could taste blood hot and coppery in her throat Her shoulder was on fire She prayed it was only dislocated and not broken But that was not the worst My face he was going to cut up my face If you call the police and tell them I was here Ill deny it You cant prove a fucking thing Its the maids day off and were all by our twosome Of course they might arrest me anyway anythings possible right She found herself nodding again as if her head was on a string Sure it is And what Id do is post bail and come right back here Theyd find your tits on the kitchen table and your eyes in the fishbowl Do you understand me Are you getting your old uncle Tommy Kay burst into tears again That string attached to her head was still working it bobbed up and down I dont know she said in a lower voice Please She didnt tell me Please dont hurt me He left without looking back head down a big shambling bear of a man She rushed after him and locked the door She rushed into the kitchen and locked that door After a moments pause she had limped upstairs as fast as her aching belly would allow and had locked the french doors which gave on the upstairs verandahit was not beyond possibility that he might decide to shinny up one of the pillars and come in again that way He was hurt but he was also insane She went for the telephone for the first time and had no more than dropped her hand on it before remembering what he had said What Id do is post bail and come right back here your tits on the kitchen table and your eyes in the fishbowl She went into the bathroom then and looked at her dripping tomato nose her black eye She didnt weep the shame and horror she felt were too deep for tears Oh Bev I did the best I could dear she thought But my face he said he would cut up my face There was Darvon and Valium in the medicine cabinet She debated between them and finally swallowed one of each Then she went to Sisters of Mercy for treatment and met the famous Dr Geffin who right now was the only man she could think of whom she would not be perfectly happy to see wiped off the face of the earth She went to her bedroom window and looked out The sun was low on the horizon now On the East Coast it would be late twilightjust going on seven oclock in Maine You can decide what to do about the cops later The important thing now is to warn Beverly It would be a hell of a lot easier Kay thought if you had told me where you were staying Beverly my love I suppose you didnt know yourself Although she had quit smoking two years before she kept a pack of Pall Malls in the drawer of her desk for emergencies She shot one out of the pack lit up grimaced She had last smoked from this pack around December of and this baby was staler than the ERA in the Illinois state Senate She smoked it anyway one eye halflidded against the smoke the other just halflidded period Thanks to Tom Rogan Using her left hand laboriouslythe son of a bitch had dislocated her good armshe dialed Maine information and asked for the name and number of every hotel and motel in Derry Maam thats going to take awhile the directoryassistance operator said dubiously Its going to take even longer than that sister Kay said Im going to have to write with my stupid hand My good ones on vacation Listen to me Kay said not unkindly Im calling you from Chicago and Im trying to reach a womanfriend of mine who has just left her husband and gone back to Derry where she grew up Her husband knows where she went He got the information out of me by beating the living shit out of me This man is a psycho She needs to know hes coming There was a long pause and then the directoryassistance operator said in a decidedly more human voice I think the number you really need is the Derry Police Department Fine Ill take that too But she has to be warned Kay said And She thought of Toms cut cheeks the knot on his forehead the one on his temple his limp his hideously swelled lips And if she knows hes coming that may be enough Arlington Motor Lodge the operator said Bassey Park Inn  The Bunyan Motor Court Slow down a little okay she asked writing furiously She looked for an ashtray didnt see one and mashed the Pall Mall out on the desk blotter Okay go on She got halflucky on her fifth call Beverly Rogan was registered at the Derry Town House She was only halflucky because Beverly was out She left her name and number and a message that Beverly should call her the instant she came back no matter how late it was The desk clerk repeated the message Kay went upstairs and took another Valium She lay down and waited for sleep Sleep didnt come Im sorry Bev she thought looking into the dark floating on the dope What he said about my face I just couldnt stand that Call soon Bev Please call soon And watch out for the crazy son of a bitch you married The crazy son of a bitch Bev had married did better on connections than Beverly had the day before because he left from OHare the hub of commercial aviation in the continental United States During the flight he read and reread the brief note on the author at the end of The Black Rapids It said that William Denbrough was a native of New England and the author of three other novels which were also available the note added helpfully in Signet paperback editions He and his wife the actress Audra Phillips lived in California He was currently at work on a new novel Noticing that the paperback of The Black Rapids had been issued in Tom supposed the guy had written some of the other novels since then Audra Phillips he had seen her in the movies hadnt he He rarely noticed actressesToms idea of a good flick was a crime story a chase story or a monster picturebut if this babe was the one he was thinking of he had noticed her especially because she looked a lot like Beverly long red hair green eyes tits that wouldnt quit He sat up a little straighter in his seat tapping the paperback against his leg trying to ignore the ache in his head and in his mouth Yes he was sure Audra Phillips was the redhead with the good tits He had seen her in a Clint Eastwood movie and then about a year later in a horror flick called Graveyard Moon Beverly had gone with him to see that one and coming out of the theater he had mentioned his idea that the actress looked a lot like her I dont think so Bev had said Im taller and shes prettier Her hairs a darker red too That was all He hadnt thought of it again until now Tom had some dim understanding of psychology he had used it to manipulate his wife all the years of their marriage And now a nagging unpleasantness began to nag at him more feeling than thought It centered on the fact that Bev and this Denbrough had played together as kids and that Denbrough had married a woman who in spite of what Beverly said looked amazingly like Tom Rogans wife What sort of games had Denbrough and Beverly played when they were kids Postoffice Spinthebottle Tom sat in his seat and tapped the book against his leg and felt his temples begin to throb When he arrived at Bangor International Airport and canvassed the rentalcar booths the girlssome dressed in yellow some in red some in Irish greenlooked at his blasted dangerous face nervously and told him more nervously still that they had no cars to rent so sorry Tom went to the newsstand and got a Bangor paper He turned to the wantads oblivious to the looks he was getting from people passing by and isolated three likelies He hit paydirt on his second call Paper says youve got a LTD wagon Fourteen hundred bucks I tell you what Tom said touching the wallet in his jacket pocket It was fat with cashsix thousand dollars You bring it out to the airport and well do the deal right here You give me the car and a bill of sale and your pinkslip Ill give you cash money The fellow with the LTD for sale paused and then said Id have to take my plates off Mr Barr Tom said He was looking at a sign across the terminal lobby that said BAR HARBOUR AIRLINES GIVES YOU NEW ENGLANDAND THE WORLD Ill be standing by the far door Youll know me because my face doesnt look so hot My wife and I went rollerskating yesterday and I took one hell of a fall Things could be worse I guess I didnt break anything but my face Ill mend You just get the car out here my good buddy He hung up walked across to the door and stepped out into the warm fragrant May night The guy with the LTD showed up ten minutes later driving out of the latespring dusk He was only a kid They did the deal the kid scribbled him a bill of sale which Tom stuffed indifferently into his overcoat pocket He stood there and watched the kid take off the LTDs Maine plates Give you an extra three bucks for the screwdriver Tom said when he was done The kid looked at him thoughtfully for a moment shrugged handed the screwdriver over and took the three ones Tom was holding out None of my business the shrug said and Tom thought How right you are my good little buddy Tom saw him into a cab then got behind the wheel of the Ford It was a piece of shit transmission whiny universal groany body rattly brakes slushy None of it mattered He drove around to the longterm parking lot took a ticket and drove in He parked next to a Subaru that looked as if it had been there for awhile He used the kids screwdriver to remove the Subarus plates and put them on the LTD He hummed as he worked By PM he was driving east on Route  a Maine roadmap open on the seat beside him He had discovered that the LTDs radio didnt work so he drove in silence That was all right He had plenty to think about All the wonderful things he was going to do to Beverly when he caught up with her for instance He was sure in his heart quite sure that Beverly was close by Oh my dear girl you fucked with the wrong man when you fucked with Tom Rogan And the question is thiswhat exactly are we to do with you The Ford bulled its way through the night chasing its high beams and by the time Tom got to Newport he knew He found a drugsandsundries shop on the main drag that was still open He went inside and bought a carton of Camels The proprietor wished him a good evening Tom wished him the same He tossed the carton on the seat and got moving again He drove slowly on up Route hunting for his turnoff Here it wasRoute  with a sign which read HAVEN  DERRY  He made the turn and got the Ford rolling faster He glanced at the carton of cigarettes and smiled a little In the green glow of the dashlights his cut and lumpy face looked strange ghoulish Got some cigarettes for you Bevvie Tom thought as the wagon ran between stands of pine and spruce heading toward Derry at a little better than sixty Oh my yes A whole carton Just for you And when I see you dear Im going to make you eat every fucking one And if this guy Denbrough needs some education we can arrange that too No problem Bevvie No problem at all For the first time since the dirty bitch had bushwhacked him and run out Tom began to feel good Audra Denbrough flew first class to Maine in a British Airways DC She had left Heathrow at ten minutes of six that afternoon and had been chasing the sun ever since The sun was winninghad won in factbut that didnt really matter By a stroke of providential luck she had discovered that British Airways flight London to Los Angeles made one refueling stop at Bangor International Airport The day had been a crazy nightmare Freddie Firestone the producer of Attic Room had of course wanted Bill first thing There had been some kind of ballsup about the stuntwoman who was supposed to fall down a flight of stairs for Audra It seemed that stuntpeople had a union too and this woman had fulfilled her quota of stunts for the week or some silly thing The union was demanding that Freddie either sign an extensionofsalary waiver or hire another woman to do the stunt The problem was there was no other woman close enough to Audras bodytype available Freddie told the union boss that they would have to get a man to do the stunt then wouldnt they It wasnt as if the fall had to be taken in bra and panties They had the auburnhaired wig and the wardrobe woman could fit the fellow up with falsies and hippadding Even some arsepads if that was necessary Cant be done mate the union boss said Against the union charter to have a man step in for a woman Sexual discrimination In the movie business Freddies temper was fabled and at that point he had lost it He told the union boss a fat man whose BO was almost paralyzing to bugger himself The union boss told Freddie he better watch his gob or there would be no more stunts on the set of Attic Room at all Then he had rubbed his thumb and forefinger together in a baksheesh gesture that had driven Freddie crazy The union boss was big but soft Freddie who still played football every chance he got and who had once scored a century at cricket was big and hard He threw the union boss out went back into his office to meditate and then came out again twenty minutes later hollering for Bill He wanted the entire scene rewritten so that the fall could be scrubbed Audra had to tell Freddie that Bill was no longer in England What Freddie said His mouth hung open He was looking at Audra as if he believed she had gone mad What are you telling me Hes been called back to the Statesthats what Im telling you Freddie made as if to grab her and Audra shrank back a bit afraid Freddie looked down at his hands then put them in his pockets and only looked at her She got up and poured herself a cup of coffee from the Silex on Freddies hotplate noticing that her hands were trembling slightly As she sat down she heard Freddies amplified voice over the studio loudspeakers telling everyone to go home or to the pub the days shooting was off Audra winced There went a minimum of ten thousand pounds right down the bog Freddie turned off the studio intercom got up poured his own cup of coffee He sat down again and offered her his pack of Silk Cut cigarettes Freddie took one lit it and squinted at her through the smoke This is serious isnt it And because she genuinely liked Freddie and genuinely trusted him Audra told him everything she knew Freddie listened intently gravely It didnt take long to tell doors were still slamming and engines starting in the parking lot outside when she finished Freddie was silent for some time looking out his window Then he swung back to her Hes had a nervous breakdown of some sort Audra shook her head No It wasnt like that He wasnt like that She swallowed and added Maybe you had to be there Freddie smiled crookedly You must realize that grown men rarely feel compelled to honor promises they made as little boys And youve read Bills work you know how much of it is about childhood and its very good stuff indeed Very much on the nail The idea that hes forgotten everything that ever happened to him back then is absurd The scars on his hands Audra said They were never there Not until this morning Whats to do then Freddie asked her and she could only shake her head Freddie lit another cigarette from the smoldering end of the first I can square it with the union boss he said Not myself maybe right now hed see me in hell before giving me another stunt Ill send Teddy Rowland round to his office Teddys a pouf but he could talk the birds down from the trees But what happens after Weve got four weeks of shooting left and heres your He waved a hand Wherever And how much good are you going to be without him He leaned forward I like you Audra I genuinely do And I like Billeven in spite of this mess We can make do I guess If the script needs cobbling up I can cobble it Ive done my share of that sort of shoemaking in my time Christ knows If he doesnt like the way it turns out hell have no one but himself to blame I can do without Bill but I cant do without you I cant have you running off to the States after your man and Ive got to have you putting out at full power Can you do that Nor do I But I want you to think about something We can keep things quiet for awhile maybe for the rest of the shoot if youll stand up like a trouper and do your job But if you take off it cant be kept quiet I can be pissy but Im not vindictive by nature and Im not going to tell you that if you take off Ill see that you never work in the business again But you should know that if you get a reputation for temperament you might end up stuck with just that Im talking to you like a Dutch uncle I know Do you resent it No she said listlessly In truth she didnt care much one way or the other Bill was all she could think of Freddie was a nice enough man but Freddie didnt understand in the last analysis nice man or not all he could think of was what this was going to do to his picture He had not seen the look in Bills eyes or heard him stutter Good He stood up Come on over to the Hare and Hounds with me We can both use a drink She shook her head A drinks the last thing I need Im going home and think this out He looked at her fixedly one hand on the telephone I believe you mean to go after him Freddie said and Im telling you that its a serious mistake dear girl Hes got a bee in his bonnet but at bottom hes steady enough Hell shake it and when he does hell come back If hed wanted you along he would have said so I havent decided anything she said knowing that she had in fact decided everything had decided even before the car picked her up that morning Have a care love Freddie said dont do something youll regret later She felt the force of his personality beating on her demanding that she give in make the promise do her job wait passively for Bill to come back or to disappear again into that hole of the past from which he had come She went to him and kissed him lightly on the cheek Ill see you Freddie She went home and called British Airways She told the clerk she might be interested in reaching a small Maine city called Derry if it was at all possible There had been silence while the woman consulted her computer terminal and then the news like a sign from heaven that BA made a stop in Bangor which was less than fifty miles away Audra closed her eyes and saw Freddies craggy mostly kind very earnest face heard him saying Have a care love Dont do something youll regret later Freddie didnt want her to go Bill didnt want her to go so why was her heart screaming at her that she had to go She closed her eyes Jesus I feel so fucked up Book it Audra said then hesitated Have a care love Maybe she should sleep on it get some distance between herself and the craziness She began to rummage in her purse for her American Express card For tomorrow First class if you have it but Ill take anything And if I change my mind I can cancel Probably will Ill wake up sane and everything will be clear But nothing had been clear this morning and her heart clamored just as loudly for her to go Her sleep had been a crazy tapestry of nightmares So she had called Freddie not because she wanted to but because she felt she owed him that She had not gotten farshe was trying in some stumbling way to tell him how much she felt Bill might need herwhen there was a soft click at Freddies end He had hung up without saying a word after his initial hello But in a way Audra thought that soft click said everything that needed to be said The plane landed at Bangor at EDT Audra was the only passenger to deplane and the others looked at her with a kind of thoughtful curiosity probably wondering why anyone would choose to get off here in this godforsaken little place Audra thought of telling them Im looking for my husband thats why He came back to a little town near here because one of his boyhood chums called him and reminded him of a promise he couldnt quite remember The call also reminded him that he hadnt thought of his dead brother in over twenty years Oh yes it also brought back his stutter and some funny white scars on the palms of his hands And then she thought the customs agent standing by in the jetway would whistle up the men in the white coats She collected her single piece of luggageit looked very lonely riding the carousel all by itselfand approached the rentalcar booths as Tom Rogan Would about an hour later Her luck was better than his would be National Car Rental had a Datsun I thought it was you the girl said and then timidly Might I please have your autograph Audra gave it writing her name on the back of a rental form and thought Enjoy it while you can girl If Freddie Firestone is right it wont be worth doodleysquat five years from now With some amusement she realized that after only fifteen minutes back in the States she had begun to think like an American again She got a roadmap and the girl so starstruck she could barely talk managed to trace out her best route to Derry Ten minutes later Audra was on the road reminding herself at every intersection that if she forgot and began driving on the left they would be scrubbing her off the asphalt And as she drove she realized that she was more frightened than she had ever been in her life By one of those odd quirks of fate or coincidence which sometimes obtain and which in truth obtained more frequently in Derry Tom had taken a room at the Koala Inn on Outer Jackson Street and Audra had taken a room at the Holiday Inn the two motels were side by side their parking lots divided only by a raised concrete sidewalk And as it so happened Audras rented Datsun and Toms purchased LTD wagon were parked nosetonose separated only by that walkway Both slept now Audra quietly on her side Tom Rogan on his back snoring so heavily that his swollen lips flapped Henry spent that day hidinghiding in the puckies beside Route Sometimes he slept Sometimes he lay watching police cruisers slide by like hunting dogs While the Losers ate lunch Henry listened to voices from the moon And when dark fell he went out to the verge of the road and stuck out his thumb The fire at the Black Spot happened in the late fall of So far as I am able to determine that firethe one my father barely escapedended the cycle of murder and disappearance which happened in the years  just as the explosion at the Ironworks ended a cycle some twentyfive years before It is as if a monstrous sacrifice is needed at the end of the cycle to quiet whatever terrible force it is which works here to send It to sleep for another quartercentury or so But if such a sacrifice is needed to end each cycle it seems that some similar event is needed to set each cycle in motion Their execution took place at the threeway intersection of Canal Main and Kansasnot far in fact from the place shown in the picture which began to move for Bill and Richie one day in June of some thirteen months before the fire at the Black Spot in October of not long before the stockmarket crash As with the fire at the Black Spot many Derry residents affect not to remember what happened that day Or they were out of town visiting relatives Or they were napping that afternoon and never found out what had happened until they heard it on the radio news that night Or they will simply look you full in the face and lie to you The police logs for that day indicate that Chief Sullivan was not even in town Sure I remember Aloysius Nell told me from a chair on the sunterrace of the Paulson Nursing Home in Bangor That was my first year on the force and I ought to remember He was off in western Maine birdhunting Theyd been sheeted and carried off by the time he got back Madder than a wet hen was Jim Sullivan but a picture in a reference book on gangsters called Bloodletters and Badmen shows a grinning man standing beside the bulletriddled corpse of Al Bradley in the morgue and if that man is not Chief Sullivan it is surely his twin brother It was from Mr Keene that I finally got what I believe to be the true version of the storyNorbert Keene who was the proprietor of the Center Street Drug Store from until  He talked to me willingly enough but like Betty Ripsoms father he made me turn off my taperecorder before he would really unwind the talenot that it mattered I can hear his papery voice yetanother a capella singer in the damned choir that is this town No reason not to tell you he said No one will print it and no one would believe it even if they did He offered me an oldfashioned apothecary jar Licorice whip As I remember you were always partial to the red ones Mikey Mr Keene laughed and took a licorice whip for himself You wondered about that did you I wondered I agreed chewing a piece of the red licorice I hadnt had one since I was a kid shoving my pennies across the counter to a much younger and sprier Mr Keene It tasted just as fine as it had back then Youre too young to remember when Bobby Thomson hit his home run for the Giants in the playoff game in Mr Keene said You wouldnt have been but four years old Well They ran an article about that game in the newspaper a few years after and it seemed like just about a million folks from New York claimed they were there in the ballpark that day Mr Keene gummed his licorice whip and a little dark drool ran down from the corner of his mouth He wiped it off fastidiously with his handkerchief We were sitting in the office behind the drugstore because although Norbert Keene was eightyfive and retired ten years he still did the books for his grandson Just the opposite when it comes to the Bradley Gang Keene exclaimed He was smiling but it was not a pleasant smileit was cynical coldly reminiscent There was maybe twenty thousand people who lived in downtown Derry back then Main Street and Canal Street had both been paved for four years but Kansas Street was still dirt Raised dust in the summer and turned into a boghole every March and November They used to oil UpMile Hill every June and every Fourth of July the Mayor would talk about how they were going to pave Kansas Street but it never happened until It but what was I saying Ayuh Well of those twenty thousand theres probably half that have passed away since maybe even morefifty years is a long time And people have a funny way of dying young in Derry Perhaps it is the air But of those left I dont think youd find more than a dozen whod say they were in town the day the Bradley Gang went to Tophet Butch Rowden over at the meat market would fess up to it I guesshe keeps a picture of one of the cars they had up on the wall where he cuts meat Looking at that picture youd hardly know it was a car Charlotte Littlefield would tell you a thing or two if you could get on her good side she teaches over to the high school and although I reckon she must not have been more than ten or twelve at the tune I bet she remembers plenty Carl Snow Aubrey Stacey Eben Stampnell and that old geezer who paints those funny pictures and drinks all night at WallysPickman I think his name istheyd remember They were all there He trailed off vaguely looking at the licorice whip in his hand I thought of prodding him and decided not to At last he said Most of the others would lie about it the way people lied and said they were there when Bobby Thomson hit his homer thats all I mean But people lied about being at that ballgame because they wished they had been there People would lie to you about being in Derry that day because they wish they hadnt been Do you understand me sonny You sure you want to hear the rest of this Mr Keene asked me Youre looking a bit peaked Mr Mikey I dont I said but I think I better all the same Okay Mr Keene said mildly It was my day for memories as he offered me the apothecary jar with the licorice whips in it I suddenly remembered a radio program my mother and dad used to listen to when I was just a little kid Mr Keene Tracer of Lost Persons Sheriff was there that day all right He was sposed to go birdhunting but he changed his mind damn quick when Lal Machen came in and told nun that he was expecting Al Bradley that very afternoon Well thats an instructive tale in itself Mr Keene said and the cynical smile creased his face again Bradley wasnt never Public Enemy Number One on the FBIs hit parade but they had wanted himsince or so To show they could cut the mustard I guess Al Bradley and his brother George hit six or seven banks across the Midwest and then kidnapped a banker for ransom The ransom was paidthirty thousand dollars a big sum for those daysbut they killed the banker anyway By then the Midwest had gotten a little toasty for the gangs that ran there so Al and George and their litter of ratlings run northeast up this way They rented themselves a big farmhouse just over the town line in Newport not far from where the Rhulin Farms are today That was in the dogdays of maybe July maybe August maybe even early September I dont know for sure just when There were eight of emAl Bradley George Bradley Joe Conklin and his brother Cal an Irishman named Arthur Malloy who was called Creeping Jesus Malloy because he was nearsighted but wouldnt put on his specs unless he absolutely had to and Patrick Caudy a young fellow from Chicago who was said to be killcrazy but as handsome as Adonis There were also two women with them Kitty Donahue George Bradleys commonlaw wife and Marie Hauser who belonged to Caudy but sometimes got passed around according to the stories we all heard later They made one bad assumption when they got up here sonnythey got the idea they were so far away from Indiana that they were safe They laid low for awhile and then got bored and decided they wanted to go hunting They had plenty of firepower but they were a bit low on ammunition So they all came into Derry on the seventh of October in two cars Patrick Gaudy took the women around shopping while the other men went into Machens Sporting Goods Kitty Donahue bought a dress in Freeses and she died in it two days later Lal Machen waited on the men himself He died in Too fat he was Always too fat But there wasnt nothing wrong with his eyes and he knew it was Al Bradley the minute he walked in he said He thought he recognized some of the others but he wasnt sure of Malloy until he put on his specs to look at a display of knives in a glass case Al Bradley walked up to him and said Wed like to buy some ammunition Bradley handed him a paper and Lal read it over The paper has been lost at least so far as I know but Lal said it would have turned your blood cold They wanted five hundred rounds ofcaliber ammunition eight hundred rounds ofcaliber sixty rounds ofcaliber which they dont even make anymore shotgun shells loaded both with buck and bird and a thousand rounds each of short and longrifle Plusget thissixteen thousand rounds of machinegun bullets Mr Keene smiled that cynical smile again and offered me the apothecary jar At first I shook my head and then I took another whip Come on Al Creeping Jesus Malloy says I told you we wasnt going to get it in a hick town like this Lets go on up to Bangor They wont have nothing there either but I can use a ride Now hold your horses Lal says just as cool as a cucumber This here is one hell of a good order and I wouldnt want to lose it to that Jew up Bangor I can give you thes right now also the bird and half the buck I can give you a hundred rounds each of the andcaliber too I could have the rest for you And here Lal sort of halfclosed his eyes and tapped his chin as if calculating it out by day after tomorrow Howd that be Bradley grinned like hed split his head around the back and said it sounded just as fine as paint Cal Conklin said hed still like to go on up to Bangor but he was outvoted Now if youre not sure you can make good on this order you ought to say so right now Al Bradley says to Lal because Im a pretty fine fellow but when I get mad you dont want to get into a pissing contest with me You follow I do Lal says and Ill have all the ammo you could want Mr He stuck out his hand and Lal pumped it grinning all the while Real pleased Mr Rader So then Bradley asked him what would be a good time for him and his friends to drop by and pick up the goods and Lal Machen asked them right back how two in the afternoon sounded to them They agreed that would be fine Out they went Lal watched them go They met the two women and Gaudy on the sidewalk outside Lal recognized Gaudy too So Mr Keene said looking at me brighteyed what do you think Lal done then Called the cops I guess he didnt I said based on what happened Me I would have broken my leg getting to the telephone Well maybe you would and maybe you wouldnt Mr Keene said with that same cynical brighteyed smile and I shivered because I knew what he meant and he knew I knew Once something heavy begins to roll it cant be stopped its simply going to roll until it finds a flat place long enough to wear away all of its forward motion You can stand in front of that thing and get flattened but that wont stop it either Maybe you would have and maybe you wouldnt Mr Keene repeated But I can tell you what Lal Machen did The rest of that day and all of the next when someone he knew came insome manwhy he would tell them that he knew who had been out in the woods around the NewportDerry line shooting at deer and grouse and God knows what else with Kansas City typewriters It was the Bradley Gang He knew for a fact because he had recognized em Hed tell em that Bradley and his men were coming back the next day around two to pick up the rest of their order Hed tell them hed promised Bradley all the ammunition he could want and that was a promise he intended to keep How many I asked I felt hypnotized by his glittering eye Suddenly the dry smell of this back roomthe smell of prescription drugs and powders of Musterole and Vicks VapoRub and Robitussin cough syrupsuddenly all those smells seemed suffocating but I could no more have left than I could kill myself by holding my breath How many men did Lal pass the word to Mr Keene asked Dont know for sure Mr Keene said didnt stand right there and take up sentry duty All those he felt he could trust I suppose Those he could trust I mused My voice was a little hoarse Ayuh Mr Keene said derrymen you know Not that many of em raised cows He laughed at this old joke before going on I came in around ten the day after the Bradleys first dropped in on Lal He told me the story then asked how he could help me Id only come in to see if my last roll of pictures had been developedin those days Machens handled all the Kodak films and camerasbut after I got my photos I also said I could use some ammo for my Winchester You gonna shoot some game Norb Lal asks me passing over the shells Might plug some varmints I said and we had us a chuckle over that Mr Keene laughed and slapped his skinny leg as if this was still the best joke he had ever heard He leaned forward and tapped my knee All I mean son is that the story got around all it needed to Small towns you know If you tell the right people what you need to pass along will get along see what I mean Like another licorice whip Make you fat Mr Keene said and cackled He looked old then infinitely old with his bifocals slipping down the gaunt blade of his nose and the skin stretched too tight and thin across his cheeks to wrinkle The next day I brought my rifle into the store with me and Bob Tanner who worked harder than any assistant I ever had after him brought in his pops shotgun Around eleven that day Gregory Cole came in for a bicarb of soda and damned if he didnt have a Colt jammed right in his belt I come out of the woods all the way from Milford for this and I got one fuck of a hangover Greg says I guess Ill blow someones balls off before the sun goes down Around onethirty I put the little sign I had BE BACK SOON PLEASE BE PATIENT in the door and took my rifle and walked out the back into Richards Alley I asked Bob Tanner if he wanted to come along and he said hed better finish filling Mrs Emersons prescription and hed see me later Leave me a live one Mr Keene he said but I allowed as how I couldnt promise nothing There was hardly any traffic on Canal Street at all either on foot or by car Every now and then a delivery truck would pass but that was about all I saw Jake Pinnette cross over and he had a rifle in each hand He met Andy Criss and they walked over to one of the benches that used to stand where the War Memorial wasyou know where the Canal goes underground Petie Vanness and Al Nell and Jimmy Gordon were all sitting on the courthouse steps eating sandwiches and fruit out of their dinnerbuckets trading with each other for stuff that looked better to them the way kids do on the schoolyard They was all armed Jimmy Gordon had himself a World War I Springfield that looked bigger than he did I see a kid go walking toward UpMile HillI think maybe it was Zack Denbrough the father of your old buddy the one who turned out to be a writerand Kenny Borton says from the window of the Christian Science Reading Room You want to get out of here kid theres going to be shooting Zack took one look at his face and ran like hell There were men everywhere men with guns standing in doorways and sitting on steps and looking out of windows Greg Cole was sitting in a doorway down the street with his in his lap and about two dozen shells lined up beside him like toy sojers Bruce Jagermeyer and that Swede Olaf Theramenius were standing underneath the marquee of the Bijou in the shade Mr Keene looked at me through me His eyes were not sharp now they were hazy with memory soft as the eyes of a man only become when he is remembering one of the best times of his lifethe first home run he ever hit maybe or the first trout he ever landed that was big enough to keep or the first time he ever lay with a willing woman I remember I heard the wind sonny he said dreamily I remember hearing the wind hearing the courthouse clock toll two Bob Tanner came up behind me and I was so tightwired I almost blew his head off He only nodded at me and crossed over to Vannocks Dry Goods trailing his shadow out behind him You would have thought that when it got to be twoten and nothing happened then twofifteen then twotwenty folks would have just up and left wouldnt you But it didnt happen that way at all People just kept their place Because Because you knew they were going to come didnt you I asked There was never any question at all He beamed at me like a teacher pleased with a students recital Thats right he said We knew No one had to talk about it no one had to say Wellnow lets wait until twenty past and if they dont show Ive got to get back to work Things just stayed quiet and around twotwentyfive that afternoon these two cars one red and one dark blue started down UpMile Hill and came into the intersection One of them was a Chevrolet and the other was a La Salle The Conklin brothers Patrick Caudy and Marie Hauser were in the Chevrolet The Bradleys Malloy and Kitty Donahue were in the La Salle They started through the intersection okay and then Al Bradley slammed on the brakes of that La Salle so sudden that Caudy damn near ran into him The street was too quiet and Bradley knew it He wasnt nothing but an animal but it doesnt take much to put up an animals wind when its been chased like a weasel in the corn for four years He opened the door of the La Salle and stood up on the running board for a moment He looked around then he made a goback gesture to Caudy with his hand Caudy said What boss I heard that plain as day the only thing I heard any of them say that day There was a wink of sun too I remember that It came off a compact mirror The Hauser woman was powdering her nose That was when Lal Machen and his helper Biff Marlow came running out of Machens store Put em up Bradley youre surrounded Lal shouts and before Bradley could do more than turn his head Lal started blasting He was wild at first but then he put one into Bradleys shoulder The claret started to pour out of that hole right away Bradley caught hold of the La Salles doorpost and swung himself back into the car He threw it into gear and thats when everyone started to shoot It was all over in four maybe five minutes but it seemed a whole hell of a lot longer while it was happening Petie and Al and Jimmy Gordon just sat there on the courthouse steps and poured bullets into the back end of the Chevrolet I saw Bob Tanner down on one knee firing and working the bolt on that old rifle of his like a madman Jagermeyer and Theramenius were shooting into the right side of the La Salle from under the theater marquee and Greg Cole stood in the gutter holding that automatic out in both hands pulling the trigger just as fast as he could work it There must have been fifty sixty men firing all at once After it was all over Lal Machen dug thirtysix slugs out of the brick sides of his store And that was three days later after just about everydamnbody in town who wanted one for a souvenir had come down and dug one out with his penknife When it was at its worst it sounded like the Battle of the Marne Windows were blown in by riflefire all around Machens Bradley got the La Salle around in a halfcircle and he wasnt slow but by the time hed done he was running on four flats Both the headlights were blowed out and the windscreen was gone Creeping Jesus Malloy and George Bradley were each at a backseat window firing pistols I seen one bullet take Malloy high up in the neck and tear it wide open He shot twice more and then collapsed out the window with his arms hanging down Gaudy tried to turn the Chevrolet and only ran into the back end of Bradleys La Salle That was really the end of em right there son The Chevrolets front bumper locked with the La Salles back one and there went any chance they might have had to make a run for it Joe Conklin got out of the back seat and just stood there in the middle of the intersection a pistol in each hand and started to pour it on He was shooting at Jake Pinnette and Andy Criss The two of them fell off the bench theyd been sitting on and landed in the grass Andy Criss shouting Im killed Im killed over and over again although he was never so much as touched neither of them were Joe Conklin he had time to fire both his guns empty before anything so much as touched him His coat flew back and his pants twitched like some woman you couldnt see was stitching on them He was wearing a straw hat and it flew off his head so you could see how hed centerparted his hair He had one of his guns under his arm and was trying to reload the other when someone cut the legs out from under him and he went down Kenny Borton claimed him later but there was really no way to tell Could have been anybody Conklins brother Cal came out after him soons Joe fell and down he went like a ton of bricks with a hole in his head Marie Hauser came out Maybe she was trying to surrender I dunno She still had the compact shed been using to powder her nose in her right hand She was screaming I believe but by then it was hard to hear Bullets was flying all around them That compact mirror was blown right out of her hand She started back to the car then but she took one in the hip She made it somehow and managed to crawl inside again Al Bradley revved the La Salle up just as high as it would go and managed to get it moving again He dragged the Chevrolet maybe ten feet before the bumper tore right off n it The boys poured lead into it All the windows was busted One of the mudguards was laying in the street Malloy was dead hanging out the window but both of the Bradley brothers were still alive George was firing from the back seat His woman was dead beside him with one of her eyes shot out Al Bradley got to the big intersection then his auto mounted the curb and stopped there He got out from behind the wheel and started running up Canal Street He was riddled Patrick Gaudy got out of the Chevrolet looked as if he was going to surrender for a minute then he grabbed a from a cheaterholster under his armpit He triggered it off maybe three times just firing wild and then his shirt blew back from his chest in flames He slid down the side of the Chevy until he was sitting on the running board He shot one more time and so far as I know that was the only bullet that hit anyone it ricocheted off something and then grazed across the back of Greg Coles hand Left a scar he used to show off when he was drunk until someoneAl Nell maybetook him aside and told him it might be a good idea to shut up about what happened to the Bradley Gang The Hauser woman came out and that time wasnt any doubt she was trying to surrendershe had her hands up Maybe no one really meant to kill her but by then there was a crossfire and she walked right into it George Bradley run as far as that bench by the War Memorial then someone pulped the back of his head with a shotgun blast He fell down dead with his pants full of piss Hardly aware I was doing it I took a licorice whip from the jar They went on pouring rounds into those cars for another minute or so before it began to taper off Mr Keene said When men get then blood up it doesnt go down easy That was when I looked around and saw Sheriff Sullivan behind Nell and the others on the courthouse steps putting rounds through that dead Chevy with a Remington pump Dont let anyone tell you he wasnt there Norbert Keene is sitting in front of you and telling you he was By the time the firing stopped those cars didnt look like cars at all anymore just hunks of junk with glass around them Men started to walk over to them No one talked All you could hear was the wind and feet gritting over broken glass Thats when the picturetaking started And you ought to know this sonny when the picturetaking starts the story is over Mr Keene rocked in his chair his slippers bumping placidly on the floor looking at me Theres nothing like that in the Derry News was all I could think of to say The headline for that day had read STATE POLICE FBI GUN DOWN BRADLEY GANG IN PITCHED BATTLE With the subhead Local Police Lend Support Course not Mr Keene said laughing delightedly I seen the publisher Mack Laughlin put two rounds into Joe Conklin himself I got enough I said I licked my lips Mr Keene how could a thing of that that magnitude be covered up Wasnt no coverup he said looking honestly surprised It was just that no one talked about it much And really who cared It wasnt President and Mrs Hoover that went down that day It was no worse than shooting mad dogs that would kill you with a bite if you give them half a chance Couple of whores he said indifferently Besides it happened in Derry not in New York or Chicago The place makes it news as much as what happened in the place sonny Thats why there are bigger headlines when an earthquake kills twelve people in Los Angeles than there are when one kills three thousand in some heathen country in the Mideast Ive heard it before and I suppose if I continue to pursue this Ill hear it again and again and again They say it as if speaking patiently to a mental defective They say it the way they would say Because of gravity if you asked them how come you stick to the ground when you walk They say it as if it were a natural law any natural man should understand And of course the worst of that is I do understand Did you see anyone at all that day that you didnt recognize once the shooting started Mr Keenes answer was quick enough to drop my blood temperature ten degreesor so it felt The clown you mean How did you find out about him sonny I only caught a glimpse of him Once things got hot I tended pretty much to my own knittin I glanced around just once and saw him upstreet beyond them Swedes under the Bijous marquee Mr Keene said He wasnt wearing a clown suit or nothing like that He was dressed in a pair of farmers biballs and a cotton shirt underneath But his face was covered with that white greasepaint they use and he had a big red clown smile painted on Also had these tufts of fake hair you know Orange Sorta comical Lal Machen never saw that fellow but Biff did Only Biff must have been confused because he thought he saw him in one of the windows of an apartment over somewhere to the left and once when I asked Jimmy Gordonhe was killed in Pearl Harbor you know went down with his ship the California I think it washe said he saw the guy behind the War Memorial Its funny how people get during a thing like that and even funnier what they remember after its all over You can listen to sixteen different tales and no two of them will jibe together Take the gun that clown fellow had for instance Ayuh Mr Keene said The one glimpse I caught of him it looked like he had a Winchester boltaction and it wasnt until later that I figured out I must have thought that because thats what I had Biff Marlow thought he had a Remington because that was what he had And when I asked Jimmy about it he said that guy was shooting an old Springfield just like his Funny huh Funny I managed Mr Keene didnt any of you wonder what in hell a clown especially one in farmers biballs was doing there just then Sure Mr Keene said It wasnt no big deal you understand but sure we wondered Most of us figured it was somebody who wanted to attend the party but didnt want to be recognized A Town Council member maybe Horst Mueller maybe or even Trace Naugler who was mayor back then Or it could just have been a professional man who didnt want to be recognized A doctor or a lawyer I wouldnt ve recognized my own father in a getup like that He laughed a little and I asked him what was funny Theres also a possibility that it was a real clown he said Back in the twenties and thirties the county fair in Esty came a lot earlier than it does now and it was set up and going full blast the week that the Bradley Gang met their end There were clowns at the county fair Maybe one of them heard we were going to have our own little carnival and rode down because he wanted to be in on it Im about talked out he said but Ill tell you one more thing since you pear to be so interested and you listen so close It was something Biff Marlow said about sixteen years later when we were having a few beers up to Pilots in Bangor Right out of a clear blue sky he said it Said that clown was leanin out of the window so far that Biff couldnt believe he wasnt fallin out It wasnt just his head and shoulders and arms that was out Biff said he was right out to the knees hanging there in midair shooting down at the cars the Bradleys had come in with that big red grin on his face He was tricked out like a jackolantern that had got a bad scare was how Biff put it Ayuh Mr Keene agreed And Biff said there was something else something that bothered him for weeks afterward One of those things you get right on the tip of your tongue but wont quite come off or something that lights on your skin like a mosquito or a noseeum He said he finally figured out what it was one night when he had to get up and tap a kidney He stood there whizzing into the bowl thinking of nothing in particular when it come to him all at once that it was twotwentyfive in the afternoon when the shooting started and the sun was out but that clown didnt cast any shadow No shadow at all Bills there first He sits in one of the wingback chairs just inside the Reading Room door watching as Mike deals with the librarys last few customers of the nightan old lady with a clutch of paperback gothics a man with a huge historical tome on the Civil War and a skinny kid waiting to check out a novel with a sevendayrental sticker in an upper corner of its plastic cover Bill sees with no sense of surprise or serendipity at all that it is his own latest novel He feels that surprise is beyond him serendipity a believedin reality that has turned out to be only a dream after all A pretty girl her tartan skirt held together with a big gold safety pin Christ I havent seen one of those in years Bill thinks are they coming back is feeding quarters into the Xerox machine and copying an off print with one eye on the big pendulum clock behind the checkout desk The sounds are librarysoft and librarycomforting the hushsqueak of soles and heels on the redandblack linoleum of the floor the steady lock and tick of the clock dropping off dry seconds the catlike purr of the copying machine The boy takes his William Denbrough novel and goes to the girl at the copier just as she finishes and begins to square up her pages You can just leave that off print on the desk Mary Mike says Ill put it away The boogeyman will get you if you dont watch out Billy the skinny kid chants and slips a proprietary arm around the girls slim waist Well I dont think hed want a pair as ugly as you two Mike says but be careful all the same We will Mr Hanlon Mary replies seriously enough and punches the boy lightly on the shoulder Come on ugly she says and giggles When she does this she is transformed from a pretty mildly desirable highschool junior into the coltish notquitegawky elevenyearold that Beverly Marsh had been and as they pass him Bill is shaken by her beauty and he feels fear he wants to go to the boy and tell him earnestly that he must go home by welllighted streets and not look around if someone speaks You cant be careful on a skateboard mister a phantom voice says inside his head and Bill smiles a rueful grownups smile He watches the boy open the door for his girl They go into the vestibule moving closer together and Bill would have bet the royalties of the book the boy named Billy is holding under his arm that he has stolen a kiss before opening the outer door for the girl More fool you if you didnt Billy my man he thinks Now see her home safe For Christs sake see her home safe Mike calls Be right with you Big Bill Just let me file this Bill nods and crosses his legs The paper bag on his lap crackles a little Theres a pint of bourbon inside and he reckons he has never wanted a drink so badly in his life as he does right now Mike will be able to supply water if not iceand the way he feels right now a very little water will be enough He thinks of Silver leaning against the wall of Mikes garage on Palmer Lane And from that his thoughts progress naturally to the day they had met in the Barrensall except Mikeand each had told his tale again lepers under porches mummies who walked on the ice blood from drains and dead boys in the Standpipe and pictures that moved and werewolves that chased small boys down deserted streets They had gone deeper into the Barrens that day before the Fourth of July he remembers now It had been hot in town but cool in the tangled shade on the eastern bank of the Kenduskeag He remembers one of those concrete cylinders not far away humming to itself the way the Xerox machine had hummed for the pretty highschool girl just now Bill remembers that and how when all the stories were done the others had looked at him They had wanted him to tell them what they should do next how they should proceed and he simply didnt know The not knowing had filled him with a kind of desperation Looking at Mikes shadow now looming large on the darkly paneled wall in the reference room a sudden sureness comes to him he hadnt known then because they hadnt been complete when they met that July rd afternoon The completion had come later at the abandoned gravelpit beyond the dump where you could climb out of the Barrens easily on either sideKansas Street or Merit Street Right around in fact where the Interstate overpass was now The gravelpit had no name it was old its crumbly sides crabby with weeds and bushes There had still been plenty of ammunition theremore than enough for an apocalyptic rockfight But before that on the bank of the Kenduskeag he hadnt been sure what to saywhat did they want him to say What did he want to say He remembers looking from one face to the nextBens Bevs Eddies Stans Richies And he remembers music Little Richard Whompbompalompbomp Music Low And darts of light in his eyes He remembers the darts of light because Richie had hung his transistor radio over the lowermost branch of the tree he was leaning against Although they were in the shade the sun bounced off the surface of the Kenduskeag onto the radios chrome facing and from there into Bills eyes TTake that thhing dddown RuhRuhRichie Bill said Its gonna bunblind mmme Sure Big Bill Richie said at once with no smartmouth at all and removed the radio from the branch He also turned it off and Bill wished he hadnt done that it made the silence broken only by the rippling water and the vague hum of the sewagepumping machinery seem very loud Their eyes watched him and he wanted to tell them to look somewhere else what did they think he was a freak But of course he couldnt do that because all they were doing was waiting for him to tell them what to do now They had come by dreadful knowledge and they needed him to tell them what to do with it Why me he wanted to shout at them but of course he knew that too It was because like it or not he had been tapped for the position Because he was the ideaman because he had lost a brother to whatever it was but most of all because he had become in some obscure way he would never completely understand Big Bill He glanced at Beverly and looked away quickly from the calm trust in her eyes Looking at Beverly made him feel funny in the pit of his stomach Fluttery We cuhcant go to the pppolice he said at last His voice sounded harsh to his own ears too loud We ccahant ggo to our puhhuhharents either Unless He looked hopefully at Richie What aaabout your mmom and ddad foureyes They suhheem ppretty rehrehregular My good man Richie said in his Toodles the Butler Voice you obviously have no understahnding whatsoevah of my mater and pater They Talk American Richie Eddie said from his spot by Ben He was sitting by Ben for the simple reason that Ben provided enough shade for Eddie to sit in His face looked small and pinched and worriedan old mans face His aspirator was in his right hand Theyd think I was ready for Juniper Hill Richie said He was wearing an old pair of glasses today The day before a friend of Henry Bowerss named Card Jagermeyer had come up behind Richie as Richie left the Derry Ice Cream Bar with a pistachio cone Tag youre it this Jagermeyer who outweighed Richie by forty pounds or so screamed and slammed Richie full in the back with both hands laced together Richie flew into the gutter losing his glasses and his icecream cone The left lens of his glasses had shattered and his mother was furious with him about it lending very little credence to Richies explanations All I know is that it was a lot of fooling around she had said Honestly Richie do you think theres a glassestree somewhere and we can just pull off a new pair of spectacles for you whenever you break the old pair But Mom this kid pushed me he came up behind me this big kid and pushed me Richie was by then near tears This failure to make his mother understand hurt much worse than being slammed into the gutter by Card Jagermeyer who was so stupid they hadnt even bothered to send him to summerschool I dont want to hear any more about it Maggie Tozier said flatly But the next time you see your father come in looking whipped after working late three nights in a row you think a little bit Richie You think about it No more I said Her voice was curt and finalworse it was near tears She left the room then and the TV went on much too loud Richie had been left alone sitting miserably at the kitchen table It was this memory that caused Richie to shake his head again My folks are okay but theyd never believe something like this And they looked around Bill would remember years later as if for someone who wasnt there Who Stan asked doubtfully I cant think of anyone else I trust Just the suhsuhsame Bill said in a troubled voice and a little silence fell among them while Bill thought about what to say next If asked Ben Hanscom would have told you that Henry Bowers hated him more than any of the others in the Losers Club because of what had happened that day when he and Henry had shot the chutes down into the Barrens from Kansas Street because of what had happened the day he and Richie and Beverly escaped from the Aladdin but most of all because by not allowing Henry to copy during examinations he had caused Henry to be sent to summerschool and incur the wrath of his father the reputedly insane Butch Bowers If asked Richie Tozier would have told you Henry hated him more than any of the others because of the day he had fooled Henry and his two other musketeers in Freeses Stan Uris would have told you that Henry hated him most of all because he was a Jew when Stan had been in the third grade and Henry the fifth Henry had once washed Stans face with snow until it bled and he was screaming hysterically with pain and fear Bill Denbrough believed that Henry hated him the most because he was skinny because he stuttered and because he liked to dress well LLLook at the ffffucking puhpuhPANSY Henry had cried when the Derry School had had Careers Day in April and Bill had come wearing a tie before the day was over the tie had been ripped off and flung into a tree halfway down Charter Street He did hate all four of them but the boy in Derry who was number one on Henrys personal Hate Parade was not in the Losers Club at all on that July rd he was a black boy named Michael Hanlon who lived a quarter of a mile down the road from the shirttail Bowers farm Henrys father who was every bit as crazy as he was reputed to be was Oscar Butch Bowers Butch Bowers associated his financial physical and mental decline with the Hanlon family in general and with Mikes father in particular Will Hanlon he was fond of telling his few friends and his son had had him thrown in the county jail when all of his Hanlons chickens died sos he could get the insurance money dont you know Butch would say eying his audience with all the baleful interruptifyoudare pugnacity of Captain Billy Bones in the Admiral Benbow He got some of his friends to lie him up and thats why I had to sell my Mercry Who lied him up Daddy Henry had asked when he was eight burning at the injustice that had been done to his father He thought to himself that when he was a grownup he would find liaruppers and coat them with honey and stake them out over anthills like in some of those Western movies they showed at the Bijou Theater on Saturday afternoons And because his son was a tireless listener although if asked Butch would have maintained that was only as it should be Bowers Senior filled his sons ears with a litany of hate and hard luck He explained to his son that while all niggers were stupid some were cunning as welland down deep they all hated white men and wanted to plow a white womans furrow Maybe it wasnt just the insurance money after all Butch said maybe Hanlon had decided to lay the blame for the dead chickens at his door because Butch had the next produce stand down the road He done it anyway and that was just as sure as shit sticks to a blanket He done it and then got a bunch of white nigger bleeding hearts from town to lie him up and threaten Butch with state prison if he didnt pay that nigger off And why not Butch would ask his roundeyed dirtynecked silent son Why not I was just a man who fought the Japs for his country There was lots of guys like us but he was the only nigger in the county The chicken business had been followed by one unlucky incident after anotherhis Deere tractor had blown a rod his good harrow got busted in the north field he got a boil on his neck which became infected had to be lanced then became infected again and had to be removed surgically the nigger started using his foully gotten money to undercut Butchs prices so they lost custom In Henrys ears it was a constant litany the nigger the nigger the nigger Everything was the niggers fault The nigger had a nice white house with an upstairs and an oil furnace while Butch and his wife and his son lived in what was not much better than a tarpaper shack When Butch couldnt make enough money farming and had to go to work in the woods for awhile it was the niggers fault When their well went dry in it was the niggers fault Later that same year Henry who was then ten years old started to feed Mikes dog Mr Chips old stewbones and bags of potatochips It got so Mr Chips would wag his tail and come running when Henry called When the dog was well used to Henry and Henrys treats Henry one day fed him a pound of hamburger laced with insect poison The bugkiller he found in the back shed he had saved three weeks to buy the meat at Costellos Mr Chips ate half the poisoned meat and then stopped Go on finish your treat Niggerdog Henry had said Mr Chips wagged his tail Since Henry had called him this from the beginning he believed it was his other name When the pains started Henry produced a piece of clothesline and tied Mr Chips to a birch so he couldnt get away and run home He then sat on a flat sunwarmed rock put his chin in his palms and watched the dog die It took a good long time but Henry considered it time well spent At the end Mr Chips began to convulse and a thin green foam ran from between his jaws How do you like that Niggerdog Henry asked it and it rolled its dying eyes up at the sound of Henrys voice and tried to wag its tail did you like your lunch you shitty mutt When the dog was dead Henry removed the clothesline went home and told his father what he had done Oscar Bowers was extremely crazy by that time a year later his wife would leave him after he beat her nearly to death Henry was likewise frightened of his father and felt a terrible hate for him sometimes but he also loved him And that afternoon after he had told he felt he had finally found the key to his fathers affections because his father had clapped him on the back so hard that Henry almost fell over taken him in the living room and given him a beer It was the first beer Henry had ever had and for all the rest of his years he would associate that taste with positive emotions victory and love Heres to a good job well done Henrys crazy father had said They clicked their brown bottles together and drank them down So far as Henry knew the niggers had never found out who killed their dog but he supposed they had their suspicions He hoped they did The others in the Losers Club knew Mike by sightin a town where he was the only Negro child it would have been strange if they had notbut that was all because Mike didnt go to Derry Elementary School His mother was a devout Baptist and Mike was therefore sent to the Neibolt Street Church School In between geography reading and arithuaetic there were Bible drills lessons on such subjects as The Meaning of the Ten Commandments in a Godless World and discussiongroups on how to handle everyday moral problems if you saw a buddy shoplifting for instance or heard a teacher taking the name of God in vain Mike thought the Church School was okay There were times when he suspected in a vague way that he was missing some thingsa wider communication with kids his own age perhapsbut he was willing to wait until high school for these things to happen The prospect made him a little nervous because his skin was brown but both his mother and father had been well treated in town as far as Mike could see and Mike believed he would be treated well if he treated others the same way Although he tried to show it as little as possible Mike went in constant terror of Henry In Mike was slim and well built taller than Stan Uris but not quite as tall as Bill Denbrough He was fast and agile and that had saved him from several beatings at Henrys hands And of course he went to a different school Because of that and the age difference their paths rarely coincided Mike took pains to keep things that way So the irony was this although Henry hated Mike Hanlon more than any other kid in Derry Mike had been the least hurt of any of them Oh he had taken his lumps The spring after he had killed Mikes dog Henry sprang out of the bushes one day while Mike was walking toward town to go to the library It was late March warm enough for bikeriding but in those days Witcham Road turned to dirt just beyond the Bowers place which meant that it was a quagmire of mudno good for bikes Mike backed off eyes flicking warily right and left watching for a chance to get away He knew that if he could buttonhook around Henry he could outdistance him Henry was big and Henry was strong but Henry was also slow Gonna make me a tarbaby Henry said advancing on the smaller boy Youre not black enough but Ill fix that Mike cut his eyes to the left and twitched his body in that direction Henry took the bait and broke that waytoo fast and too far to pull himself back Reversing with a sweet and natural speed Mike took off to the right in high school he would make the varsity football team as a tailback his sophomore year and was only kept from breaking the schools alltime scoring record by a broken leg halfway through his senior season He would have made it easily past Henry but for the mud It was greasy and Mike slipped to his knees Before he could get up Henry was upon him Niggerniggernigger Henry cried in a kind of religious ecstasy as he rolled Mike over Mud went up the back of Mikes shirt and down the back of his pants He could feel it squeezing into his shoes But he did not begin to cry until Henry slathered mud across his face plugging up both of his nostrils Now youre black Henry had screamed gleefully rubbing mud in Mikes hair Now youre REEEELY black He ripped up Mikes poplin jacket and the teeshirt beneath and slammed a poultice of mud down over the boys bellybutton Now youre as black as midnight in a MINESHAFT Henry screamed triumphantly and slammed mudplugs into both of Mikes ears Then he stood back muddy hands hooked into his belt and yelled I killed your dog black boy But Mike did not hear this because of the mud in his ears and his own terrified sobs Henry kicked a final sticky clot of mud onto Mike and then turned and walked home not looking back A few moments later Mike got up and did the same still weeping His mother was of course furious she wanted Will Hanlon to call Chief Borton and have him out to the Bowers house before the sun went down Hes been after Mikey before Mike heard her say He was sitting in the bathtub and his parents were in the kitchen This was his second tub of water the first had turned black almost the moment he had stepped into it and sat down In her fury his mother had lapsed into a thick Texas patois Mike could barely understand You put the law on him Will Hanlon Both the dog and the pup You law em hear me Will heard but did not do as his wife asked Eventually when she cooled down by then it was that night and Mike two hours asleep he refreshed her on the facts of life Chief Borton was not Sheriff Sullivan If Borton had been sheriff when the incident of the poisoned chickens occurred Will would never have gotten his two hundred dollars and would have had to be content with that state of affairs Some men would stand behind you and some men wouldnt Borton was of the latter type He was in fact a jellyfish Mike has had trouble with that kid before yes he told Jessica But he hasnt had much because hes careful around Henry Bowers This will serve to make him more careful Bowers has told his son stories about his dealings with me I guess Will said and his son hates the three of us because of them and because his father has also told him that hating niggers is what men are supposed to do It all comes back to that I cant change the fact that our son is a Negro any more than I can sit here and tell you that Henry Bowers is going to be the last one to take after him because his skins brown Hes going to have to deal with it all the rest of his life as I have dealt with it and you have dealt with it Why right there in that Christian school you were bound he was going to go to the teacher told them blacks werent as good as whites because Noahs son Ham looked at his father while he was drunk and naked and Noahs other two boys cast their eyes aside Thats why the sons of Ham were condemned to always be hewers of wood and drawers of water she said And Mikey said she was lookin right at him while she told that story to them Jessica looked at her husband mute and miserable Two tears fell one from each eye and tracked slowly down her face Isnt there ever any getting away from it His reply was kind but implacable it was a tune when wives believed their husbands and Jessica had no reason to doubt her Will No There is no getting away from the word nigger not now not in the world weve been given to live in you and me Country niggers from Maine are still niggers I have thought times that the reason I came back to Derry was that there is no better place to remember that But Ill have a talk with the boy The next day he called Mike out of the barn Will sat on the yoke of his harrow and patted a place next to him for Mike You want to stay out of that Henry Bowerss way he said Mike nodded again He had heard as much around town His few glimpses of Mr Bowers had reinforced the notion I dont mean just a little crazy Will said lighting a homerolled Bugler cigarette and looking at his son Hes t about three steps away from the boobyhatch He came back from the war that way I think Henrys crazy too Mike said His voice was low but firm and that strengthened Wills heart although he was even after a checkered life whose incidents had included almost being burned alive in a juryrigged speakeasy called the Black Spot unable to believe a kid like Henry could be crazy Well hes listened to his father too much but that is only natural Will said Yet on this his son was closer to the truth Henry Bowers either because of his constant association with his father or because of something elsesome interior thingwas indeed slowly but surely going crazy I dont want you to make a career out of running away his father said but because youre a Negro youre apt to be put upon a good deal Do you know what I mean Yes Daddy Mike said thinking of Bob Gautier at school who had tried to explain to Mike that nigger could not be a bad word because his father used it all the time In fact Bob told Mike earnestly it was a good word When a fighter on the Friday Night Fights took a bad beating and managed to stay on his feet his daddy said His head is as hard as a niggers and when someone was really putting out at his work which for Mr Gautier was Star Beef in town his daddy said That man works like a nigger And my daddy is just as much a Christian as your daddy Bob had finished Mike remembered that looking at Bob Gautiers white earnest pinched face surrounded by the mangy fur of his handmedown snowsuithood he had felt not anger but a terrible sadness that made him feel like crying He had seen honesty and good intent in Bobs face but what he had felt was loneliness distance a great whistling emptiness between himself and the other boy I see that you do know what I mean Will said and ruffled his sons hair And what it all comes down to is that you have to be careful where you take your stand You have to ask yourself if Henry Bowers is worth the trouble Is he No Mike said No I dont think so It would be yet awhile before he changed his mind July rd in fact While Henry Bowers Victor Criss Belch Huggins Peter Gordon and a halfretarded highschool boy named Steve Sadler known as Moose after the character in the Archie comics were chasing a winded Mike Hanlon through the trainyard and toward the Barrens about half a mile away Bill and the rest of the Losers Club were still sitting on the bank of the Kenduskeag pondering their nightmare problem I nunknow wwhere ihihit is I think Bill said finally breaking the silence The sewers Stan said and they all jumped at a sudden harsh rattling noise Eddie smiled guiltily as he lowered his aspirator back into his lap Bill nodded I wuhwuhwas aasking my fuhfather about the suhsewers a ffew nuhhihights aaago All of this area was originally marsh Zack told his son and the town fathers managed to put whats downtown these days in the very worst part of it The section of the Canal that runs under Center and Main and comes out in Bassey Park is really nothing but a drain that happens to hold the Kenduskeag Most of the year those drains are almost empty but theyre important when the spring runoff comes or when there are floods He paused here perhaps thinking that it had been during the flood of the previous autumn that he had lost his younger son because of the pumps he finished Puhpuhpumps Bill asked turning his head a little without even thinking about it When he stuttered over the plosive sounds spittle flew from his lips The drainage pumps his father said Theyre in the Barrens Concrete sleeves that stick about three feet out of the ground Zack grinned back but it was a shadow of his old grin They were in Zacks workshop where he was turning chairdowels without much interest sumppumps is all they really are kiddo he said They sit in cylinders about ten feet deep and they pump the sewage and the runoff along when the slope of the land levels out or angles up a little Its old machinery and the city should have some new pumps but the Council always pleads poverty when the item comes up on the agenda at budget meetings If I had a quarter for every time Ive been down there up to my knees in crap rewiring one of those motors but you dont want to hear all this Bill Why dont you go watch TV I think Sugarfoots on tonight I dddo wuhwant to hhear it Bill said and not only because he had come to the conclusion that there was something terrible under Derry someplace Why do you want to hear about a bunch of sewerpumps Zack asked Well its a pretty dull subject Zack said Teacherll probably give you an F for putting him to sleep Look heres the Kenduskeaghe drew a straight line in the light fall of sawdust on the table in which his handsaw was embeddedand heres the Barrens Now because downtowns lower than the residential areasKansas Street say or the Old Cape or West Broadwaymost of the downtown waste has to be pumped into the river The waste from the houses flows down to the Barrens pretty much on its own You see YYYes Bill said drawing a little closer to his father to look at the lines close enough so that his shoulder was against his fathers arm Someday theyll put a stop to pumping raw sewage into the river and thatll be an end to the whole business But for now weve got those pumps in the what did your buddy call em Morlock holes Bill said with not a trace of a stutter neither he nor his father noticed Yeah Thats what the pumps in the Morlock holes are for anyway and they work pretty well except when theres too much rain and the streams overflow Because although the gravity drains and the sewers with the pumps were meant to be separate systems they actually crisscross all over the place See He drew a series of Xs radiating out from the line which represented the Kenduskeag and Bill nodded Well the only thing you need to know about water draining is that it will go wherever it can When it gets high it starts to fill up the drains as well as the sewers When the water in the drains gets high enough to reach those pumps it shorts them out Makes trouble for me because I have to fix them The main sewers are maybe six feet in diameter The secondaries from the residential areas are three or four I guess Some of them might be a little bigger And believe me when I tell you this Billy and you can tell your friends you never want to go into one of those pipes not in a game not on a dare not for any reason A dozen different town governments have built on them since or so During the Depression the WPA put in a whole secondary drain system and a tertiary sewer system there was lots of money for public works back then But the fellow who bossed those projects got killed in World War II and about five years later the Water Department found out that the system blueprints were mostly gone Thats about nine pounds of blues that just disappeared sometime between  and  My point is that nobody knows where all the damned sewers and drains go or why When they work nobody cares When they dont theres three or four sad sacks from Derry Water who have to try and find out which pump went flooey or where the plugup is And when they go down there they damn well pack a lunch Its dark and its smelly and there are rats Those are all good reasons to stay out but the best reason is that you could get lost Its happened before Lost under Derry Lost in the sewers Lost in the dark There was something so dismal and chilling about the idea that Bill was momentarily silenced Then he said But havent they ever suhsuhhent people down to map I ought to finish these dowels Zack said abruptly turning his back and pulling away Go on in and see whats on TV Go on Bill Zack said and Bill could feel the coldness again That coldness made suppers a kind of torture as his father leafed through electrical journals he hoped for a promotion the following year as his mother read one of her endless British mysteries Marsh Sayers Innes Allingham Eating in that coldness robbed food of its taste it was like eating frozen dinners that had never seen the inside of an oven Sometimes after he would go up to his room and lie on his bed holding his griping stomach and think He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts He thought of that more and more since Georgie had died although his mother had taught him the phrase two years before It had taken on a talismanic cast in his mind the day he could walk up to his mother and simply speak that phrase without tripping or stuttering looking her right in the eye as he spoke it the coldness would break apart her eyes would light up and she would hug him and say Wonderful Billy What a good boy What a good boy He had of course told this to no one Wild horses would not have dragged it from him neither the rack nor the boot would have induced him to give up this secret fantasy which lay at the very center of his heart If he could say this phrase which she had taught him casually one Saturday morning as he and Georgie sat watching Guy Madison and Andy Devine in The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok it would be like the kiss that awakened Sleeping Beauty from her cold dreams to the warmer world of the fairytale princes love He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts Nor did he tell it to his friends on that July rdbut he told them what his father had told him about the Derry sewer and drain systems He was a boy to whom invention came easily and naturally sometimes more easily than telling the truth and the scene he painted was quite different from the scene in which the conversation had actually taken place he and his old man had been watching the tube together he said having cups of coffee Wow Eddie said My mother would never let me have a coffee She says the caffeine in it is dangerous He paused she drinks quite a bit of it herself though My dad lets me have coffee if I want it Beverly said but hed kill me if he knew I smoked What makes you so sure its in the sewers Richie asked looking from Bill to Stan Uris and then back to Bill again EEEverything ggoes back tto thththat Bill said The vvoices Behheheverly heard ccame from the dddrain And the bluhblood When the ccclown chchased us those oorange buhbuhbuttons were by a suhsewer And Juh juhGeorge It wasnt a clown Big Bill Richie said I told you that I know its crazy but it was a werewolf He looked at the others defensively Honest to God I saw it Bill said dDont you sssee It was a wuhwuhwere wolf for yyou because yyou saw that duhhumb movie at the AAAAladdin I went to the lllibrary and llooked it uhuhup Bill said I think Its a gluhgluhhe paused throat straining and spat it outa glamour GGGlamour Bill said and spelled it He told them about an encyclopedia entry on the subject and a chapter he had read in a book called Nights Truth Glamour he said was the Gaelic name for the creature which was haunting Derry other races and other cultures at other times had different words for it but they all meant the same thing The Plains Indians called it a manitou which sometimes took the shape of a mountainlion or an elk or an eagle These same Indians believed that the spirit of a manitou could sometimes enter them and at these times it was possible for them to shape the clouds themselves into representations of those animals for which their houses had been named The Himalayans called it a tallus or taelus which meant an evil magic being that could read your mind and then assume the shape of the thing you were most afraid of In Central Europe it had been called eylak brother of the vurderlak or vampire In France it was le loupgarou or skinchanger a concept that had been crudely translated as the werewolf but Bill told them le loupgarou which he pronounced le loopgaroo could be anything anything at all a wolf a hawk a sheep even a bug Did any of those articles tell you how to beat a glamour Beverly asked Bill nodded but he didnt look hopeful The HHHimalayans had a rihhihitual to gget rihrid of iiit but ihits pretty gruhgruhgruesome They looked at him not wanting to hear but needing to IIIt was cuhcalled the RRRitual of ChuhChud Bill said and went on to explain what that was If you were a Himalayan holyman you tracked the taelus The taelus stuck its tongue out You stuck yours out You and it overlapped tongues and then you both bit in all the way so you were sort of stapled together eye to eye Oh I think Im gonna puke Beverly said rolling over on the dirt Ben patted her back tentatively then looked around to see if he had been observed He hadnt been the others were looking at Bill mesmerized WWWell Bill said this sounds cuhcuhcrazy bbut the book ssaid that ththen yyou started telling juh jokes and rihriddles Bill nodded his face that of a correspondent who wants you to knowwithout coining right out and saying itthat he doesnt make the news but only

around her shins I dont see how people could talk with their tongues you know nailed together Richie immediately ran out his tongue gripped it with his fingers and intoned My father works in a

a thing like that would come from Ben asked Do you believe any of it Stan asked sounding as if he wanted to scoff but could not quite find the moral or mental force to do so Bill shrugged and said I aaalmost ddo He seemed about to say more then shook his head and remained silent It explains a lot Eddie said slowly The clown the leper the werewolf He lookedover at Stan The dead boys too I guess This sounds like a job for Richard Tozier Richie said in the MovieTone Newsreel Announcers Voice Man of a thousand jokes and six thousand riddles If we sent you to do it wed all get killed Ben said slowly In great pain At this they all laughed again So what do we do about it Stan demanded and once again Bill could only shake his head and feel he almost knew Stan stood up Lets go somewhere else he said Im getting fanny fatigue I like it here Beverly said Its shady and nice She glanced at Stan I suppose you want to do something babyish like going down to the dump and breaking bottles with rocks I like breaking bottles with rocks Richie said standing up beside Stan Its the jd in me baby He flipped up his collar and began to stalk around like James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause They hurt me he said looking moody and scratching his chest You know like wow My parents School SoSYety Everyone Its pressure baby Its Ive got some firecrackers Stan said and they forgot all about glamours manitous and Richies bad James Dean imitation as Stan produced a package of Black Cats from his hip pocket Even Bill was impressed From this fat kid that I go to synagogue with sometimes Stan said I traded a bunch of Superman and Little Lulu funnybooks for em Lets shoot em off Richie cried nearly apoplectic in his joy Lets go shoot em off Stanny I wont tell any more guys you and your dad killed Christ I promise what do you say Ill tell em your nose is small Stanny Ill tell em youre not circumcised At this Beverly began to shriek with laughter and actually appeared to be approaching apoplexy before covering her face with her hands Bill began to laugh Eddie began to laugh and after a moment even Stan joined in The sound of it drifted across the broad shallow expanse of the Kenduskeag on that day before July th a summersound as bright as the sunrays darting off the water and none of them saw the orange eyes staring at them from a tangle of brambles and sterile blackberry bushes to their left This brambly patch scrubbed the entire bank for thirty feet and in the center of it was one of Bens Morlock holes It was from this raised concrete pipe that the eyes each more than two feet across stared The reason Mike ran afoul of Henry Bowers and his notsomerry band on that same day was because the next day was the Glorious Fourth The Church School had a band in which Mike played the trombone On the Fourth the band would march in the annual holiday parade playing The Battle Hymn of the Republic Onward Christian Soldiers and America the Beautiful This was an occasion that Mike had been looking forward to for over a month He walked to the final rehearsal because his bike had a busted chain The rehearsal was not scheduled until twothirty but he left at one because he wanted to polish his trombone which was stored in the schools music room until it glowed Although his tromboneplaying was really not much better than Richies Voices he was fond of the instrument and whenever he felt blue a half an hour of foghorning Sousa marches hymns or patriotic airs cheered hun right up again There was a can of Saddlers brass polish in one of the flap pockets of his khaki shirt and two or three clean rags were dangling from the hip pocket of his jeans The thought of Henry Bowers was the furthest thing from his mind A glance behind as he approached Neibolt Street and the Church School would have changed his mind in a hurry because Henry Victor Belch Peter Gordon and Moose Sadler were spread across the road behind him If they had left the Bowers house five minutes later Mike would have been out of sight over the crest of the next hill the apocalyptic rockfight and everything that followed it might have happened differently or not at all But it was Mike himself years later who advanced the idea that perhaps none of them were entirely their own masters in the events of that summer that if luck and free will had played parts then their roles had been narrow ones He would point out a number of these suspicious coincidences to the others at their reunion lunch but there was at least one of which he was unaware The meeting in the Barrens that day broke up when Stan Uris produced the Black Cats and the Losers Club headed toward the dump to shoot them off And Victor Belch and the others had come out to the Bowers farm because Henry had firecrackers cherrybombs and Ms the possession of these last would a few years hence become a felony The big boys were planning to go down beyond the trainyard coalpit and explode Henrys treasures None of them not even Belch went out to the Bowers farm under ordinary circumstancesprimarily because of Henrys crazy father but also because they always ended up helping Henry do his chores the weeding the endless rockpicking the lugging of wood the toting of water the pitching of hay the picking of whatever happened to be ripe at the time of the seasonpeas cukes tomatoes potatoes These boys were not exactly allergic to work but they had plenty to do at their own places without sweating for Henrys kooky father who didnt much care who he hit he had once taken a length of stovewood to Victor Criss when the boy dropped a basket of tomatoes he was lugging out to the roadside stand Getting whopped with a chunk of birch was bad enough what made it worse was that Butch Bowers had chanted Im gonna kill all the Nips Im gonna kill all the fuckin Nips when he did it Dumb as he was Belch Huggins had expressed it best I dont fuck with crazy people he told Victor one day two years before Victor had laughed and agreed But the sirensong of all those firecrackers had been too great to be withstood Tell you what Henry Victor said when Henry called him up that morning at nine and invited him out Ill meet you at the coalpit around one oclock what do you say You show up at the coalpit around one and Im not gonna be there Henry replied I got too many chores If you show up at the coalpit around three I will be there And the first M is going to go right up your old tan track Vie Vie hesitated then agreed to come over and help with the chores The others came as well and with the five of them all big boys working like fiends around the Bowers place they got all the chores finished by early afternoon When Henry asked his father if he could go Bowers the elder simply waved a languid hand at his son Butch was settled in for the afternoon on the back porch a quart milkbottle filled with exquisitely hard cider by his rocker his Philco portable radio on the porch rail later that afternoon the Red Sox would be playing the Washington Senators a prospect that would have given a man who was not crazy a bad case of cold chills An unsheathed Japanese sword lay across Butchs lap a war souvenir which Butch said he had taken off the body of a dying Nip on the island of Tarawa he had actually traded six bottles of Budweiser and three joysticks for the sword in Honolulu Lately Butch almost always got out his sword when he drank And since all of the boys including Henry himself were secretly convinced that sooner or later he would use it on someone it was best to be far away when it made its appearance on Butchs lap The boys had no more than stepped out into the road when Henry spied Mike Hanlon up ahead Its the nigger he said his eyes lighting up like the eyes of a small child contemplating Santa Clauss imminent arrival on Christmas Eve The nigger Belch Huggins looked puzzledhe had seen the Hanlons only rarelyand then his dim eyes lit up Oh yeah The nigger Lets get him Henry Belch broke into a thunderous trot The others were following suit when Henry grabbed Belch and hauled him back Henry had more experience than the others chasing Mike Hanlon and he knew that catching him was easier said than done That black boy could move He dont see us Lets just walk fast till he does Cut the distance They did so An observer might have been amused the five of them looked as if they were trying out for that peculiar Olympic walking competition Moose Sadlers considerable belly joggled up and down inside his Derry High School teeshirt Sweat rolled down Belchs face which soon grew red But the distance between them and Mike closedtwo hundred yards a hundred and fifty yards a hundredand so far Little Black Sambo hadnt looked back They could hear him whistling What you gonna do to him Henry Victor Criss asked in a low voice He sounded merely interested but in truth he was worried Just lately Henry had begun to worry him more and more He wouldnt care if Henry wanted them to beat the Hanlon kid up maybe even rip his shut off or throw his pants and underwear up in a tree but he was not sure that was all Henry had in mind This year there had been several unpleasant encounters with the children from Derry Elementary Henry referred to as the little shits Henry was used to dominating and terrorizing the little shits but since March he had been balked by them time and time again Henry and his friends had chased one of them the foureyes Tozier kid into Freeses and had lost him somehow just when it seemed his ass was surely theirs Then on the last day of school the Hanscom kid What worried him simply was this Henry might go TOO FAR Just what TOO FAR might be was something Victor didnt like to think of but his uneasy heart had prompted the question just the same Were gonna catch him and take him down to that coalpit Henry said I thought wed put a couple of firecrackers in his shoes and see if he dances If Henry intended something like that Victor was going to take a powder An M in each shoe would blow that niggers feet off and that was much TOO FAR Ive got only four of those Henry said not taking his eyes off Mike Hanlons back They had closed the distance to seventyfive yards now and he also spoke in a low voice You think Id waste two of em on a fuckin nightfighter Well just put a couple of Black Cats in his loafers Henry said then strip him bareass and throw his clothes down into the Barrens Maybe hell catch poison ivy going after them We gotta roll im in the coal too Belch said his formerly dim eyes now glowing brightly Okay Henry Is that cool Cool as a moose Henry said in a casual way Victor didnt quite like Well roll im in the coal just like I rolled im in the mud that other time And Henry grinned showing teeth that were already beginning to rot at the age of twelve And I got something to tell him I dont think he heard when I told im before Whats that Henry Peter asked Peter Gordon was merely interested and excited He came from one of Berrys good families he lived on West Broadway and in two years he would be sent to prep school in Grotonor so he believed on that July rd He was brighter than Vie Criss but had not hung around long enough to understand how Henry was eroding Youll find out Henry said Now shut up Were gettin close They were twentyfive yards behind Mike and Henry was just opening his mouth to give the order to charge when Moose Sadler set off the first firecracker of the day Moose had eaten three plates of baked beans the night before and the fart was almost as loud as a shotgun blast Mike froze for a moment then he took off running for his life The Losers wound their way through the bamboo in the Barrens in this order Bill Richie Beverly behind Richie walking slim and pretty in bluejeans and a white sleeveless blouse zoris on her feet then Ben trying not to puff too loudly although it was eightyone that day he was wearing one of his baggy sweatshirts Stan Eddie bringing up the rear the snout of his aspirator poking out of his right front pants pocket Bill had fallen into a junglesafari fantasy as he often did when walking through this part of the Barrens The bamboo was high and white limiting visibility to the path they had made through here The earth was black and squelchy with sodden patches that had to be avoided or jumped over if you didnt want to get mud in your shoes The puddles of standing water had oddly flat rainbow colors The air had a reeky smell that was half the dump and half rotting vegetation Bill halted one turn away from the Kenduskeag and turned back to Richie TTTiger up ahead TTTozier Maneating tiger Ben muttered to Stan and he passed the news back to Eddie whose thin face was hectic with excitement They faded into the bamboo leaving the path of black earth that looped through it magically bare The tiger passed in front of them and all of them nearly saw it heavy perhaps four hundred pounds its muscles moving with grace and power beneath the silk of its striped pelt They nearly saw its green eyes and the flecks of blood around its snout from the last batch of pygmy warriors it had eaten alive The bamboo rattled faintly a noise both musical and eerie and then was still again It might have been a breath of summer breeze or it might have been the passage of an African tiger on its way toward the Old Cape side of the Barrens Gone Bill said He let out a pentup breath and stepped out onto the path again The others followed suit Richie was the only one who had come armed he produced a cappistol with a frictiontaped handgrip I could have had a clear shot at him if youd moved Big Bill he said grimly He pushed the bridge of his old glasses up on his nose with the muzzle of the gun Theres WuhWuhWatusis around hhhere Bill said CCCant rihrisk a shot YYou wwant them down on tttop of us Bill made a comeon gesture with his arm and they were back on the path again which narrowed into a neck at the end of the bamboo patch They stepped out onto the bank of the Kenduskeag where a series of steppingstones led across the river Ben had shown them how to place them You got a big rock and plopped it in the water then you got a second and plopped it in the water while you were stepping on the first then you got a third and plopped it in the water while you were stepping on the second and so on until you were all the way across the river which here and at this time of year was less than a foot deep and shaled with tawny sandbars with your feet still dry The trick was so simple it was damn near babyish but none of them had seen it until Ben pointed it out He was good at stuff like that but when he showed you he never made you feel like a dummy They went down the bank in single file and started across the dry backs of the rocks they had planted He froze at once not looking back arms held out The water chuckled and rilled around him What Theres piranha fish in here I saw them eat a whole cow two days ago A minute after it fell in there was nothing but bones Dont fall off They teetered their way across the rocks A freighttrain charged by on the railway embankment as Eddie Kaspbrak neared the halfway point and the sudden blast of its airhorn caused him to jiggle on the edge of balance He looked into the bright water and for one moment between the sunnxx ashes that darted arrows of light into his eyes he actually saw the cruising piranhas They were not part of the makebelieve that went with Bills jungle safari fantasy he was quite sure of that The fish he saw looked like oversized goldfish with the great ugly jaws of catfish or groupers Sawteeth protruded between their thick lips and like goldfish they were orange As orange as the fluffy pompoms you sometimes saw on the suits the clowns wore at the circus Eddie pin wheeled his arms Im going in he thought Im going in and theyll eat me alive Then Stanley Uris gripped his wrist firmly and brought him back to dead center Close call Stan said If you fell in your motherd give you heck Thoughts of his mother were for once the furthest things from Eddies mind The others had gained the far bank now and were counting cars on the freight Eddie stared wildly into Stans eyes then looked into the water again He saw a potatochip bag go dancing by but that was all He looked up at Stan again Eddie shook his head Nothing I guess he said Im just a little but they were there yes they were and they would have eaten me alive This western bank of the Kenduskeagthe Old Cape bankwas a quagmire of mud during rainy weather and the spring runoff but there had been no heavy rain in Derry for two weeks or more and the bank had dried to an alien crackglaze from which several of those cement cylinders poked casting grim little shadows About twenty yards farther down a cement pipe jutted out over the Kenduskeag and spilled a steady thin stream of foullooking brown water into the river Bill led them up the dry bank and back into the heavy shrubbery where bugs whirred and chiggers chigged Every now and then there would be a heavy ruffle of wings as a bird took off Once a squirrel ran across their path and about five minutes later as they approached the low wrinkle of ridge that guarded the town dumps blind side a large rat with a bit of cellophane caught in its whiskers trundled in front of Bill passing along its own secret run through its own microcosmic wilderness The smell of the dump was now clear and pungent a black column of smoke rose in the sky The ground while still heavily overgrown except for their own narrow path began to be strewn with litter Bill had dubbed this dumpdandruff and Richie had been delighted he had laughed almost until he cried You ought to write that down Big Bill he said Thats really good Papers caught on branches wavered and flapped like cutrate pennants here was a silver gleam of summer sun reflected from a clutch of tin cans lying at the bottom of a green and tangled hollow there the hotter reflection of sunrays bouncing off a broken beer bottle Beverly spied a babydoll its plastic skin so brightly pink it looked almost boiled She picked it up then dropped it with a little cry as she saw the whitishgray beetles squirming from beneath its moldy skirt and down its rotting legs She rubbed her fingers on her jeans They climbed to the top of the ridge and looked down into the dump Oh shit Bill said and jammed his hands into his pockets as the others gathered around him They were burning the northern end today but here at their end the dumpkeeper he was in fact Armando Fazio Mandy to his friends and the bachelor brother of the Derry Elementary School janitor was tinkering on the World War II D dozer he used to push the crap into piles for burning His shirt was off and the big portable radio sitting under the canvas parasol on the dozers seat was putting out the Red SoxSenators pregame festivities Cant go down there Ben agreed Mandy Fazio was not a bad guy but when he saw kids in the dump he ran them off at oncebecause of the rats because of the poison he regularly sowed to keep the rat population down because of the potential for cuts falls and burns but mostly because he believed a dump was no place for children to be Aint you nice he would yell at the kids he spied who had been drawn to the dump with theirs to plink away at bottles or rats or seagulls or by the exotic fascination of dumppicking you might find a toy that still worked a chair that could be mended for a clubhouse or a junked TV with the picturetube still intactif you threw a rock through one of these there was a very satisfying explosion Aint you kids nice Mandy would bellow he bellowed not because he was angry but because he was deaf and wore no hearingaid dintchore folks teach you to be nice Nice boys and girls dont play in the dump Go to the park Go to the liberry Go down to Community House and play boxhockey Be nice They all sat down for a few moments to watch Mandy work on his dozer hoping he would give up and go away but not really believing he would the presence of the radio suggested Mandy intended to stay all afternoon It was enough to piss off the Pope Bill thought There was really no better place to come with firecrackers than the dump You could put them under tin cans and then watch the cans fly into the air when the firecrackers went off or you could light the fuses and drop them into bottles and then run like hell The bottles didnt always break but usually they did Wish we had some Ms Richie sighed unaware of how soon one would be chucked at his head My mother says people ought to be happy with what they have Eddie said so solemnly that they all laughed When the laughter died away they all looked toward Bill again Bill thought about it and then said I nuhknow a pplace Theres an old gruhgruhgravelpit at the end of the BunBarrens by the tttrainyards Yeah Stan said getting to his feet I know that place Youre a genius Bill The six of them one shy of the magic number walked along the brow of the hill which circled the dump Mandy Fazio glanced up once and saw them silhouetted against the blue sky like Indians out on a raiding party He thought about hollering at themthe Barrens was no place for kidsand then he turned back to his work instead At least they werent in his dump Mike Hanlon ran past the Church School without pausing and pelted straight up Neibolt Street toward the Derry trainyards There was a janitor at NCS but Mr Gendron was very old and even deafer than Mandy Fazio Also he liked to spend most of his summer days asleep in the basement by the summersilent boiler stretched out in a battered old reclining chair with the Derry News in his lap Mike would still be pounding on the door and shouting for the old man to let him in when Henry Bowers came up behind him and tore his freaking head off But not blindly he was trying to pace himself trying to control his breathing not yet going all out Henry Belch and Moose Sadler presented no problems even relatively fresh they ran like wounded buffalo Victor Criss and Peter Gordon however were much faster As Mike passed the house where Bill and Richie had seen the clownor the werewolfhe snapped a glance back and was alarmed to see that Peter Gordon had almost closed the distance Peter was grinning cheerfullya steeplechase grin a fullout polo grin a pippipjollygoodshow grin and Mike thought I wonder if hed grin that way if he knew whats going to happen if they catch me Does he think theyre just going to say Tag youre it and run away As the trainyard gate with its signPRIVATE PROPERTY KEEP OUT VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTEDloomed up Mike was forced to let himself out to the limit There was no painhis breathing was rapid yet still controlledbut he knew everything was going to start hurting if he had to keep this pace up for long The gate was standing halfway open He snapped a second look back and saw that hed pulled away from Peter again Victor was perhaps ten paces behind Peter the others now forty or fifty yards back Even in that quick glance Mike could see the black anger on Henrys face He skittered through the opening whirled and slammed the gate closed He heard the click as it latched A moment later Peter Gordon slammed into the chainlink and a moment after that Victor Criss ran up beside him Peters smile was gone a sulky balked look had replaced it He grabbed for the latch but of course there was none the latch was on the inside Incredibly he said Come on kid open the gate Thats not fair Whats your idea of fair Mike asked panting Five against one Fairup Peter repeated as if he had not heard Mike at all Mike looked at Victor saw the troubled look in Victors eyes He started to speak but that was when the others pulled up to the gate Open up nigger Henry bawled He began to shake the chainlink with such ferocity that Peter looked at him startled Open up Open up right now Mike backed away from the gate his heart beating heavily in his chest He couldnt remember ever being quite this scared quite this upset They lined their side of the gate shouting at him calling him names for nigger he had never dreamed existednightfighter Ubangi spade blackberry junglebunny others He was barely aware that Henry was taking something from his pocket that he had popped a wooden match alight with his thumbnailand then a round red something came over the fence and he flinched instinctively away as the cherrybomb exploded to his left kicking up dust The bang silenced them all for a momentMike stared unbelievingly at them through the fence and they stared back Peter Gordon looked utterly shocked and even Belch looked stunned Theyre ascared of him now Mike thought suddenly and a new voice spoke inside of him perhaps for the first time a voice that was disturbingly adult Theyre ascared but that wont stop them You got to get away Mikey or somethings going to happen Not all of them will want it to happen maybenot Victor and maybe not Peter Gordonbut it will happen anyway because Henry will make it happen So get away Get away fast He backed up another two or three steps and then Henry Bowers said I was the one killed your dog nigger Mike froze feeling as if he had been hit in the belly with a bowling ball He stared into Henry Bowerss eyes and understood that Henry was telling the simple truth he had killed Mr Chips That moment of understanding seemed nearly eternal to Mikelooking into Henrys crazed sweatringed eyes and his rageblackened face it seemed to him that he understood a great many things for the first time and the fact that Henry was far crazier than Mike had ever dreamed was only the least of them He realized above all that the world was not kind and it was more this than the news itself that forced the cry from him You honky chickenshit bastard Henry uttered a shriek of rage and attacked the fence monkeying his way toward the top with a brute strength that was terrifying Mike paused a moment longer wanting to see if that adult voice that had spoken inside had been a true voice and yes it had been true after the slightest hesitation the others spread out and also began to climb Mike turned and ran again sprinting across the trainyards his shadow trailing squat at his feet The freight which the Losers had seen crossing the Barrens was long gone now and there was no sound but Mikes own breathing in his ears and the musical jingle of chainlink as Henry and the others climbed the fence Mike ran across one triple set of tracks his sneakers kicking back cinders as he ran across the space between He stumbled crossing the second set of tracks and felt pain flare briefly in his ankle He got up and ran on again He heard a thud as Henry jumped down from the top of the fence behind him Here I come for your ass nigger Henry bawled Mikes reasoning self had decided that the Barrens were his only chance now If he could get down there he could hide in the tangles of underbrush in the bamboo or if things became really desperate he could climb into one of the drainpipes and wait it out He could do those things maybe but there was a hot spark of fury in his chest that had nothing to do with his reasoning self He could understand Henry chasing after him when he got the chance but Mr Chips killing Mr Chips My DOG wasnt a nigger you cheapshit bastard Mike thought as he ran and the bewildered anger grew Now he heard another voice this one his fathers I dont want you to make a career out of running away and what it all comes down to is that you have to be careful where you take your stand You have to ask yourself if Henry Bowers is worth the trouble Mike had been running a straight line across the trainyards toward the storage quonsets Beyond them another chainlink fence divided the trainyards from the Barrens He had been planning to scale that fence and jump over to the other side Instead he veered hard right toward the gravelpit This gravelpit had been used as a coalpit until or soit had been a  stokingpoint for the trains which ran through the Derry yards Then the diesels came and the electrics For a number of years after the coal was gone much of the remainder stolen by people with coalfired furnaces a local contractor had dug gravel there but he went bust in  and since then the pit had been deserted A spur railroad line still ran in a loop up to the pit and then back toward the switchingyards but the tracks were dull with rust and ragweed grew up between the rotting ties These same weeds grew in the pit itself vying for space with goldenrod and nodding sunflowers Amid the vegetation there was still plenty of slag coalthe stuff people had once called clinkers As Mike ran toward this place he took his shirt off He reached the run of the pit and looked back Henry was coming across the tracks his buddies spread out around him That was okay maybe Moving as quickly as he could using his shirt for a bindle Mike picked up half a dozen handfuls of hard clinkers Then he ran back toward the fence swinging his shirt by the arms Instead of climbing the fence when he reached it he turned so his back was against it He dumped the coal out of his shirt stooped and picked up a couple of chunks Henry didnt see the coal he only saw that he had the nigger trapped against the fence He sprinted toward him yelling This is for my dog you bastard Mike cried unaware that he had begun to cry He threw one of the chunks of coal overhand It flew in a hard direct line It struck Henrys forehead with a loud bonk and then rebounded into the air Henry stumbled to his knees His hands went to his head Blood seeped through his fingers at once like a magicians surprise The others skidded to a stop their faces stamped with identical expressions of disbelief Henry uttered a high scream of pain and got to his feet again still holding his head Mike threw another chunk of coal Henry ducked He began to walk toward Mike and when Mike threw a third chunk of coal Henry removed one hand from his gashed forehead and batted the chunk of coal almost casually aside He was grinning Oh youre gonna get such a surprise he said such aOH MY GAWD Henry tried to say more but only inarticulate gargling noises emerged from his mouth Mike had pegged another chunk of coal and this one had struck Henry square in the throat Henry buckled to his knees again Peter Gordon gaped Moose Sadlers brow was furrowed as if he were trying to figure out a difficult math problem What are you guys waiting for Henry managed Blood seeped between his fingers His voice sounded rusty and foreign Get him Get the little cocksucker Mike didnt wait to see if they would obey or not He dropped his shirt and leaped at the fence He began to pull himself up toward the top and then he felt rough hands grab his foot He looked down and saw Henry Bowerss contorted face smeared by blood and coal Mike yanked his foot up His sneaker came off in Henrys hand He pistoned his bare foot down into Henrys face and heard something crunch Henry screamed again and staggered backward now holding his spouting nose Another handBelch Hugginsssnagged briefly in the cuff of Mikes leans but he was able to pull free He threw one leg over the top of the fence and then something struck him with blinding force on the side of his face Warmth trickled down his cheek Something else struck his hip his forearm his upper thigh They were throwing his own ammunition at him He hung briefly by his hands and then dropped rolling over twice The scrubby ground sloped downward here and perhaps that saved Mike Hanlons eyesight or even his life Henry had approached the fence again and now looped one of his four Ms over the top of the fence It went off with a terrific CRRRACK that echoed and blew a wide bare patch in the grass Mike his ears ringing went headoverheels and staggered to his feet He was now in high grass on the edge of the Barrens He wiped a hand down his right cheek and it came away bloody The blood did not particularly worry him he had not expected to come out of this unscathed Henry tossed a cherrybomb but Mike saw this one coming and moved away easily Lets get him Henry roared and began to climb the fence Jeez Henry I dont know This had gone too far for Peter Gordon who had never encountered a situation that had turned so suddenly savage Things were not supposed to get bloodyat least not for your teamwhen the odds were comfortably slugged in your favor You better know Henry said looking back at Peter from halfway up the fence He hung there like a bloated poisonous spider in human shape His baleful eyes stared at Peter blood rimmed them on either side Mikes downward kick had broken his nose although Henry would not be aware of the fact for some time yet You better know or Ill come after you you fucking jerk The others began to climb the fence Peter and Victor with some reluctance Belch and Moose as vacantly eager as before Mike waited to see no more He turned and ran into the scrub Henry bellowed after him Ill find you nigger Ill find you The Losers had reached the far side of the gravelpit which was little more than a huge weedy pockmark in the earth now three years after the last load of gravel had been taken out of it They were all gathered around Stan looking appreciatively at his package of Black Cats when the first explosion came Eddie jumpedhe was still goofed up over the piranha fish he thought he had seen he wasnt sure what real piranha fish looked like but he was pretty sure they didnt look like oversized goldfish with teeth Merrow down easy Eddiesan Richie said doing his Chinese Coolie Voice Iss just other kids shooting off fireclackers I keep trying Big Bill Richie said I feel like if I get good enough someday Ill earn your love He made dainty kissing gestures at the air Bill shot him the finger Ben and Eddie stood side by side grinning Oh Im so young and youre so old Stan Uris piped up suddenly doing an eerily accurate Paul Anka imitation this my darling Ive been told He can sayng Richie screeched in his Pickaninny Voice Lawksamussy thisyere boy can sayng And then in the MovieTone Announcers Voice Want you to sign right here boy on this dotted line Richie slung an arm around Stans shoulders and favored him with a gigantic gleaming smile Were going to grow your hair out boy Going to give you a gittar Going to Bill popped Richie twice on the arm quickly and lightly They were all excited at the prospect of shooting off firecrackers They gathered around again as Stan carefully opened the package of firecrackers There were exotic Chinese letters on the black label and a sober caution in English that got Richie giggling again do not hold in hand after fuse is lit this warning read Good thing they told me Richie said I always used to hold them after I lit them I thought thats how you got rid of your frockin hangnails Working slowly almost reverently Stan removed the red cellophane and laid the block of cardboard tubes blue and red and green on the palm of his hand Their fuses had been braided together in a Chinese pigtail Ill unwind the Stan began and then there was a much louder explosion The echo rolled slowly across the Barrens A cloud of gulls rose from the eastern side of the dump squalling and crying They all jumped this time Stan dropped the firecrackers and had to pick them up Was that dynamite Beverly asked nervously She was looking at Bill whose head was up his eyes wide She thought he had never looked so handsomebut there was something too alert too strungup in the attitude of his head He was like a deer scenting fire in the air That was an M I think Ben said quietly Last Fourth of July I was in the park and there were these highschool kids that had a couple They put one of them in a steel trashcan It made a noise like that Did it blow a hole in the can Haystack Richie asked No but it bulged out the side Looked like there was some little guy inside who just stroked it one They ran away The big one was closer Eddie said He also glanced at Bill Do you guys want to shoot these off or not Stan asked He had unbraided about a dozen of the firecrackers and had put the rest neatly back in the waxed paper for later They looked at Bill questioningly a little scaredit was his abrupt tone more than what he had said PPPuhhut them aaaaway Bill repeated his face contorting with the effort he was making to get the words out Spit flew from his lips sSSuhhomethings gggonna hhhappen Eddie licked his lips Richie shoved his glasses up the sweaty slope of his nose with his thumb and Ben moved closer to Beverly without even thinking about it Stan opened his mouth to say something and then there was another smaller explosionanother cherrybomb RuhRuhRocks AAAmmo Bill began to pick up stones stuffing them into his pockets until they bulged The others stared at him as though he had gone crazy and then Eddie felt sweat break on his forehead All of a sudden he knew what a malaria attack felt like He had sensed something like this on the day he and Bill had met Ben except Eddie like the others was already coming to think of Ben as Haystack the day Henry Bowers had casually bloodied his nosebut this felt worse This felt like maybe it was going to be Hiroshima time in the Barrens Ben started to get rocks then Richie moving quickly not talking now His glasses slipped all the way off and clicked to the gravelly surface of the ground He folded them up absently and put them inside his shirt Why did you do that Richie Beverly asked Her voice sounded thin too taut Dont know keed Richie said and went on picking up rocks Beverly maybe you better uh go back toward the dump for awhile Ben said His hands were full of rocks Shit on that she said shit all over that Ben Hanscom She bent and began to gather rocks herself Stan looked at them thoughtfully as they grubbed for rocks like lunatic farmers Then he began to gather them himself his lips pressed into a thin and prissy line Eddie felt the familiar tightening sensation as his throat began to close up to a pinhole Not this time dammit he thought suddenly Not if my friends need me Like Bev said shit all over that Henry Bowers had gotten too big too fast to be either quick or agile under ordinary circumstances but these circumstances were not ordinary He was in a frenzy of pain and rage and these lent him an ephemeral unthinking physical genius Conscious thought was gone his mind felt the way a latesummer grassfire looks as dusk comes on all rosered and smokegray He took after Mike Hanlon like a bull after a red flag Mike was following a rudimentary path along the side of the big pit a path which would eventually lead to the dump but Henry was too far gone to bother with such niceties as paths he slammed through the bushes and the brambles on a straight line feeling neither the tiny cuts inflicted by the thorns nor the slaps of limber bushes striking his face neck and arms The only thing that mattered was the niggers kinky head drawing closer Henry had one of the Ms in his right hand and a wooden match in his left When he caught the nigger he was going to strike the match light the fuse and stuff that ashcan right down the front of his pants Mike knew that Henry was gaining and the others were close on his heels He tried to push himself faster He was badly scared now keeping panic at bay only by a grim effort of will He had turned his ankle more seriously crossing the tracks than he had thought at first and now he was limpskipping along The crackle and crash of Henrys goforbroke progress behind him called up unpleasant images of being chased by a killer dog or a rogue bear The path opened out just ahead and Mike more fell than ran into the gravelpit He rolled to the bottom got to his feet and was halfway across before he realized that there were kids there six of them They were spread out in a straight line and there was a funny look on their faces It wasnt until later when hed had a chance to sort out his thoughts that he realized what was so odd about that look it was as if they had been expecting him Help Mike managed as he limped toward them He spoke instinctively to the tall boy with the red hair Kids big kids That was when Henry burst into the gravelpit He saw the six of them and came to a skidding halt For a moment his face was marked with uncertainty and he looked back over his shoulder He saw his troops and when Henry looked back at the Losers Mike was now standing beside and slightly behind Bill Denbrough panting rapidly he was grinning I know you kid he said speaking to Bill He glanced at Richie I know you too Wheres your glasses foureyes And before Richie could reply Henry saw Ben Well son of a bitch The Jew and the fatboy are here too That your girlfriend fatboy Just then Peter Gordon pulled up beside Henry Victor arrived and stood on Henrys other side Belch and Moose Sadler arrived last They flanked Peter and Victor and now the two opposing groups stood facing each other in neat almost formal lines Panting heavily as he spoke and still sounding more than a little like a human bull Henry said I got bones to pick with a lot of you but I can let that go for today I want that nigger So you little shits buzz off He killed my dog Mike cried out his voice shrill and breaking He said so You come on over here right now Henry said and maybe I wont kill you Speaking softly and clearly Bill said The BBarrens are ours You kkkids get out of hhere Henrys eyes widened It was as if hed been slapped unexpectedly UhUhUs Bill said Were through tttaking your shit BBBowers Get owowout You stuttering freak Henry said He lowered his head and charged Bill had a handful of rocks all of them had a handful except Mike and Beverly who was only holding one Bill began to throw at Henry not hurrying his throws but chucking hard and with fair accuracy The first rock missed the second struck Henry on the shoulder If the third had missed Henry might have closed with Bill and wrestled him to the ground but it didnt miss it struck Henrys lowered head Henry cried out in surprised pain looked up and was hit four more times a little billetdoux from Richie Tozier on the chest one from Eddie that ricocheted off his shoulderblade one from Stan Uris that struck his shin and Beverlys one rock which hit him in the belly He looked at them unbelievingly and suddenly the air was full of whizzing missiles Henry fell back that same bewildered pained expression on his face Come on you guys he shouted Help me Chchcharge them Bill said in a low voice and not waiting to see if they would or not he ran forward They came with him firing rocks not only at Henry now but at all the others The big boys were grubbing on the ground for ammunition of their own but before they could gather much they had been peppered Peter Gordon screamed as a rock thrown by Ben glanced off his cheekbone and drew blood He backed up a few steps paused threw a hesitant rock or two back and then fled He had had enough things were not done this way on West Broadway Henry grabbed up a handful of rocks in a savage sweeping gesture Most of them fortunately for the Losers were pebbles He threw one of the larger ones at Beverly and it cut her arm She cried out Bellowing Ben ran for Henry Bowers who looked around in time to see him coming but not in time to sidestep Henry was offbalance Ben was one hundred and fifty trying for onesixty the result was no contest Henry did not go sprawling but flying He landed on his back and skidded Ben ran toward him again and was only vaguely aware of a warm blooming pain in his ear as Belch Huggins nailed him with a rock roughly the size of a golf ball Henry was getting groggily to his knees as Ben reached him and kicked him hard his sneakered foot connecting solidly with Henrys left hip Henry rolled over heavily on his back His eyes blazed up at Ben You aint supposed to throw rocks at girls Ben shouted He could not remember ever in his life feeling so outraged You aint Then he saw a flame in Henrys hand as Henry popped the wooden match alight He touched it to the thick fuse of the M which he then threw at Bens face Acting with no thought at all Ben struck the ashcan with the palm of his hand swinging at it as one would swing a racket at a badminton birdie The M went back down Henry saw it coming His eyes widened and then he rolled away screaming The ashcan exploded a splitsecond later blackening the back of Henrys shirt and tearing some of it away A moment later Ben was hit by Moose Sadler and driven to his knees His teeth clicked together over his tongue drawing blood He blinked around dazed Moose was coming toward him but before he could reach the place where Ben was kneeling Bill came up behind him and began pelting the big kid with rocks Moose wheeled around bellowing You hit me from behind yellowbelly Moose screamed You fuckin dirtyfighter He gathered himself to charge but Richie joined Bill and also began to fire rocks at Moose Richie was unimpressed with Mooses rhetoric on the subject of what might or might not constitute yellowbelly behavior he had seen the five of them chasing one scared kid and he didnt think that exactly put them up there with King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table One of Richies missiles split the skin above Mooses left eyebrow Moose howled Eddie and Stan Uris moved up to join Bill and Richie Beverly moved in with them her arm bleeding but her eyes wildly alight Rocks flew Belch Huggins screamed as one of them clipped his crazy bone He began to dance lumbersomely rubbing his elbow Henry got to his feet the back of his shirt hanging in rags the skin beneath almost miraculously unmarked Before he could turn around Ben Hanscom bounced a rock off the back of his head and drove him to his knees again It was Victor Criss who did the most damage to the Losers that day partly because he was a pretty fair fastball pitcher but mostlyparadoxicallybecause he was the least emotionally involved More and more he didnt want to be here People could get seriously hurt in rockfights a kid could get his skull split a mouthful of broken teeth could even lose an eye But since he was in it he was in it He intended to dish out some trouble That coolness had allowed him to take an extra thirty seconds and pick up a handful of goodsized rocks He threw one at Eddie as the Losers reformed their rough skirmish line and it struck Eddie on the chin He fell down crying the blood already starting to flow Ben turned toward him but Eddie was already getting up again the blood gruesomely bright against his pallid skin his eyes slitted Victor threw at Richie and the rock thudded off Richies chest Richie threw back but Vie ducked it easily and threw one sidearm at Bill Denbrough Bill snapped his head back but not quite quickly enough the rock cut his cheek Bill turned toward Victor Their eyes locked and Victor saw something in the stuttering kids gaze that scared the hell out of him Absurdly the words I take it back trembled behind his lips except that was nothing you said to a little kid Not if you didnt want your buddies to start ranking you to the dogs and back Bill started to walk toward Victor now and Victor began to walk toward Bill At the same moment as if by some telepathic signal they began to throw rocks at each other still closing the distance The righting flagged around them as the others turned to watch even Henry turned his head Victor ducked and bobbed but Bill made no such effort Victors rocks slammed him in the chest the shoulder the stomach One clipped by his ear Apparently unshaken by any of this Bill threw one rock after another pegging them with murderous force The third one struck Victors knee with a brittle chipping sound and Victor uttered a stifled groan He was out of ammunition Bill had one rock left It was smooth and white shot with quartz roughly the size and shape of a ducks egg To Victor Criss it looked very hard Bill was less than five feet away from him YYYou gget owout of hhhere now he said or Im ggoing to spuhpuhlit your hhead ooopen I mmean ihihit Looking into his eyes Victor saw that he really did Without another word he turned and headed back the way Peter Gordon had gone Belch and Moose Sadler were looking around uncertainly Blood trickled from the corner of the Sadler boys mouth and blood from a scalpwound was sheeting down the side of Belchs face Henrys mouth worked but no sound came out Bill turned toward Henry GGGet out he said What if I wont Henry was trying to sound tough but Bill could now see a different thing in Henrys eyes He was scared and he would go It should have made Bill feel goodtriumphant evenbut he only felt tired IIf you wwont Bill said wwwere ggoing to muhmove iin on yyou I think the sssix of uus can pput you in the huhhuhhospital Seven Mike Hanlon said and joined them He had a softballsized rock in each hand Just try me Bowers Id love to You fucking NIGGER Henrys voice broke and wavered on the edge of tears That voice took the last of the fight out of Belch and Moose they backed away their remaining rocks dropping from relaxing hands Belch looked around as if wondering exactly where he might be Shut up you cunt Henry said You Four rocks flew at once hitting Henry in four different places He screamed and scrambled backward over the weedraddled ground the tatters of his shirt flapping around him He looked from the grim oldyoung faces of the little kids to the frantic ones of Belch and Moose There was no help there no help at all Moose turned away embarrassed Henry got to his feet sobbing and snuffling through his broken nose Ill kill you all he said and suddenly ran for the path A moment later he was gone GGGo on Bill said speaking to Belch Get owout And ddont cccome down hhere anymore The BBBarrens are owowours Youre gonna wish you didnt cross Henry kid Belch said Come on Moose The seven of them stood in a loose semicircle all of them bleeding somewhere The apocalyptic rockfight had lasted less than four minutes but Bill felt as if he had fought his way through all of World War II both theaters without so much as a single timeout The silence was broken by Eddie Kaspbraks whooping whining struggle for air Ben went toward him felt the three Twinkies and four DingDongs he had eaten on his way down to the Barrens begin to struggle and churn in his stomach and ran past Eddie and into the bushes where he was sick as privately and quietly as he could be It was Richie and Bev who went to Eddie Beverly put an arm around the thin boys waist while Richie dug his aspirator out of his pocket Bite on this Eddie he said and Eddie took a hitching gasping breath as Richie pulled the trigger Ben came back out of the bushes blushing wiping a hand over his mouth Beverly went over to him and took both of his hands in hers Ben nodded looking at his dirty sneakers Any time keed he said One by one they turned to look at Mike Mike with his dark skin They looked at him carefully cautiously thoughtfully Mike had felt such curiosity beforethere had not been a time in his life when he had not felt itand he looked back candidly enough Bill looked from Mike to Richie Richie met his eyes And Bill seemed almost to hear the clicksome final part fitting neatly into a machine of unknown intent He felt icechips scatter up his back Were all together now he thought and the idea was so strong so right that for a moment he thought he might have spoken it aloud But of course there was no need to speak it aloud he could see it in Richies eyes in Bens in Eddies in Beverlys in Stans Were all together now he thought again Oh God help us Now it really starts Please God help us You want to shoot off some firecrackers Stan asked and Mikes grin was answer enough As it turns out Bill isnt the only one they all bring booze Bill has bourbon Beverly has vodka and a carton of orange juice Richie a sixpack Ben Hanscom a bottle of Wild Turkey Mike has a sixpack in the little refrigerator in the staff lounge Smiling nervously Eddie removes first a bottle of gin and then a bottle of prune juice In the thunderstruck silence which follows Richie says quietly somebody call for the men in the white coats Eddie Kaspbraks finally gone over the top Ginandprune juice happens to be very healthy Eddie replies defensively and then theyre all laughing wildly the sound of their mirth echoing and reechoing in the silent library rolling up and down the glassedin hall between the adult library and the Childrens Library You go headon Ben says wiping his streaming eyes You go headon Eddie I bet it really moves the mail too Smiling Eddie fills a paper cup threequarters full of prune juice and then soberly adds two capfuls of gin Oh Eddie I do love you Beverly says and Eddie looks up startled but smiling She gazes up and down the table I love all of you Yes Ben says We love you His eyes widen a little and he laughs I think we still all love each other Do you know how rare that must be Theres a moment of silence and Mike is really not surprised to see that Rickie is wearing his glasses My contacts started to burn and I had to take them out Richie says briefly when Mike asks Maybe we should get down to business They all look at Bill then as they had in the gravelpit and Mike thinks They look at Bill when they need a leader at Eddie when they need a navigator Get down to business what a hell of a phrase that is Do I tell them that the bodies of the children that were found back then and now werent sexually molested not even precisely mutilated but partially eaten Do I tell them Ive got seven miners helmets the kind with strong electric lights set into the front stored back at my house one of them for a guy named Stan Uris who couldnt make the scene as we used to say Or is it maybe enough just to tell them to go home and get a good nights sleep because it ends tomorrow or tomorrow night for goodeither for It or us None of those things have to be said perhaps and the reason why they dont has already been stated they still love one another Things have changed over the last twentyseven years but that miraculously hasnt It is Mike thinks our only real hope The only thing that really remains is to finish going through it to complete the job of catching up of stapling past to present so that the strip of experience forms some halfassed kind of wheel Yes Mike thinks thats it Tonight the job is to make the wheel tomorrow we can see if it still turns the way it did when we drove the big kids out of the gravelpit and out of the Barrens Richie swallows some beer and shakes his head I remember you telling us about the bird and about the smokehole A grin breaks over Richies face I remembered about that walking over here tonight with Bevvie and Ben What a fucking honorshow that was Well you know he says still smiling himself and punching his glasses up on his nose in a gesture that is eerily reminiscent of the old Richie He winks at Mike You and me right Mikey Miss Scawlett Miss Scawlett Richie shrieks in his Pickaninny Voice Its gettin a little waam in de smokehouse Miss Scawlett Laughing Bill says Another engineering and architectural triumph by Ben Hanscom Beverly nods We were digging out the clubhouse when you brought your fathers photograph album to the Barrens Mike Richie nods grimly The same trick as in Georgies room Only that time we all saw it Ben says I remembered what happened to the extra silver dollar I gave the other three to a friend of mine before I came out here Ben says quietly For his kids I remembered there had been a fourth but I couldnt remember what happened to it Now I do He looks at Bill We made a silver slug out of it didnt we You me and Richie At first we were going to make a silver bullet You were pretty sure you could do it Richie agrees But in the end We got ccold fuhfeet Bill nods slowly The memory has fallen naturally into its place and he hears that same low but distinct click when it happens Were getting closer he thinks We went back to Neibolt Street Richie says All of us You saved my life Big Bill Ben says suddenly and Bill shakes his head You did though Ben persists and this time Bill doesnt shake his head He suspects that maybe he had done just that although he does not yet remember how and was it him He thinks maybe Beverly but that is not there Not yet anyway Excuse me for a second Mike says Ive got a sixpack in the back fridge Hanlon no drinkum white mans beer Mike replies Especially not yours Trashmouth Beepbeep Mikey Rickie says solemnly and Mike goes to get his beer on a warm wave of their laughter He snaps on the light in the lounge a tacky little room with seedy chairs a Silex badly in need of scrubbing and a bulletin board covered with old notices wage and hour information and a few New Yorker cartoons now turning yellow and curling up at the edges He opens the little refrigerator and feels the shock sink into him bonedeep and icewhite the way February cold sank into you when February was here and it seemed that April never would be Blue and orange balloons drift out in a flood dozens of them a New Years Eve bouquet of partyballoons and he thinks incoherently in the midst of his fear All we need is Guy Lombardo tootling away on Auld Lang Syne They waft past his face and rise toward the lounge ceiling Hes trying to scream unable to scream seeing what had been behind the balloons what It had popped into the refrigerator beside his beer as if for a latenight snack after his worthless friends have all told their worthless stones and gone back to their rented beds in this home town that is no longer home Mike takes a step backward his hands going to his face shutting the vision out He stumbles over one of the chairs almost falls and takes his hands away It is still there Stan Uriss severed head beside Mikes sixpack of Bud Light the head not of a man but of an elevenyearold boy The mouth is open in a soundless scream but Mike can see neither teeth nor tongue because the mouth has been stuffed full of feathers The feathers are a light brown and unspeakably huge He knows well enough what bird those feathers came from Oh yes Oh yes indeed He had seen the bird in May of and they had all seen it in early August of  and then years later while visiting his dying father he had found out that Will Hanlon had seen it once too after his escape from the fire at the Black Spot The blood from S tans tattered neck has dripped down and formed a coagulated pool on the fridges bottom shelf It glitters dark rubyred in the uncompromising glow shed by the fridge bulb Uh uh uh Mike manages but no more sound than that can he make Then the head opens its eyes and they are the silverbright eyes of Pennywise the Clown Those eyes roll in his direction and the heads lips begin to squirm around the mouthful of feathers It is trying to speak perhaps trying to deliver prophecy like the oracle in a Greek play Just thought Id join you Mike because you cant win without me You cant win without me and you know it dont you You might have had a chance if all of me had shown up but I just couldnt stand the strain on my allAmerican brain if you see what I mean jellybean Ail the six of you can do on your own is hash over some old times and then get yourselves killed So I thought Id head you off at the pass Head you off get it Mikey Get it old pal Get it you fucking scumbag nigger Youre not real he screams but no sound comes out he is like a TV with the volume control turned all the way down Im real all right Real as raindrops And you know what Im talking about Mikey What the six of you are planning to try is like taking off in a jet plane with no landing gear Theres no sense in going up if you cant get back down is there No sense in going down if you cant get back up either Youll never think of the right riddles and jokes Youll never make me laugh Mikey Youve all forgotten how to turn your screams upsidedown Beepbeep Mikey what do you say Remember the bird Nothing but a sparrow but sayhey it was a lulu wasnt it Big as a barn big as one of those silly Japanese movie monsters that used to scare you when you were a little kid The days when you knew how to turn that bird from your door are gone forever Believe it Mikey If you know how to use your head youll get out of here out of Derry right now If you dont know how to use it itll end up just like this one here Todays guidepost along the great road of life is use it before you lose it my good man The head rolls over on its face the feathers in its mouth make a horrid crumpling sound and falls out of the refrigerator It thuks to the floor and rolls toward him like a hideous bowling ball its bloodmatted hair changing places with its grinning face it rolls toward him leaving a gluey trail of blood and dismembered bits of feather behind its mouth working around its clot of feathers Beepbeep Mikey it screams as Mike backs madly away from it hands held out in a wardingoff gesture Beepbeep beepbeep beepfuckingbeep Then there is a sudden loud popthe sound of a plastic cork thumbed out of a bottle of cheap champagne The head disappears Real Mike thinks sickly there was nothing supernatural about that pop anyway that was the sound of air rushing back into a suddenly vacated space real oh God real A thin net of blood droplets floats up and then patters back down No need to clean the lounge though Carole will see nothing when she comes in tomorrow not even if she has to plow her way through the balloons to get to the hotplate and make her first cup of coffee How handy He giggles shrilly He looks up and yes the balloons are still there The blue ones say DERRY NIGGERS GET THE BIRD The orange ones say THE LOSERS ARE STILL LOSING BUT STANLEY URIS IS FINALLY AHEAD No sense going up if you cant get back down the speaking head had assured him no sense going down if you cant get back up This latter makes him think again of the stored miners helmets And was it true Suddenly hes thinking about the first day he went down to the Barrens after the rockfight July th that had been two days after he had marched in the Fourth of July parade two days after he had seen Pennywise the Clown in person for the first time It had been after that day in the Barrens after listening to their stones and then hesitantly telling his own that he had gone home and asked his father if he could look at his photograph album Why exactly had he gone down to the Barrens that July th Had he known he would find them there It seemed that he hadand not just that they would be there but where they would be They had been talking about a clubhouse of some sort he remembers but it had seemed to him that they had been talking about that because there was something else that they didnt know how to talk about Mike looks up at the balloons not really seeing them now trying to remember exactly how it had been that day that hot hot day Suddenly it seems very important to remember just what had happened what every nuance had been what his state of mind had been Because that was when everything began to happen Before that the others had talked about killing It but there had been no forward motion no plan When Mike had come the circle closed the wheel began to roll It had been later that same day that Bill and Richie and Ben went down to the library and began to do serious research on an idea that Bill had had a day or a week or a month before It had all begun to Mike Richie calls from the Reference Room where the others are gathered did you die in there Almost Mike thinks looking at the balloons the blood the feathers inside the fridge He calls back I think you guys better come in here He hears the scrape of their chairs the mutter of their voices he hears Richie saying Oh Jesus whats up now and another ear this one in his memory hears Richie saying something else and suddenly he remembers what it is he has been searching for even more he understands why it has seemed so elusive The reaction of the others when he stepped into the clearing in the darkest deepest and most overgrown part of the Barrens that day had been nothing No surprise no questions about how he had found them no big deal Ben had been eating a Twinkie he remembers Beverly and Richie had been smoking cigarettes Bill had been lying on his back with his hands behind his head looking at the sky Eddie and Stan were looking doubtfully at a series of strings which had been pegged into the ground to form a square of about five feet on a side No surprise no questions no big deal He had simply shown up and been accepted It was as if without even knowing it they had been waiting for him And in that third ear memorys ear he hears Richies Pickaninny Voice raised as it was earlier tonight Lawdy Miss Clawdy here come that black chile agin Lawksamussy I doan know what thisyere Barrens is comin to Look at that there nappy haid Big Bill Bill didnt even look around he just went on staring dreamily at the fat summer clouds marching across the sky He was giving an important question his most careful consideration Richie was not offended by the lack of attention however He pushed onward Jest lookin at that nappy haid makes me bleeve I needs me another mint joolip Ise gwinter have it out on the verandah where its be a little bit coolah Beepbeep Richie Ben said from around a mouthful of Twinkie and Beverly laughed Hi Mike said uncertainly His heart was beating a little too hard but he was determined to go on with this He owed his thanks and his father had told him that you always paid what you owedand as quick as you could before the interest mounted up Stan looked around Hi he said and then looked back at the square of strings pegged into the center of the clearing Ben are you sure this is going to work No thank you Mike took a deep breath and said I wanted to thank you all again for helping me the other day Those guys meant to hurt me bad Im sorry some of you guys got banged up Bill waved his hand dismissing it dDDont wuhwuhhorry aabout it Ththeyve hhad it iiin ffor us all yyyear He sat up and looked at Mike with sudden starry interest CCan I aask you sssomething I guess so Mike said He sat down gingerly He had heard such prefaces before The Denbrough kid was going to ask him what it was like to be a Negro But instead Bill said When LLLarsen pitched the nnohhitter in the World SSeries two years ago ddo you think that was just luhluck Richie dragged deep on his cigarette and started to cough Beverly pounded nun goodnaturedly on the back Youre just a beginner Richie youll learn I think its gonna fall in Ben Eddie said worriedly looking at the pegged square I dont know how cool I am on the idea of getting buried alive Youre not gonna get buried alive Ben said And if you are just suck your damn old aspirator until someone pulls you out This struck Stanley Uris as deliciously funny He leaned back on his elbow his head turned up to the sky and laughed until Eddie kicked his shin and told him to shut up Luck Mike said finally I think any nohitters more luck than skill MMMe ttoo Bill said Mike waited to see if there was more but Bill seemed satisfied He lay down again laced his hands behind his head again and went back to studying the clouds as they floated by What are you guys up to Mike asked looking at the square of strings pegged just above the ground Oh this is Haystacks big idea of the week Richie said Last time he flooded out the Barrens and that was pretty good but this ones a real dinnerwinner This is Dig Your Own Clubhouse Month Next month YYou dont nuhnuhneed to put BBBBen dduhhown Bill said still looking at the sky Its going to be guhguhgood Well its pretty simple Ben said They wanted a treehouse and we could do that but people have a bad habit of breaking their bones when they fall out of treehouses Kookie Kookie lend me your bones Stan said and laughed again while the others looked at him puzzled Stan did not have much sense of humor and the bit he did have was sort of peculiar You ees goin loco senhorr Richie said Eees the heat an the cucarachas I theenk Anyway Ben said what well do is dig down about five feet in the square I pegged out there We cant go much deeper than that or well hit groundwater I guess Its pretty close to the surface down here Then well shore up the sides just to make sure they dont cave in He looked significantly at Eddie here but Eddie was worried Put boards over the top of the hole We can put in a trapdoor or something so we can get in and out even windows if we want Well need some hihhihhinges Bill said still looking at the clouds Ive got five dollars Beverly said I saved it up from babysitting Richie immediately began to crawl toward her on his hands and knees I love you Bevvie he said making dogs eyes at her Will you marry me Well live in a pinestudded bungalow A what Beverly asked while Ben watched them with an odd mixture of anxiety amusement and concentration A bungstudded pinealow Richie said Five bucks is enough sweetie you We shshare the eexpenses Bill said Thats why we got a club So after we cap the hole with boards Ben went on we put down this heavyduty glueTangleTrack they call itand put the sods back on Maybe sprinkle it with pine needles We could be down there and peoplepeople like Henry Bowerscould walk right over us and not even know we were there Bill sat up suddenly and looked at Mike You wwwant to hehhelp A look passed among the othersMike felt it as well as saw it There are seven of us here Mike thought and for no reason at all he shivered PPhretty ssoon Bill said and Mike knewknewthat it wasnt just Bens underground clubhouse Bill was talking about Ben knew it too So did Richie Beverly and Eddie Stan Uris had stopped smiling WWere ggonna start this pruhhuhhoject pretty suhsuhsoon There was a pause then and Mike was suddenly aware of two things they wanted to say something tell him something and he was not entirely sure he wanted to hear it Ben had picked up a stick and was doodling aimlessly in the dirt his hair hiding his face Richie was gnawing at his already ragged fingernails Only Bill was looking directly at Mike Speaking very slowly Bill said WWWere a cluhclub YYou can be in the club if you wwwant but yyyou have to keekeep our seeseesecrets You mean like the clubhouse Mike asked now more uneasy than ever Well sure Weve got another secret kid Richie said still not looking at Mike And Big Bill says weve got something more important to do this summer than digging underground clubhouses There was a sudden whistling gasp Mike jumped It was only Eddie blasting off Eddie looked at Mike apologetically shrugged and then nodded Well Mike said finally dont keep me in suspense Tell me Bill was looking at the others IIs there aaanyone who ddoesnt want him in the cluhclub There was another long pause and this time Bill didnt break it At last Beverly sighed and looked up at Mike The kids who have been killed she said We know whos been doing it and its not human They told him one by one the clown on the ice the leper under the porch the blood and voices from the drain the dead boys in the Standpipe Richie told about what had happened when he and Bill went back to Neibolt Street and Bill spoke last telling about the school photo that had moved and the picture he had stuck his hand into He finished by explaining that it had killed his brother Georgie and that the Losers Club was dedicated to killing the monster whatever the monster really was Mike thought later going home that night that he should have listened with disbelief mounting into horror and finally run away as fast as he could not looking back convinced either that he was being put on by a bunch of white kids who didnt like black folks or that he was in the presence of six authentic lunatics who had in some way caught their lunacy from each other the way everyone in the same class could catch a particularly virulent cold But he didnt run because in spite of the horror he felt a strange sense of comfort Comfort and something else something more elemental a feeling of coming home There are seven of us here he thought again as Bill finally finished speaking He opened his mouth not sure of what he was going to say What Richie and Stan asked together and Beverly turned her head so quickly that her ponytail flipped from her left shoulder to her right I saw him on the Fourth Mike said slowly speaking to Bill mostly Bills eyes sharp and utterly concentrated were on his demanding that he go on Yes on the Fourth of July He trailed off momentarily thinking But I knew him I knew him because that wasnt the first time I saw him And it wasnt the first time I saw something something wrong He thought of the bird then the first time hed really allowed himself to think of itexcept in nightmaressince May He had thought he was going crazy It was a relief to find out he wasnt crazy but it was still a scary relief He wet his lips Well its actually a trombone Mike said I play with the Neibolt Church School Band Anyway I saw the clown He was handing out balloons to kids on the threeway corner downtown He was just like Ben and Bill said Silver suit orange buttons white makeup on his face big red smile I dont know if it was lipstick or makeup but it looked like blood The others were nodding excited now but Bill only went on looking at Mike closely OOOrange tufts of hhhair he asked Mike making them unconsciously over his own head with his fingers Seeing him like that it scared me And while I was looking at him he turned around and waved at me like hed read my mind or my feelings or whatever you call it And that like scared me worse I didnt know why then but he scared me so bad for a couple of seconds I couldnt play my bone anymore All the spit in my mouth dried up and I felt He glanced briefly at Beverly He remembered it all so clearly now how the sun had suddenly seemed intolerably dazzling on the brass of his horn and the chrome of the cars the music too loud the sky too blue The clown had raised one whitegloved hand the other was full of balloon strings and had waved slowly back and forth his bloody grin too red and too wide a scream turned upsidedown He remembered how the flesh of his testicles had begun to crawl how his bowels had suddenly felt all loose and hot as if he might suddenly drop a casual load of shit into his pants But he couldnt say any of that in front of Beverly You didnt say stuff like that in front of girls even if they were the sort of girls you could say things like bitch and bastard in front of  I felt scared he finished feeling that was too weak but not knowing how to say the rest But they were nodding as if they understood and he felt an indescribable relief wash through him Somehow that clown looking at him smiling his red smile his whitegloved hand penduluming slowly back and forth that had been worse than having Henry Bowers and the rest after him Ever so much worse Then we were past Mike went on We marched up Main Street Hill And I saw him again handing out balloons to kids Except a lot of them didnt want to take them Some of the little ones were crying I couldnt figure out how he could have gotten up there so fast I thought to myself that there must be two of them you know both of them dressed the same way A team But then he turned around and waved to me again and I knew it was him It was the same man Hes not a man Richie said and Beverly shuddered Bill put his arm around her for a moment and she looked at him gratefully He waved to me and then he winked Like we had a secret Or like like maybe he knew Id recognized him I think so Mike said I have to check something before I say its for sure My fathers got some pictures He collects them Listen you guys play down here a lot dont you Mike nodded Ill check and see if Im right If I am I can bring the pictures Mike opened his mouth and then closed it again He looked around at them uncertainly and then said Youd think I was crazy Crazy or lying You bet were not Eddie said I got a lot wrong with me but Im not bughouse I dont think Mike looked them all over cleared his throat and said I saw a bird Couple three months ago I saw a bird Speaking more reluctantly than ever Mike said It looked like a sparrow sort of but it also looked like a robin It had an orange chest Well whats so special about a bird Ben asked There are lots of birds in Derry But he felt uneasy and looking at Stan he felt sure that Stan was remembering what had happened in the Standpipe and how he had somehow stopped it from happening by shouting out the names of birds But he forgot all about that and everything else when Mike spoke again He looked at their shocked amazed faces He waited for their laughter but none came Stan looked as if someone had clipped him with a brick His face had gone so pale it was the color of muted November sunlight I swear its true Mike said It was a giant bird like one of those birds in the monstermovies that are supposed to be prehistoric Yeah like in The Giant Claw Richie said He thought the bird in that had been sort of fakelooking but by the time it got to New York he had still been excited enough to spill his popcorn over the balcony railing at the Aladdin Foxy Foxworth would have kicked him out but the movie was over by then anyway Sometimes you got the shit kicked out of you but as Big Bill said sometimes you won one too But it didnt look prehistoric Mike said And it didnt look like one of those whatdoyoucallums the Greeks and Romans made up stories about Right I guess so It wasnt like those either It was just like a combination robin and sparrow The two most common birds you see He laughed a little wildly Tell us Beverly said simply and after a moment to collect his thoughts Mike did And telling it watching their faces grow concerned and scared but not disbelieving or derisive he felt an incredible weight lift from his chest Like Ben with his mummy or Eddie with his leper and Stan with the drowned boys he had seen a thing that would have driven an adult insane not just with terror but with the walloping force of an unreality too great to be explained away or lacking any rational explanation simply ignored Elijahs face had been burned black by the light of Gods love or so Mike had read but Elijah had been an old man when it happened and maybe that made a difference Hadnt one of those other Bible fellows this one little more than a kid actually wrestled an angel to a draw He had seen it and he had gone on with his life he had integrated the memory into his view of the world He was still young enough so that view was tremendously wide But what had happened that day had nonetheless haunted his minds darker corners and sometimes in his dreams he ran from that grotesque bird as it printed its shadow on him from above Some of these dreams he remembered and some he did not but they were there shadows which moved by themselves How little of it he had forgotten and how greatly it had troubled him as he went about his daily round helping his father going to school riding his bike doing errands for his mother waiting for the black groups to come on American Bandstand after school was perhaps measurable in only one waythe relief he felt in sharing it with the others As he did he realized it was the first time he had even allowed himself to think of it fully since that early morning by the Canal when he had seen those odd grooves and the blood Mike told the story of the bird at the old Ironworks and how he had run into the pipe to escape it Later on that afternoon three of the LosersBen Richie Billwalked toward the Derry Public Library Ben and Richie were keeping a close watch for Bowers and Company but Bill only looked at the sidewalk frowning lost in thought About an hour after telling them his story Mike had left them saying his father wanted him home by four to pick peas Beverly had to do some marketing and fix dinner for her father she said Both Eddie and Stan had their own things to do But before they broke up for the day they began digging what was to becomeif Ben was righttheir underground clubhouse To Bill and to all of them he suspected the groundbreaking had seemed an almost symbolic act They had begun Whatever it was they were supposed to do as a group as a unit they had begun Ben asked Bill if he believed like Hanlons story They were passing Derry Community House and the library was just ahead a stone oblong comfortably shaded by elms a century old and as yet untouched by the Dutch Elm disease that would later plague and thin them Yeah Bill said I ththink it was the truhhooth CCCrazy but true What about you RuhRuhRichie Richie nodded Yeah I hate to believe it if you know what I mean but I guess I do You remember what he said about the birds tongue Thats the kicker Richie said Its like some comicbook villain Lex Luthor or the Joker or someone like that It always leaves a trademark Bill nodded thoughtfully It was like some comicbook villain Because they saw it that way Thought of it that way Yes perhaps so It was kids stuff but it seemed that was what this thing thrived onkids stuff I aaasked StuhStuhStan iif he eever hhheard of a buhbird llike that Bill said Nuhnuhnot nnecessarily a bbbig wuhwuhone but j just aaa Bill nodded HHe suhsaid there mmmight be a buhbird like that in Suhhouth America or AAAAfrica but nuhnuhnot aaround hhhere HHHe buhbelieved iiit Bill said And then he told them something else Stan had suggested when Bill walked with him back to where Stan had left his bike Stans idea was that nobody else could have seen that bird before Mike told them that story Something else maybe but not that bird because the bird was Mike Hanlons personal monster But now why now that bird was the property of the whole Losers Club wasnt it Any of them might see it It might not look exactly the same Bill might see it as a crow Richie as a hawk Beverly as a golden eagle for all Stan knewbut It could be a bird to all of them now Bill told Stan that if that was true then any of them might see the leper the mummy or possibly the dead boys Which means we ought to do something pretty soon if were going to do anything at all Stan had replied It knows Man if It knows that were sunk Stan had answered But you can bet It knows we know about It I think Itll try to get us Are you still thinking about what we talked about yesterday BuhBuhBen and RihRichie wwwill Bens really sssmart and RihRihRichie is too when he ihisnt fucking ooff Now standing outside the library Richie asked Bill exactly what it was he had in mind Bill told them speaking slowly so he wouldnt stutter too badly The idea had been circling in his mind for the last two weeks but it had taken Mikes story of the bird to crystallize it What did you do if you wanted to get rid of a bird What did you do if you wanted to get rid of a monster Well the movies suggested that shooting it with a silver bullet was pretty goddam final Ben and Richie listened to this respectfully enough Then Richie asked How do you get a silver bullet Big Bill Send away for it I guess thats what were at the library to find out Ben said Richie nodded and pushed his glasses up on his nose Behind them his eyes were sharp and thoughtful but doubtful Bill thought He felt doubtful himself At least there was no foolishness in Richies eyes and that was a step in the right direction You thinking about your dads Walther Richie asked The one we took to Neibolt Street Even if we could really make silver bullets Richie said where would we Well okay Richie said Well let Haystack worry about that Then what Neibolt Street again Bill nodded NeeNeeNeibolt Street aaagain And then we buhblow its fucking hhhead ooff The three of them stood there a moment longer looking at each other solemnly and then they went into the library Sure an begorrah its that black feller again Richie cried in his Irish Cop Voice A week had passed it was nearly mid July and the underground clubhouse was almost finished Top o the mornin to ye Mr OHanlon sor And a foine foine day it promises to be foine as pertaters agrowin as me old mither used to So far as I know noon is the top of the morning Richie Ben said popping up in the hole and noon was two hours ago He and Richie had been putting in shoring around the sides of the hole Ben had taken off his sweatshirt because the day was hot and the work was hard His teeshirt was gray with sweat and stuck to his chest and pouch of a stomach He seemed remarkably unselfconscious of the way he looked but Mike guessed that if Ben heard Beverly coming he would be inside that baggy sweatshirt again before you could say puppy love Dont be so pickyyou sound like Stan the Man Richie said He had gotten out of the hole five minutes before because he told Ben it was time for a cigarette break I thought you said you didnt have any cigarettes Ben had said I dont Richie had replied but the principle remains the same Mike had his fathers photograph album under his arm Where is everybody he asked He knew Bill had to be somewhere around because he had left his own bike parked under the bridge near Silver Bill and Eddie went down to the dump about half an hour ago to liberate some more boards Richie said stanny and Bev went down to Reynolds Hardware to get hinges I dont know what the frock Haystacks up to down thereup to down there haha you get itbut its probably no good Boy needs someone to keep an eye on him you know By the way you owe us twentythree cents if you still want to be in this club Your share of the hinges Mike switched the album from his right arm to his left and dug into his pocket He counted out twentythree cents leaving a grand total of one dime in his own personal treasury and handed it over to Richie Then he walked over to the hole and looked in Except it really wasnt a hole anymore The sides had been neatly squared off Each side had been shored up The boards were all mongrels but Ben Bill and Stan had done a good job of sizing them with tools from Zack Denbroughs shop and Bill had been at great pains to make sure every tool was returned every night and in the same condition as when it was taken Ben and Beverly had nailed crosspieces between the supports The hole still made Eddie a little nervous but that was Eddies nature Piled carefully to one side were squares of sod which would later be glued to the top Sure Ben said and pointed to the album What you got My fathers Derry album Mike said He collects old pictures and clippings about the town Its his hobby I was looking through it a couple of days agoI told you I thought Id seen that clown before And I did In here So I brought it down He was too ashamed to add that he had not dared to ask his fathers permission to do this Afraid of the questions to which such a request might lead he had taken it from the house like a thief while his father planted potatoes in the west field and his mother hung clothes in the back yard I thought you guys ought to take a look too Id like to wait until everybodys here It might be better Okay Richie was in truth not that anxious to look at more pictures of Derry in this or any other album Not after what had happened in Georgies room You want to help me and Ben with the rest of the shoring You bet Mike put his fathers album down carefully far enough from the hole so it wouldnt be pelted with flying dirt and took Bens shovel Dig right here Ben said showing Mike the spot Go down about a foot Then Ill set a board in and hold it flush against the side while you shovel the dirt back in Good plan man Richie said sagely from where he sat on the edge of the excavation with his sneakers dangling down Hows your project with Bill going Mike stopped long enough to strip off his shirt and then began to dig It was hot down here even in the Barrens Crickets hummed sleepily like summer clocks in the brush Well not too bad Richie said and Mike thought he flashed Ben a mildly warning look I guess Why dont you play your radio Richie Ben asked He slipped a board into the hole Mike had dug and held it there Richies transistor was hung by the strap in its accustomed place on the thick branch of a nearby shrub Batteries are worn out Richie said You had to have my last twentyfive cents for hinges remember Cruel Haystack very cruel After all the things Ive done for you Besides all I can only get down here is WABI and they only play pansy rock Haystack thinks Tommy Sands and Pat Boone sing rock and roll Richie said but thats because hes ill Elvis sings rock and roll Ernie K Doe sings rock and roll Carl Perkins sings rock and roll Bobby Darin Buddy Holly Ahow Peggy my Peggy Suhuhoo Also Mike said leaning on his shovel theres Fats Domino Chuck Berry Little Richard Shep and the Limelights La Verne Baker Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers Hank Ballard and the Midnighters the Coasters the Isley Brothers the Crests the Chords Stick McGhee They were looking at him with such amazement that Mike laughed You lost me after Little Richard Richie said He liked Little Richard but if he had a secret rockandroll hero that summer it was Jerry Lee Lewis His mom had happened to come into the living room while Jerry Lee was performing on American Bandstand This was at the point in his act where Jerry Lee actually climbed onto his piano and played it upside down with his hair hanging in his face He had been singing High School Confidential For a moment Richie believed his mom was going to faint She didnt but she was so traumatized by what she had seen that she talked at dinner that night about sending Richie to one of those militarytype camps for the rest of the summer Now Richie shook his hair down over his eyes and began to sing Come on over baby all the cats are at the high school rockin Ben began to stagger around the hole grasping his large belly and pretending to puke Mike held his nose but he was laughing so hard tears squirted out of his eyes Whats wrong Richie demanded I mean what ails you guys That was good I mean that was really good Oh man Mike said and now he was laughing so hard he could barely talk That was priceless I mean that was really priceless Negroes have no taste Richie said I think it even says so in the Bible Yo mamma Mike said laughing harder than ever When Richie asked with honest bewilderment what that meant Mike sat down with a thump and rocked back and forth howling and holding his stomach You probably think Im jealous Richie said You probably think I want to be a Negro Now Ben also fell down laughing wildly His whole body rippled and quaked alarmingly His eyes bulged No more Richie he managed Im gonna shit my pants Im gonna dddie if you dont stubstop I dont want to be a Negro Richie said Who wants to wear pink pants and live in Boston and buy pizza by the slice I want to be Jewish like Stan I want to own a pawnshop and sell people switchblades and plastic dogpuke and used guitars Ben and Mike were now actually screaming with laughter Their laughter echoed through the green and jungly ravine that was the misnamed Barrens causing birds to take wing and squirrels to freeze momentarily on limbs It was a young sound penetrating lively vital unsophisticated free Almost every living thing within range of that sound reacted to it in some way but the thing which had tumbled out of a wide concrete drain and into the upper Kenduskeag was not living The previous afternoon there had been a sudden driving thunderstorm the clubhousetobe had not been much affectedsince digging operations had begun Ben had covered the hole carefully each evening with a ragged piece of tarpaulin Eddie had scrounged from behind Wallys Spa it smelled painty but it did the job and the stormdrains under Derry had run with violent water for two or three hours It was that spate of water that had pushed this unpleasant baggage into the sun for the flies to find It was the body of a nineyear old named Jimmy Cullum Except for the nose his face was gone There was a churned and featureless mess where it had been This raw meat was dotted with deep black marks that perhaps only Stan Uris would have recognized for what they were pecks Pecks made by a very large beak Water rilled over Jimmy Cullums muddy chino pants His white hands floated like dead fish They had also been pecked although not as badly His paisley shirt ballooned out and collapsed back ballooned out and collapsed back like a bladder Bill and Eddie loaded down with boards scrounged from the dump crossed the Kenduskeag by steppingstones less than forty yards from the body They heard Richie Ben and Mike laughing smiled a little themselves and hurried past the unseen ruin of Jimmy Cullum to see what was so funny They were still laughing as Bill and Eddie came into the clearing sweating under their load of lumber Even Eddie usually as pale as cheese had some color in his face They dropped the new boards on the almost depleted supplypile Ben climbed out of the hole to inspect them Bill collapsed to the ground Can I hhave my heart aaattack now or do I hhave to wuhwait until luhhater Have it later Ben said absently He had brought a few tools of his own down to the Barrens and was now going over the new boards carefully pounding out nails and removing screws He tossed one aside because it was splintered Rapping on another returned a dull punky sound in at least three places and he also tossed that one aside Eddie sat on a pile of dirt watching him He took a honk on his aspirator as Ben pulled a rusty nail from a board with the claw end of his hammer The nail squealed like some small unpleasant animal that had been stepped on and didnt like it You can get tetanus if you cut yourself on a rusty nail Eddie informed Ben Youre a bird Eddie said Its tetanus not titnuss and it means lock jaw Theres these special microbes that grow in rust see and if you cut yourself they can get inside your body and um fuck up your nerves Eddie went an even darker red and took another fast honk on his aspirator You bet First your jaw locks up so tight you cant open your mouth not even to eat They have to cut a hole in your cheek and feed you liquids through a tube Oh man Mike said standing up in the hole His eyes were wide the corneas very white in his brown face For sure My mom told me Eddie said Then your throat locks up and you cant eat anymore and you starve to death So Eddie said briskly I always watch out for rusty nails and shit like that I had to have a tetanus shot once and it really hurt So whyd you go to the dump with Bill and bring all this crap back Richie asked Eddie glanced briefly at Bill who was looking into the clubhouse and there was all the love and heroworship in that gaze needed to answer such a question but Eddie said softly some stuff has to be done even if there is a risk Thats the first important thing I ever found out I didnt find out from my mother A further silence not quite uncomfortable followed Then Ben went back to pounding out rusty nails and after awhile Mike Hanlon joined him Richies transistor robbed of its voice at least until Richies allowance came in or he found a lawn to mow swung from its low branch in a mild breeze Bill had time to reflect upon how odd all this was how odd and how perfect that they should all be here this summer There were kids he knew visiting relatives Kids he knew who were off on vacations at Disney land in California or on Cape Cod or in the case of one chum an unimaginably distantsounding place with the queer but somehow evocative name of Gstaad There were kids at church camp kids at Scout camp kids at richkid camps where you could learn to swim and play golf camps where you learned to say Hey good one instead of Fuck you when your opponent got a killer serve past you at tennis kids whose parents had simply taken them AWAY Bill could understand that He knew some kids who wanted to go AWAY frightened by the boogeyman stalking Derry this summer but suspected there were more parents frightened by that boogeyman People who had planned to take their vacations at home suddenly decided to go AWAY instead It was a little like the polio scare of when four kids who went swimming in the OBrian Memorial Pool had gotten the disease Grownupsword absolutely synonymous in Bills mind with mothers and fathershad decided then as now that AWAY was better Safer Anyone able to clear out had cleared Bill understood AWAY and he could muse over a word of such fabulous wonder as Gstaad but wonder was cold comfort compared with desire Gstaad was AWAY Derry was desire And none of us have gone AWAY he thought watching as Ben and Mike pounded used nails out of used boards as Eddie strolled off into the bushes to take a whiz you had to go as soon as you could in order to avoid seriously straining your bladder he told Bill once but you also had to watch out for poison ivy because who needed a case of that on your pecker Were all here in Derry No camp no relatives no vacations no AWAY All right here Present and accounted for Theres a door down there Eddie said zipping his fly as he came back Hope you shook off Eds Richie said If you dont shake off each time you can get cancer My mom told me so Eddie looked startled thinly worried and then saw Richies grin He withered him or tried to with a babiesmustplay look and then said It was too big for us to carry But Bill said if all of us went down we could get it up here Of course you can never shake off completely Richie went on You want to know what a wise man once told me Eds No Eddie said and I dont want you to call me Eds anymore Richie I mean Im sincere I dont call you Dick as in You got any gum on ya Dick so I dont see why This wise man Richie said told me this No matter how much you squirm and dance the last two drops go in your pants And thats why theres so much cancer in the world Eddie my love The reason theres so much cancer in the world is because nerds like you and Beverly Marsh smoke cigarettes Eddie said Beverly is not a nerd Ben said in a forbidding voice You just watch what you say Trashmouth Beepbeep you gguys Bill said absently And speaking of BBBeverly shes pretty struhstruhstrong She could hhhelp get that duhdoor Somebody threw out a mahogany door Ben asked surprised but not unbelieving People throw out everything Mike said That dump It kills me to go down there I mean it kills me Yeah Ben agreed A lot of that stuff could be fixed up easy And there are people in China and South America with nothing Thats what my mother says Theres people with nothing right here in Maine Sunny Jim Richie said grimly WWWhats ththis Bill asked noticing the album Mike had brought Mike told him saying he would show them the picture of the clown when Stan and Beverly got back with the hinges Whats wrong Mike asked Is it what happened in your brothers room They took turns working on the hole until Stan and Beverly came back each with a brown paper bag containing hinges As Mike talked Ben sat crosslegged tailorfashion and made glassless windows that would swing open and shut in two of the long boards Perhaps only Bill noticed how quickly and easily his fingers moved how adept and knowing they were like surgeons fingers Bill admired that Some of these pictures go back a hundred years my dad said Mike told them holding the album on his lap He gets them at those sales people have in their yards and at secondhand shops Sometimes he buys them or trades other collectors for them Some of them are stereoscopestheres two of them just the same on a long card and when you look at them through this thing like binoculars it looks like one picture only in D Like House of Wax or The Creature from the Black Lagoon Why does he like all that stuff Beverly asked She was wearing ordinary Levis but she had done something amusing to the cuffs blousing them out with a bright paisley material for the final four inches so that they looked like pants out of some sailors whimsy Well I dont know for sure but I think its because he wasnt born here Mike said diffidently Its likeI dont knowlike its all new to him or like you know if you came in during the middle of a movie Yeah Mike said Theres a lot of history lying around in Derry I kind of like it And I think some of it has to do with this thingthis It if you want to call it that So I was looking through it after the Fourth of July parade because I knew Id seen that clown before I knew it And look He opened the book thumbed through it then handed it to Ben who was sitting on his right DDDont tttouch the puhpuhpages Bill said and there was such urgency in his voice that they all jumped He had fisted the hand he had cut reaching into Georgies album Richie saw Fisted it into a tight protective knot Bills right Richie said and that subdued totally unRichielike voice was a powerful convincer Be careful Its like Stan said If we saw it happen you guys could see it happen too The album went from hand to hand each of them holding the book gingerly by the edges as if it were old dynamite sweating big beads of nitro It came back to Mike He opened it to one of the first pages Daddy says theres no way to date that one but its probably from the early or midseventeenhundreds Mike said He repaired a guys handsaw for a box of old books and pictures That was one of them He says it might be worth forty bucks or even more The picture was a woodcut the size of a large postcard When Bills turn came to look at it he was relieved to see that Mikes father had the land of album where the pictures were under a protective plastic sheet He looked fascinated and he thought There Im seeing himor It Really seeing Thats the face of the enemy The picture showed a funny fellow juggling oversized bowling pins in the middle of a muddy street There were a few houses on either side of the street and a few huts that Bill guessed were stores or trading posts or whatever they called them back then It didnt look like Derry at all except for the Canal It was there neatly cobbled on both sides In the upper background Bill could see a team of mules on a towpath dragging a barge There was a group of maybe half a dozen kids gathered around the funny fellow One of them was wearing a pastoral straw hat Another had a hoop and a stick to roll it with Not the sort of stick that would come with a hoop that you bought today in a Woolworths it was a branch from a tree Bill could see the bare knobs on it where smaller branches had been lopped off with a knife or a hatchet That baby wasnt made in Taiwan or Korea he thought fascinated by this boy who could have been him if hed been born four or five generations before The funny fellow had a huge grin on his face He wore no makeup except to Bill his whole face looked like makeup but he was bald except for two tufts of hair that stuck up like horns over his ears and Bill had no trouble recognizing their clown Two hundred years ago or more he thought and felt a crazy surge of terror anger and excitement rush through him Twentyseven years later sitting in the Derry Public Library and remembering his first look into Mikes fathers album he realized he had felt the way a hunter might feel coming upon the first fresh spoor of an old killer tiger Two hundred years ago that long and only God knows how much longer This led him to wonder just how long the spirit of Pennywise had been here in Derrybut he found that was a thought he did not really want to pursue Gimme Bill Richie was saying but Bill held the album a moment longer staring fixedly at the woodcut sure it would begin to move the bowling pins if thats what they were which the funny fellow was juggling would rise and fall rise and fall the kids would laugh and applaud except maybe they wouldnt all laugh and applaud some of them might scream and run instead the muleteam pulling the barge would move beyond the borders of the picture It didnt happen and he passed the book on to Richie When the album came back to Mike he turned some more pages hunting Here he said This one is from four years before Lincoln was elected President The book went around again This was a color picturea sort of cartoonwhich showed a bunch of drunks standing in front of a saloon while a fat politician with muttonchop whiskers declaimed from a board that had been set between two hogsheads He held a foamy pitcher of beer in one hand The board upon which he stood was considerably bowed with his weight Some distance off a group of bonneted women were looking at this show of mingled buffoonery and intemperance with disgust The caption below the picture read POLITICS IS THIRSTY WORK SEZ SENATOR GARNER Daddy says pictures like this were really popular for about twenty years before the Civil War Mike said They called them foolcards and people used to send them to each other They were like some of the jokes in Mad I guess Yeah Mike said But now look down in the corner of this one The picture was like Mad in another wayit had as many details and little sidejokes as a big Mort Drucker panel in a Mad magazine movie takeoff There was a grinning fat man pouring a glass of beer down a spotted dogs throat There was a woman who had fallen on her prat in a mudpuddle There were two street urchins slyly sticking sulphurheaded matches into the soles of a prosperouslooking businessmans shoes and a girl swinging from her heels in an elm tree so that her underpants showed But despite this bewildering intaglio of detail none of them really needed Mike to point the clown out Dressed in a loud checked vestbusting drummers suit he was playing the shellgame with a bunch of drunken loggers He was winking at a lumber jack who had to judge by the gapemouthed look of surprise on his face just picked the wrong nutshell The drummerclown was taking a coin from him It was a clipping from the front page of the Derry News HUZZAH the headline proclaimed exuberantly IRONWORKS OPENS Just below this Town Turns Out for Gala Picnic The picture showed a woodcut of the ribboncutting ceremony at the Kitchener Ironworks its style reminded Bill of the Currier and Ives prints his mother had in the dining room although this was nowhere near as polished A fellow tricked out in a morning coat and tophat was holding a large pair of openjawed scissors above the Ironworks ribbon while a crowd of perhaps five hundred watched Off to the left was a clowntheir clownturning a handspring for a group of children The artist had caught him upside down turning his smile into a scream The next picture was a photograph under which Will Hanlon had written Repeal in Derry Although none of the boys knew much about either the Volstead Act or its repeal the picture made the salient facts clear The photo was of Wallys Spa down in Hells HalfAcre The place was almost literally filled to the rafters with men wearing opencollared white shirts straw boaters lumbermens shirts teeshirts bankers suits All of them were holding glasses and bottles victoriously aloft There were two big signs in the window WELCOME BACK JOHN BARLEYCORN one read The other said FREE BEER TONIGHT The clown dressed like the biggest dandy you ever saw white shoes spats gangster pants had his foot on the running board of a Reo auto and was drinking champagne from a ladys highheeled shoe The Derry News again The headline JAPAN SURRENDERSITs OVER THANK GOD ITs OVER A parade was snakedancing its way along Main Street toward UpMile Hill And there was the clown in the background wearing his silver suit with the orange buttons frozen in the matrix of dots that made up the grainy newsprint photo seeming to suggest at least to Bill that nothing was over no one had surrendered nothing was won nil was still the rule zilch still the custom seeming to suggest above all that all was still lost Suddenly the dots in the picture disappeared and it began to move LLLook Bill said The word dropped out of his mouth like a partially melted icecube AAAll of you luhlook at ththis Thats IT Richie nearly screamed pounding Bill on the back in his excitement He looked around at Eddies white drawn face and Stan Uriss frozen one Thats what we saw in Georges room Thats exactly what we shhh Ben said Listen And almost sobbing You can hear themChrist you can hear them in there And in the silence that was only broken by the mild stir of the summer breeze they all realized they could The band was playing a martial marching tune made faint and tinny by distance or the passage of time or whatever it was The cheering of the crowd was like sounds that might come through on a badly tuned radio station There were popping noises also faint like the muffled sound of snapping fingers Firecrackers Beverly whispered and rubbed at her eyes with hands that shook Those are firecrackers arent they No one answered They watched the picture their eyes eating up their faces The parade wiggled its way toward them but just before the marchers reached the extreme foregroundat the point where it seemed they must march right out of the picture and into a world thirteen years laterthey dropped from sight as if on some kind of unknowable curve The World War I soldiers first their faces strangely old under their pieplate helmets with their sign which read THE DERRY VFW WELCOMES HOME OUR BRAVE BOYS then the Boy Scouts the Kiwanians the Home Nursing Corps the Derry Christian Marching Band then the Derry World War II vets themselves with the highschool band behind them The crowd moved and shifted Tickertape and confetti fluttered down from the second and thirdfloor windows of the business buildings that lined the streets The clown pranced along the sidelines doing splits and cartwheels miming a sniper miming a salute And Bill noticed for the first time that people were turning from himbut not as if they saw him exactly it was more as if they felt a draft or smelled something bad Ben stretched his hand out to the picture as Bill had done in Georges room I think its all right Bill Ben said Look And he laid his hand on the protective plastic over the picture for a moment and then took it back But if you stripped off that cover Beverly screamed The clown had left off its antics when Ben withdrew his hand It rushed toward them its paintbloody mouth gibbering and laughing Bill winced back but held onto the book all the same thinking it would drop out of sight as the parade had done and the marching band and the Boy Scouts and the Cadillac convertible carrying Miss Derry of But the clown did not disappear along that curve that seemed to define the edge of that old existence Instead it leaped with a scary nimble grace onto a lamppost that stood in the extreme left foreground of the picture It shinnied up like a monkey on a stickand suddenly its face was pressed against the tough plastic sheet Will Hanlon had put over each of the pages in his book Beverly screamed again and this time Eddie joined her although his scream was faint and bluebreathless The plastic bulged outlater they would all agree they saw it Bill saw the bulb of the clowns red nose flatten the way your nose will flatten when you press it against a windowpane Kill you all The clown was laughing and screaming Try to stop me and Ill kill you all Drive you crazy and then kill you all You cant stop me Im the Gingerbread Man Im the Teenage Werewolf And for a moment It was the Teenage Werewolf the moonsilvered face of the lycanthrope peering out at them from over the collar of the silver suit white teeth bared Now the lepers face haunted and peeling rotting with sores stared at them with the eyes of the living dead The lepers face aged and ran with sterile cracks Ancient bandages swam halfway out of its skin and solidified there Ben turned away his face as white as curds one hand plastered over his neck and ear No Stan Uris screamed His eyes bulged above braisedlooking crescents of skinshockflesh Bill thought randomly and it was a word he would use in a novel twelve years later with no idea where it had come from simply taking it as writers take the right word at the right time as a simple gift from that outer space Stan snatched the album from his hands and slammed it shut He held it closed with both hands the tendons standing out along the inner surfaces of his wrists and forearms He looked around at the others with eyes that were nearly insane No he said rapidly No no no And suddenly Bill found he was more concerned with Stans repeated denials than with the clown and he understood that this was exactly the sort of reaction the clown had hoped to provoke because Because maybe Its scared us really scared for the first time in Its long long life He grabbed Stan and shook him twice hard holding onto his shoulders Stans teeth clicked together and he dropped the album Mike picked it up and put it aside in a hurry not liking to touch it after what he had seen But it was still his fathers and he understood intuitively that his father would never see in it what he had just seen aaall suhhaw it Stan Bill said He looked at the others Yes Eddie managed gasping it out of his rapidly closing throat Bill looked at Stan demanding with his eyes that Stan look back at him duhdont let it ggget yyou man Bill said Yuhyou suhsaw it tttoo I didnt want to Stan wailed Sweat stood out on his brow in an oily sheen Stan looked at the others one by one He ran his hands through his short hair and fetched up a great shuddering sigh His eyes seemed to clear of that lowering madness that had so disturbed Bill Yes he said Yes Okay Yes That what you want Yes Bill thought Were still all together It didnt stop us We can still kill It We can still kill It if were brave Bill looked around at the others and saw in each pair of eyes some measure of Stans hysteria Not quite as bad but there YYYeah he said and smiled at Stan After a moment Stan smiled back and some of that horrible shocked look left his face Thats what I wuhwuhwanted you wehwehwet end Beepbeep Dumbo Stan said and they all laughed It was hysterical screaming laughter but better than no laughter at all Bill reckoned CCCome on he said because someone had to say something Lets fffinish the clubhouse What do you sssay He saw the gratitude in their eyes and felt a measure of gladness for them but their gratitude did little to heal his own horror In fact there was something in their gratitude which made him want to hate them Would he never be able to express his own terror lest the fragile welds that made them into one thing should let go And even to think such a thing wasnt really fair was it Because in some measure at least he was using themusing his friends risking their livesto settle the score for his dead brother And was even that the bottom No because George was dead and if revenge could be exacted at all Bill suspected it could only be exacted on behalf of the living And what did that make him A selfish little shit waving a tin sword and trying to make himself look like King Arthur Oh Christ he groaned to himself if this is the stuff adults have to think about I never want to grow up His resolve was still strong but it was a bitter resolve Richie Tozier pushes his glasses up on his nose already the gesture feels perfectly familiar although he has worn contact lenses for twenty years and thinks with some amazement that the atmosphere has changed in the room while Mike recalled the incident with the bird out at the Ironworks and reminded them about his fathers photograph album and the picture that had moved Richie had felt a mad exhilarating kind of energy growing in the room He had done cocaine nine or ten times over the last couple of yearsat parties mostly coke wasnt something you wanted just lying around your house if you were a biggatime disc jockeyand the feel was something like that but not exactly This feeling was purer more of a mainline high He thought he recognized the feeling from his childhood when he had felt it every day and had come to take it merely as a matter of course He supposed that if he had ever thought about that deeprunning aquifer of energy as a kid he could not recall that he ever had he would have simply dismissed it as a fact of life something that would always be there like the color of his eyes or his disgusting hammertoes Well that hadnt turned out to be true The energy you drew on so extravagantly when you were a kid the energy you thought would never exhaust itselfthat slipped away somewhere between eighteen and twentyfour to be replaced by something much duller something as bogus as a coke high purpose maybe or goals or whatever rahrah Junior Chamber of Commerce word you wanted to use It was no big deal it didnt go all at once with a bang And maybe Richie thought thats the scary part How you dont stop being a kid all at once with a big explosive bang like one of that clowns trick balloons with the BurmaShave slogans on the sides The kid in you just leaked out like the air out of a tire And one day you looked in the mirror and there was a grownup looking back at you You could go on wearing bluejeans you could keep going to Springsteen and Seger concerts you could dye your hair but that was a grownups face in the mirror just the same It all happened while you were asleep maybe like a visit from the Tooth Fairy He laughs aloud at the stupid extravagance of thisimage and when Beverly looks at him questioningly he waves a hand at her Nothing babe he says Just thinkin me thinks But now that energy is back No not all the way backnot yet anywaybut coming back And its not just him he can feel it filling the room Mike looks okay to Richie for the first time since they all got together for that hideous lunch out by the mall When Richie walked into the lobby and saw Mike sitting there with Ben and Eddie he thought shocked Theres a man whos going crazy getting ready to commit suicide maybe But that look is gone now Not just sublimated gone Richie has sat right here and watched the last of it slip out of Mikes face while he relived the experience of the bird and the album Hes been energised And it is the same with all of them Its in their faces their voices their gestures Eddie pours himself another ginandprune juice Bill knocks back some bourbon and Mike cracks another beer Beverly glances up at the balloons Bill has tethered to the microfilm recorder at the main desk and finishes her third screwdriver in a hurry They have all been drinking pretty enthusiastically but none of them are drunk Richie doesnt know where that energy he feels is coming from but its not out of a liquor bottle THE LOSERS ARE STILL LOSING BUT STANLEY URIS IS FINALLY AHEAD Orange Richie thinks opening a fresh beer for himself it isnt bad enough It can be any damn monster It wants to be and it isnt bad enough that It can feed off our fears It also turns out to be Rodney Dangerfield in drag Its Eddie who breaks the silence How much do you think It knows about what were doing now he asks Bill nods Those are just images he says Im not sure that means It can see us or know what were up to You can see a news commentator on TV but he cant see you Those balloons arent just images Beverly says and jerks a thumb over her shoulder at them Theyre real Thats not true though Richie says and they all look at him Images are real Sure they are They And suddenly something else clicks into place something new it clicks into place with such firm force that he actually puts his hands to his ears His eyes widen behind his glasses Oh my God he cries suddenly He gropes for the table halfstands then falls back into his chair with a boneless thud He knocks his can of beer over reaching for it picks it up and drinks whats left He looks at Mike while the others look at him startled and concerned The burning he almost shouts The burning in my eyes Mike The burning in my eyes But Richie barely hears him The force of the memory sweeps through him like a tide turning him alternately hot and cold and he suddenly understands why these memories have come back one at a time If he had remembered everything at once the force would have been like a psychological shotgun blast let off an inch from his temple It would have torn off the whole top of his head We saw It come he says to Mike We saw It come didnt we You and me or was it just me He grabs Mikes hand which lies on the table did you see it too Mikey or was it just me Did you see it The forest fire The crater I saw it Mike says quietly and squeezes Richies hand Richie closes his eyes for a moment thinking he has never felt such a warm and powerful wave of relief in his life not even when the PSA jet he had taken from LA to San Francisco skidded off the runway and just stopped therenobody killed nobody even hurt Some luggage had fallen out of the overhead bins and that was all He had jumped onto the yellow emergency slide and helped a woman away from the plane The woman had turned her ankle on a hummock concealed in the high grass She was laughing and saying I cant believe Im not dead I cant believe it I just cant believe it So Richie who was halfcarrying the woman with one arm and waving with the other to the firemen who were making frantic comeon gestures to the deplaning passengers said Okay youre dead youre dead you feel better now and they both laughed crazily That had been relieflaughter but this relief is greater What are you guys talking about Eddie asks looking from one to the other Richie looks at Mike but Mike shakes his head You go ahead Richie Ive had my say for the evening The rest of you dont know or maybe dont remember because you left Richie tells them Me and Mikey we were the last two Injuns in the smokehole The burning sensation in my eyes Richie says under my contact lenses I felt it for the first time right after Mike called me in California I didnt know what it was then but I do now It was smoke Smoke that was twentyseven years old He looks at Mike Psychological would you say Psychosomatic Something from the subconscious I would say not Mike answers quietly I would say that what you felt was as real as those balloons or the head I saw in the icebox or the corpse of Tony Tracker that Eddie saw Tell them Richie Richie says It was four or five days after Mike brought his dads album down to the Barrens Sometime just after the middle of July I guess The clubhouse was done But the smokehole thing that was your idea Haystack You got it out of one of your books Richie thinks It was overcast that day No breeze Thunder in the air Like the day a month or so later when we stood in the stream and made a circle and Stan cut our hands with that chunk of Coke bottle The air was just sitting there waiting for something to happen and later Bill said that was why it got so bad in there so quick because there was no draft July th Yes that was it that had been the day of the smokehole July th almost a month after summer vacation began and the nucleus of the LosersBill Eddie and Benhad formed down in the Barrens Let me look up the weather forecast for that day almost twentyseven years ago Richie thinks and Ill tell you what it said before I even read it Richard Tozier aka the Great Mentalizer Hot humid chance of thundershowers And watch out for the visions that may come while youre down in the smokehole It had been two days after the body of Jimmy Cullum was discovered the day after Mr Nell had come down to the Barrens again and sat right on the clubhouse without knowing it was there because by then they had capped it off and Ben himself had carefully overseen the replacement of the sods Unless you got right down on your hands and knees and crawled around youd have no idea anything was there Like the dam Bens clubhouse had been a roaring success but this time Mr Nell didnt know anything about it He had questioned them carefully officially taking down their answers in his black notebook but there had been little they could tell himat least about Jimmy Cullumand Mr Nell had gone away again after reminding them once more that they were not to play in the Barrens alone ever Richie guessed that Mr Nell would have told them simply to get out if anyone in the Derry Police Department had really believed that the Cullum boy or any of the others had actually been killed in the Barrens But they knew better because of the sewer and stormdrain system that was simply where the remains tended to finish up Mr Nell had come on the th yes a hot and humid day also but sunny The th had been overcast Are you going to talk to us or not Richie Bev asks She is smiling a little her lips full and a pale rosered her eyes alight Im just thinking about where to start Richie says He takes his glasses off wipes them on his skirt and suddenly he knows where with the ground opening up at his and Bills feet Of course he knew about the clubhouseso did Bill and the rest of them but it still freaked him out seeing the ground suddenly open on a slit of darkness like that He remembers Bill riding him double on the back of Silver to the usual place on Kansas Street and then stowing his bike under the little bridge He remembers the two of them walking along the path toward the clearing sometimes having to turn sideways because the brush was so thickit was midsummer now and the Barrens was at that years apogee oflushness He remembers swatting at the mosquitoes that hummed maddeningly close to their ears he even remembers Bill saying oh how clearly it all comes back not as if it happened yesterday but as if it is happening now HHHold it a sss econd RuhRichie Theres a damn guhguhhood one on the bback of your nehneck Oh Christ Richie said He hated mosquitoes Little flying vampires thats all they were when you got right down to the facts Kill it Big Bill Bill held his hand in front of Richies face There was a broken mosquito body in the center of an irregular patch of blood My blood Richie thought which was shed for you and for many Yeeick he said DDont wworry Bill said Lil fuckerll nehnever dance the tuhtuhtango again They walked on slapping at mosquitoes waving at the clouds of noseeums attracted by something in the smell of their sweatsomething which would years later be identified as pheromones Whatever they were Bill when you gonna tell the rest of em about the silver bullets Richie asked as they approached the clearing In this case the rest of them meant Bev Eddie Mike and Stanalthough Richie guessed Stan already had a good idea of what they were studying up on down at the Public Library Stan was sharptoo sharp for his own good Richie sometimes thought The day Mike brought his fathers album down to the Barrens Stan had almost flipped out Richie had in fact been nearly convinced that they wouldnt see Stan again and the Losers Club would become a sextet a word Richie liked a lot always with the emphasis on the first syllable But Stan had been back the next day and Richie hadrespected him all the more for that You going to tell them today Bill shrugged and Richie who maybe understood Bill Denbrough better than anyone ever would until Audra Phillips suspected all the things Bill might have said if not for the roadblock of his speech impediment that kids making silver bullets was boys book stuff comicbook stuff In a word it was crap Dangerous crap They could try it yeah Ben Hanscom might even be able to bring it off yeah In a movie it would work yeah But I got an iiiidea Bill said simpler But only if BehBehBeverly They came into the clearing If you looked closely you might have thought that the grass there had a slightly matted looka slightly used look You might even have thought that there was something a bit artificialalmost arrangedabout the scatter of leaves and pine needles on top of the sods Bill picked up a RingDing wrapperBens almost certainlyand put it absently in his pocket The boys crossed to the center of the clearing and a piece of ground about ten inches long by three inches wide swung up with a dirty squall of hinges revealing a black eyelid Eyes looked out of that blackness giving Richie a momentary chill But they were only Eddie Kaspbraks eyes and it was Eddie whom he would visit in the hospital a week later who intoned hollowly Whos that triptrapping on my bridge Thees ees the rurales senhorr Richie said squatting down twirling an invisible mustache and speaking in his Pancho Vanilla Voice Go to hell Pancho Eddie replied and slammed the big eyelid closed There were more muffled giggles from below Come out with your hands up Bill cried in a low commanding adult voice He began to tramp back and forth across the sodcovered cap of the clubhouse He could see the ground springing up and down with his backandforth passage but just barely they had built well You havent got a chance he bellowed seeing himself as fearless Joe Friday of the LAPD in his minds eye Come on out of there punks Or well come in SHOOTIN He jumped up and down once to emphasize his point Screams and giggles from below Bill was smiling unaware that Richie was looking at him wiselylooking at him not as one child looks at another but in that brief moment as an adult looks at a child Let them in Ben before they crash the roof in Bev said A moment later a trapdoor flopped open like the hatch of a submarine Ben looked out He was flushed Richie knew at once that Ben had been sitting next to Beverly Bill and Richie dropped down through the hatch and Ben closed it again Then there they all were sitting snug against board walls with their legs drawn up their faces dimly revealed in the beam of Bens flashlight Not too much Ben said He was indeed sitting next to Beverly and his face looked happy as well as flushed We were just Tell em Ben Eddie interrupted Tell em the story See what they think Wouldnt do much for your asthma Stan told Eddie in his best someonehastobepracticalhere tone of voice Richie sat between Mike and Ben holding his knees in his linked hands It was delightfully cool down here delightfully secret Following the gleam of the flashlight as it moved from face to face he temporarily forgot what had so astounded him outside only a minute ago What are you talkin about Oh Ben was telling us a story about this Indian ceremony Bev said But Stans right it wouldnt be very good for your asthma Eddie It might not bother it Eddie said soundingto his credit Richie thoughtonly a little uneasy Usually its only when I get upset Anyway Id like to try it The beam of Bens flashlight drifted upward and Richie followed it with his eyes It tracked aimlessly across the wooden roof of their clubhouse as Ben explained It crossed the gouged and splintered panels of the mahogany door the seven of them had carried back here from the dump three days agothe day before the body of Jimmy Cullum was discovered The thing Richie remembered about Jimmy Cullum a quiet little boy who also wore spectacles was that he liked to play Scrabble on rainy days Not going to be playing Scrabble anymore Richie thought and shivered a little In the dimness no one saw the shiver but Mike Hanlon sitting shoulder to shoulder with him glanced at him curiously Well I got this book out of the library last week Ben was saying Ghosts of the Great Plains its called and its all about the Indian tribes that lived out west a hundred and fifty years ago The Paiutes and the Pawnees and the Kiowas and the Otoes and the Comanches It was really a good book Id love to go out there sometime to where they lived Iowa Nebraska Colorado Utah Shut up and tell about the SmokeHole Ceremony Beverly said elbowing him Sure he said Right And Richie believed his response would have been the same if Beverly had given him the elbow and said drink the poison now Ben okay See almost all those Indians had a special ceremony and our clubhouse made me think of it Whenever they had to make a big decisionwhether to move on after the buffalo herds or to find fresh water or whether or not to fight their enemiestheyd dig a big hole in the ground and cover it up with branches except for a little vent in the top Your quick mind never ceases to amaze me Big Bill Richie said gravely You ought to go on TwentyOne Ill bet you could even beat ole Charlie Van Doren Bill made as if to hit him and Richie recoiled bumping his head a pretty good one on a piece of shoring I keel you rotten gringo sumbeesh Richie said We doan need no stinkin Will you guys stop it Beverly asked This is interesting And she favored Ben with such a warm look that Richie believed steam would start curling out of Haystacks ears in a couple of minutes Sure Ben said The word came out in a croak He had to clear his throat and start again When the smokehole was finished theyd start a fire down there Theyd use green wood so it would be a really smoky fire Then all the braves would go down there and sit around the fire The place would fill up with smoke The book said this was a religious ceremony but it was also kind of a contest you know After half a day or so most of the braves would bug out because they couldnt stand the smoke anymore and only two or three would be left And they were supposed to have visions Yeah if I breathed smoke for five or six hours Id probably have some visions all right Mike said and they all laughed The visions were supposed to tell the tribe what to do Ben said And I dont know if this part is true or not but the book said that most times the visions were right A silence fell and Richie looked at Bill He was aware that they were all looking at Bill and he had the feelingagainthat Bens story of the smokehole was more than a thing you read about in a book and then had to try for yourself like a chemistry experiment or a magic trick He knew it they all knew it Perhaps Ben knew it most of all This was something they were supposed to do They were supposed to have visions Most times the visions were right Richie thought Ill bet if we asked him Haystack would tell us that book practically jumped into his hand Like something wanted him to read that one particular book and then tell us about the smokehole ceremony Because theres a tribe right here isnt there Yeah Us And yeah I guess we do need to know what happens next This thought led to another Was this supposed to happen From the time Ben got the idea for an underground clubhouse instead of a treehouse was this supposed to happen How much of this are we thinking up ourselves and how much is being thought up for us In a way he supposed such an idea should have been almost comforting It was nice to imagine that something bigger than you smarter than you was doing your thinking for you like the adults that planned your meals bought your clothes and managed your timeand Richie was convinced that the force that had brought them together the force that had used Ben as its messenger to bring them the idea of the smokeholethat force wasnt the same as the one killing the children This was some kind of counterforce to that other to It But all the same he didnt like this feeling of not being in control of his own actions of being managed of being run They all looked at Bill they all waited to see what Bill would say Rihrihreally nuhneat Bill repeated looking down at his hands and perhaps it was only the uneasy flashlight beam in Bens hands or his own imagination but Richie thought Bill looked a little pale and a lot scared although he was smiling Maybe we could uuse a vihhision to tell us what to dddo about oour pruhpruhhoblem And if anyone has a vision Richie thought it will be Bill But about that he was wrong Well Ben said it probably only works for Indians but it might be flippy to try it Yeah well probably all pass out from the smoke and die in here Stan said gloomily Thatd be really flippy all right Well I sort of do Stan said He sighed I think you guys are making me crazy you know it He looked at Bill When There was a startled thoughtful silence Then Richie got to his feet straightarming the trapdoor open and letting in the muted light of that still summer day I got my hatchet Ben said following him out Who wants to help me cut some green wood It took them about an hour to get ready They cut four or five armloads of small green branches from which Ben had stripped the twigs and leaves Theyll smoke all right he said I dont even know if well be able to get them going Beverly and Richie went down to the bank of the Kenduskeag and brought back a collection of goodsized stones using Eddies jacket his mother always made him take a jacket even if it was eighty degreesit might rain Mrs Kaspbrak said and if you have a jacket to put on your skin wont get soaked if it does as a makeshift sling Carrying the rocks back to the clubhouse Richie said You cant do this Bev Youre a girl Ben said it was just the braves that went down in the smokehole not the squaws Beverly paused looking at Richie with mixed amusement and irritation A lock of hair had escaped from her ponytail she pushed out her lower lip and blew it off her forehead I could wrestle you to a fall any day Richie And you know it Dat doan mattuh Miss Scawlett Richie said popping his eyes at her You is still a girl and you is always goan be a girl You sho aint no Injun brave Ill be a bravette then Beverly said Now are we going to take these rocks back to the clubhouse or am I going to bounce a few of them off your asshole skull Lawksamussy Miss Scawlett I aint got no asshole in man skull Richie screeched and Beverly laughed so hard she dropped her end of Eddies jacket and all the stones fell out She scolded Richie all the time they were picking them up again and Richie joked and screeched in many Voices and thought to himself how beautiful she was Although Richie had not been serious when he spoke of excluding her from the smokehole on the basis of her sex Bill Denbrough apparently was She stood facing him her hands on her hips her cheeks flushed with anger You can just take that and stuff it with a long pole Stuttering Bill Im in on this too or arent I a member of your lousy club anymore Patiently Bill said IIts not llike that BBBev and yyou nunknow iit Somebody has to stay uuhup here Bill tried but the roadblock was in again He looked at Eddie for help Its what Stan said Eddie told her quietly About the smoke Bill says that might really happenwe could pass out down there Then wed die Bill says thats what happens to most people in housefires They dont burn up They choke to death on the smoke They Now she turned to Eddie Well okay He wants somebody to stay up on top in case theres trouble Eddie said nothing She turned back to Bill The others stood around hands in their pockets looking at their sneakers Its because Im a girl isnt it Thats really it isnt it You dont have to talk she snapped Just nod your head or shake it Your head doesnt stutter does it Is it because Im a girl She looked at him for a moment her lips trembling and Richie thought she would cry Instead she exploded Well fuck you She whirled around to look at the others and they flinched from her gaze so hot it was nearly radioactive Fuck all of you if you think the same thing She turned back to Bill and began to talk fast rapping him with words This is something more than some diddlyshit kids game like tag or guns or hideandgoseek and you know it Bill Were supposed to do this Thats part of it And youre not going to cut me out just because Im a girl Do you understand You better or Im leaving right now And if I go Im gone For good You understand She stopped Bill looked at her He seemed to have regained his calm but Richie felt afraid He felt that any chance they had of winning of finding a way to get to the thing that had killed Georgie Denbrough and the other kids getting to It and killing It was now in jeopardy Seven Richie thought Thats the magic number There has to be seven of us Thats the way its supposed to be AA rright Bill said and Richie let his breath out But suhsuhsomebody has to sstay tuhhopside Who wwwants to ddo it Richie thought Eddie or Stan would surely volunteer for this duty but Eddie said nothing Stan stood pale and thoughtful and silent Mike had his thumbs hooked into his belt like Steve McQueen in Wanted Dead or Alive nothing moving but his eyes Cuhcuhcome oon Bill said and Richie realized that all pretense had gone out of the thing now Bevs impassioned speech and Bills grave tooold face had seen to that This was a part of it perhaps as dangerous as the expedition he and Bill had made to the house at Neibolt Street They knew it and no one was backing down Suddenly he was very proud of them very proud to be with them After all the years of being counted out he was counted in Finally counted in He didnt know if they were still losers or not but he knew they were together They were friends Damn good friends Richie took his glasses off and rubbed them vigorously with the tail of his shirt I know how to do it Bev said and took a book of matches from her pocket On the front so tiny youd need a magnifying glass to get a really good look at them were pictures of that years candidates for the title of Miss Rheingold Beverly lit a match and then blew it out She tore out six more and added the burned match She turned away from them and when she turned back the white ends of the seven matches poked out of her closed fist Pick she said holding the matches out to Bill The one who picks the match with the burned head stays up here and pulls the rest out if they go flippy Bill looked at her levelly ThThis is hhhow you wwant iit She smiled at him then and her smile made her face radiant Yeah you big dummy this is how I want it What about you I luhluhlove you BBBev he said and color rose in her cheeks like hasty flames Bill did not appear to notice He studied the matchtails sucking out of her fist and at length he picked one Its head was blue and unburned She turned to Ben and offered the remaining six I love you too Ben said hoarsely His face was plumcolored he looked like he was on the verge of a stroke But no one laughed Somewhere deeper in the Barrens the bird sang again Stan would know what it was Richie thought randomly Thank you she said smiling and Ben picked a match Its head was unburned She offered them to Eddie next Eddie smiled a shy smile that was incredibly sweet and almost heartbreakingly vulnerable I guess I love you too Bev he said and then picked a match blindly Its head was blue Beverly now offered the four matchtails in her hand to Richie Ah loves yuh Miss Scawlett Richie screamed at the top of his voice and made exaggerated kissing gestures with his lips Beverly only looked at him smiling a little and Richie suddenly felt ashamed I do love you Bev he said and touched her hair Youre cool He picked a match and looked at it positive hed picked the burned one But he hadnt I love you Stan said and plucked one of the matches from her fist Unburned You and me Mike she said and offered him his pick of the two left He stepped forward I dont know you well enough to love you he said but I love you anyway You could give my mother shoutin lessons I guess They all laughed and Mike took a match Its head was also unburned Looking disgustedall that flash and fire for nothingBeverly opened her hand The head of the remaining match was also blue and unburned No I didnt Her tone was not one of angry protestwhich would have been suspectbut flabbergasted surprise Honest to God I didnt Then she showed them her palm They all saw the faint mark of soot from the burned matchhead there Bill looked at her for a moment and then nodded By common unspoken consent they all handed the matches back to Bill Seven of them their heads intact Stan and Eddie began to crawl around on the ground but there was no burned match there We aaall go down Bill said Because thats wwhat wwwere suhsupposed to do Bill looked at Beverly again IIf BBevs ttelling the truhtruth and sshe iiis wwe wont Ben and Richie went down first and the others handed the rocks down one by one Richie passed them on to Ben who made a small stone circle in the middle of the dirt clubhouse floor Okay he said Thats enough The others came down each with a handful of the green twigs theyd cut with Bens hatchet Bill came last He closed the trapdoor and opened the narrow hinged window ThThThere he said Ththeres our smuhsmokehole Do we hhave any kihkihkindling You can use this if you want Mike said and took a battered Archie funnybook out of his hip pocket I read it already Bill tore the pages out of the funnybook one by one working slowly and gravely The others sat around the walls knee to knee and shoulder to shoulder watching not speaking The tension was thick and still Bill laid small twigs and branches over the paper and then looked at Beverly YYYou ggot the muhmatches he said She lit one a tiny yellow flare in the gloom darn thing probably wont catch anyway she said in a slightly uneven voice and touched a light to the paper in several places When the matchflame got close to her fingers she tossed it into the center The flames blazed up yellow crackling throwing their faces into sharp relief and in that moment Richie had no trouble believing Bens Indian story and he thought it must have been like this back in those old days when the idea of white men was still no more than a rumor or a tall tale to those Indians who followed buffalo herds so big they could cover the earth from horizon to horizon herds so big that their passing shook the ground like an earthquake In that moment Richie could picture those Indians Kiowas or Pawnees or whatever they were down in their smokehole knee to knee and shoulder to shoulder watching as the flames guttered and sank into the green wood like hot sores listening to the faint and steady ssssss of sap oozing out of the damp wood waiting for the vision to descend Yeah Sitting here now he could believe it all and looking at their somber faces as they studied the flames and the charring pages of Mikes Archie funny book he could see that they believed it too The branches were catching The clubhouse began to fill up with smoke Some of it white as cotton smokesignals in a Saturdaymatinee movie starring Randolph Scott or Audie Murphy escaped from the smokehole But with no moving air outside to create a draft most of it stayed below It had an acrid bite that made eyes sting and throats throb Richie heard Eddie cough twicea flat sound like dry boards being whacked togetherand then fall silent again He shouldnt be down here he thought but something else apparently felt otherwise Bill tossed another handful of green twigs on the smoldering fire and asked in a thin voice that was not much like his usual speaking voice Anyone having aany vihvihvisions Visions of getting out of here Stan Uris said Beverly laughed at this but her laughter turned into a fit of coughing and choking Richie leaned his head back against the wall and looked up at the smokeholea thin rectangle of mellow white light He thought about the Paul Bunyan statue that day in March but that had only been a mirage a hallucination a So leave Richie murmured not taking his eyes off the smokehole He felt as if he was getting a handle on this He felt as if he had lost ten pounds And he sure as shit felt as if the clubhouse had gotten bigger Damn straight on that last He had been sitting with Ben Hanscoms fat right leg squashed against his left one and Bill Denbroughs bony left shoulder socked into his right arm Now he was touching neither of them He glanced lazily to his right and left to verify that his perception was true and it was Ben was a foot or so to his left On his right Bill was even farther away Place is bigger friends and neighbors he said He took a deeper breath and coughed hard It hurt hurt deep in his chest the way a cough hurt when you had the flu or the grippe or something For awhile he thought it would never pass that he would just go on coughing until they had to pull him out If they still can he thought but the thought was really too dim to be frightening Then Bill was pounding him on the back and the coughing fit passed You dont know you dont always Richie said He was looking at the smokehole again instead of at Bill How bright it seemed When he closed his eyes he could still see the rectangle floating there in the dark but bright green instead of bright white Stutter He paused aware that someone else was coughing but not sure who it was You ought to do the Voices not me Big Bill You The coughing got louder Suddenly the clubhouse was flooded with daylight so sudden and so bright Richie had to squint against it He could just make out Stan Uris climbing and clawing his way out Its all right Richie heard himself say You doan need no stinkin batches His voice sounded as if it were coming from a different body The trapdoor slammed shut a moment later but enough fresh air had come in to clear his head a little Before Ben moved over a little to fill the space Stan had vacated Richie became aware of Bens leg again pressing his How had he gotten the idea that the clubhouse had gotten bigger Mike Hanlon threw more sticks on the smoky fire Richie resumed taking shallow breaths and looking up at the smokehole He had no sense of real time passing but he was vaguely aware that in addition to the smoke the clubhouse was getting good and hot He looked around looked at his friends They were hard to see halfswallowed in shadowsmoke and still white summerlight Bevs head was tilted back against a piece of shoring her hands on her knees her eyes closed tears trickling down her cheeks toward her earlobes Bill was sitting crosslegged his chin on his chest Ben was But suddenly Ben was getting to his feet pushing the trapdoor open again There goes Ben Mike said He was sitting Indianfashion directly across from Richie his eyes as red as a weasels Comparative coolness struck them again The air freshened as smoke swirled up through the trap Ben was coughing and dryretching He pulled himself out with Stans help and before either of them could close the trapdoor Eddie was staggering to his feet his face a deadly pale except for the bruisedlooking patches under his eyes and traced just below his cheekbones His thin chest was hitching up and down in quick shallow spasms He groped weakly for the edge of the escape hatch and would have fallen if Ben had not grabbed Sorry Eddie managed in a squeaky little whisper and then they hauled him up The trapdoor banged down again There was a long quiet period The smoke built up until it was a thick still fog in the clubhouse Looks like a peasouper to me Watson Richie thought and for a moment he imagined himself as Sherlock Holmes a Holmes who looked a great deal like Basil Rathbone and who was totally black and white moving purposefully along Baker Street Moriarty was somewhere near a hansom cab awaited and the game was afoot The thought was amazingly clear amazingly solid It seemed almost to have weight as if it were not a little pocketdaydream of the sort he had all the time batting cleanup for the Bosox bottom of the ninth bases loaded and there it goes its up ITS GONE Home run Tozier and that breaks the Babes record but something that was almost real There was still enough of the wiseacre in him to think that if all he was getting out of this was a vision of Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes then the whole idea of visions was pretty overrated Except of course it isnt Moriarty thats out there Its out theresome Itand Its real It Then the trapdoor opened again and Beverly was struggling her way out coughing dryly one hand cupped over her mouth Ben got one hand and Stan grabbed her under the other arm Halfpulled halfscrambling under her own power she was up and gone Richie looked around He saw the circle of stones with the fire smoldering within fuming out clouds of smoke Across the way he saw Mike sitting crosslegged like a totem carved from mahogany staring at him through the fire with his smokereddened eyes Except Mike was better than twenty yards away and Bill was even farther away on Richies right The underground clubhouse was now at least the size of a ballroom Doesnt matter Mike said Its gonna come pretty quick Somethin is He began to cough He tried to control it but the cough worsened a dry rattling Dimly Richie saw Bill stumble to his feet lunge for the trapdoor and shove it open Looks like its you and me ole Mikey Richie said and then he began to cough himself I thought for sure that it would be Bill The cough worsened He doubled over hacking dryly unable to get his breath His head was thuddingwhackinglike a turnip filled with blood His eyes teared behind his glasses From far away he heard Mike saying Go on up if you have to Richie Dont go flippy Dont kill yourself He raised a hand toward Mike and flapped it at him in a negative gesture Little by little he began to get the coughing under control again Mike was right something was going to happen and soon He wanted to still be here when it did He tilted his head back and looked up at the smokehole again The coughing fit had left him feeling lightheaded and now he seemed to be floating on a cushion of air It was a pleasant feeling He took shallow breaths and thought Someday Im going to be a rockandroll star Thats it yes Ill be famous Ill make records and albums and movies Ill have a black sportcoat and white shoes and a yellow Cadillac And when I come back to Derry theyll all eat their hearts out even Bowers I wear glasses but what the fuck Buddy Holly wears glasses Ill bop till Im blue and dance till Fm black Ill be the first rockandroll star to ever come from Maine Ill The thought drifted away It didnt matter He found that now he didnt need to take shallow breaths His lungs had adapted He could breathe as much smoke as he wanted Maybe he was from Venus Mike threw more sticks on the fire Not to be outdone Richie tossed on another handful himself Mike nodded and smiled back I feel okay Have you been having some funny thoughts Yeah Thought I was Sherlock Holmes for a minute there Then I thought I could dance like the Dovells Your eyes are so red you wouldnt believe it you know it Yours too Just a coupla weasels in the pen thats what we are They grinned at each other and then Richie let his head tilt back against the wall again and looked up at the smokehole Shortly he began to drift away No not away Up He was drifting up Like Bills voice coming down through the smokehole Coming from Venus Worried Richie felt himself thud back down inside himself All right he heard his voice distant irritated All right we said all right be quiet Bill let us get the word we wanna say we got the The clubhouse was bigger than ever floored now in some polished wood The smoke was fogthick and it was hard to see the fire That floor Jesuscomepleaseus It was as big as a ballroom floor in an MGM musical extravaganza Mike looked at him from the other side a shape almost lost in the fog Richie held his hand out and although Mike was on the far side of this enormous room he felt those strong brown fingers close over his wrist Oh and that was good that was a good touchgood to find desire in comfort to find comfort in desire to find substance in smoke and smoke in substance He tilted his head back and looked at the smokehole so white and wee It was farther up now Miles up Venusian skylight It was happening He began to float Come on then he thought and began to rise faster through the smoke the fog the mist whatever it was The two of them were standing together in the middle of the Barrens and it was nearly dusk It was the Barrens he knew that but everything was different The foliage was lusher deeper savagely fragrant There were plants he had never seen before and Richie realized some of the things he had first taken for trees were really giant ferns There was the sound of running water but it was much louder than it should have beenthis water sounded not like the leisurely flow of the Kenduskeag Stream but more the way he imagined the Colorado River would sound as it cut its way through the Grand Canyon It was hot too Not that it didnt get hot in Maine during the summer and humid enough so that sometimes you felt sticky just lying in your bed at night but this was more heat and more humidity than he had ever felt in his whole life A low mist smoky and thick lay in the hollows of the land and crept around the boys legs It had a thin acrid smell like burning green wood He and Mike began to move toward the sound of the running water without speaking pushing their way through the strange foliage Thick ropy lianas lay between some of the trees like spidery hammocks and once Richie heard something go crashing off through the underbrush It sounded bigger than a deer He stopped long enough to look around turning in a circle studying the horizon He knew where the Standpipes thick white cylinder should have been but it wasnt there Neither was the railroad trestle going over to the trainyards at the end of Neibolt Street or the Old Cape housing developmentlow bluffs and red sandstone outcroppings of rock bulged out of thick stands of giant fern and pine trees where the Old Cape should have been There was a flapping noise overhead The boys ducked as a squadron of bats flapped by They were the biggest bats Richie had ever seen and for a moment he was more terrified than he had been even when Bill was trying to get Silver rolling and he had heard the werewolf closing in on them from behind The stillness and the alienness of this land were both terrible but its awful familiarity was somehow worse No need to be scared he told himself Remember that this is just a dream or a vision or whatever you want to call it Me and ole Mikey are really back in the clubhouse goofed up on smoke Pretty soon Big Bill is gonna get noivous from the soivice because were not answering anymore and he and Ben will come down and haul us out Its just like Conway Twitty saysonly makebelieve But he could see how one of the bats wings was so ragged the hazy sun shone through it and when they passed beneath one of the giant ferns he could see a fat yellow caterpillar trundling across a wide green frond leaving its shadow behind it There were tiny black mites jumping and sizzling on the caterpillars body If this was a dream it was the clearest one he had ever had They went on toward the sound of the water and in the thick kneehigh groundmist Richie was unable to tell if his feet were touching the ground or not They came to a place where both the mist and the ground stopped Richie looked unbelieving This was not the Kenduskeagand yet it was The stream boiled and roiled through a narrow watercourse cut through that same crumbly rocklooking across to the far side he could see ages cut into those stacked layers of stone red and then orange and then red again You couldnt walk across this stream on steppingstones youd need a rope bridge and if you fell in you would be swept away at once The sound of the water was the sound of bitter foolish anger and as Richie watched slackjawed he saw a pinkishsilver fish jump in an impossibly high arc snapping at the bugs that made shifting clouds just above the surface of the water It splashed down again giving Richie just time enough to register its presence and to realize he had never seen a fish exactly like that in his whole life not even in a book Birds flocked across the sky squalling harshly Not a dozen or two dozen for a moment the sky was so dark with birds that they blotted out the sun Something else crashed through the bushes and then more things Richie wheeled his heart thudding painfully in his chest and saw something that looked like an antelope flash by heading southeast The birds passed presumably alighting somewhere en masse farther south Another animal crashed by them and another Then there was silence except for the steady rumble of the Kenduskeag The silence had a waiting quality about it a pregnant quality Richie didnt like He felt the hairs shifting and trying to stand up on the back of his neck and he groped for Mikes hand again Do you know where we are he shouted at Mike You got the word Jesus yes Mike shouted back I got it This is ago Richie Ago Richie nodded Ago as in once upon a time long long ago when we all lived in the forest and nobody lived anywhere else They were in the Barrens as they had been God knew how many thousands of years ago They were in some unimaginable past before the ice age when New England had been as tropical as South America was today if there still was a today He looked around again nervously almost expecting to see a brontosaurus raise its cranelike neck against the sky and stare down at them its mouth full of mud and dripping uprooted plants or a sabertoothed tiger come stalking out of the undergrowth But there was only that silence as in the five or ten minutes before a vicious thundersquall strikes when the purple heads stack up and up in the sky overhead and the light turns a queer bruised purpleyellow and the wind dies completely and you can smell a thick aroma like overcharged car batteries in the air Were in the ago a million years back maybe or ten million or eighty million but here we are and somethings going to happen I dont know what but something and Im scared I want it to end I want to be back and Bill please Bill please pull us out its like we fell into the picture some picture please please help Mikes hand tightened on his and he realized that now the silence had been broken There was a steady low vibrationhe could feel it more than hear it working against the tight flesh of his eardrums buzzing the tiny bones that conducted the sound It grew steadily It had no tone it simply was the word in the beginning was the word the world the a tuneless soulless sound He groped for the tree they stood near and as his hand touched it cupped the curve of the bole he could feel the vibration caught inside At the same moment he realized he could feel it in his feet a steady tingling that went up his ankles and calves to his knees turning his tendons into tuning forks It was coming out of the sky Not wanting to but unable to help himself Richie turned his face up The sun was a molten coin burning a circle in the lowhanging overcast surrounded by a fairyring of moisture Below it the verdant green slash that was the Barrens lay utterly still Richie thought he understood what this vision was they were about to see the coming of It The vibration took on a voicea rumbling roar that built to a shattering crescendo of sound He clapped his hands to his ears and screamed and could not hear himself scream Beside him Mike Hanlon was doing the same and Richie saw that Mikes nose was bleeding a little The clouds in the west lit with a bloom of red fire It traced its way toward them widening from an artery to a stream to a river of ominous color and then as a burning falling object broke through the cloud cover the wind came It was hot and searing smoky and suffocating The thing in the sky was gigantic a flaming matchhead that was nearly too bright to look at Arcs of electricity bolted from it blue bullwhips that flashed out from it and left thunder in their wake A spaceship Richie screamed falling to his knees and covering his eyes Oh my God its a spaceship But he believedand would tell the others later as best he couldthat it was not a spaceship although it might have come through space to get here Whatever came down on that longago day had come from a place much farther away than another star or another galaxy and if spaceship was the first word to come into his mind perhaps that was only because his mind had no other way of grasping what his eyes were seeing There was an explosion thena roar of sound followed by a rolling concussion that knocked them both down This time it was Mike who groped for Richies hand There was another explosion Richie opened his eyes and saw a glare of fire and a pillar of smoke rising into the sky It he screamed at Mike in an ecstasy of terror nownever in his life before or after would he feel any emotion so deeply be so overwhelmed by feeling It It It Mike dragged him to his feet and they ran along the high bank of the young Kenduskeag never noticing how close they were to the drop Once Mike stumbled and went skidding to his knees Then it was Richies turn to go down barking his shin and tearing his pants The wind had come up and it was pushing the smell of the burning forest toward them The smoke grew thicker and Richie became dimly aware that he and Mike were not running alone The animals were on the move again fleeing from the smoke the fire the death in the fire Running from It perhaps The new arrival in their world Richie began to cough He could hear Mike beside him also coughing The smoke was thicker washing out the greens and grays and reds of the day Mike fell again and Richie lost his hand He groped for it and could not find it Mike He screamed panicked coughing Mike where are you Mike MIKE His eyes fluttered open and he saw Beverly kneeling beside him wiping his mouth with a handkerchief The othersBill Eddie Stan and Benstood behind her their faces solemn and scared The side of Richies face hurt like hell He tried to speak to Beverly and could only croak He tried to clear his throat and almost vomited His throat and lungs felt as if they had somehow been lined with smoke It was all I could think of to do she said I didnt think you were going to be all right is all Bev said and suddenly burst into tears Richie patted her clumsily on the shoulder and Bill put a hand on the back of her neck She reached around at once took it squeezed it Richie managed to sit up The world began to swim in waves When it steadied down he saw Mike leaning against a tree nearby his face dazed and ashypale In a croaking stumbling Irish Cops Voice he asked Get any on ye darlin Bev laughed through her tears and shook her head I turned you on your side I was afraid aaafraid youd chchchoke on it She began to cry hard again NuhNuhNo ffair Bill said still holding her hand IIIm the one who stuhhuhhutters aaround hhere Not bad Big Bill Richie said He tried to get to his feet and sat down again heavily The world was still swimming He began to cough and turned his head away aware that he was going to retch again only a moment before it happened He threw up a mess of green foam and thick saliva that mostly came out in ropes He closed his eyes tight and croaked Anyone want a snack Oh shit Ben cried disgusted and laughing at the same time Looks more like puke to me Richie said although in truth his eyes were still tightly shut The shit usually comes out the other end at least for me I dunno about you Haystack When he opened his eyes at last he saw the clubhouse about twenty yards away Both the window and the big trapdoor were thrown open Smoke thinning now puffed from both This time Richie was able to get to his feet For a moment he was quite sure he was going to retch again or faint or both Whacko he murmured watching the world waver and warp in front of his eyes When the feeling passed he made his way over to where Mike was Mikes eyes were still weaselred and from the dampness on his pants cuffs Richie thought that maybe ole Mikey had taken a ride on the stomachelevator too For a white boy you did pretty good Mike croaked and punched Richie weakly on the shoulder Richie was at a loss for wordsa condition of exquisite rarity MMe and BuhBen YYou were scuhscuhrheaming BBoth of yyyou BBBut He looked over at Ben Ben said It must have been the smoke Bill But there was no conviction in the big boys voice at all Mike answered We werent there at first were we You went down because you heard us screaming but at first we werent there It was really smoky Ben said Hearing you both screaming that way that was scary enough But the screaming it sounded well It sssounded very ffffar aaway Bill said Stuttering badly he told them that when he and Ben had gone down they hadnt been able to see either Richie or Mike They had gone plunging around in the smoky clubhouse panicked scared that if they didnt act quickly the two boys might die of smoke poisoning At last Bill had gripped a handRichies He had given a huhhuhhell of a yuhyank and Richie had come flying out of the gloom only about onequarter conscious When Bill turned around he had seen Ben with Mike in a bearhug both of them coughing Ben had thrown Mike up and out through the trapdoor I kept grabbing you know Really not doing anything except jabbing my hand out like I wanted to shake hands You grabbed it Mike Damn good thing you grabbed it when you did I think you were just about gone You guys make the clubhouse sound a lot bigger than it is Richie said Talking about stumbling around in it and all Its only five feet on every side There was a moments silence while they all looked at Bill who stood in frowning concentration Ben shrugged It sure seemed like it Unless it was the smoke It wasnt the smoke Richie said Just before it happenedbefore we went outI remember thinking it was at least as big as a ballroom in a movie Like one of those musicals Seven Brides for Seven Brothers something like that I could barely see Mike against the other wall She grabbed Richies arm It happened didnt it It really happened You had a vision just like in Bens book Her face was glowing It really happened Richie looked down at himself and then at Mike One of the knees of Mikes corduroy pants was out and both the knees of his own jeans were torn He could look through the holes and see bleeding scrapes on both his knees If it was a vision I never want to have another one he said I dont know about de Kingfish over there but when I went down there I didnt have any holes in my pants Theyre practically new for gosh sakes My moms gonna give me hell Richie and Mike exchanged a glance and then Richie said Bevvie you got a smoke She had two wrapped in a piece of tissue Richie put one of them in his mouth and when she lit it the first drag made him cough so badly that he handed it back to her Cant he said sorry Shit on that Richie said It wasnt just the past It was ago Yeah right We were in the Barrens but the Kenduskeag was going a mile a minute It was deep It was fuckin wild Sorry Bevvie but it was And there were fish in it Salmon I think MMy dddad ssays ththere havent been aaany fuhfish in the KKenduskkkeag for a lllong tuhhime BBecause of the suhsewage This was a long time all right Richie said He looked around at them uncertainly I think it was a million years ago at least A thunderstruck silence greeted this Beverly broke it at last But what happened Richie felt the words in his throat but he had to struggle to bring them out It felt almost like vomiting again We saw It come he said at last I think that was it It came out of the sky Mike said I never want to see anything like that again in my whole life It was burning so hot you couldnt really look at it And it was thowin off electricity and makin thunder The noise He shook his head and looked at Richie It sounded like the end of the world And when it hit it started a forest fire That was at the end of it Well I guess it was Mike said and at the same time Richie said No it really wasnt a spaceship you know but You tell Richie said to Mike We mean the same thing I think but theyre not getting it Mike coughed into his fist and then looked up at the others almost apologetically I dont know just how to tell you he said It came out of the sky Mike repeated but it wasnt a spaceship exactly It wasnt a meteor either It was more like well like the Ark of the Covenant in the Bible that was supposed to have the Spirit of God inside of it except this wasnt God Just feeling It watching It come you knew It meant bad that It was bad Richie nodded It came from outside I got that feeling From outside Outside everything Richie said And when It came down It made the biggest damn hole you ever saw in your life It turned this big hill into a doughnut just about It landed right where the downtown part of Derry is now Beverly dropped the cigarette halfsmoked and crushed it out under one shoe Mike said Its always been here since the beginning of time since before there were men anywhere unless maybe there were just a few of them in Africa somewhere swinging through the trees or living in caves The craters gone now and the ice age probably scraped the valley deeper and changed some stuff around and filled the crater in but It was here then sleeping maybe waiting for the ice to melt waiting for the people to come Thats why It uses the sewers and the drains Richie put in They must be regular freeways for It You didnt see what It looked like Stan Uris asked abruptly and a little hoarsely Can we beat It Eddie said in the silence A thing like that No one answered By the time Richie finishes theyre all nodding Eddie is nodding along with them remembering along with them when the pain suddenly races up his left arm Races up No Rips through it feels as if someone is trying to sharpen a rusty saw on the bone in there He grimaces and reaches into the pocket of his sport jacket sorts through a number of bottles by feel and takes out the Excedrin He swallows two with a gulp of ginandprune juice The arm has been paining him off and on all day At first he dismissed it as the twinges of bursitis he sometimes gets when the weather is damp But halfway through Richies story a new memory clicks into place for him and he understands the pain This isnt Memory Lane were wandering down anymore he thinks its getting more and more like the Long Island Expressway Five years ago during a routine checkup Eddie has a routine checkup every six weeks the doctor said matteroffactly Theres an old break here Ed Did you fall out of a tree when you were a kid Something like that Eddie agreed not bothering to tell Dr Robbins that his mother undoubtedly would have fallen down dead of a brain hemorrhage if she had seen or heard of her Eddie climbing trees The truth was he hadnt been able to remember exactly how he broke the arm It didnt seem important although Eddie thinks now that lack of interest was in itself very oddhe is after all a man who attaches importance to a sneeze or a slight change in the color of his stools But it was an old break a minor irritation something that happened a long time ago in a boyhood he could barely remember and didnt care to recall It pained him a little when he had to drive long hours on rainy days A couple of aspirin took care of it nicely No big deal But now it is not just a minor irritation it is some madman sharpening that rusty saw playing bonetunes and he remembers that was how it felt in the hospital especially late at night in the first three or four days after it happened Lying there in bed sweating in the summer heat waiting for the nurse to bring him a pill tears running silently down his cheeks into the bowls of his ears thinking Its like some kooks sharpening a saw in there If this is Memory Lane Eddie thinks Id trade it for one great big brain enema a mental high colonic Unaware he is going to speak he says It was Henry Bowers who broke my arm Do you remember that Mike nods That was just before Patrick Hockstetter disappeared I dont remember the date I do Eddie says flatly It was the th of July The Hockstetter kid was reported missing on what the rd Twentysecond Beverly Rogan says although she doesnt tell them why she is so sure of the date it is because she saw It take Hockstetter Nor does she tell them that she believed then and believes now that Patrick Hockstetter was crazy perhaps even crazier than Henry Bowers She will tell them but this is Eddies turn She will speak next and then she supposes that Ben will narrate the climax of that Julys events the silver bullet they had never quite dared to make A nightmare agenda if ever there was one she thinksbut that crazy exhilaration persists When did she last feel this young She can hardly sit still The th of July Eddie muses rolling his aspirator along the table from one hand to the other Three or four days after the smokehole thing I spent the rest of the summer in a cast remember Richie slaps his forehead in a gesture they all remember from the old days and Bill thinks with a mixture of amusement and unease that for a moment there Richie looked just like Beaver Cleaver sure of course You were in a cast when we went to the house on Neibolt Street werent you And later in the dark But now Richie shakes his head a little puzzled Cant remember that part yet Richie admits Can you Bill shakes his head slowly Hockstetter was with them that day Eddie says It was the last time I ever saw him alive Maybe he was a replacement for Peter Gordon I guess Bowers didnt want Peter around anymore after he ran the day of the rockfight They all died didnt they Beverly asks quietly After Jimmy Cullum the only ones who died were Henry Bowerss friends or his exfriends All but Bowers Mike agrees glancing toward the balloons tethered to the microfilm recorder And hes in Juniper Hill A private insane asylum in Augusta Your stutters getting worse Big Bill Eddie says solemnly and finishes his drink in one gulp Tell us Beverly repeats and puts her hand lightly on his arm The pain flares there again All right Eddie says He pours himself a fresh drink studies it and says It was a couple of days after I came home from the hospital that you guys came over to the house and showed me those silver ballbearings You remember Bill Eddie looks at Beverly Bill asked you if youd shoot them if it came to that because you had the best eye I think you said you wouldnt that youd be too afraid And you told us something else but I just cant remember what it was Its like Eddie sticks his tongue out and plucks the end of it as if something were stuck there Richie and Ben both grin Was it something about Hockstetter It was after that after all you guys left that my mother came in and we had a big fight She didnt want me to hang around with any of you guys again And she might have gotten me to agreeshe had a way a way of working on a guy you know Bill nods again He remembers Mrs Kaspbrak a huge woman with a strange schizophrenic face a face capable of looking stony and furious and miserable and frightened all at the same time Yeah she might have gotten me to agree Eddie says But something else happened the same day Bowers broke my arm Something that really shook me up He utters a little laugh thinking It shook me up all right Is that all you can say What goods talking when you can never tell people how you really feel In a book or a movie what I found out that day before Bowers broke my arm would have changed my life forever and nothing would have happened the way it did in a book or a movie it would have set me free In a book or a movie I wouldnt have a whole suitcase full of pills back in my room at the Town House I wouldnt be married to Myra I wouldnt have this stupid fucking aspirator here right now In a book or a movie Because Suddenly as they all watch Eddies aspirator rolls across the table by itself As it rolls it makes a dry rattling sound a little like maracas a little like bones a little like laughter As it reaches the far side between Richie and Ben it flips itself up into the air and falls on the floor Richie makes a startled halfgrab and Bill cries sharply dont tttouch it Both balloons tethered to the microfilm recorder now read ASTHMA MEDICINE GIVES YOU CANCER Below the slogan are grinning skulls Eddie looks at this mouth dry the familiar sensation of suffocation starting to tighten down in his chest like locking bolts Bill looks back at him Who ttold you and wwwhat did they tell you Eddie licks his lips wanting to go after his aspirator not quite daring to Who knew what might be in it now He thinks about that day the th about how it was hot about how his mother gave him a check all filled out except for the amount and a dollar in cash for himselfhis allowance Mr Keene he says and his voice sounds distant to his own ears without power It was Mr Keene Not exactly the nicest man in Derry Mike says but Eddie lost in his thoughts barely hears him Yes it was hot that day but cool inside the Center Street Drug the wooden fans turning leisurely below the pressedtin ceiling and there was that comforting smell of mixed powders and nostrums This was the place where they sold healththat was his mothers unstated but clearly communicated conviction and with his bodyclock set at halfpast eleven Eddie had no suspicion that his mother might be wrong about that or anything else Well Mr Keene sure put an end to that he thinks now with a kind of sweet anger He remembers standing at the comic rack for awhile spinning it idly to see if there were any new Batmans or Superboys or his own favorite Plastic Man He had given his mothers list she sent him to the drugstore as other boys mothers might send them to the comer grocery and his mothers check to Mr Keene he would fill the order and then write in the amount on the check giving Eddie the receipt so she could deduct the amount from her checking balance This was all SOP for Eddie Three different kinds of prescription for his mother plus a bottle of Geritol because she told him mysteriously Its full of iron Eddie and women need more iron than men Also there would be his vitamins a bottle of Dr Swetts Elixir for Children and of course his asthma medicine It was always the same Later he would stop in the Costello Avenue Market with his dollar and get two candybars and a Pepsi He would eat the candy drink the soda and jingle his pocketchange all the way home But this day was different it would end with him in the hospital and that was certainly different but it started being different when Mr Keene called him Because instead of handing him the big white bag full of cures and the receipt admonishing him to put the receipt in his pocket so he wouldnt lose it Mr Keene looked at him thoughtfully and said Come back into the office for a minute Eddie I want to talk to you Eddie only looked at him for a moment bunking a little scared The idea that maybe Mr Keene thought he had been shoplifting flashed briefly through his mind There was that sign by the door that he always read when he came into the Center Street Drug It was written in accusing black letters so large that he bet even Richie Tozier could read it without his glasses SHOPLIFTING is NOT A KICK OR A GROOVE OR A GASSER SHOPLIFTING is A CRIME AND WE WILL PROSECUTE Eddie had never shoplifted anything in his life but that sign always made him feel guiltymade him feel as if Mr Keene knew something about him that he didnt know about himself Then Mr Keene confused him even further by saying How about an icecream soda Oh its on the house I always have one in the office around this time of day Good energy unless you need to watch your weight and Id say neither of us do My wife says I look like stuffed string Your friend there the Hanscom boy hes the one who needs to have a care about his weight What flavor Eddie Well my mother said to get home as soon as I You look like a chocolate man to me Chocolate okay for you Mr Keenes eyes twinkled but it was a dry twinkle like the sun shining on mica in the desert Or so Eddie a fan of such Western writers as Max Brand and Archie Joceylen thought Sure Eddie gave in Something about the way Mr Keene pushed his goldrimmed glasses up on his blade of a nose made him edgy Something about the way Mr Keene seemed both nervous and secretly pleased He didnt want to go into the office with Mr Keene This wasnt about a soda Nope And whatever it was about Eddie had an idea it wasnt such great news Maybe hes going to tell me I got cancer or something Eddie thought wildly That kidcancer Leukemia Jesus Oh dont be so stupid he answered himself back trying to sound in his own mind like Stuttering Bill Stuttering Bill had replaced Jock Mahoney who played the Range Rider on TV Saturday mornings as the great hero of Eddies life In spite of the fact that he couldnt talk right Big Bill always seemed to be on top of things This guys a pharmacist not a doctor for cripes sake But Eddie was still nervous Mr Keene had raised the countergate and was beckoning to Eddie with one bony finger Eddie went but reluctantly Ruby the countergirl was sitting by the cash register and reading a Silver Screen Would you make two icecream sodas Ruby Mr Keene called to her One chocolate one coffee Sure Ruby said marking her place in the magazine with a tinfoil gum wrapper and getting up Come on son Im not going to bite you And Mr Keene actually winked astounding Eddie completely He had never been in back of the counter before and he gazed at all the bottles and pills and jars with interest He would have lingered if he had been on his own examining Mr Keenes mortar and pestle his scales and weights the fishbowls full of capsules But Mr Keene propelled him forward into the office and closed the door firmly behind him When it clicked shut Eddie felt a warning tightness in his chest and fought it There would be a fresh aspirator in with his mothers things and he could have a long satisfying honk on it as soon as he was out of here A bottle of licorice whips stood on the corner of Mr Keenes desk He offered it to Eddie Mr Keene sat down in the swivel chair behind his desk and took one Then he opened his drawer and took something out He put it down next to the tall bottle of licorice whips and Eddie felt real alarm course through him It was an aspirator Mr Keene tilted back in his swivel chair until his head was almost touching the calendar on the wall behind him The picture on the calendar showed more pills It said SQUIBB And and for one nightmare moment when Mr Keene opened his mouth to speak Eddie remembered what had happened in the shoe store when he was just a little kid when his mother had screamed at him for putting his foot in the Xray machine For that one nightmare moment Eddie thought Mr Keene would say Eddie nine out of ten doctors agree that asthma medicine gives you cancer just like the Xray machines they used to have in the shoe stores Youve probably got it already Just thought you ought to know But what Mr Keene did say was so peculiar that Eddie could think of no response at all he could only sit in the straight wooden chair on the other side of Mr Keenes desk like a nit Yes sir Eddie said faintly His breathing was indeed shallowing up He wasnt yet whistling like a teakettle which was how Richie put it Somebody turn Eddie off Hes reached the boil but that might happen at any time He looked longingly at the aspirator on Mr Keenes desk and because something else seemed required he said Ill be twelve in November Mr Keene nodded then leaned forward like a TV pharmacist in a commercial and clasped his hands together His eyeglasses gleamed in the strong light thrown by the overhead fluorescent bars do you know what a placebo is Eddie Nervously taking his best guess Eddie said Those are the things on cows that the milk comes out of arent they Mr Keene laughed and rocked back in his chair No he said and Eddie blushed to the roots of his flattop haircut Now he could hear the whistle creeping into his breathing A placebo He was interrupted by a brisk double tap at the door Without waiting for a comein call Ruby entered with an oldfashioned icecreamsoda glass in each hand Yours must be the chocolate she said to Eddie and gave him a grin He returned it as best he could but his interest in icecream sodas was at its lowest ebb in his entire personal history He felt scared in a way that was both vague and specific it was the way he felt scared when he was sitting on Dr Handors examination table in his underpants waiting for the doctor to come in and knowing his mother was out in the waiting room taking up most of one sofa a book most likely Norman Vincent Peaks The Power of Positive Thinking or Dr Jarviss Vermont Folk Medicine held firmly up to her eyes like a hymnal Stripped of his clothes and defenseless he felt caught between the two of them He sipped some of his soda as Ruby went out hardly tasting it Mr Keene waited until the door was shut and then smiled his dry sunonmica smile again Loosen up Eddie Im not going to bite you or hurt you Eddie nodded because Mr Keene was a grownup and you were supposed to agree with grownups at all costs his mother had taught him that but inside he was thinking Oh Ive heard that bullshit before It was about what the doctor said when he opened his sterilizer and the sharp frightening smell of alcohol drifted out stinging his nostrils That was the smell of shots and this was the smell of bullshit and both came down to the same thing when they said it was just going to be a little prick something you hardly felt at all that meant it was going to hurt plenty He tried another halfhearted suck on his soda straw but it was no good he needed all the space in his narrowing throat just to suck in air He looked at the aspirator sitting in the middle of Mr Keenes blotter wanted to ask for it didnt quite dare A weird thought occurred to him maybe Mr Keene knew he wanted it but didnt dare ask for it that maybe Mr Keene was teasing him Except that was a really stupid idea wasnt it A grownupparticularly a healthdispensing grownupwouldnt tease a little kid that way would he Surely not It wasnt even to be considered because consideration of such an idea might necessitate a terrifying reappraisal of the world as Eddie understood it But there it was there it was so near and yet so far like water just beyond the reach of a man who was dying of thirst in the desert There it was standing on the desk below Mr Keenes smiling mica eyes Eddie wished more than anything else that he was down in the Barrens with his friends around him The thought of a monster some great monster lurking under the city where he had been born and where he had grown up using the sewers and drains to creep from place to placethat was a frightening thought and the thought of actually fighting that creature of taking it on was even more frightening but somehow this was worse How could you fight a grownup who said it wasnt going to hurt when you knew it was How could you fight a grownup who asked you funny questions and said obscurely ominous things like This has gone on long enough And almost idly in a kind of sidethought Eddie discovered one of his childhoods great truths Grownups are the real monsters he thought It was no big deal not a thought that came in a revelatory flash or announced itself with trumpets and bells It just came and was gone almost buried under the stronger overriding thought I want my aspirator and I want to be out of here Loosen up Mr Keene said again Most of your trouble Eddie comes from being so tight and stiff all the time Take your asthma for instance Look here Mr Keene opened his desk drawer fumbled around inside and then brought out a balloon Expanding his narrow chest as much as possible his tie bobbed like a narrow boat riding a mild wave he huffed into it and blew it up CENTER STREET DRUG the balloon said PRESCRIPTIONS SUNDRIES OSTOMY SUPPLIES Mr Keene pinched the balloons rubber neck and held the balloon out in front of him Now pretend for just a moment that this is a lung he said Your lung I should really blow up two of course but since I only had one left from the sale we had just after Christmas Mr Keene could I have my aspirator now Eddies head was starting to pound He could feel his windpipe sealing itself up His heartrate was up and sweat stood out on his forehead His chocolate icecream soda stood on the corner of Mr Keenes desk the cherry on top sinking slowly into a goo of whipped cream In a minute Mr Keene said Pay attention Eddie I want to help you Its time somebody did If Russ Handor isnt man enough to do it Ill have to Your lung is like this balloon except its surrounded by a blanket of muscle these muscles are like the arms of a man operating a bellows you understand In a healthy person those muscles help the lungs to expand and contract easily But if the owner of those healthy lungs is always getting stiff and tight the muscles begin to work against the lungs rather than with them Look Mr Keene wrapped a bunched bony liverspotted hand around the balloon and squeezed The balloon bulged over and under his fist and Eddie winced trying to get ready for the pop Simultaneously he felt his breathing stop altogether He leaned over the desk and grabbed for the aspirator on the blotter His shoulder struck the heavy icecreamsoda glass It toppled off the desk and shattered on the floor like a bomb Eddie heard that only dimly He was clawing the top off the aspirator slamming the nozzle into his mouth triggering it off He took a tearing heaving breath his thoughts a ratrun of panic as they always were at moments like this Please Mommy Im suffocating I cant BREATHE oh my dear God oh dear Jesus meekandmild I cant BREATHE phase I dont want to die dont want to die oh please Then the fog from the aspirator condensed on the swollen walls of his throat and he could breathe again Im sorry he said nearly crying Im sorry about the glass Ill clean it up and pay for it just please dont tell my mother okay Im sorry Mr Keene but I couldnt breathe There was that double tap at the door again and Ruby poked her head in Is everything Well Im sawry Ruby said She rolled her eyes and closed the door Eddies breath was starting to whistle in his throat again He took another pull at the aspirator and then began his fumbling apology once more He ceased only when he saw that Mr Keene was smiling at himthat peculiar dry smile Mr Keenes hands were laced over his middle The balloon lay on his desk A thought came to Eddie he tried to hold it back and couldnt Mr Keene looked as if Eddies asthma attack had tasted better to him than his halffinished coffee soda Dont be concerned he said Ruby will clean up the mess later and if you want to know the truth Im rather glad you broke the glass Because I promise not to tell your mother that you broke it if you promise not to tell her we had this little talk Good Mr Keene said We have an understanding And you feel much better now dont you Why Well because I had my medicine He looked at Mr Keene the way he looked at Mrs Casey in school when he had given an answer he wasnt quite sure of But you didnt have any medicine Mr Keene said You had a placebo A placebo Eddie is something that looks like medicine and tastes like medicine but isnt medicine A placebo isnt medicine because it has no active ingredients Or if it is medicine its medicine of a very special sort Headmedicine Mr Keene smiled do you understand that Eddie Headmedicine Eddie understood all right Mr Keene was telling him he was crazy But through numb lips he said No I dont get you Let me tell you a little story Mr Keene said In a series of medical tests on ulcer patients was run at DePaul University One hundred ulcer patients were given pills They were all told the pills would help their ulcers but fifty of the patients really got placebos They were in fact M ampMs given a uniform pink coating Mr Keene uttered a strange shrill gigglethat of a man describing a prank rather than an experiment Of those one hundred patients ninetythree said they felt a definite improvement and eightyone showed an improvement So what do you think What conclusion do you draw from such an experiment Eddie Mr Keene tapped his head solemnly Most sickness starts in here thats what I think Ive been in this business a long long time and I knew about placebos a mighty stretch of years before those doctors at DePaul University did their study Usually its old folks who end up getting the placebos The old fellow or the old girl will go to the doctor convinced that theyve got heart disease or cancer or diabetes or some damn thing But in a good many cases its nothing like that at all They dont feel good because theyre old thats all But whats a doctor to do Tell them theyre like watches with wornout mainsprings Huh Not likely Doctors like their fees too much And now Mr Keenes face wore an expression somewhere between a smile and a sneer Eddie just sat there waiting for it to be over to be over to be over You didnt have any medicine those words clanged in his mind The doctors dont tell them that and I dont tell them that either Why bother Sometimes an old party will come in with a prescription blank that will say it right out Placebo or grains Blue Skies which was how old Doc Pearson used to put it Mr Keene cackled briefly and then sucked on his coffee soda Well whats wrong with it he asked Eddie and when Eddie only sat there Mr Keene answered his own question Why nothing Nothing at all Placebos are a blessing for old people And then there are other casesfolks with cancer folks with degenerative heart disease folks with terrible things that we dont understand yet some of them children just like you Eddie In cases like that if a placebo makes the patient feel better where is the harm Do you see the harm Eddie No sir Eddie said and looked down at the splatter of chocolate ice cream sodawater whipped cream and broken glass on the floor In the middle of all this was the maraschino cherry as accusing as a bloodclot at a crime scene Looking at this mess made his chest feel tight again Then were like Ike and Mike We think alike Five years ago when Vernon Maitland had cancer of the esophagusa painful painful sort of cancerand the doctors had run out of anything effective they could give him for his pain I came by his hospital room with a bottle of sugarpills He was a special friend you see And I said Vern these are special experimental painpills The doctor doesnt know Im giving them to you so for Gods sake be careful and dont tattle on me They might not work but I think they will Take no more than one a day and only if the pain is especially bad He thanked me with tears in his eyes Tears Eddie And they worked for him Yes They were only sugarpills but they killed most of his pain because pain is here I know it does Mr Keene replied and smiled a maddening complacent grownups smile It works on your chest because it works on your head HydrOx Eddie is water with a dash of camphor thrown in to give it a medicine taste Mr Keene drank some of his soda spooned some of the melting ice cream and fastidiously wiped his chin with his handkerchief while Eddie used his aspirator again No I want to go youve got your money and I want to go Let me finish Mr Keene said so forbiddingly that Eddie sat back in his chair Grownups could be so hateful in their power sometimes So hateful Part of the problem here is that your doctor Russ Handor is weak And pan of the problem is that your mother is determined you are ill You Eddie have been caught in the middle Im not crazy Eddie whispered the words coming out in a bare husk I said Im not crazy Eddie shouted Then immediately a miserable blush rose into his face Mr Keene smiled Think what you like that smile said Think what you like and Ill think what I like All Im telling you Eddie is that youre not physically ill Your lungs dont have asthma your mind does Mr Keene leaned forward looking at him intently over his folded hands Its all a lie Eddie cried surprised the words came out so strongly from his tight chest He was thinking of Bill how Bill would react to such amazing charges Bill would know what to say stutter or not Bill would know how to be brave All a great big lie I do have asthma I do Yes Mr Keene said and now the dry smile had become a weird skeletal grin But who gave it to you Eddie Eddies brain thudded and whirled Oh he felt sick he felt very sick Four years ago in the same year as the DePaul tests oddly enoughDr Handor began prescribing this HydrOx for you That stands for hydrogen and oxygen the two components of water I have condoned this deception since then but I will not condone it anymore Your asthma medicine works on your mind rather than your body Your asthma is the result of a nervous tightening of the diaphragm that is ordered by your mind or your mother Eddie sat in his chair his mind whirling For a moment he considered the possibility that Mr Keene might be telling the truth but there were ramifications in such an idea that he could not face Yet why would Mr Keene lie especially about something so serious Mr Keene sat and smiled his bright dry heartless desert smile I do have asthma I do The day that Henry Bowers punched me in the nose the day Bill and I were trying to make a dam in the Barrens I almost died Am I supposed to think that my mind was just just making all of that up But why would he lie It was only years later in the library that Eddie asked himself the more terrible question Why would he tell me the truth Dimly he heard Mr Keene saying Ive kept my eye on you Eddie I told you all this because youre old enough to understand but also because Ive noticed youve finally made some friends They are good friends arent they Mr Keene tilted his chair back it made that cricketlike noise again and closed one eye in what might or might not have been a wink And Ill bet your mother doesnt like them much does she She likes them fine Eddie said thinking of the cutting things his mother had said about Richie Tozier He has a foul mouth and Ive smelled his breath Eddie I think he smokes her sniffing remark not to loan any money to Stan Uris because he was a Jew her outright dislike of Bill Denbrough and that fatboy Does she Mr Keene said still smiling Well maybe shes right and maybe shes wrong but at least you have friends Maybe you ought to talk to them about this problem of yours This this mental weakness See what they have to say Eddie didnt reply He was through talking to Mr Keene that seemed safer And he was afraid that if he didnt get out of here soon he really would cry Well Mr Keene said standing up I think that just about finishes us up Eddie If Ive upset you Im sorry I was only doing my duty as I saw it I But before he could say any more Eddie had snatched up his aspirator and the white bag of pills and nostrums and had fled One of his feet skidded in the icecreamy mess on the floor and he almost fell Then he was running bolting from the Center Street Drug Store in spite of his whistling breath Ruby stared after him over her movie magazine her mouth open Behind him he seemed to sense Mr Keene standing in the doorway of his office and watching his graceless retreat over the prescription counter gaunt and neat and thoughtful and smiling Smiling that dry desert smile He paused outside on the threeway corner of Kansas Main and Center He took another deep pull from his aspirator while sitting on the low stone wall by the busstophis throat was now positively slimy with that medicinal taste and he thought that if he had to use the aspirator again today he would probably puke his guts He slipped it into his pocket and watched the traffic pass back and forth headed up Main Street and down UpMile Hill He tried not to think The sun beat down on his head blaringly hot Each passing car threw bright darts of reflection into his eyes and a headache was starting in his temples He couldnt find a way to stay angry at Mr Keene but he had no trouble at all feeling bad for Eddie Kaspbrak He felt real bad for Eddie Kaspbrak He supposed that Bill Denbrough never wasted time feeling sorry for himself but Eddie just couldnt seem to help it More than anything else he wanted to do exactly what Mr Keene had suggested go down to the Barrens and tell his friends everything see what they would say find out what answers they had But he couldnt do that now His mother would expect him home with her medicines soon trouble would follow She would assume he had been with Bill or Richie or the Jewboy as she called Stan insisting that she meant no prejudice by so calling him but was simply slapping down the cardsher phrase for truthtelling in difficult situations And standing here on this corner trying hopelessly to sort out his flying thoughts Eddie knew what she would say if she knew one of his other friends was a Negro and another was a girla girl old enough to be getting bosoms He started slowly toward UpMile Hill dreading the stiff climb in this heat It felt almost hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk For the first time he found himself wishing for school to be in again for a new grade and a new teachers peculiarities to contend with For this dreadful summer to be over He stopped halfway up the hill not far from where Bill Denbrough would rediscover his bike Silver twentyseven years later and pulled his aspirator from his pocket HydrOx Mist the label said Administer as needed Something else clicked home Administer as needed He was only a kid still wet behind the ears as his mother sometimes told him when she was slapping down the cards but even a kid of eleven knew that you didnt give someone real medicine and then write on the label Administer as needed If it was real medicine it would be too easy to kill yourself as you went happyassholing around and administering as needed He supposed you could kill yourself with plain old aspirin doing that He looked fixedly at the aspirator unaware of the old lady who glanced curiously at him as she passed on down the hill toward Main Street with her shopping basket over her arm He felt betrayed And for one moment he almost cast the plastic squeezebottle into the gutterbetter yet he thought throw it down that sewergrating Sure Why not Let It have it down there in Its tunnels and dripping sewerpipes Have a placeebo you hundredfaced creep He uttered a wild laugh and came within an ace of doing it But in the end habit was simply too strong He replaced the aspirator in his right front pants pocket and walked on hardly hearing the occasional blare of a horn or the diesel drone of the Bassey Park bus as it passed him He was likewise unaware of how close he was to discovering what being hurtreally hurtwas all about When he came out of the Costello Avenue Market twentyfive minutes later with a Pepsi in one hand and two Payday candybars in the other Eddie was unpleasantly surprised to see Henry Bowers Victor Criss Moose Sadler and Patrick Hockstetter kneeling on the crushed gravel to the left of the little store For a moment Eddie thought they were shooting craps then he saw they were pooling their money on Victors baseball shirt Their summerschool textbooks lay off to one side in an untidy heap On an ordinary day Eddie might have simply faded quietly back into the store and asked Mr Gedreau if he could leave by the back door but this had been no ordinary day Eddie froze right where he was instead one hand still holding the screen door with its tin cigarette signs WINSTON TASTES GOOD LIKE A CIGARETTE SHOULD TWENTYONE GREAT TOBACCOS MAKE TWENTY WONDERFUL SMOKES the bellboy who was shouting CALL FOR PHILIP MORRIS the other clutching the brown grocery bag and the white drugstore bag Victor Criss saw him and elbowed Henry Henry looked up so did Patrick Hockstetter Moose whose relays worked more slowly went on counting out pennies for five seconds or so before the sudden silence sank into him and he also looked up Henry stood brushing loose pieces of gravel from the knees of the biballs he was wearing There were splints on the sides of his bandaged nose and his voice had a nasal foghorning quality Well I be go to hell he said One of the rockthrowers Wheres your friends asshole They inside Eddie was shaking his head numbly before he realized this was another mistake Henrys smile broadened Well thats okay he said I dont mind taking you one by one Come on down here asshole Victor stood beside Henry Patrick Hockstetter trailed behind them smiling in a porky vacant way Eddie was familiar with from school Moose was still getting up Come on asshole Henry said Lets talk about throwing rocks Lets talk about that you wanna Now that it was too late Eddie decided it would be wise to go back into the store Back in the store where there was a grownup But as he retreated Henry darted forward and grabbed him He pulled Eddies arm pulled hard his smile turning into a snarl Eddies hand was ripped free of the screen door He was pulled off the steps and would have crashed headlong into the gravel if Victor hadnt caught him roughly under the arms Victor threw him Eddie managed to keep on his feet but only by whirling around twice The four boys faced him now over a distance of about ten feet Henry slightly ahead of the others smiling His hair stood up at the back in a cowlick Behind Henry and on his left was Patrick Hockstetter a genuinely spooky kid Eddie hadnt ever seen him with anyone else until today He was just enough overweight so that his belly always hung slightly over his belt which had a Red Ryder buckle His face was perfectly round and usually as pale as cream Now he had a slight sunburn It was heaviest on his nose which was peeling but it spread out toward either cheek like wings In school Patrick liked to kill flies with his green plastic SkoolTime ruler and put them in his pencilbox Sometimes he would show his fly collection to some new kid in the playyard at recess his heavy lips smiling his graygreen eyes sober and thoughtful He never spoke when he exhibited his dead flies no matter what the new kid might say to him That expression was on his face now How ya doin Rock Man Henry asked advancing across the distance between them Got any rocks on you Leave me alone Henry mimicked waving his hands in mock terror Victor laughed What are you going to do if I dont Rock Man Huh His hand flashed out incredibly fast and exploded against Eddies cheek with a gunshot sound Eddies head rocked back Tears began to pour from his left eye My friends are inside Patrick Hockstetter squealed Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh He began to circle to Eddies right Eddie started to turn in that direction Henrys hand flashed out again and this time his other cheek flamed Dont cry he thought thats what they want but dont you do it Eddie Bill wouldnt do it Bill wouldnt cry and dont you cry eith Victor stepped forward and gave Eddie a hard openhanded push in the middle of his chest Eddie stumbled half a step backward and then fell sprawling over Patrick who had crouched directly behind his feet He thudded to the gravel scraping his arms There was a whoof as the wind rushed out of him A moment later Henry Bowers was on top of him his knees pinning Eddies arms his butt on Eddies stomach Got any rocks Rock Man Henry raved down at him and Eddie was more frightened by the mad light in Henrys eyes than he was by the pain in his arms or by his inability to get his breath back Henry was nuts Somewhere close by Patrick Uttered You wanna throw rocks Huh Ill give you rocks Here Heres some rocks Henry swept up a handful of gravel and slammed it down into Eddies face He rubbed the gravel into Eddies skin cutting his cheeks his eyelids his lips Eddie opened his mouth and screamed Want rocks Ill give you rocks Heres some rocks Rock Man You want rocks Okay Okay Okay Gravel slammed into his open mouth lacerating his gums grinding against his teeth He felt sparks fly against his fillings He screamed again and spat gravel out Want some more rocks Okay How about a few more How about Stop that Here here Stop that You boy Quit on him Right now You hear me Quit on him Through halflidded tearblurred eyes Eddie saw a big hand come down and grab Henry by the collar of his shirt and the right strap of his biballs The hand gave a yank and Henry was pulled off He landed in the gravel and got up Eddie rose more slowly He was trying to scramble to his feet but his scrambler seemed temporarily broken He gasped and spat chunks of bloody gravel out of his mouth It was Mr Gedreau dressed in his long white apron and he looked furious There was no fear in his face although Henry stood about three inches taller and probably outweighed him by fifty pounds There was no fear in his face because he was the grownup and Henry was the kid Except this time Eddie thought that might not mean anything Mr Gedreau didnt understand He didnt understand that Henry was nuts You get out of here Mr Gedreau said advancing on Henry until he stood toe to toe with the hulking sullenfaced boy You get out and you dont want to come back either I dont hold with bullying I dont hold with four against one What would your mothers think He swept the others with his hot angry eyes Moose and Victor dropped their gazes and examined their sneakers Patrick only stared at and through Mr Gedreau with that vacant graygreen look Mr Gedreau looked back at Henry and got just as far as You get on your bikes and when Henry gave him a good hard push An expression of surprise that would have been comical in other circumstances spread across Mr Gedreaus face as he flew backward loose gravel spurting out from under his heels He struck the steps leading up to the screen door and sat down hard You Mr Gedreau said and this time he stopped on his own Mr Gedreau had finally seen it Eddie realizedthe light in Henrys eyes He got up quickly apron flapping He went up the stairs as fast as he could stumbling on the second one from the top and going briefly to one knee He was up again at once but that stumble as brief as it had been seemed to rob him of the rest of his grownup authority He spun around at the top and yelled Im calling the cops Henry made as if to lunge for him and Mr Gedreau flinched back That was the end Eddie realized As incredible as unthinkable as it seemed there was no protection for him here It was time to go While Henry was standing at the bottom of the steps and glaring up at Mr Gedreau and while the others were staring transfixed and except for Patrick Hockstetter not a little horrified by this sudden successful defiance of adult authority Eddie saw his chance He whirled took to his heels and ran He was halfway up the block before Henry turned his eyes blazing Get him he bellowed Asthma or no asthma Eddie ran them a good race that day There were spaces some of them as long as fifty feet when he couldnt remember if the soles of his PP Flyers had touched the sidewalk or not For a few moments he even entertained the giddy notion that he might be able to outrun them Then just before he reached Kansas Street and what might have been safety a little kid on a trike suddenly pedaled out of a driveway and right into Eddies path Eddie tried to swerve but running fullout as he had been he might have done better to jump over the kid the kids name in fact was Richard Cowan and he would grow up marry and father a son named Frederick Cowan who would be drowned in a toilet and then be partially eaten by a thing that rose up from the toilet like black smoke and then took an unthinkable shape or at least to try One of Eddies feet caught on the trikes back deck where an adventurous little shit might stand and push the trike along like a scooter Richard Cowan whose unborn son would be murdered by It twentyseven years later barely rocked on his trike Eddie however went flying He struck the sidewalk on his shoulder rebounded came down again and skidded ten feet erasing the skin from his elbows and knees He was trying to get up when Henry Bowers hit him like a shell from a bazooka and knocked him flat Eddies nose connected briskly with the concrete Blood flew Henry did a quick sideroll like a paratrooper and was up again He grabbed Eddie by the nape of the neck and by his right wrist His breath snorting through his swelled and splinted nose was warm and moist Want rocks Rock Man Sure Shit He jerked Eddies wrist halfway up his back Eddie yelled Rocks for the Rock Man right Rock Man He jerked Eddies wrist up even higher Eddie screamed Behind him dimly he could hear the others approaching and the little kid on the trike starting to bawl Join the club kid he thought and in spite of the pain in spite of the tears and the fear he brayed a huge donkeylike heehaw of laughter You think this is funny Henry asked sounding suddenly astounded rather than furious You think this is funny And did Henry also sound scared Years later Eddie would think Yes scared he sounded scared Eddie twisted his wrist in Henrys grip He was slick with sweat and he almost got away Perhaps that was why Henry shoved Eddies wrist up harder this time than before Eddie heard a crack in his arm like the sound of winterwood giving under an accumulated plate of ice The pain that rolled out of his fractured arm was gray and huge He shrieked but the sound seemed distant The color was washing out of the world and when Henry let go of him and pushed he seemed to float toward the sidewalk It took a long time to get down to that old sidewalk He had a good look at every single crack in it as he glided down He had a chance to admire the way the July sun glinted off the flecks of mica in that old sidewalk He had a chance to note the remains of a very old hopscotch grid that had been done in pink chalk on that old sidewalk Then for just a moment it swam and looked like something else It looked like a turtle He might have fainted then but he struck on his newly broken arm and this fresh pain was sharp bright hot terrible He felt the splintered ends of the greenstick fracture grind together He bit his tongue bringing fresh blood He rolled over on his back and saw Henry Victor Moose and Patrick standing over him They looked impossibly tall impossibly high up like pallbearers peering into a grave You like that Rock Man Henry asked his voice drifting down over a distance floating through clouds of pain You like that action Rock Man You like that jobbanobba Your fathers crazy Eddie heard himself say and so are you Henrys grin faded so fast it might have been slapped off his face He drew his foot back to kick and then a siren rose in the still hot afternoon Henry paused Victor and Moose looked around uneasily Henry I think we better get out of here Moose said I know damn well Im getting out of here Victor said How far away their voices seemed Like the clowns balloons they seemed to float Victor took off toward the library cutting into McCarron Park to get off the street Henry hesitated a moment longer perhaps hoping the copcar was on some other business and he could continue with his own But the siren rose again closer You got lucky fuckface he said He and Moose took off after Victor Patrick Hockstetter waited for a moment Heres a little something extra for you he whispered in his low husky voice He inhaled and spat a large green lunger into Eddies upturned sweating bloody face Splat dont eat it all at once if you dont want Patrick said smiling his liverish unsettling smile save some for later if you want Eddie tried to wipe the lunger off with his good arm but even that little movement made the pain flare again Now when you started off for the drugstore you never thought youd end up on the Costello Avenue sidewalk with a busted arm and Patrick Hockstetters snot running down your face did you You never even got to drink your Pepsi Lifes full of surprises isnt it Incredibly he laughed again It was a weak sound and it hurt his broken arm to laugh but it felt good And there was something else no asthma His breathing was okay at least for now A good thing too He never would have been able to get to his aspirator Never in a thousand years The siren was very close now whooping and whooping Eddie closed his eyes and saw red under his eyelids Then the red turned black as a shadow fell over him It was the little kid with the trike No you look terrible the little kid said and pedaled off singing The Farmer in the Dell Eddie began to giggle Here was the copcar he could hear the squeal of its brakes He found himself hoping vaguely that Mr Nell would be in it even though he knew Mr Nell was a foot patrolman He didnt know any more than he knew why he should feel in spite of the pain such intense relief Was it maybe just because he was still alive that the worst he had suffered was a broken arm and there were still some pieces to pick up He settled for that but years later sitting in the Derry Library with a glass of gin and prune juice in front of him and his aspirator near at hand he told the others he thought it was something more than that he had been old enough to feel that something more but not to understand or define it I think it was the first real pain I ever felt in my life he would tell the others It wasnt what I thought it would be at all It didnt put an end to me as a person I think it gave me a basis for comparison finding out you could still exist inside the pain in spite of the pain Eddie turned his head weakly to the right and saw large black Firestone tires blinding chrome hubcaps and pulsing blue lights He heard Mr Nells voice then thickly Irish impossibly Irish more like Richies Irish Cop Voice than Mr Nells real voice but perhaps that was the distance There was a brief period of consciousness in the ambulance He saw Mr Nell sitting across from him tipping a drink from his little brown bottle and reading a paperback called The Jury The girl on the cover had the biggest bosoms Eddie had ever seen His eyes shifted past Mr Nell to the driver up front The driver peered around at Eddie with a big leering grin his skin livid with greasepaint and talcum powder his eyes shiny as new quarters It was Pennywise Mr Nell looked up and smiled How are you feelin me bye Yes well be there in a jig Mr Nell said and handed him the little brown bottle suck some of this Itll make ye feel better Eddie drank what tasted like liquid fire He coughed hurting his arm He looked toward the front and saw the driver again Just some guy with a crewcut No clown Much later there was the Emergency Room and a nurse wiping blood and dirt and snot and gravel off his face with a cold cloth It stung but it felt wonderful at the same time He heard his mother bugling and clarioning outside and he tried to tell the nurse not to let her in but no words would come out no matter how hard he tried if hes dying I want to know his mother was bellowing You hear me Its my right to know and its my right to see him I can sue you you know I know lawyers plenty of lawyers Some of my best friends are lawyers Dont try to talk the nurse said to Eddie She was young and he could feel her bosoms pressing against his arm For a moment he had this crazy idea that the nurse was Beverly Marsh and then he drifted away again When he came back his mother was in the room talking to Dr Handor at a mileaminute clip Sonia Kaspbrak was a huge woman Her legs encased in support hose were trunklike but weirdly smooth Her face was pale now except for hectic flaring blots of rouge Youre not youre not Mrs Kaspbrak moaned She wrung her hands Eddie heard her knuckles crack and grind He began to feel his breath shorten up as he looked at her seeing what a state she was in how this latest escapade of his had hurt her He wanted to tell her to take it easy or shed have a heart attack but he couldnt His throat was too dry Youre not all right youve had a serious accident a very serious accident but you will be all right I promise you that Eddie you will be all right even if we need to bring in every specialist in the book oh Eddie Eddie your poor arm She burst into honking sobs Eddie saw that the nurse who had washed his face was looking at her without much sympathy All through this aria Dr Handor had been stuttering sonia please Sonia Sonia He was a skinny limplooking man with a little mustache that hadnt grown very well and which in addition had been clipped unevenly so it was longer on the left side than on the right He looked nervous Eddie remembered what Mr Keene had told him that morning and felt a certain sorrow for Dr Handor At last gathering himself Russ Handor managed to say If you cant control yourself youll have to leave Sonia She whirled on him and he drew back Ill do no such thing Dont you even suggest it This is my son lying here in agony My son lying here on his bed of pain Eddie astounded them all by finding his voice I want you to leave Ma If theyre going to do something thatll make me yell and I think they are youll feel better if you go She turned to him astonished and hurt At the sight of the hurt on her face he felt his chest begin to tighten down inexorably I certainly will not she cried What an awful thing to say Eddie Youre delirious You dont understand what youre saying thats the only explanation I dont know what the explanation is and I dont care the nurse said All I know is that were standing here doing nothing while we should be setting your sons arm Are you suggesting Sonia began her voice rising toward the high bugling note it took on when she was most upset Please Sonia Dr Handor said Lets not have an argument here Lets help Eddie Sonia stood back but her glowering eyesthe eyes of a mother bear whose cub has been threatenedpromised the nurse that there would be trouble later Possibly even a suit Then her eyes misted extinguishing the glower or at least hiding it She took Eddies good hand and squeezed it so painfully that he winced Its bad but youll be well again soon she said Well again soon I promise you that Of course she said Sonia Kaspbrak looked at the nurse triumphantly as if vindicated of some ridiculous criminal charge My son has asthma she said Its quite serious but he copes with it beautifully His ma held the aspirator for him so he could inhale A moment later Dr Handor was feeling Eddies broken arm He was as gentle as possible but the pain was still enormous Eddie felt like screaming and gritted his teeth against it He was afraid if he screamed his mother would scream too Sweat stood out on his forehead in large clear drops Youre hurting him Mrs Kaspbrak said I know you are Theres no need of that Stop it Theres no need for you to hurt him Hes very delicate he cant stand that sort of pain Eddie saw the nurse lock her furious eyes with Dr Handors tired worried ones He saw the wordless conversation that passed between them Send that woman out of here doctor And in the drop of his eyes I cant I dont dare There was great clarity inside the pain although in truth this was not a clarity that Eddie would want to experience often the price was too high and in that unspoken conversation Eddie accepted everything Mr Keene had told him His HydrOx aspirator was filled with nothing more than flavored water The asthma wasnt in his throat or his chest or his lungs but in his head Somehow or other he was going to have to deal with that truth He looked at his mother seeing her clear in his pain each flower on her Lane Bryant dress the sweatstains under her arms where the pads she wore had soaked through the scuffmarks on her shoes He saw how small her eyes were in their pockets of flesh and now a terrible thought came to him those eyes were almost predatory like the eyes of the leper that had crawled out of the basement at Neibolt Street Here I come thats all right it wont do you any good to run Eddie Dr Handor put his hands gently around Eddies broken arm and squeezed The pain exploded They gave him some liquid to drink and Dr Handor set the fracture He heard Dr Handor telling his ma that it was a greenstick fracture no more serious than any childhood break Its the sort of break kids get falling out of trees he said and Eddie heard his ma respond furiously Eddie doesnt climb trees Now I want the truth How bad is he Then the nurse was giving him a pill He felt her bosoms against his shoulder again and was grateful for their comforting pressure Even through the haze he could see that the nurse was angry and he thought he said Shes not the leper please dont think that shes only eating me because she loves me but perhaps nothing came out because the nurses angry face didnt change He had a faint recollection of being pushed up a corridor in a wheelchair and his mothers voice somewhere behind fading What do you mean visiting hours Dont talk to me about visiting hours thats my son Fading He was glad she was fading glad he was fading The pain was gone and the clarity was gone with it He didnt want to think He wanted to drift He was aware that his right arm felt very heavy He wondered if they had put it in a cast yet He couldnt seem to see if they had or not He was vaguely aware of radios playing from rooms of patients who looked like ghosts in their hospital johnnies walking up and down the wide halls and that it was hot so very hot When he was wheeled into his room he could see the sun going down in an angry orange boil of blood and thought incoherently Like a great big clownbutton Come on Eddie you can walk a voice was saying and he found that he could He was slid between crisp cool sheets The voice told him that he would have some pain in the night but not to ring for a painkiller unless it got very bad Eddie asked if he could have a drink of water The water came with a straw that had an accordion middle so you could bend it It was cool and good He drank it all There was pain in the night a good deal of it He lay awake in bed holding the callbutton in his left hand but not pressing it A thunderstorm was going on outside and when the lightning flashed bluewhite he turned his head away from the windows afraid he might see a monstrous grinning face etched across the sky in that electric fire At last he slept again and in his sleep he had a dream In it he saw Bill Ben Richie Stan Mike and Bevhis friendsarriving at the hospital on their bikes Bill was riding Richie double on Silver He was surprised to see that Beverly was wearing a dressit was a lovely green the color of the Caribbean in a National Geographic plate He couldnt remember if he had ever seen her in a dress before all he remembered were jeans and pedalpushers and what the girls called schoolsets skirts and blouses the blouses usually white with round collars the skirts usually brown and pleated and hemmed at midshin so that the scabs on their knees didnt show In the dream he saw them coming in for the PM visiting hours and his mother who had been waiting patiently since eleven shouting so loudly at them that everyone turned to look at her If you think youre going to go in there youve got another think coming Eddies mother shouted and now the clown who had been sitting here in the waiting room all along but way back in one corner with a copy of Look magazine held up in front of his face until now jumped up and mimed applause patting his whitegloved hands together rapidly He capered and danced now turning a cartwheel now executing a neat backover flip as Mrs Kaspbrak ranted at Eddies fellow Losers and as they shrank one by one behind Bill who only stood there pale but outwardly calm his hands stuffed deep into the pockets of his jeans maybe so no one including Bill himself would be able to see if they were shaking or not No one saw the clown except Eddie although a baby who had been sleeping peacefully in his mothers arms awoke and began to cry lustily Youve done enough damage Eddies ma shouted I know who those boys were Theyve been in trouble at school theyve even been in trouble with the police And just because those boys have something against you is no reason for them to have something against him I told him so and he agrees with me He wants me to tell you to go away hes done with you he never wants to see any of you again He doesnt want your socalled friendship anymore Any of you I knew it would lead to trouble and look at this My Eddie in the hospital A boy as delicate as he is The clown capered and jumped and did splits and stood on one hand Its smile was real enough now and in his dream Eddie realized that this was of course what the clown wanted a nice big wedge to drive among them splitting them apart and destroying any chance of concerted action In a kind of filthy ecstasy the clown did a double barrelroll and burlesqued kissing his mothers cheek Dont you speak back to me Mrs Kaspbrak shrieked Dont you dare speak back to me Hes done with you I say Done Then an intern came running into the waiting room and told Eddies ma she would have to be quiet or leave the hospital The clown started to fade started to wash out and as it did it began to change Eddie saw the leper the mummy the bird he saw the werewolf and a vampire whose teeth were Gillette BlueBlades set at crazy angles like mirrors in a carnival mirrormaze he saw Frankenstein the creature and something fleshy and shelllike that opened and closed like a mouth he saw a dozen other terrible things a hundred But just before the clown washed out completely he saw the most terrible thing of all his mas face Nol he tried to scream No No Not her Not my ma But no one looked around no one heard And in the dreams fading moments he realized with a cold and wormy horror that they couldnt hear nun He was dead It had killed him and he was dead He was a ghost Sonia Kaspbraks soursweet triumph at sending Eddies socalled friends away evaporated almost as soon as she stepped into Eddies private room the next afternoon on the st of July She could not tell exactly why the feeling of triumph should fade like that or why it should be displaced by an unfocused fear it was something in her sons pale face which was not blurred with pain or anxiety but instead bore an expression she could not remember ever having seen there before It was sharp somehow Sharp and alert and set The confrontation between Eddies friends and Eddies ma had not occurred in the waiting room as in Eddies dream she had known they would be comingEddies friends who were probably teaching him to smoke cigarettes in spite of his asthma his friends who had such an unhealthy hold over him that they were all he talked about when he came home for the evening his friends who got his arm broken She had told all of this to Mrs Van Prett next door The time has come Mrs Kaspbrak had said grimly to slap a few cards down on the table Mrs Van Prett who had horrible skinproblems and who could almost always be counted upon to agree eagerly almost pathetically with everything Sonia Kaspbrak said in this case had the temerity to disagree I should think youd be glad hes made some friends Mrs Van Prett said as they hung out their washes in the earlymorning cool before workthis had been during the first week of July And hes safer if hes with other children Mrs Kaspbrak dont you think so With all thats going on in this town and all the poor children that have been murdered Mrs Kaspbraks only reply had been an angry sniff in fact she couldnt just then think of an adequate verbal response although she thought of dozenssome of them extremely cuttinglater on and when Mrs Van Prett called her that evening sounding rather anxious to ask if Mrs Kaspbrak would be going to the Beano down at Saint Marys with her like usual Mrs Kaspbrak had replied coldly that she believed she would just stay home that evening and put her feet up instead Well she hoped Mrs Van Prett was satisfied now She hoped Mrs Van Prett saw now that the only danger abroad in Derry this summer wasnt the sexmaniac killing children and babies Here was her son lying on his bed of pain in Derry Home Hospital he might never be able to use his good right arm again she had heard of such things or God forbid loose splinters from the break might work through his bloodstream to his heart and puncture it and kill him oh of course God would never allow that to happen but she had heard of it happening so that meant God could allow such a thing to happen In certain cases So she lingered on the Home Hospitals long and shady front porch knowing they would show up coldly determined to put paid to this socalled friendship this camaraderie that ended in broken arms and beds of pain once and for all Eventually they came as she had known they would and to her horror she saw that one of them was a nigger Not that she had anything against niggers she thought they had every right to ride where they wanted to on the buses down south and eat at white lunchcounters and should not be made to sit in nigger heaven at the movies unless they bothered white people but she also believed firmly in what she called the Bird Theory Blackbirds flew with other blackbirds not with the robins Crackles roosted with grackles they did not mix in with the bluebirds or the nightingales To each his own was her motto and seeing Mike Hanlon pedal up with the others just as if he belonged there caused her resolution like her anger and her dismay to grow apace She thought reproachfully as if Eddie were here and could listen to her You never told me that one of your friends was a nigger Well she thought twenty minutes later stepping into the hospital room where her son lay with his arm in a huge cast that was strapped to his chest it hurt her heart just to look at it she had sent them packing in jig time no pun intended None of them except for the Denbrough boy the one who had such a horrible stutter had had the nerve to so much as speak back to her The girl whoever she was had flashed a pair of decidedly slutty jades eyes at Soniafrom Lower Main Street or someplace even worse had been Sonia Kaspbraks opinionbut she had wisely kept her mouth shut If she had dared so much as to let out a peep Sonia would have given her a piece of her mind would have told her what sort of girls ran with the boys There were names for girls like that and she would not have her son associated now or ever with the girls who bore them The others had done no more than look down at their shuffling feet That was about what she had expected When she was done saying what she had to say they had gotten on their bikes and ridden away The Denbrough boy had the Tozier boy riding double behind him on a huge unsafelooking bike and with an interior shudder Mrs Kaspbrak had wondered how many times her Eddie had ridden on that dangerous bike risking his arms and his legs and his neck and his life I did this for you Eddie she thought as she walked into the hospital with her head firmly up I know you may feel a bit disappointed at first thats natural enough But parents know better than their children the reason God made parents in the first place was to guide instruct and protect After his initial disappointment he would understand And if she felt a certain relief now it was of course on Eddies behalf and not on her own Relief was only to be expected when you had saved your son from bad companions Except that her sense of relief was marred by fresh unease now looking into Eddies face He was not asleep as she had thought he would be Instead of a drugged doze from which he would wake disoriented dimwitted and psychologically vulnerable there was this sharp watchful look so different from Eddies usual soft tentative glance Like Ben Hanscom although Sonia did not know this Eddie was the sort of boy who would look quickly into a face as if to test the emotional weather brewing there and glance just as quickly away But he was looking at her steadily now perhaps its the medication she thought of course thats it Ill have to consult with Dr Handor about his medication and she was the one who felt a need to glance aside He looks like hes been waiting for me she thought and it was a thought that should have made her happya boy waiting for his mother must surely be one of Gods most favored creations You sent my friends away The words came out flatly with no doubt or question in them She flinched almost guiltily and certainly the first thought to flash through her mind was a guilty oneHow does he know that He cant know thatand she was immediately furious with herself and him for feeling that way So she smiled at him That was the right response Someonesome foolish candystriper or perhaps even that incompetent and antagonistic nurse from the day beforehad been carrying tales Someone How are we feeling she asked again when he didnt respond She thought he hadnt heard her Shed never read in any of her medical literature of a broken bone affecting the sense of hearing but she supposed it was possible anything was possible She came farther into the room hating the tentative almost timid feeling inside her distrusting it because she had never felt tentative or timid around Eddie before She felt anger as well although that was still nascent What right did he have to make her feel that way after all she had done for him after all she had sacrificed for him Ive talked to Dr Handor and he assures me that youre going to be perfectly all right Sonia said briskly sitting down in the straightbacked wooden chair by the bed Of course if theres the slightest problem well go to see a specialist in Portland In Boston if thats what it takes She smiled as if conferring a great favor Eddie did not smile back And still he did not reply Yes she said dropping the pretense and said no more Two could play at that game She simply looked back at him But a strange thing happened a terrible thing really Eddies eyes seemed to to grow somehow The flecks of gray in them seemed actually to be moving like racing stormclouds She became aware suddenly that he was not in a snit or having a poopie or any of those things He was furious with her and Sonia was suddenly scared because something more than her son seemed to be in this room She dropped her eyes and fumbled her purse open She began searching for a Kleenex Yes I sent them away she said and found that her voice was strong enough and steady enough as long as she wasnt looking at him Youve been seriously injured Eddie You dont need any visitors right now except for your own ma and you dont need visitors like that ever If it hadnt been for them youd be home watching the TV right now or building your soapbox racer in the garage It was Eddies dream to build a soapbox racer and take it to Bangor If he won there he would be awarded an allexpensespaid trip to Akron Ohio for the National Soapbox Derby Sonia was perfectly willing to allow him this dream as long as it seemed to her that completion of the racer which was made out of orange crates and the wheels from a ChooChoo Flyer wagon was just thata dream She certainly had no intention of letting Eddie risk his life in such a dangerous contraption not in Derry not in Bangor and certainly not in Akron which Eddie had informed her would mean riding in an airplane as well as making a suicidal run down a steep hill in a wheeled orange crate with no brakes But as her own mother had often said what a person didnt know couldnt hurt him her mother had also been fond of saying Tell the truth and shame the devil but when it came to the recollection of aphorisms Sonia like most people could be remarkably selective My friends didnt break my arm Eddie said in that same flat voice I told Dr Handor last night and I told Mr Nell when he came in this morning Henry Bowers broke my arm Some other kids were with him but Henry did it If Id been with my friends it never would have happened It happened because I was alone This made Sonia think of Mrs Van Pretts comment about how it was safer to have friends and that brought the rage back like a tiger She snapped her head up That doesnt matter and you know it What do you think Eddie That your ma fell off a haytruck yesterday Is that what you think I know well enough why the Bowers boy broke your arm That Paddy cop was at our house too That big boy broke your arm because you and your friends crossed him somehow Now do you think that would have happened if youd listened to me and stayed away from them in the first place NoI think that something even worse might have happened Eddie said I mean it he said and she felt that power coming off him coming out of him in waves Bill and the rest of my friends will be back Ma Thats something I know And when they come youre not going to stop them Youre not going to say a word to them Theyre my friends and youre not going to steal my friends just because youre scared of being alone She stared at him flabbergasted and terrified Tears filled her eyes and spilled down her cheeks wetting the powder there This is how you talk to your mother now I guess she said through her sobs Maybe this is the way your friends talk to their folks I guess you learned it from them She felt safer in her tears Usually when she cried Eddie cried too A low weapon some might say but were there really any low weapons when it came to protecting her son She thought not She looked up the tears streaming from her eyes feeling both unutterably sad bereft betrayed and sure Eddie would not be able to stand against such a flood of tears and sorrow That cold sharp look would leave his face Perhaps he would begin to gasp and wheeze a little bit and that would be a sign as it was always a sign that the fight was over and that she had won another victory for him of course Always for him She was so shocked to see that same expression on his faceit had if anything deepenedthat her voice caught in midsob There was sorrow under his expression but even that was frightening it struck her in some way as an adult sorrow and thinking of Eddie as adult in any way always caused a panicky little bird to flutter inside her mind This was how she felt on the infrequent occasions when she wondered what would happen to her if Eddie didnt want to go to Derry Business College or the University of Maine in Orono or Husson in Bangor so he could come home every day after his classes were done what would happen if he met a girl fell in love wanted to get married Wheres the place for me in any of that the panicky birdvoice would cry when these strange almost nightmarish thoughts came Where would my place be in a life like that I love you Eddie I love you I take care of you and I love you You dont know how to cook or change your sheets or wash your underwear Why should you I know those things for you I know because I love you He said it himself now I love you Ma But I love my friends too I think I think youre making yourself cry Eddie you hurt me so much she whispered and fresh tears doubled his pale face trebled it If her tears a few moments ago had been calculated these were not In her own peculiar way she was toughshe had seen her husband into his grave without cracking up she had gotten a job in a depressed jobmarket where it wasnt easy to get a job she had raised her son and when it had been necessary she had fought for him These were the first totally unaffected and uncalculated tears she had wept in years perhaps since Eddie had gotten the bronchitis when he was five and she had been so sure he would die as he lay there in his bed of pain glowing bright with fever whooping and coughing and gasping for breath She wept now because of that terribly adult somehow alien expression on his face She was afraid for him but she was also in some way afraid of him afraid of that aura that seemed to surround him which seemed to demand something of her Dont make me have to choose between you and my friends Ma Eddie said His voice was uneven strained but still under control Because thats not fair Theyre bad friends Eddie she cried in a nearfrenzy I know that I feel that with all my heart theyll bring you nothing but pain and grief And the most horrible thing of all was that she did sense that some part of her had intuited it in the eyes of the Denbrough boy who had stood before her with his hands in his pockets his red hair flaming in the summer sun His eyes had been so grave so strange and distant like Eddies eyes now And hadnt that same aura been around him as was around Eddie now The same but even stronger She thought yes She stood up so suddenly she almost knocked the straightbacked chair over Ill come back this evening she said Its the shock the accident the pain those things that make you talk this way I know it You you She groped and found her original text in the flying confusion of her mind Youve had a bad accident but youre going to be just fine And youll see Im right Eddie Theyre bad friends Not our sort Not for you You think it over and ask yourself if your ma ever told you wrong before You think about it and and Im running she thought with a sick and hurtful dismay Im running away from my own son Oh God please dont let this be For a moment she almost fled anyway scared of him now oh yes he was more than Eddie she sensed the others in him his friends and something else something that was beyond even them and she was afraid it might flash out at her It was as if he were in the grip of something some dreadful fever as he had been in the grip of the bronchitis that time when he was five when he had almost died She paused her hand on the doorknob not wanting to hear what he might say and when he said it it was so unexpected that for a moment she didnt really understand it When comprehension crashed down it came like a loose load of cement and for a moment she thought she would faint Eddie said Mr Keene said my asthma medicine is just water Just water With some stuff added to make it taste like medicine He said it was a placeebo Thats a lie That is nothing but a solid lie Why would Mr Keene want to tell you a lie like that Well there are other drugstores in Derry I guess I guess Ive had time to think about it Eddie said softly and implacably his eyes never leaving hers and I think hes telling the truth Eddie I tell you hes not The panic was back fluttering What I think Eddie said is that it must be the truth or there would be some kind of warning on the bottle like if you take too much it will kill you or at least make you sick Even Eddie I dont want to hear this she cried and clapped her hands to her ears Youre youre youre just not yourself and thats all that it is Even if its something you can just go in and buy without a prescription they put special instructions on it he went on not raising his voice His gray eyes lay on hers and she couldnt seem to drop her gaze or even move it Even if its just Vicks cough syrup or your Geritol He paused for a moment Her hands dropped from her ears it seemed too much work to hold them up They seemed very heavy Because he went on as if she had not spoken at allhe was frowning now concentrating on the problem because your folks are supposed to know about medicines Why I use that aspirator five sometimes six times a day And you wouldnt let me do that if you thought it could like hurt me Because its your job to protect me I know it is because thats what you always say So did you know Ma Did you know it was just water She said nothing Her lips were trembling It felt as if her whole face was trembling She was no longer crying She felt too scared to cry Because if you did Eddie said still frowning if you did know Id want to know why I can figure some things out but not why my ma would want me to think water was medicine or that I had asthma herehe pointed to his chestwhen Mr Keene says I only have it up hereand he pointed to his head She thought she would explain everything then She would explain it quietly and logically How she had thought he was going to die when he was five and how that would have driven her crazy after losing Frank only two years before How she came to understand that you could only protect your child through watchfulness and love that you must tend a child as you tended a garden fertilizing weeding and yes occasionally pruning and thinning as much as that hurt She would tell him that sometimes it was better for a childparticularly a delicate child like Eddieto think he was sick than to really get sick And she would finish by talking to him about the deadly foolishness of doctors and the wonderful power of love she would tell him that she knew he had asthma and it didnt matter what the doctors thought or what they gave him for it She would tell him you could make medicine with more than a malicious meddling druggists mortar and pestle Eddie she would say its medicine because your mothers love makes it medicine and in just that way for as long as you want me and let me I can do that This is a power that God gives to loving caring mothers Please Eddie please my hearts own love you must believe me But in the end she said nothing Her fright was too great But maybe we dont even have to talk about it Eddie went on Mr Keene might have been joking with me Sometimes grownups you know they like to play jokes on kids Because kids believe almost anything Its mean to do that to kids but sometimes grownups do it Yes Sonia Kaspbrak said eagerly They like to joke and sometimes theyre stupid mean and and So Ill kind of keep an eye out for Bill and the rest of my friends Eddie said and keep right on using my asthma medicine Thats probably best dont you think She realized only now when it was too late how neatlyhow cruellyshe had been trapped What he was doing was almost blackmail but what choice did she have She wanted to ask him how he could be so calculating so manipulative She opened her mouth to ask and then closed it again It was too likely that in his present mood he might answer But she knew one thing Yes One thing for sure she would never never never set foot into Mr NosyParker Keenes drugstore again in her life She looked up and saw it was Eddie again just Eddie and she went to him gladly She hugged him but carefully so as not to hurt his broken arm or dislodge any loose bonefragments so they could run an evil race around his bloodstream and then lodge in his heartwhat mother would kill her son with love and Eddie hugged her back As far as Eddie was concerned his ma left just in time During the horrible confrontation with her he had felt his breath piling up and up and up in his lungs and throat still and tideless stale and brackish threatening to poison him He held on until the door had snicked shut behind her and then he began to gasp and wheeze The sour air working in his tight throat jabbed up and down like a warm poker He grabbed for his aspirator hurting his arm but not caring He triggered a long blast down his throat He breathed deep of the camphor taste thinking It doesnt matter if its a placeebo words dont matter if a thing works He lay back against his pillows eyes closed breathing freely for the first time since she had come in He was scared plenty scared The things he had said to her the way he had actedit had been him and yet it hadnt been him at all There had been something working in him working through him some force and his mother had felt it too He had seen it in her eyes and in her trembling lips He had no sense that this power was an evil one but its enormous strength was frightening It was like getting on an amusementpark ride that was really dangerous and realizing you couldnt get off until it was over come what might No turning around Eddie thought feeling the hot itchy weight of the cast that encased his broken arm No one goes home until we get to the end But God Im so scared so scared And he knew that the truest reason for demanding she not cut him off from his friends was something he could never have told her I cant face this alone He cried a little then and then drifted off into a restless sleep He dreamed of a darkness in which machinerypumping machineryran on and on It was threatening showers again that evening when Bill and the rest of the Losers returned to the hospital Eddie was not surprised to see them come filing in He had known they would be back It had been hot all dayit was generally agreed later that that third week of July was the hottest of an exceptionally hot summerand the thunderheads began to build up around four in the afternoon purpleblack and colossal pregnant with rain loaded with lightnings People went about their errands quickly and a little uneasily with one eye always cocked at the sky Most agreed it would rain good and hard by dinnertime washing some of the thick humidity out of the ear Derrys parks and playgrounds underpopulated all summer were totally deserted that evening by six The rain had still not fallen and the swings hung moveless and shadeless in a light that was a queer flat yellow Thunder rumbled thicklythat a barking dog and the low mutter of traffic on Outer Main Street were the only sounds that drifted in through Eddies window until the Losers came Bill was first followed by Richie Beverly and Stan followed them then Mike Ben came last He looked excruciatingly uncomfortable in a white trurtleneck sweater They came to his bed solemn Not even Richie was smiling He was seeing in them what his mother had seen in him that afternoon that odd combination of power and helplessness The yellow stormlight lay on their skins making their faces seem ghostlike distant shadowy Were passing over Eddie thought Passing over into something newwere on the border But whats on the other side Where are we going Where Had a day yesterday I guess Mike said Thunder rumbled behind his voice Neither the overhead light nor the bedside lamp was on in Eddies room and all of them seemed to fade in and out of the bruised light Eddie thought of that light all over Derry right now lying long and still across McCarron Park falling through the holes in the roof of the Kissing Bridge in smudged lackadaisical rays making the Kenduskeag look like smoky glass as ifcut its broad shallow path through the Barrens he thought of seesaws standing at dead angles behind Derry Elementary as the thunderheads piled up and up he thought of this thundery yellow light and the stillness as if the whole town had fallen asleep or died My ffolks are ggoing out to a muhmuhmovie the night aaafter nnext Bill said When the ppichictures change Were ggoing to mmake them then The suhsuhsuh Its better this way Ben said quietly I still think we could have made the bullets but thinking isnt good enough If we were grownups Oh yeah the world would be peachy if we were grownups Beverly said Grownups can make anything they want cant they Grownups can do anything they want and it always comes out right She laughed a jagged nervous sound Bill wants me to shoot It Can you feature that Eddie Just call me Beverly Oakley I dont know what youre talking about Eddie said but he thought he didhe was getting some kind of picture anyway Ben explained They would melt down one of his silver dollars and make two silver balls a little smaller than ballbearings And then if there really was a werewolf residing at Neibolt Street Beverly would put a silver ball into Its head with Bills Bullseye slingshot Goodbye werewolf And if they were right about one creature who wore many faces goodbye It There must have been some sort of expression on Eddies face because Richie laughed and nodded I know how you feel man I thought Bill must have lost his few remaining marbles when he started talking about using his slingshot instead of his dads gun But this afternoon He stopped and cleared his throat This afternoon after your ma blew us out of the water was how he had been about to start and that obviously wouldnt do This afternoon we went down to the dump Bill brought his Bullseye Look From his back pocket Richie took a flattened can which had once held Del Monte pineapple chunks There was a ragged hole about two inches in diameter through the middle of it Beverly did that with a rock from twenty feet away Looks like a to me De Trashmouth was convinced And when de Trashmouth is convinced de Trashmouth is convinced Killing cans is one thing Beverly said If it was something else something alive Bill you should be the one Really Nno Bill said We aaall ttook turns You suhsuhsaw how it wwwent Bill explained slowly and haltingly while Beverly looked out the window with her lips pressed so tightly together they were white She was for reasons she could not explain even to herself more than afraid she was deeply embarrassed by what had happened today On the way over here tonight she had argued again passionately that they try to make the bullets after all not because she was any more sure than Bill or Richie that they would actually work when the time came but becauseif something did happen out at that housethe weapon would be in But facts were facts They had each taken ten rocks each and shot the Bullseye at ten cans set up twenty feet away Richie had gotten one out of ten and his one hit was really only a nick Ben had gotten two Bill four Mike five Beverly shooting almost casually and appearing to aim not at all had banged nine of the ten cans dead center The tenth fell over when the rock she fired bounced off the rim Night after next I should be out by then Eddie said His mother would protest that but he didnt think she would protest too much Not after this afternoon Does your arm hurt Beverly asked She was wearing a pink dress not the dress he had seen in his dream perhaps she had worn that this afternoon when Ma sent them away on which she had appliqued small flowers And silk or nylon hose she looked very adult but also somehow very childlike like a girl playing dressup Her expression was dreamy and distant Eddie thought I bet thats how she looks when shes sleeping They talked for awhile their voices punctuated by thunder Eddie did not ask them about what had happened when they came to the hospital earlier that day and none of them mentioned it Richie took out his yoyo made it sleep once or twice then put it back Conversation lagged and in one of the pauses there was a brief click that made Eddie look around Bill had something in his hand and for a moment Eddie felt his heart speed up in alarm For that brief moment he thought it was a knife But then Stan turned on the rooms overhead dispelling the gloom and he saw it was only a ballpoint pen In the light they all looked natural again real only his friends I thought we ought to sign your cast Bill said His eyes met Eddies squarely But thats not it Eddie thought with sudden and alarming clarity Its a contract Its a contract Big Bill isnt it or the closest well ever get to one He was frightened and then ashamed and angry at himself If he had broken his arm before this summer who would have signed the cast Anyone besides his mother and perhaps Dr Handor His aunts in Haven These were his friends and his mother was wrong they werent bad friends Maybe he thought there arent any such things as good friends or bad friendsmaybe there are just friends people who stand by you when youre hurt and who kelp you feel not so lonely Maybe theyre always worth being scared for and hoping for and living for Maybe worth dying for too if thats what has to be No good friends No bad friends Only people you want need to be with people who build their houses in your heart Okay Eddie said a little hoarsely Okay thatd be real good Big Bill So Bill leaned solemnly over his bed and wrote his name on the hillocky plaster of Paris that encased Eddies mending arm the letters large and looping Richie signed with a flourish Bens handwriting was as narrow as he was wide the letters slanting backward They looked ready to fall over at the slightest push Mike Hanlons writing was large and awkward because he was lefthanded and the angle was bad for him He signed above Eddies elbow and circled his name When Beverly bent over him he could smell some light flowery perfume on her She signed in a round Palmermethod script Stan came last and wrote his name in tightpacked little letters by Eddies wrist They all stepped back then as if aware of what they had done Outside thunder muttered heavily again Lightning washed the hospitals wooden exterior in brief stuttering light Bill nodded CCCome ohohover to my hhouse aafter suhhupper day aaafter ttomorrow if you cccan ookay There was another period of desultory almost aimless conversation Some of it was about the dominant topic in Derry that Julythe trial of Richard Macklin for the bludgeonmurder of his stepson Dorsey and the disappearance of Dorseys older brother Eddie Corcoran Macklin would not break down and confess weeping on the witness stand for another two days but the Losers were in agreement that Macklin probably had nothing to do with Eddies disappearance The boy had either run away or It had gotten him They left around quarter of seven and the rain still had not fallen It continued to threaten until long after Eddies ma had come made her visit and gone home again she had been horrified at the signatures on Eddies cast and even more horrified at his determination to leave the hospital the following dayshe had been envisioning a stay of a week or more in absolute quiet so that the ends of the break could set together as she said Eventually the stormclouds broke apart and drifted away Not so much as a drop of rain had fallen in Derry The humidity remained and people slept on porches and on lawns and in sleeping bags in back fields that night The rain came the next day not long after Beverly saw something terrible happen to Patrick Hockstetter When he finishes Eddie pours himself another drink with a hand not completely steady He looks at Beverly and says You saw It didnt you You saw It take Patrick Hockstetter the day after you all signed my cast Beverly pushes her hair back in a reddish cloud Beneath it her face looks extraordinarily pale She fumbles a fresh cigarette out of her packthe last oneand flicks her Bic She cant seem to guide the flame to the tip of her cigarette After a moment Bill holds her wrist lightly but firmly and puts the flame where its supposed to go Beverly looks at him gratefully and exhales a cloud of bluishgray smoke He was cruhcruhcrazy Bill says and thinks Just the fact that Henry let a flako like Patrick Hockstetter hang around as that summer wore on that says something doesnt it Either that Henry was losing some of his charm some of his attraction or that Henrys own craziness had progressed far enough so that the Hockstetter kid seemed okay to him Both came to the same thingHenrys increasing what degeneration Is that the word Yes in light of what happened to him where he ended up I think it is Theres something else to support the idea too Bill thinks but as yet he can only remember it vaguely He and Richie and Beverly had been down at Tracker Brothersearly August by then and the summerschool that had kept Henry out of their hair for most of the summer was just about to endand hadnt Victor Criss approached them A very frightened Victor Criss Yes that had happened Things had been rapidly approaching the end by then and Bill thinks now that every kid in Derry had sensed itthe Losers and Henrys group most of all But that had been later Oh yeah you got that right Beverly says flatly Patrick Hockstetter was crazy None of the girls would sit in front of him in school Youd be sitting there doing your arithmetic or writing a story or a composition and all at once youd feel this hand almost as light as a feather but warm and sweaty Meaty She swallows and there is a small click in her throat The others watch her solemnly from around the table Youd feel it on your side or maybe on your breast Not that any of us had much in the way of breasts back then But Patrick didnt seem to care about that Youd feel that that touch and youd jerk away from it and turn around and there Patrick would be grinning with those big rubbery lips He had a pencilbox Full of flies Richie says suddenly sure Hed kill em with this green ruler he had and then put em in his pencilbox I even remember what it looked likered with a wavy white plastic cover that slid open and closed Youd jerk away and hed grin and then maybe hed open his pencilbox so you could see the dead flies inside Beverly says And the worst thingthe horrible thingwas the way hed smile and never say anything Mrs Douglas knew Greta Bowie told on him and I think Sally Mueller said something once too But I think Mrs Douglas was scared of him too Ben has rocked back on the rear legs of his chair and his hands are laced behind his neck She still cannot believe how lean he is Im pretty sure youre right he says She swallows again trying to fight off the nightmarish power of what she saw that day in the Barrens her roller skates tied together and hung over her shoulder one knee a stinging net of pain from a fall she had taken on Saint Crispins Lane another of the short treelined streets that deadended where the land fell and still falls sharply into the Barrens She remembers oh these memories when they come are so clear and so powerful that she was wearing a pair of denim shortsreally too short they came only to just below the hem of her panties She had become more conscious of her body over the last yearover the last six months actually as it began to curve and become more womanly The mirror was one reason for this heightened consciousness of course but not the main one the main one was that her father seemed even sharper just lately more apt to use his slapping hand or even his fists He seemed restless almost caged and she was more and more nervous when she was around him more and more on her mark It was as if there was a smell they made between them a smell that wasnt there when she was in the apartment alone one that had never been there when they were in it togethernot until this summer And when Mom was gone it was worse If there was a smell some smell then he knew it too maybe because Bev saw less and less of him as the hot weather wore on partly because of his summer bowling league partly because he was helping his friend Joe Tammerly fix cars but she suspects it was partly that smell the one they made between them neither of them meaning to but making it just the same as helpless to stop it as either was helpless to stop sweating in July The vision of the birds hundreds and thousands of them descending on the roofpeaks of houses on telephone wires on TV aerials intervenes again Something about poison ivy she says slowly looking at him But it wasnt It just felt like poison ivy Mike Never mind Mike says It will come Tell us what you do remember Bev I remember the blue shorts she would tell them and how faded they were getting how tight around my hips and butt I had half a pack of Lucky Strikes in one pocket and the Bullseye in the other Do you remember the Bullseye she asks Richie but they all nod Bill gave it to me she says I didnt want it but it he She smiles at Bill a little wanly You couldnt say no to Big Bill that was all So I had it and thats why I was out by myself that day To practice I still didnt think Id have the guts to use it when the time came Except I used it that day I had to I killed one of them one of the parts of It It was terrible Even now its hard for me to think of And one of the others got me Look She raises her arm and turns it over so they can all see a puckery scar on the roundest part of her upper forearm It looks as if a hot circular object about the size of a Havana cigar had been pressed against her skin It is slightly sunken and looking at it gives Mike Hanlon a chill This is one of the parts of the story which like Eddies unwilling hearttoheart with Keene he has suspected but never actually heard You were right about one thing Richie she says That Bullseye was a killer I was scared of it but I sorta loved it too Richie laughs and claps her on the back shit I knew that back then you stupid skirt Yeah really he says It was something in your eyes Bevvie I mean it looked like a toy but it was real You could blow holes in things And you blew a hole in something with it that day Ben muses No God no Beverly says It was the other wait She crushes out her cigarette sips her drink and gets herself under control again Finally she is Well no But she has a feeling its the closest shes going to get tonight I was rollerskating you see and I fell down and gave myself a good scrape Then I decided Id go down to the Barrens and practice I went by the clubhouse first to see if you guys were there You werent Just that smoky smell You guys remember how long that place went on smelling of smoke We never really did get the smell out did we Ben says So then I headed down to the dump she says because thats where we had the the tryouts I guess youd call them and I knew thered be lots of things to shoot at Maybe even you know rats She pauses Theres a fine misty sweat on her forehead now Thats what I really wanted to shoot at she says finally something that was alive Not a seagullI knew I couldnt shoot a gullbut a rat I wanted to see if I could Im glad I came from the Kansas Street side instead of the Old Cape side though because there wasnt much cover over there by the railroad embankment They would have seen me and God knows what would have happened then Them Beverly says Henry Bowers Victor Criss Belch Huggins and Patrick Hockstetter They were down in the dump and Suddenly amazing all of them she begins to giggle like a child her cheeks turning rosered She giggles until tears stand in her eyes What the hell Bev Rickie says Let us in on the joke Oh it was a joke all right she says It was a joke but I think they might have killed me if they knew Id seen I remember now Ben cries and he begins to laugh too I remember you telling us Giggling wildly Beverly says They had their pants down and they were lighting farts There is an instant of thunderstruck silence and then they all begin to laughthe sound echoes through the library Thinking of exactly how to tell them of Patrick Hockstetters death the thing she fixes on first is how approaching the town dump from the Kansas Street side was like entering some weird asteroid belt There was a rutted din track a town road actually it even had a name Old Lyme Street that ran from Kansas Street to the dump the only actual road into the Barrensthe citys dump trucks used it Beverly walked near Old Lyme Street but didnt take itshe had grown more cautiousshe supposed all of them hadsince Eddies arm had been broken Especially when she was alone She wove her way through the heavy undergrowth skirting a patch of poison ivy with its reddish oily leaves smelling the dumps smoky rot hearing the seagulls On her left through occasional breaks in the foliage she could see Old Lyme Street The others are looking at her waiting She checks her cigarette pack and finds it empty Wordlessly Richie tosses her one of his She lights up looks around at them and says Heading toward the dump from the Kansas Street side was a little like entering some weird asteroid belt The dumpoid belt At first there was nothing but the underbrush growing from the spongy ground underfoot and then you would see your first dumpoid a rusty can that had once contained Prince Spaghetti Sauce maybe or an S OK sodabottle crawling with bugs attracted by the sweetsticky remains of cream soda or birch beer Then there would be a bright wink of sun kicking off a scrap of tinfoil caught in a tree You might see a bedspring or trip over it if you werent watching where you were going or a bone some dog had carried away gnawed dropped The dump itself wasnt so badwas in fact sort of interesting Beverly thought What was nasty and sort of creepy was the way it had of spreading Of creating this dumpoid belt She was getting closer now the trees were bigger mostly firs and the bushes were thinning out The gulls cheeped and cried in their shrill querulous voices and the air was smudgy with the smell of burning Now on Beverlys right leaning at an angle against the base of a spruce tree was a rusty Amana refrigerator Beverly glanced at it thinking vaguely of the state policeman who had visited her class when she had been in the third grade He had told them that such things as discarded refrigerators were dangerousa kid could climb into one while playing hideandgoseek for instance and smother to death inside Although why anyone would want to get in a scroungy old She heard a shout so close it made her jump followed by laughter Beverly grinned So they were here They had left the clubhouse because of the smoky smell and had come down here They were maybe breaking bottles with rocks maybe just dumppicking She began to walk a little faster the nasty scrape she had gotten earlier now forgotten in her eagerness to see them to see him with his red hair so much like hers to see if he would smile at her in that oddly endearing onesided way of his She knew she was too young to love a boy too young to have anything but crushes but she loved Bill just the same And she walked a little faster her skates swinging heavily from her shoulder the sling of his Bullseye beating soft time against her left buttock She almost walked into them before realizing it wasnt her gang at all but Bowerss She walked out of the screening bushes and the dumps steepest side lay about seventy yards ahead a twinkling avalanche of junk lying along the high angle of the gravelpit Mandy Fazios bulldozer was off to the left Much closer in front of her was a wilderness of junked cars At the end of each month these were crushed and hauled off to Portland for scrap but now there were a dozen or more some sitting on bare wheelrims some on their sides one or two lying on their roofs like dead dogs They were arranged in two rows and Beverly walked down the rough trashlittered aisle between them like some punk bride of the future wondering idly if she could break a windshield with the Bullseye One of the pockets of her blue shorts bulged with the small ballbearings that were her practice ammo The voices and laughter were coming from beyond the junkedout cars and to the left at the edge of the dump proper Beverly rounded the last one a Studebaker with its entire front end missing Her hail of greeting died on her lips The hand she had put up to wave did not exactly fail back to her side it seemed to wilt Her first furiously embarrassed thought was Oh dear God why are they all naked This was followed by the scary realization of who they were She froze there in front of the halfStudebaker with her shadow stapled to the heels of her lowtopped sneakers For that one moment she was totally visible to them if any of the four had looked up from the circle they were squatting in he could not have missed her a girl of slightly more than medium height a pair of skates over one shoulder the knee of one long coltish leg still oozing blood her mouth slackjawed her cheeks scarlet Before darting back behind the Studebaker she saw that they werent entirely naked after all they had their shirts on and their pants and underpants were simply pulled down to their shoetops as if they had to Go Number Two in her shock Beverlys mind had automatically reverted to the euphemism she had been taught as a toddlerexcept whoever heard of four boys Going Number Two at the same time Once out of sight again her first thought was to get awayget away fast Her heart was pumping hard her muscles heavy with adrenaline She looked around seeing what she hadnt bothered to notice walking up here when she had thought the voices she heard belonged to her friends The row of junked cars on her left was really pretty thinthey were by no means packed in door to door as they would be in the week or so before the crusher came to turn them into rough blocks of twinkling metal She had been exposed to the boys several times walking up to where she was now if she retreated she would be exposed again and this time she might be seen Also she felt a certain shameful curiosity what in the world could they be doing Henry and Victor Criss were more or less facing in her direction Patrick Hockstetter was on Henrys left Belch Huggins had his back to her She observed the fact that Belch had an extremely large extremely hairy ass and halfhysterical giggles suddenly bubbled up her throat like the head on a glass of ginger ale She had to clap both hands over her mouth and withdraw behind the Studebaker again struggling to hold the giggles in Youve got to get out of here Beverly If they catch you She looked back down between the junked cars still holding her hands over her mouth The aisle was maybe ten feet wide littered with cans twinkling with little jigsaw pieces of SafTGlas scruffy with weeds If she so much as made a sound they might hear her particularly if their absorption in whatever strange thing they were doing flagged When she thought of how casually she had walked up here her blood ran cold Also She peeked again seeing more of the details this time There was a careless scatter of books and papers nearbyschoolbooks They had just come from their summer classes then what most of the kids called Dummy School or Makeup School And because Henry and Victor were facing her way she could see their things They were the first things she had ever seen in her life other than pictures in a smudgy little book that Brenda Arrowsmith had showed her the year before and in those pictures you really couldnt see very much Bev observed now that their things were little tubes that hung down between their legs Henrys was small and hairless but Victors was quite big and there was a cloudy fuzz of fine black hair just over it Bill has one of those she thought and suddenly her whole body seemed to flush at onceheat rushed through her in a wave that made her feel giddy and faint and almost sick to her stomach In that moment she felt much the way Ben Hanscom had felt on the last day of school looking down at her ankle bracelet and observing the way it flashed in the sun but he had not felt the intermixed sense of terror she felt now She looked behind her once more Now the pathway between the cars leading to the shelter of the Barrens seemed much longer She was scared to move If they knew she had seen their things they would probably hurt her And not just a little they would hurt her badly Belch Huggins bellowed suddenly making her jump and Henry yelled Three feet No shit Belch It was three feet Wasnt it Vie Vie agreed it was and they all roared with trolllike laughter Patrick Hockstetter had turned and halfrisen so that his butt was nearly in Henrys face In Henrys hand was a silvery glinting object After a moments study she made it out as a lighter I thought you said you felt one coming on Henry said I do Patrick said Ill tell you when Get ready Get ready its coming Get now Henry flicked the lighter At the same moment there was the unmistakable ripping sound of a really good fart There was no mistaking that sound Beverly had heard it enough in her own house usually on Saturday night after the beans and franks A regular bear for his beans was her father As Patrick blew off and Henry flicked the lighter she saw something that made her jaw drop A bright blue jet of flame appeared to roar directly out of Patricks bum To Bev it looked like the pilotlight on a gasburner The boys roared their trolllike laughter and Beverly withdrew behind the sheltering car stifling mad giggles again She was laughing but not because she was amused In some very weird way it was funny yes but mostly she was laughing because she felt a deep revulsion accompanied by a sort of horror She was laughing because she knew of no other way to cope with what she had seen It had something to do with seeing the boys things but that was by no means all or even the great part of what she felt She had known after all that boys had things the same way she knew that girls had different things this was only what you might call a confirmed sighting But the rest of what they were doing seemed so strange so ludicrous and yet at the same time so deadlyprimitive that she found herself in spite of the giggling fit groping for the core of herself with some desperation Stop she thought as if this were the answer stop theyll hear you so just you stop it Bevvie But that was impossible The best she could do was to laugh without engaging her vocal cords so that the sounds came out of her in a series of almost inaudible chuffs her hands pasted over her mouth her cheeks as red as Mac apples her eyes swimming with tears Twelve feet Henry bellowed I swear to God Vie twelve fuckin feet I swear it on my mothers name I dont care if it was twenty fuckin feet you burned my ass off Victor howled and there was more bellowing laughter still trying to giggle silently from behind the sheltering car Beverly thought of a movie she had seen on TV Jon Hall had been in it It was about this jungle tribe they had a secret rite and if you saw it you got sacrificed to their god which was this big stone idol This did not stop her giggles but infused them with a nearly frantic quality They were becoming more and more like silent screams Her belly hurt Tears streamed down her face Henry Victor Belch and Patrick Hockstetter ended up in the dump lighting each others farts on that hot July afternoon because of Rena Davenport Henry knew what resulted from consuming large amounts of baked beans This result was perhaps best expressed in a little ditty he had learned at his fathers knee when he was still in short pants Beans beans the musical fruit The more you eat the more you toot The more you toot the better you feel Then youre ready for another meal Rena Davenport and his father had been courting for nearly eight years She was fat forty and usually filthy Henry supposed that Rena and his father sometimes fucked although he could not imagine anyone squashing his body down on Rena Davenports Renas beans were her pride She soaked them Saturday nights and baked them over a slow fire all day Sunday Henry supposed they were okaythey were something to shovel into your mouth and chew up anywaybut after eight years anything lost its charm Nor was Rena content to make just a few beans she cooked them in job lots When she turned up Sunday evenings in her old green De Soto a naked rubber babydoll hung from the rearview mirror looking like the worlds youngest lynchmob victim she usually had the Bowerses beans steaming on the seat beside her in a twelvegallon galvanizedsteel pail The three of them would eat the beans that night Rena raving about her own cooking all the while crazy Butch Bowers grunting and mopping up bean juice with a piece of Sonny Boy bread or simply telling her to shut up if there was a ballgame on the radio Henry just eating staring out the window thinking his own thoughts it was over a plate of Sundaynight beans that he had conceived the idea of poisoning Mike Hanlons dog Mr Chips and Butch would reheat a mess of them the next night On Tuesdays and Wednesdays Henry would take a Tupperware box full of them to school By Thursday or Friday neither Henry or his father could eat any more The houses two bedrooms would smell of stale farts in spite of the open windows Butch would take the remains and mix them into the other slops and feed them to Bip and Bop the Bowerses two pigs Rena would like as not show up the following Sunday with another steaming pail and the cycle would start all over again That morning Henry had put up an enormous quantity of leftover beans and the four of them had eaten the whole lot at noon sitting out on the playground in the shade of a big old elm They had eaten until they were nearly bursting It had been Patrick who suggested they go down to the dump which would be fairly quiet in the middle of a workingday summer afternoon By the time they arrived the beans were doing their work quite nicely Little by little Beverly got herself under control again She knew she had to get out beating a retreat was ultimately less dangerous than hanging around They were absorbed in what they were doing and even if worse came to worst she could get a headstart and in the back of her mind she had also decided that if worst came to terrible a few shots from the Bullseye might discourage them She was about to begin creeping away when Victor said I gotta go Henry My dad wants me to help him pick com this afternoon No hes mad at me Because of what happened the other day Beverly listened more closely now suspecting it might be the scuffle which had ended with Eddies broken arm that they were talking about Watch your mouth fuckface Victor said It might grow on you Your father want you to pick corn Henry asked angrily This was what might have passed for a jest in Henrys mind Belchs father was dead No But I got a job delivering the Weekly Shopper I gotta do that tonight Whats this Weekly Shopper crap Henry asked now sounding upset as well as angry Its a job Belch said with ponderous patience I make money Henry made a disgusted sound and Beverly risked another peek around the car Victor and Belch were standing buckling their belts Henry and Patrick were still squatting with their pants down The lighter glinted in Henrys hand You dont have to pick corn or go do some pussy job Sure Henry said and spat near one of Belchs clodhopping workshoes Vie and Belch started off together toward the two rows of wrecked cars toward the Studebaker behind which Beverly was crouching At first she could only cringe frozen with fear like a rabbit Then she slid around the left side of the Studebaker and backed down the gap between it and the battered doorless Ford next to it For a moment she paused looking from side to side hearing them approach She hesitated her mouth cottonydry her back itchy with sweat a part of her mind was numbly wondering how shed lookin a cast like Eddies with the Losers names signed on it Then she dived into the Ford on the passenger side She curled up on the filthy floormat making herself as small as possible It was boiling hot inside the junkedout Ford and it smelled so thickly of dust rotting upholstery and elderly ratcrap that she had to struggle grimly to keep from sneezing or coughing She heard Belch and Victor pass close by talking in low voices Then they were gone She sneezed three times quickly and quietly into her cupped hands She supposed she could go now if she was careful The best way to do it would be to shift over to the drivers side of the Ford sneak back to the aisle and then just do a fade She believed she could manage it but the shock of almost being discovered had robbed her of her courage at least for the time being She felt safer here in the Ford And maybe now that Victor and Belch had gone the other two would also go soon Then she could go back to the clubhouse She had lost all interest in targetshooting Come on she thought Come on hurry up and go hurry up and go puhLEEZE A moment later she heard Patrick roar with mixed laughter and pain Six feet Henry bellowed Just like a fuckin blowtorch Swear to God Silence then for awhile Sweat trickling down her back The sun beating through the Fords cracked windshield on the nape of her neck Heaviness in her bladder Henry bellowed so loud that Beverly who had been close to dozing in spite of her discomfort almost cried out herself damn it Hockstetter You burned my frigging ass What are you doing with that lighter Ten feet Patrick giggled just the sound of it made Bev feel cold and revolted as if she had seen a worm squirm its way out of her salad Ten feet if it was an inch Henry Bright blue Ten feet if it was an inch Swear to God When Patrick spoke again his voice was so low Bev could barely hear it If there had been the slightest breath of wind on the air that baking afternoon she would not have done I dont want to look I dont want to see what theyre doing now and besides they might see me in fact they probably will because youve used up all your luck But her curiosity had overcome her good sense There was something strange in that silence something a little bit scary She raised her head inch by inch until she could look through the Fords cracked cloudy windshield She neednt have worried about being seen both of the boys were concentrating on what Patrick was doing She didnt understand what she was seeing but she knew it was nasty not that she would have expected anything else from Patrick who was just so weird He had one hand between Henrys thighs and one hand between his own One hand was flogging Henrys thing gently with his other hand Patrick was rubbing his own Except he wasnt exactly rubbing ithe was kind of squeezing it pulling it letting it flop back down She didnt know not for sure but it scared her She didnt think she had been this scared since the blood had vomited out of the bathroom drain and splattered all over everything Some deep part of her cried out that if they discovered she had seen this whatever it was they might do more than hurt her they might actually kill her Still she couldnt look away She saw that Patricks thing had gotten a little longer but not much it still dangled between his legs like a snake with no backbone Henrys however had grown amazingly It stood up stiff and hard almost poking his bellybutton Patricks hand went up and down up and down sometimes pausing to squeeze sometimes tickling that odd heavy sac under Henrys thing Those are his balls Beverly thought Do boys have to go around with those all the time God Id go crazy Another part of her mind then whispered Bill has those On its own her mind visualized her holding them cupping them in her hand testing their texture and that hot feeling raced through her again sparking off a furious blush Henry stared at Patricks hand as if hypnotized His lighter lay on the rocky scree beside him reflecting hot afternoon sun Want me to put it in my mouth Patrick asked His big livery lips smiled complacently Ill put it in my mouth if you want I dont m Henrys hand flashed out halfcurled not quite a fist Patrick was knocked sprawling His head thudded on the gravel Beverly dived down again her heart crashing in her chest her teeth locked against a little whimpering moan After knocking Patrick down Henry had turned and for a moment just before she dropped back into her little huddled ball on the passenger side of the driveshaft hump it seemed that her eyes and Henrys had locked Please God the sun was in his eyes she prayed Please God Im sorry I peeked Please God There was an agonizing pause then Her white blouse was plastered to her body with sweat Droplets like seed pearls gleamed on her tanned arms Her bladder throbbed painfully She felt that very soon she would wet her pants She waited for Henrys furious crazy face to appear in the opening where the Fords passenger door had been sure it was going to happenhow could he have missed seeing her He would drag her out and hurt her He would A new and even more terrible thought now occurred to her and once again she had to engage in a painful crampy struggle to keep from wetting her pants Suppose he did something to her with his thing Suppose he wanted her to put it in her somewhere She knew where it was supposed to go all right it seemed that knowledge had suddenly sprung into her mind fullblown She thought that if Henry tried to put his thing in her she would go crazy Please no please God dont let him have seen me please okay Then Henry spoke and to her growing horror his voice was coming from someplace much closer I dont go for that queer stuff I didnt like it Henry shouted And if you tell anyone I did Ill kill you you fucking little pansy You got a boner Patrick said He sounded like he was smiling As much as she feared Henry Bowers the smile would not have surprised Beverly Patrick was crazy crazier than Henry maybe and people that crazy werent afraid of anything I saw it Footsteps crunched over the gravelcloser and closer Beverly looked up her eyes bulging Through the Fords old windshield she could now see the back of Henrys head He was looking toward Patrick now but if he turned around If you tell anyone Ill say youre a cocksucker Henry said Then Ill kill you You dont scare me Henry Patrick said and giggled But I might not tell if you gave me a dollar Henry shifted restlessly He turned slightly Beverly could now see onequarter of his profile instead of just the back of his head Please God please God she begged incoherently and her bladder throbbed more strongly If you tell Henry said his voice low and deliberate Ill tell what youve been doing with the cats With the dogs too Ill tell them about your refrigerator You know whatll happen Hockstetter Theyll come and take you away and put you into the fuckingA loonybin Henry drummed his fingers on the hood of the Ford Beverly was hiding in do you hear me I hear you Patrick sounded sullen now Sullen and a little scared He burst out You liked it You got a boner Biggest boner I ever saw Yeah I bet you seen a lot of em you fuckin little homo faggot You just remember what I said about the refrigerator Your refrigerator And if I see you around again Ill knock your block off Henry moved away Beverly turned her head and saw him pass by the drivers side of the Ford If he had looked to his left even a little bit he would have seen her But he didnt look A moment later she heard him heading off the way Victor and Belch had gone Beverly waited but nothing happened Five minutes dragged by Her need to urinate was now desperate She might be able to hold out for another two or three minutes but no more And it made her uneasy not to know for sure where Patrick was She peeked through the windshield again and saw him just sitting there Henry had forgotten his lighter Patrick had put his schoolbooks back into a small canvas carrier sack and had slung it around his neck like a newsboys but his pants and underpants were still down around his ankles He was playing with the lighter He would spin the wheel produce a flame that was almost invisible in the bright day snap the lighter closed and then start all over again He seemed hypnotized A line of blood ran from the corner of his mouth to his chin and his lips were swelling up on the right side He seemed not to notice and once again Beverly felt a squirmy sort of revulsion Patrick was crazy all right she had never in her life wanted so badly to get away from someone Moving very carefully she crawled backward over the Fords driveshaft hump and squeezed under the steering wheel She put her feet out on the ground and crept to the back of the Ford Then she ran quickly back the way she had come When she had entered the pines beyond the junked cars she looked back over her shoulder No one was there The dump dozed in the sun She felt the bands of tension around her chest and stomach loosen with relief and all that was left was the need to urinate so great that she now felt sick with it She hurried down the path a short way and then ducked off to the right She had her shorts unsnapped almost before the underbrush had closed behind her again She took a quick look around to make sure there was no poison ivy at hand then she squatted holding the tough trunk of a bush for balance She was pulling her shorts up again when she heard approaching footsteps from the dump All she could see through the bushes were flashes of blue denim and the faded plaid of a schoolshirt It was Patrick She ducked down waiting for him to pass by toward Kansas Street She was more sanguine about her position here The cover was good she no longer had to pee and Patrick was off in his own cuckoo world When he was gone she would double back and head for the clubhouse But Patrick didnt pass by He stopped on the path almost directly opposite her and stood looking at the rusting Amana refrigerator Beverly could observe Patrick along a natural sightline in the bushes without too much chance of being seen Now that she was relieved she found she was curious againand if Patrick did happen to see her she felt certain she could outrun him He wasnt as fat as Ben but he was podgy She pulled the Bullseye out of her back pocket however and put half a dozen steel pellets in the breast pocket of her old Ship n Shore Crazy or not a good one to the knee might discourage the likes of Patrick Hockstetter in a hurry She remembered the refrigerator well enough now There were lots of discarded fridges at the dump but it suddenly occurred to her that this was the only one shed seen which Mandy Fazio hadnt disarmed by either tearing out the latching mechanism with pliers or simply removing the door altogether Patrick began to hum and sway back and forth in front of the rusty old refrigerator and Beverly felt a fresh chill course through her He was like a guy in a horror movie trying to summon a dead body out of a crypt But if she had known that or what was going to happen when Patrick finished his private ritual and opened the dead Amanas rusty door she would have run away as fast as she could No onenot even Mike Hanlonhad the slightest idea of how crazy Patrick Hockstetter really was He was twelve the son of a paint salesman His mother was a devout Catholic who would die of breast cancer in four years after Patrick was consumed by the dark entity which existed in and below Derry Although his IQ tested out as low normal Patrick had already repeated two grades the first and third He was taking summer classes this year so he would not have to repeat the fifth as well His teachers found him an apathetic student this several of them noted on the bare six lines of the Derry Elementary Schools report cards reserved for TEACHERs COMMENTS and a rather disturbing one as well which none notedtheir feelings were too vague too diffuse to be expressed in sixty lines let alone six If he had been born ten years later a guidance counsellor might have steered him toward a child psychologist who might or might not Patrick was far more clever than his lackluster IQ results indicated have realized the frightening depths behind that slack and pallid moonface He was a sociopath and perhaps by that hot July in he had become a fullfledged psychopath He could not remember a time when he had believed that other peopleany other living creatures for that matterwere real He believed himself to be an actual creature probably the only one in the universe but was by no means convinced that his actuality made him real He had no sense of hurting exactly and no real sense of being hurt his indifference to being struck in the mouth by Henry in the dump was a case in point But while he found reality a totally meaningless concept he understood the concept of rules perfectly And while all of his teachers had found him odd both Mrs Douglas his fifthgrade teacher and Mrs Weems who had had Patrick in the third grade knew about the pencilbox full of flies and while neither of them totally ignored the implications each had between twenty and twentyeight other students each with problems of his or her own none of them had serious disciplinary problems with him He might turn in test papers that were utterly blankor blank except for a large decorative questionmarkand Mrs Douglas had discovered it was best to keep him away from the girls because of his Roman hands and Russian fingers but he was quiet so quiet that there were times when he might have been taken for a big lump of clay that had been crudely fashioned to look like a boy It was easy to ignore a Patrick who failed quietly when you had to cope with boys like Henry Bowers and Victor Criss who were actively disruptive and insolent boys who would steal milkmoney or happily deface school property if given a chance and girls like the unfortunately named Elizabeth Taylor who was epileptic and whose few poor braincells worked only sporadically and who had to be discouraged from pulling her dresses up in the playyard to show off a new pan of panties In other words Derry Elementary School was the typical confused educational carnival a circus with so many rings that Pennywise himself might have gone unnoticed Certainly none of Patricks teachers or his parents for that matter suspected that when he was five Patrick had murdered his baby brother Avery Patrick had not liked it when his mother brought Avery home from the hospital He didnt care or so he at first told himself if his parents had two kids five kids or five dozen kids as long as the kid or kids didnt alter his own schedule But he found that Avery did Meals came late The baby cried in the night and woke him up It seemed that his parents were always hanging over its crib and often when he tried to get their attention he found that he could not For one of the few times in his life Patrick became frightened It occurred to him that if his parents had brought him Patrick home from the hospital and if he was real then Avery might be real too It might even be that when Avery got big enough to walk and talk to bring in his fathers copy of the Derry News from the front step and to hand his mother the bowls when she baked bread they might decide to get rid of Patrick altogether It was not that he feared they loved Avery more although it was obvious to Patrick that they did love him more and in this case his judgment was probably correct What he cared about was the rules that were being broken or had changed since Averys arrival  Averys possible reality and  the possibility that they might throw him out in favor of Avery Patrick went into Averys room one afternoon around twothirty shortly after the schoolbus had dropped him off from his afternoon kindergarten session It was January Outside snow was beginning to fall A powerful wind boomed across McCarron Park and rattled the frosty upstairs storm windows His mother was napping in her bedroom Avery had been fussy all the previous night His father was at work Avery was sleeping on his stomach his head turned to one side Patrick his moonface expressionless turned Averys head so his face was pressed directly into the pillow Avery made a snuffling noise and turned his head back to the side Patrick observed this and stood thinking about it while the snow melted off his yellow boots and puddled on the floor Perhaps five minutes passed quick thinking was not Patricks specialty and then he turned Averys face into the pillow again and held it there for a moment Avery stirred under his hand struggling But his struggles were weak Patrick let go Avery turned his head to the side again made one snorting little cry and then went on sleeping The wind gusted rattling the windows Patrick waited to see if the one little cry would awaken his mother It didnt Now he felt swept by a great excitement The world seemed to stand out in front of him clearly for the first time His emotional equipment was severely defective and in those few moments he felt as a totally colorblind person might feel if given a shot which enabled him to perceive colors for a short time or as a junkie who has just fixed feels as the smack rockets his brain into orbit This was a new thing He had not suspected it existed Very gently he turned Averys face into the pillow again This time when Avery struggled Patrick did not let go He pressed the babys face more firmly into the pillow The baby was making steady muffled cries now and Patrick knew it was awake He had a vague idea that it might tell on him to his mother if he stopped He held it down The baby struggled Patrick held it down The baby farted Its struggles weakened Patrick still held it down It eventually became totally still Patrick held it down for another five minutes feeling that excitement crest and then begin to ebb the shot wearing off turning the world gray again the fix mellowing into an accustomed low doze Patrick went downstairs and got himself a plate of cookies and poured himself a glass of milk His mother came down half an hour later and said she hadnt even heard him come in she had been that tired you wont be anymore Mom Patrick thought dont worry I fixed it She sat down with him ate one of his cookies and asked him how school had been Patrick said it was all right and showed her his drawing of a house and a tree His paper was covered with looping meaningless scribbles made with black and brown crayon His mother said it was very nice Patrick brought home the same looping scrawls of black and brown every day Sometimes he said it was a turkey sometimes a Christmas tree sometimes a boy His mother always told him it was very nice although sometimes in a part of her so deep she hardly knew it was there she worried There was something a little disquieting about the dark sameness of those big scribbled loops of black and brown She didnt discover Averys death until nearly five oclock until then she had simply assumed he was taking a very long nap By then Patrick was watching Crusader Rabbit on their seveninch TV and he went on watching TV through all the uproar that followed Whirlybirds was on when Mrs Henley arrived from next door his screaming mother had been holding the babys corpse in the open kitchen door believing in some blind way that the cold air might revive it Patrick was cold and got a sweater out of the downstairs closet Highway Patrol Ben Hanscoms favorite was on when Mr Hockstetter arrived home from work By the time the doctor arrived Science Fiction Theater with Your Host Truman Bradley was just coming on Who knows what strange things the universe may hold Truman Bradley speculated while Patricks mother shrieked and struggled in her husbands arms in the kitchen The doctor observed Patricks deep calm and unquestioning stare and assumed the boy was in shock He wanted Patrick to take a pill Patrick didnt mind It was diagnosed as cribdeath Years later there might have been questions about such a fatality deviations from the usual infantdeath syndrome observed But when it happened the death was simply noted and the baby buried Patrick was gratified that once things finally settled down his meals began to come on time again In the madness of that afternoon and eveningpeople banging in and out of the house the red lights of the Home Hospital ambulance pulsing on the walls Mrs Hockstetter screaming and wailing and refusing to be comfortedonly Patricks father came within brushing distance of the truth He was standing numbly by Averys empty crib some twenty minutes after the body had been removed simply standing there unable to believe any of this had happened He looked down and saw a pair of tracks on the hardwood floor They had been made by the snow melting off Patricks yellow rubber boots He looked at them and a dreadful thought rose briefly in his mind like bad gas from a deep mineshaft His hand went slowly to his mouth and his eyes widened A picture began to form in his mind Before it could come clear he left the room slamming the door behind him so hard that the top of the frame splintered Patrick had never done anything like that again although he might have done so if the chance had presented itself He felt no guilt had no bad dreams As time passed however he became more aware of what would have happened to him if he had been caught There were rules Unpleasant things happened to you if you didnt follow them or if you were caught breaking them You could be locked up or stuck in the electrocution chair But that remembered feeling of excitementthat feeling of color and sensationwas simply too powerful and too wonderful to give over entirely Patrick killed flies At first he only smacked them with his mothers flyswatter later he discovered he could kill them quite efficiently with a plastic ruler He also discovered the joys of flypaper A long sticky runner of it could be purchased for two cents at the Costello Avenue Market and Patrick sometimes stood for as long as two hours in the garage watching the flies land and then struggle to get free his mouth ajar his dusty eyes alight with that rare excitement sweat running down his round face and his thick body Patrick killed beetles but if possible he captured them first Sometimes he would steal a long needle from his mothers pincushion impale a Japanese beetle on it and sit crosslegged in the garden watching it die His expression at these times was the expression of a boy who is reading a very good book Once he had discovered a runover cat that was dying in the gutter on Lower Main Street and sat watching it until an old woman saw him pushing the squashed and mewing thing around with his foot She whacked him with the broom she had been using to sweep her walk Go on home she had shouted at him What are you crazy Patrick had gone on home He wasnt mad at the old woman He had been caught breaking the rules that was all Then last year it would not have surprised Mike Hanlon or any of the others at that point to have known that it was in fact on the same day that George Denbrough had been murdered Patrick had discovered the rusty Amana refrigeratorone of the larger dumpoids in the belt surrounding the dump itself Like Bev he had heard the cautionary warnings about such abandoned appliances about how thirtysquirty million kids got their stupid selves smoked in them each year Patrick had stood looking at the refrigerator for a long time idly playing pocketpool with himself That excitement was back stronger than it had ever been except for the time he had fixed Avery The excitement was back because in the chilly yet fuming wastes that passed for his mind Patrick Hockstetter had had an idea The Luces who lived three houses down from the Hockstetters missed their cat Bobby a week later The Luce kids who couldnt remember a time when Bobby hadnt been there spent hours combing the neighborhood for him They even pooled their money and put an ad in the Derry News Lost and Found column Nothing came of it And if any of them had seen Patrick that day bulkier than ever in his mothballsmelling winter parka after the floodwaters receded in that fall of it had come off bitterly cold almost at once carrying a cardboard carton they would have thought nothing of it The Engstroms a block over and almost directly behind the Hockstetter home lost their cocker pup about ten days before Thanksgiving Other families lost dogs and cats over the next six or eight months and Patrick of course had taken them all not to mention a dozen unremarked strays from the Hells HalfAcre area of Derry He put them into the rusty Amana near the dump one by one Each time he brought another animal down his heart thundering in his chest his eyes hot and watery with excitement he would expect to find that Mandy Fazio had pulled the Amanas latch or popped the hinges with his sledgehammer But Mandy never touched that particular refrigerator Perhaps he didnt realize it was there perhaps the force of Patricks will kept him away or perhaps some other force did that The Engstroms cocker lasted the longest In spite of the singlenumber cold it was still alive when Patrick came back for the third time in as many days although it had lost all of its original friskiness it had been wagging its tail and lapping his hands frantically when he originally hauled it out of the box and stuffed it into the refrigerator When he came back a day after putting it in the puppy had damn near gotten away Patrick had to chase it almost all the way to the dump before he was able to jump it and get hold of one rear leg The puppy had nipped Patrick with its sharp little teeth Patrick didnt mind In spite of the nips he had taken the cocker back to the refrigerator and bundled it back in He had a hardon when he did it This was not uncommon On the second day the puppy had tried to get out again but it moved much too slowly Patrick shoved it back in slammed the Amanas rusty door and leaned against it He could hear the puppy scratching against the door He could hear its muffled whines Good dog said Patrick Hockstetter His eyes were closed and he was breathing fast Thats a good dog On the third day the puppy could only roll its eyes toward Patricks face when the door opened Its sides were heaving rapidly and shallowly When Patrick returned the next day the cocker was dead with a cake of foam frozen around its mouth and muzzle This made Patrick think of coconut Popsicles and he laughed quite hard as he hauled the frozen corpse from his killingbottle and threw it in the bushes The supply of victims which Patrick thought of when he thought of them at all as test animals had been thin this summer Questions of reality aside his sense of selfpreservation was well developed his intuition exquisite He suspected he was suspected By whom he was not sure Mr Engstrom Perhaps Mr Engstrom had turned around and given Patrick a long speculative look in the A ampP one day this spring Mr Engstrom had been buying cigarettes and Patrick had been sent for bread Mrs Josephs Maybe She sat in her parlor window with a telescope sometimes and was according to Mrs Hockstetter a nosy parker Mr Jacubois who had an ASPCA sticker on the back bumper of his car Mr Nell Someone else Patrick didnt know for sure but his intuition told him he was suspected and he never argued with his intuition He had taken a few wandering animals from among the rotted tenements in the HalfAcre picking only those that looked thin or diseased but that was all He discovered however that the refrigerator near the dump had gotten an oddly powerful hold over him He began to draw pictures of it in school when he was bored He sometimes dreamed of it at night and in his dreams the Amana was perhaps seventy feet tall a whited sepulchre a ponderous crypt iced in chilly moonlight In these dreams the giant door would swing open and he would see huge eyes staring out at him He would awake in a cold sweat but he found he could not give up the joys of the refrigerator entirely Today he had finally found out who had suspected Bowers Knowing that Henry Bowers held the secret of his killingbottle in his hands left Patrick as close to panic as he was ever apt to get This was not very close at all in truth but he still found thisnot fear exactly but mental unrestoppressive and unpleasant Henry knew Knew that Patrick sometimes broke the rules His latest victim had been a pigeon he discovered on Jackson Street two days ago The pigeon had been struck by a car and couldnt fly Patrick went home got his box out of the garage and put the pigeon inside The pigeon pecked the back of Patricks hand several times leaving shallow bloody digs Patrick didnt mind When he checked the refrigerator the next day the pigeon had been quite dead but Patrick hadnt removed the corpse then Now following Henrys threat to tell Patrick decided he better get rid of the pigeons body right away Perhaps he would even get a bucket of water and some rags and scrub out the interior of the refrigerator It didnt smell very good If Henry told and Mr Nell came down to check he might be able to tell that somethingseveral somethings in facthad died in there If he tells Patrick thought standing in the grove of pines and looking at the rusty Amana Ill tell that he broke Eddie Kaspbraks arm Of course they probably knew that already but they couldnt prove anything because all of them said they had been playing out at Henrys house that day and Henrys crazy father had backed them up But if he tells Ill tell Tit for tat Never mind that now What he had to do now was get rid of the bird He would leave the refrigerator door open and then come back with the rags and the water and clean it up Good At first he was simply puzzled unable to cope in any way with what he was seeing It meant nothing to him at all It had no context Patrick merely stared his head cocked to one side his eyes wide The pigeon was nothing but a skeleton surrounded by a ragged fall of feathers There was no flesh left on its body at all And around it stuck on the refrigerators inner walls hanging from the underside of the freezer compartment dangling from the wire shelves were dozens of fleshcolored objects that looked like big macaroni shells Patrick saw that they were moving slightly fluttering as if in a breeze Except there was no breeze He frowned Suddenly one of the shelllike things unfurled insectile wings Before Patrick could do more than register the fact it had flown across the space between the refrigerator and Patricks left arm It struck with a smacking sound There was an instant of heat It faded and Patricks arm felt just like always again but the shelllike creatures pale flesh turned first pink and then with shocking suddenness rosered Although Patrick was afraid of almost nothing in the commonly understood sense of the word its hard to be afraid of things that arent real there was at least one thing that filled him with wretched loathing He had come out of Brewster Lake one warm August day when he was seven to discover four or five leeches clinging to his stomach and legs He had screamed himself hoarse until his father had pulled them off Now in a deadly burst of inspiration he realized that this was some weird kind of flying leech They had infested his refrigerator Patrick began to scream and beat at the thing on his arm It had swelled to nearly the size of a tennis ball At the third blow it broke open with a sickening squtt sound Bloodhis bloodsprayed his arm from elbow to wrist but the things jellylike eyeless head held on In a way it was like a birds narrow head ending in a beaklike structure but this beak was not flat or pointed it was tubular and blunt like the proboscis of a mosquito This proboscis was buried in Patricks arm Still screaming he pinched the splattered creature between his fingers and pulled it off The proboscis came out cleanly followed by a watery flow of blood mixed with some yellowishwhite liquid like pus It had made a painless dimesized hole in his arm And the creature although exploded was still twisting and moving and seeking in his fingers Patrick threw it away turned and more of them flew out of the refrigerator lighting on him even as he groped for the Amanas handle They landed on his hands his arms his neck One touched down on his forehead When Patrick raised his hand to pick it off he saw four others on his hand trembling minutely turning first pink and then red There was no pain but there was a hideous draining sensation Screaming whirling beating at his head and neck with his leechencrusted hands Patrick Hockstetters mind yammered It isnt real its just a bad dream dont worry its not real nothing is real But the blood pouring from the smashed leeches seemed real enough the sound of their buzzing wings seemed real enough and his own terror seemed real enough One of them fell down inside his shirt and settled on his chest While he was beating frantically at it and watching the bloodstain spread above the place where it had taken its hold another settled on his right eye Patrick closed it but that did no good he felt a brief hot flare as the things sucker poked through his eyelid and began to suck the fluid out of his eyeball Patrick felt his eye collapse in its socket and he screamed again A leech flew into his mouth when he did and roosted on his tongue Patrick went staggering and flapping up the path toward the junked cars Parasites hung all over him Some of them drank to capacity and then burst like balloons when this happened to the bigger ones they drenched Patrick with almost half a pint of his own hot blood He could feel the leech inside his mouth swelling up and he opened his jaws because the only coherent thought he had left was that it must not burst in there it must not must not But it did Patrick ejected a huge spray of blood and parasiteflesh like vomit He fell down in the gravelly dirt and began to roll over and over still screaming Little by little the sound of his own screams began to seem faint faraway Just before he passed out he saw a figure step from behind the last of the junked cars At first Patrick thought he was a guy Mandy Fazio perhaps and he would be saved But as the figure drew closer he saw its face was running like wax Sometimes it began to harden and look like somethingor someoneand then it would start to run again as if it couldnt make up its mind who or what it wanted to be Hello and goodbye a bubbling voice said from inside the running tallow of its features and Patrick tried to scream again He didnt want to die as the only real person he wasnt supposed to die If he did everyone else in the world would die with him The manshape laid hold of his leechencrusted arms and began to drag him away toward the Barrens His bloodstained bookcarrier bumped and thumped along beside him its strap still twisted about his neck Patrick still trying to scream lost consciousness He awoke only once when in some dark smelly drippy hell where no light shone no light at all It began to feed At first Beverly was not entirely sure what she was seeing or what was happening only that Patrick Hockstetter had begun to thrash and dance and scream She got up warily holding the slingshot in one hand and two of the ballbearings in the other She could hear Patrick blundering off down the path still yelling his head off In that moment Beverly looked every inch the lovely woman she was going to become and if Ben Hanscom had been around to see her just then his heart might not have been able to stand it She was standing fully upright her head cocked to the left her eyes wide her hair done in braids that had been tied off with two small red velvet bows which she had bought in Dahlies for a dime Her posture was one of total attention and concentration it was feline lynxlike She had shifted forward on her left foot her body halfturned as if to go after Patrick and the legs of her faded shorts had pulled up enough to show the edging on her yellow cotton panties Below them her legs were already smoothly muscled beautiful in spite of the scabs bruises and smutches of dirt Its a trick He saw you and he knows he probably cant catch you in a fair chase so hes trying to get you to come out Dont go Bevvie But another part of her thought there was too much pain and fear in those screams She wished she had seen whatever had happened to Patrickif anything hadmore clearly She wished more than anything else that she had come into the Barrens a different way and missed the whole crazy shenanigans Patricks screams stopped A moment later Beverly heard someone speakbut she knew that had to be her imagination She heard her father say Hello and goodbye Her father wasnt even in Derry that day he had set off for Brunswick at eight oclock He and Joe Tammerly were going to pick up a Chevy truck in Brunswick She shook her head as if to clear it The voice didnt speak again Her imagination obviously She walked out of the bushes to the path ready to run the instant she saw Patrick charging at her her reactions on triggers as delicate as a cats whiskers She looked down at the path and her eyes widened There was blood here Quite a lot of it Fake blood her mind insisted You can buy a bottle of it at Dahlies for fortynine cents Be careful Bevvie She knelt and quickly touched the blood with her fingers She looked at them closely It wasnt fake blood There was a flash of heat in her left arm just below the elbow She looked down and saw something that she first thought was some kind of burr Nonot a burr Burrs didnt twitch and flutter This thing was alive A moment after that she realized it was biting her She struck it hard with the back of her right hand and it spattered spraying blood She backed up a step getting ready to scream now that it was over and then she saw that it wasnt over at all The things featureless head was still on her arm its snout buried in her flesh With a shrill cry of disgust and fear she picked it off and saw its proboscis come out of her arm like a small dagger dripping with blood She understood the blood on the path now oh yes and her eyes went to the refrigerator The door had swung closed and latched again but a number of the parasites had been left outside and were crawling sluggishly over the rustywhite porcelain As Beverly looked one of them unfurled its membranous flylike wings and buzzed toward her She acted without thinking loading one of the steel ballbearings into the cup of the Bullseye and pulling the sling back As the muscles of her left arm flexed smoothly she saw loose blood squirt from the hole the thing had made in her arm She let fly anyway unconsciously leading the flying thing Shit Missed she thought as the Bullseye snapped and the ballbearing flew a glittering chunk of light in the hazy sun And she would later tell the other Losers that she knew she had missed it the same way a bowler knows he has missed the strike as soon as a bad ball leaves his hand But then she saw the ballbearing curve It happened in a splitsecond but the impression was very clear it had curved It struck the flying thing and splattered it to mush There was a shower of yellowish droplets which pattered on the path Beverly backed up slowly at first her eyes huge her lips trembling her face a shocked grayishwhite Her gaze was pinned to the front of the discarded refrigerator waiting to see if any of the other things would smell or sense her But the parasites only crawled slowly back and forth like autumn flies drugged with the cold Panic beat darkly against her thoughts but she would not give in to it entirely She held the Bullseye in her left hand and looked back over her shoulder from time to time There was still blood dappled brightly on the path and on the leaves of some of the bushes bordering it as if Patrick had woven from side to side as he ran Beverly burst out into the area of the junked cars again Ahead of her there was a bigger splash of blood just beginning to soak into the gravelly earth The ground looked disturbed darker streaks of earth lined into the powderywhite surface As if there had been a struggle there Two grooves about two and a half feet apart led away from this spot Beverly halted panting She looked at her arm and was relieved to see that the flow of blood was finally slowing although her lower forearm and the palm of her hand were streaked and tacky with it The pain had begun now a low steady throb It felt the way her mouth felt about an hour after the dentists when the novocaine began to wear off She looked behind again saw nothing then looked back at those grooves leading away from the junked cars away from the dump and into the Barrens Those things were in the refrigerator They got all over himsure they did look at all the blood He got this far and then She was terribly afraid she knew The leeches were a part of It and they had driven Patrick into another part of It much as a panicmaddened steer is driven down the chute and into the slaughteringpen Instead she followed the grooves in the earth holding the Bullseye tightly She walked on following the grooves as the ground sloped down and became softer She followed them into heavy foliage again Somewhere a cicada burred loudly and then unwound into silence Mosquitoes lighted on her bloodstreaked arm She waved them away Her teeth were clenched on her lower lip There was something lying on the ground ahead She picked it up and looked at it It was a handmade wallet the sort of thing a kid might make as a crafts project at Community House Except it was obvious to Bev that the kid who made this hadnt been much of a craftsman the wide plastic stitching was already coming unravelled and the bill compartment flapped like a loose mouth She found a quarter in the change compartment The only other thing in the wallet was a library card made out in the name of Patrick Hockstetter She tossed the wallet aside library card and all She wiped her fingers on her shorts Fifty feet farther on she found a sneaker The underbrush was now too dense for her to be able to follow the grooves in the earth but you didnt have to be the Pathfinder to follow the splashes and drips of blood on the bushes The trail wound down through a steep brake Bev lost her footing once slid and was raked by thorns Fresh lines of blood appeared on her upper thigh She was breathing fast now her hair sweaty and matted to her skull The spots of blood led out onto one of the faint paths through the Barrens The Kenduskeag was nearby Patricks other sneaker its laces bloody lay marooned on the path She approached the river with the Bullseyes sling halfdrawn The grooves in the earth had reappeared They were shallower nowthats because he lost his sneakers she thought She came around a final bend and faced the river The grooves went down the bank and led ultimately to one of those concrete cylindersone of the pumpingstations There they stopped The iron cover capping the top of this cylinder was a little ajar As she stood above it looking down a thick and monstrous chuckle suddenly issued from beneath It was too much The panic which had threatened now descended Beverly turned and fled toward the clearing and clubhouse her bloody left arm up to shield her face from the branches which whipped and slapped her Sometimes I worry too Daddy she thought wildly Sometimes I worry a LOT Four hours later all of the Losers except Eddie crouched in the bushes near the spot where Beverly had hidden and watched Patrick Hockstetter go to the refrigerator and open it The sky overhead had darkened with thunderheads and the smell of rain was in the air again Bill was holding the end of a long length of clothesline in his hands The six of them had pooled their available cash and bought the line and a Johnsons firstaid kit for Beverly Bill had carefully affixed a gauze pad over the bloody hole in her arm TTell your puhpuhharents you ggot a scruhhape when you were skuhskuhskating Bill said My skates Beverly cried dismayed She had forgotten all about them There Ben said and pointed They were lying in a heap not far away and she went to retrieve them before Ben or Bill or any of the others could offer She remembered now that she had put them aside before urinating She didnt want any of the others over there Bill himself had tied one end of the clothesline to the handle of the Amana refrigerator although they had all cautiously approached it together ready to bolt at the first sign of movement Bev had offered to give the Bullseye back to Bill he had insisted she keep it As it turned out nothing had moved Although the area on the path in front of the refrigerator was splattered with blood the parasites were gone Perhaps they had flown away You could bring Chief Borton and Mr Nell and a hundred other cops down here and it still wouldnt matter Stan Uris said bitterly Nope They wouldnt see a frockin thing Richie agreed Hows your arm Bev Hurts She paused looking from Bill to Richie and back to Bill again Would my mom and dad see the hole that thing made in my arm I dddont ththink ssso Bill said Get rehready to ruhruhrun Im gonna ttttie it uhuhon He looped the cod of the clothesline around the refrigerators rustflecked chrome handle working with the care of a man defusing a live bomb He tied a grannyknot and then stepped back paying out the clothesline He grinned a small shaky grin at the others when they had made some distance Whooo he said GGlad thats ohover Now a safe they hoped distance from the refrigerator Bill told them again to get ready to run Thunder boomed directly overhead and they all jumped The first scattered drops began to fall Bill jerked the clothesline as hard as he could His grannyknot popped off the handle but not before it had pulled the refrigerator door open again An avalanche of orange pompoms fell out and Stan Uris uttered a painful groan The others only stared openmouthed The rain began to come harder Thunder whipcracked above them making them cringe and purplishblue lightning flared as the refrigerator door swung all the way open Richie saw it first and screamed a high hurt sound Bill uttered some sort of angry frightened cry The others were silent Written on the inside of the door written in drying blood were these words image of handwriting in shaky capitals with the words STOP NOW BEFORE I KILL YOU ALL A WORD TO THE WISE FROM YOUR FRIEND PENNYWISE Hail mixed with the driving rain The refrigerator door shuddered back and forth in the rising wind the letters painted there beginning to drip and run now taking on the draggling ominous look of a horrormovie poster Bev was not aware that Bill had gotten up until she saw him advancing across the path toward the refrigerator He was shaking both fists Water streamed down his face and plastered his shirt to his back WWere going to kkkill you Bill screamed Thunder whacked and cracked Lightning flashed so brightly that she could smell it and not far away there was a splintering rending sound as a tree fell Bill come back Richie was yelling Come back man He started to get up and Ben hauled him back down again You killed my brother George You son of a bitch You bastard You whoremaster Lets see you now Lets see you now Hail came in a spate stinging them even through the screening bushes Beverly held her arm up to protect her face She could see red welts on Bens streaming cheeks Bill come back she screamed despairingly and another thundercrack drowned her out it rolled across the Barrens below the low black clouds Bill kicked wildly at the heap of pompoms that had spilled out of the refrigerator He turned away and began to walk back toward them his head down He seemed not to feel the hail although it now covered the ground like snow He blundered into the bushes and Stan had to grab bis arm to keep him from going into the prickerbushes He was crying Thats okay Bill Ben said putting a clumsy arm around him Yeah Richie said dont worry Were not gonna chicken out He stared around at them his eyes looking wildly out of his wet face Is there anyone here whos gonna chicken out Bill looked up wiping his eyes They were all soaked to the skin and looked like a litter of pups that had just forded a river IhIts scuhscuhhared of uuus you know he said I can fuhfeel ththat I swear to GuhGod I cccan We will Beverly said She took Bill in her arms She had not realized how easily her arms would go around him how thin he was She could feel his heart racing under his shut she could feel it next to hers She thought that no touch had ever seemed so sweet and strong Richie put his arms around both of them and laid his head on Beverlys shoulder Ben did the same from the other side Stan Uris put his arms around Richie and Ben Mike hesitated and then slipped one arm around Beverlys waist and the other over Bills shivering shoulders They stood that way hugging and the sleet turned back to driving pouring rain rain so heavy it seemed almost like a new atmosphere The lightning walked and the thunder talked No one spoke Beverlys eyes were tightly shut They stood in the rain in a huddled group hugging each other listening to it hiss down on the bushes That was what she remembered best the sound of the rain and their own shared silence and a vague sorrow that Eddie was not there with them She remembered those things Okay Haystack Richie says Your turn The redheads smoked all of her cigarettes and most of mine The hour groweth late Ben glances up at the clock Yes its late nearly midnight Just time for one more story he thinks One more story before twelve Just to keep us warm What should it be But that of course is only a joke and not a very good one there is only one story left at least only one he remembers and that is the story of the silver slugshow they were made in Zack Denbroughs workshop on the night of July rd and how they were used on the th Beverly and Eddie shake their heads Bill and Richie nod Mike sits silent his eyes watchful in his tired face Ben stands up and unbuttons the workshirt he is wearing spreading it open An old scar in the shape of the letter H shows there Its lines are brokenthe belly was much bigger when that scar was put therebut its shape still identifiable The heavy scar depending downward from the crossbar of the H is much clearer It looks like a twisted white hangrope from which the noose has been cut Beverlys hand goes to her mouth The werewolf In that house Oh Jesus Christ And she turns to the windows as if to see it lurking outside in the darkness Thats right Ben said And you want to know something funny That scar wasnt there two days ago Henrys old callingcard was I know because I showed it to a friend of mine a bartender named Ricky Lee back in Hemingford Home But this one He laughs without much humor and begins buttoning his shirt again This one just came back Yeah Mike says as Ben buttons his skin up again The werewolf We all saw It as the werewolf that time Because thats how RRRichie saw IhIt before Bill murmurs Thats it isnt it We were close werent we Beverly says Her voice is softly marvelling Close enough to read each others minds Ole Big Hairy damn near had your guts for garters Ben Richie says and he is not smiling as he says it He pushes his mended glasses up on his nose and behind them his face looks white and haggard and ghostly Bill saved your bacon Eddie says abruptly I mean Bev saved us all but if it hadnt been for you Bill Yes Ben agrees You did big Bill I was like lost in the funhouse Bill points briefly at the empty chair I had some help from Stan Uris And he paid for it Maybe died for it But its ttrue And if its yuhyour ffault its my fault too and eeeveryone elses here because we went on Even after Patrick and what was written on that rrefrigerator we went on It would be my fault mmost of all I guess because I wuhwuhwanted us to go on Because of JuhGeorge Maybe even because I thought that if I killed whatever kkilled George my puhharents would have to luhluhluh Yes Of course But I dddont think it was aaanyones fuhhault Ben It was just the wwway Stan was built He couldnt face it Eddie says He is thinking of Mr Keenes revelation about his asthma medicine and how he could still not give it up He is thinking that he might have been able to give up the habit of being sick it was the habit of believing he had been unable to kick As things had turned out maybe that habit had saved his life He was great that day Ben says stan and his birds A chuckle stirs through them and they look at the chair where Stan would have been in a rightful sane world where all the good guys won all of the time I miss him Ben thinks God how I miss him He says You remember that day Richie when you told him you heard somewhere he killed Christ and Stan says totally deadpan I think that was my father I remember Richie says in a voice almost too low to hear He takes his handkerchief out of his back pocket removes his glasses wipes his eyes then puts his glasses back on He puts away the handkerchief and without looking up from his hands he says Why dont you just tell it Ben Yeah Richie says his voice so thick it is hard to understand him Why sure It hurts Ben looks around at them then nods All right then One more story before twelve Just to keep us warm Bill and Richie had the idea of the bullets No Richie demurs Bill thought of it first and he got nervous first Doesnt really matter I guess Ben says The three of us spent some heavy library time that July We were trying to find out how to make silver bullets I had the silver four silver dollars that were my fathers Then Bill got nervous thinking about what kind of shape wed be in if we had a misfire with some kind of monster coming down our throats And when we saw how good Beverly was with that slingshot of his we ended up using one of my silver dollars to make slugs instead We got the stuff together and all of us we went down to Bills place Eddie you were there I told my mother we were going to play Monopoly Eddie says My arm was really hurting but I had to walk Thats how pissed she was at me And every time I heard someone behind me on the sidewalk Id whip around thinking it was Bowers It didnt help the pain Bill grins And what we did was stand around and watch Ben make the ammo I think Ben rreally could have made silsilver bullets Oh Im not so sure of that Ben says although he still is He remembers how the dusk was drawing down outside Mr Denbrough had promised them all rides home the sound of the crickets in the grass the first lightningbugs blinking outside the windows Bill had carefully set up the Monopoly board in the dining room making it look as if the game had been going on for an hour or more He remembers that and the clean pool of yellow light falling on Zacks worktable He remembers Bill saying We gotta be cc careful I dont want to leave a muhmuhmess My dadll be He spat out a number of ps and finally managed to say pissed off Richie made a burlesque of wiping his cheek do you serve towels with your showers Stuttering Bill Bill made as if to hit him Richie cowered shrieking in his Pickaninny Voice Ben took very little notice of them He watched Bill lay out the implements and tools one by one in the light Part of his mind was wishing that someday he might have such a nice worktable as this himself Most of it was centered directly on the job ahead Hot as difficult as making silver bullets would have been but he would still be careful There was no excuse for sloppy workmanship This was not something he had been taught or told just something he knew Bill had insisted that Ben make the slugs just as he continued to insist that Beverly would be the one carrying the Bullseye These things could have and had been discussed but it was only twentyseven years later telling the story that Ben realized no one had even suggested that a silver bullet or slug might not stop a monsterthey had the weight of what seemed like a thousand horror movies on their side Okay Ben said He cracked his knuckles and then looked at Bill You got the molds Oh Bill jumped a little HHHere He reached into his pants pocket and brought out his handkerchief He put it on the workbench and unfolded it There were two dull steel balls inside each with a small hole in it They were bearing molds After deciding on slugs instead of bullets Bill and Richie had gone back to the library and had researched how bearings were made You boys are so busy Mrs Starrett had said Bullets one week and bearings the next And its summer vacation too It turned out that making bearings was a cinch once you had the molds The only real question was where to get them A couple of discreet questions to Zack Denbrough had taken care of that and none of the Losers were too surprised to find that the only machineshop in Derry where such molds might be obtained was Kitchener Precision Tool amp Die The Kitchener who owned and ran it was a greatgreatgrandnephew of the brothers who had owned the Kitchener Ironworks Bill and Richie had gone over together with all the cash the Losers had been able to raise on short noticeten dollars and fiftynine centsin Bills pocket When Bill asked how much a couple of twoinch bearing molds might cost Carl Kitchenerwho looked like a veteran boozehound and smelled like an old horseblanketasked what a couple of kids wanted with bearing molds Richie let Bill speak knowing things would probably go easier that waychildren made fun of Bills stutter adults were embarrassed by it Sometimes this was surprisingly helpful Bill got halfway through the explanation he and Richie had worked out on the way oversomething about a model windmill for next years science projectwhen Kitchener waved for him to shut up and quoted them the unbelievable price of fifty cents per mold Hardly able to believe their good fortune Bill forked over a single dollar bill Dont expect me to give you a bag Carl Kitchener said eying them with the bloodshot contempt of a man who believes he has seen everything the world holds most of it twice You dont get no bag unless you spend at least five bucks And dont hang around out front Kitchener said You both need haircuts Outside Bill said YYYou ever nuhhotice RuhRichie how guhguhgrownups wwwont sell you aaanything except ccandy or cuhcuhhomic books or mmaybe movie tttickets without first they wwant to know what yyou want it ffor Yeah Richie said and then giggled Lets hang around out front want to Well put up our collars and sneer at people and let our hair grow Okay Ben said looking at the molds carefully and then putting them down Good Now They gave him a little more room looking at him hopefully the way a man with engine trouble who knows nothing about cars will look at a mechanic Ben didnt notice their expressions He was concentrating on the job Bill handed a cutdown mortar shell to him It was a war souvenir Zack had picked it up five days after he and the rest of General Pattons army had crossed the river into Germany There had been a time when Bill was very young and George was still in diapers that his father had used it as an ashtray Later he had quit smoking and the mortar shell had disappeared Bill had found it in the back of the garage just a week ago Ben put the mortar shell into Zacks vise tightened it and then took the blowtorch from Beverly He reached into his pocket brought out a silver dollar and dropped it into the makeshift crucible It made a hollow sound She smiled back It was enough for Ben If she had smiled at him twice he would gladly have made enough silver bearings to shoot a platoon of werewolves He looked hastily away Okay Here we go No problem Easy as pie right Years later recounting all of this Ben would think These days a kid could just run out and buy a propane torch or his dad would have one in the workshop There had been no such things in however Zack Denbrough had a tankjob and it made Beverly nervous Ben could tell she was nervous wanted to tell her not to worry but was afraid his voice would tremble Dont worry he said to Stan who was standing next to her Oh I thought you were And I just wanted you to know this is perfectly safe If you were Worrying I mean Richie gave him a book of matches Ben twisted the valve on the tank and lit a match under the nozzle of the torch There was a flump and a bright blueorange glare Ben tuned the flame to a blue edge and began to heat the base of the mortar shell RRRight here Bill handed over a homemade funnel that Ben had made earlier The tiny hole at its base fit the hole in the bearing molds almost exactly Ben had done this without taking a single measurement Bill had been amazedalmost flabbergastedbut did not know how to say so without embarrassing Ben Absorbed in what he was doing Ben could talk to Beverlyhe spoke with the dry precision of a surgeon addressing a nurse Bev you got the steadiest hands Suck the funnel in the hole Use one of those gloves so you dont get burned Bill handed her one of his fathers work gloves Beverly put the tin funnel in the mold No one spoke The hissing of the blowtorch flame seemed very loud They watched it eyes squinted almost shut Wuhwuhwait Bill said suddenly and dashed into the house He came back a minute later with a pair of cheap Turtle wraparound sunglasses that had been languishing in a kitchen drawer for a year or more Better pput these uhon HHHaystack Shit its Fabian Richie said Or Frankie Avalon or one of those Bandstand wops Fuck you Trashmouth Ben said but he started giggling in spite of himself The idea of him being Fabian or someone like that was just too weird The flame wavered and he stopped laughing his concentration narrowed to a point again Two minutes later he handed the torch to Eddie who held it gingerly in his good hand Its ready he said to Bill Gimme that other glove Fast Fast Bill gave it to him Ben put it on and held the mortar shell with the gloved hand while he turned the vise lever with the other Im ready dont wait for me she rapped back at him Ben tilted the shell over the funnel The others watched as a rivulet of molten silver flowed between the two receptacles Ben poured precisely not a drop was spilled And for a moment he felt galvanized He seemed to see everything magnified through a strong white glow For that one moment he did not feel like plain fat old Ben Hanscom who wore sweatshirts to disguise his gut and his tits he felt like Thor working thunder and lightning at the smithy of the gods Okay he said Im gonna have to reheat the silver Someone shove a nail or something up the spout of the funnel before the goop hardens in there Ben clamped the mortar shell in the vise again and took the torch from Eddie Now we play Monopoly for an hour Ben said while they harden in the molds Then I clip em open with a chisel along the cutlines and were done Richie looked uneasily at the cracked face of his Timex which had taken a great many lickings and kept on ticking When will your folks be back Bill NNNot until tuhten or tenthuhthuhhirty Bill said Its a double ffffeature at the UhUhUh Yeah And theyll stop in for a slice of pppizza after They aalmost always ddo Then lets go in Bev said I want to call home I promised I would And dont any of you talk He thinks Im at Community House and that Im getting a ride home from there What if he wants to come down and pick you up early Mike asked Then Beverly said Im going to be in a lot of trouble Ben thought Id protect you Beverly In his minds eye an instant daydream unfolded one with an ending so sweet he shivered Bevs father started to give her a hard time to bawl her out and all that even in his daydream he did not imagine how bad all that could get with Al Marsh Ben threw himself in front of her and told Marsh to lay off If you want trouble fatboy you just keep protecting my daughter Hanscom usually a quiet bookish type can be a ravening tiger when you get him mad He speaks to Al Marsh with great sincerity If you want to get to her youll have to come through me first Marsh starts forward and then the steely glint in Hanscoms eyes stops him Youll be sorry he mumbles but its clear all the fight has gone out of himHes just a paper tiger after all Somehow I doubt that Hanscom says with a tight Gary Cooper smile and Beverlys father slinks away Whats happened to you Ben Bev cries but her eyes are shining and full of stars You looked ready to kill him Kill him Hanscom says the Gary Cooper smile still lingering on his lips No way baby He may be a creep but hes still your father I might have roughed him up a little but thats only because when someone talks wrong to you I get a little hot under the collar You know She throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips on the LIPS I love you Ben she sobs He can feel her small breasts pressing firmly against his chest and He shivered a little throwing this bright terribly clear picture off with an effort Richie stood in the doorway asking him if he was coming and Ben realized he was all alone in the workroom Youre goin senile Haystack Richie said as Ben went though the door but he clapped Ben on the shoulder Ben grinned and hooked an elbow briefly around Richies neck There was no problem with Beverlys dad He had come home late from work Bevs mother told her over the phone fallen asleep in front of the TV and waked up just long enough to get himself into bed Yes Bill Denbroughs dad is going to take a whole bunch of us home Mrs Marsh sounded suddenly alarmed Youre not on a date are you Bevvie No of course not Bev said looking through the arched doorway between the darkened hall where she was and the dining room where the others were sitting down around the Monopoly board But I sure wish I was Boys uck But they have a signup sheet down here and every night a different dad or mom takes kids home That much at least was true The rest was a lie so outrageous that she could feel herself blushing hotly in the dark All right her mom said I just wanted to be sure Because if your dad caught you going on dates at your age hed be mad Almost as an afterthought she added I would be too Yeah I know Bev said still looking into the dining room She did know yet here she was not with one boy but six of them in a house where the parents were gone She saw Ben looking at her anxiously and she sketched a smiling little salute at him He blushed but gave her the little salute right back Um Patty OHaras here And Ellie Geiger I think Shes playing shuffleboard downstairs The facility with which the lies came from her lips made her ashamed She wished she were talking to her father she would have been more scared but less ashamed She supposed she really wasnt a very good girl Same goes back to you Bev Her mother paused briefly and added Be careful The paper says there may be another one A boy named Patrick Hockstetter Hes missing Did you know him Bevvie She joined the others at the table and for an hour they played Monopoly Stan was the big winner Jews are very good at making money Stan said putting a hotel on Atlantic Avenue and two more green houses on Ventnor Avenue Everybody knows that Jesus make me Jewish Ben said promptly and everyone laughed Ben was almost broke Beverly glanced across the table from time to time at Bill noting his clean hands his blue eyes the fine red hair As he moved the little silver shoe he was using as a marker around the board she thought If he held my hand I think Id be so glad Id probably die A warm light seemed to glow briefly in her chest and she smiled secretly down at her hands The evenings finale was almost anticlirnactic Ben took one of Zacks chisels from the shelf and used a hammer to strike the molds on the cutlines They opened easily Two small silver balls fell out In one they could faintly see part of a date In the other wavery lines Beverly thought were the remnants of Lady Libertys hair They looked at them without speaking for a moment and then Stan picked one up So was the rock in Davids sung when he went up against Goliath Mike said They look powerful to me All done Ben said Here He tossed the second slug to Bill who was so surprised he almost fumbled it The slugs went around the circle Each of them looked closely at both marvelling at their roundness weight actuality When they came back to Ben he held them in his hand and then looked at Bill What do we do with them now He looked at her His face was kind enough but stern BBBev weve been thruhthrough this aaalready and Ill do it she said Ill shoot the goddamned things when the time comes If it comes Ill probably get us all killed but Ill do it I dont want to take them home though One of my Dont you have a secret hiding place Richie asked Criminy I got four or five Ive got a place Beverly said There was a small slit in the bottom of her boxspring where she sometimes stashed cigarettes comic books and just lately film and fashion magazines But nothing Id trust for something like this You keep them Bill Until its time anyway you keep them Okay Bill said mildly and just then lights splashed into the driveway Holy cruhcrow theyre eeearly LLets get out of hhere They were just sitting down around the Monopoly board again when Sharon Denbrough opened the kitchen door Richie rolled his eyes and mimed wiping sweat from his forehead the others laughed heartily Richie had Gotten Off A Good One A moment later she came in Your dads waiting for your friends in the car Bill Who won Sharon asked smiling brighteyed at Bills little friends The girl was going to be very pretty she thought She supposed in another year or two the children would have to be chaperoned if there were going to be girls instead of just the regular gang of boys But surely it was still too soon to worry about sex rearing its ugly head StStan wuhwuhwon Bill said JuhJuhJews are very gggood at mmaking money Bill She cried horrified and blushing and then she looked around at them amazed as they roared with laughter Stan included Amazement turned to something like fear although she said nothing of this to her husband later in bed There was a feeling in the air like static electricity only somehow much more powerful much more scary She felt that if she touched any of them she would receive a walloping shock Whats happened to them she thought dismayed and perhaps she even opened her mouth to say something like that Then Bill was saying he was sorry but still with that devilish glint in his eye and Stan was saying that was all right it was just a joke they laid on him from time to time and she found herself too confused to say anything at all But she felt relieved when the children were gone and her own puzzling stuttering son had gone to his room and turned off the light The day that the Losers Club finally met It in facetoface combat the day It almost had Ben Hanscoms guts for garters was July th It was hot and muggy and still Ben remembered the weather clearly enough it had been the last day of the hot weather After that day a long spell of cool and cloudy had come in They arrived at Neibolt Street around ten that morning Bill riding Richie double on Silver Ben with his ample buttocks spilling over either side of the sagging seat on his Raleigh Beverly came down Neibolt Street on her girls Schwinn her red hair held back from her forehead by a green band It streamed out behind her Mike came by himself and about five minutes later Stan and Eddie walked up together Aw not too bad Hurts if I roll over on that side while Im sleeping Did you bring the stuff There was a canvaswrapped bundle in Silvers bikebasket Bill took it out and unwrapped it He handed the slingshot to Beverly who took it with a little grimace but said nothing There was also a tin Sucrets box in the bundle Bill opened it and showed them the two silver balls They looked at them silently gathered close together on the balding lawn on Neibolt Streeta lawn where only weeds seemed to grow Bill Richie and Eddie had seen the house before the others hadnt and they looked at it curiously The windows look tike eyes Stan thought and his hand went to the paperback book in his back pocket He touched it for luck He carried the book with him almost everywhereit was M K Handeys Guide to North American Birds They look like dirty blind eyes It stinks Beverly thought I can smell itbut not with my nose not exactly Mike thought Its like that time out where the Ironworks used to be It has the same feel as if its telling us to step on in This is one of Its places all right Ben thought One of the places like the Morlock holes where It goes out and comes back in And It knows were out here Its waiting for us to come in They looked back at him pale and solemn No one said no Eddie fumbled his aspirator out of his pocket and took a long whooping gasp at it Richie held out his hand No fake Jake Can I have some Eddie shrugged with his good shoulderan oddly disjointed movementand handed it over Richie triggered the aspirator and breathed deep Needed that he said and handed it back He was coughing a little but his eyes were sober So one after another they used Eddies aspirator When it came back to him Eddie jammed it in his back pocket where the nozzle stuck out They turned to look at the house again Does anybody live on this street Beverly asked in a low voice Not this end of it Mike said Not anymore I guess there are still bums sometimes Guys that come through on the freights They wouldnt see anything Stan said Theyd be safe Most of them anyway He looked at Bill Can any grownups at all see It do you think I wish we could meet one Richie said glumly This really isnt a job for kids you know what I mean Bill knew Whenever the Hardy Boys got into trouble Fenton Hardy was around to bail them out Same with Rick Brants dad in the Rick Brant Science Adventures Shit even Nancy Drew had a father who would show up in the nick of time if the bad guys tied her up and threw her into an abandoned mine or something Ought to be a grownup along Richie said looking at the closed house with hs peeling paint its duty windows its shadowy porch He sighed tiredly For a moment Ben felt their resolution falter They walked around to the left side of the porch where the skirting was torn off The brambly runtothewild roses were still there and those It had touched when It climbed out were still black and dead It just touched them and it did that Beverly asked horrified For a moment nobody replied They werent sure even though all of them knew by Bills face that he would go on without them they werent sure There was also a species of shame on Bills face As he had told them before George hadnt been their brother But all the other kids Ben thought Betty Ripsom Cheryl Lamonica that Clements kid Eddie Corcoran maybe Ronnie Grogan even Patrick Hockstetter It kills kids goddamit kids Sure Richie said You think were gonna let you have all the fun mushmouth Bill looked at them his throat working and then he nodded He handed the tin box to Beverly She nodded at once horrified by the responsibility and bewitched by his trust She opened the box took out the slugs and slipped one into the right front pocket of her jeans The other she socketed in the Bullseyes rubber cup and it was by the cup that she carried the slingshot She could feel the ball tightly enclosed in her fist cold at first and then warming Lets go she said her voice not quite steady Lets go before I chicken out Bill nodded then looked sharply at Eddie CuhCan you dddo this EhEhEddie Eddie nodded sure I can I was alone last time This time Im with my friends Right He looked at them and grinned a little His expression was shy fragile and quite beautiful Richie clapped him on the back Thass right senhorr Anywhunn tries to steal your assipirator we keel heem But we keel heem slow UhUhunder the pporch Bill said AA of you bbbehind me Then into the suhsuhcellar If you go first and that thing jumps you what do I do Beverly asked shoot through you If yyou have to Bill said But I suhsuhsuggest yyyou try guhhoing aaround first Well gggo through the whole puhpuhplace if we have tto He shrugged Maybe we wont find be aaanything Ben believed he was right The house at Neibolt Street seemed to be encased in a poisonous envelope It could not be seen but it could be felt He licked his lips Cuhcome on ththen Bill said stay cluhclose behind me BBeverly He dropped to his knees crawled through the blighted rosebushes and under the porch They went this way Bill Beverly Ben Eddie Richie Stan Mike The leaves under the porch crackled and puffed up a sour old smell Ben wrinkled his nose Had he ever smelled fallen leaves like these He thought not And then an unpleasant idea struck him They smelled the way he imagined a mummy would smell just after its discoverer had levered open its coffin all dust and bitter ancient tannic acid Bill had reached the broken cellar window and was looking into the cellar Beverly crawled up beside him You see anything Bill shook his head But that ddoesnt mmmean nuhhuthins there LLook theres the ccoalpile me and RRRichie used to get owout Ben who was looking between them saw it He was becoming excited as well as afraid now and he welcomed the excitement instinctively recognizing the fact that it could be a tool Seeing the coalpile was a little like seeing a great landmark about which you had only read or heard from others Bill turned around and slipped lithely through the window Beverly gave Ben the Bullseye folding his hand over the cup and ball nestled in it Give it to me the second Im down she said The second She slipped down as easily and lithely as Bill had before her There wasfor Ben at leastone heartstopping instant when her blouse pulled out of her jeans and he saw her flat white belly Then there was the thrill of her hands over his as he handed the slingshot down Ben turned around himself and began to wriggle through the window He should have forseen what happened next it was really inevitable He got stuck His fanny bound up against the rectangular cellar window and he couldnt go in any further He started to pull himself out and realized horrified that he could do it but was very apt to yank his pantsand perhaps his underpants as welldown to his knees when he did And there he would be with his extremely large ass practically in his beloveds face Ben pushed grimly with both hands For a moment he still couldnt move and then his butt popped through the windowhole His bluejeans dragged painfully up into his crotch squashing his balls The top of the window rucked his shin all the way up to his shoulderblades Now his gut was stuck Suck in Haystack Richie said giggling hysterically You better suck in or well have to send Mike after his dads chainfall to pull you out again Beepbeep Richie Ben said through gritted teeth He sucked his belly in as much as he could He had never really realized just how big his stupid stomach was until this supremely embarrassing moment He moved a little further then stopped again He turned his head as far as he could fighting panic and claustrophobia His face had gone a bright sweaty red The sour smell of the leaves was heavy in his nostrils cloying Bill Can you guys pull me He felt Bill grasp one of his ankles Beverly the other He sucked his belly in as far as he could A moment later he came tumbling through the window Bill grabbed him Both of them almost fell over Ben couldnt look at Bev He had never in his life been as embarrassed as he was at that moment Bill laughed shakily Beverly joined him and then Ben was able to laugh a little too although it would be years before he could see anything remotely funny in what had happened OOOkay Bill and Ben took up positions below the window Eddie came through on his back Bill got his legs just above the knees Watch what youre doing Eddie said in a querulous nervous voice Im ticklish Ben got Eddie around the waist trying to keep his hand away from the cast and the sling The two of them manhandled Eddie through the cellar window like a corpse Eddie cried out once but that was all Yeah Eddie said okay No big deal But large drops of sweat stood out on his forehead and he was breathing in quick rasps His eyes darted around the cellar Bill stepped back again Beverly stood near him now holding the Bullseye by the shaft and the cup ready to fire if necessary Her eyes swept the cellar constantly Richie came through next followed by Stan and Mike Both of the latter moved with a smooth grace that Ben deeply envied Then they were all down down in the cellar where Bill and Richie had seen It only a month before The room was dim but not dark Dusky light shafted in through the windows and pooled on the dirt floor The cellar seemed very big to Ben almost too big as if he were witnessing an optical illusion of some sort Dusty rafters crisscrossed overhead The furnacepipes were rusty Some sort of duty white cloth hung from the waterpipes in dirty strings and strands The smell was down here too A dirty yellow smell Ben thought Its here all right Oh yeah Bill started toward the stairs The others fell in behind him He halted at their foot and glanced underneath He reached under with one foot and kickpawed something out They looked at it wordlessly It was a white clownglove now streaked with dirt and dust They went up and emerged into a dirty kitchen One plain straightbacked chair stood marooned in the center of the humped hillocky linoleum That was it for furniture There were empty liquor bottles in one corner Ben could see others in the pantry He could smell boozewine mostlyand old stale cigarettes Those smells were dominant but that other smell was there too It was getting stronger all the time Beverly went to the cupboards and opened one of them She screamed piercingly as a blackishbrown Norway rat tumbled out almost into her face It struck the counter with a plop and glared around at them with its black eyes Still screaming Beverly raised the Bullseye and pulled the sling back She turned her pale terrified face toward him Then she nodded and relaxed her arm the silver ball unfiredbut Ben thought she had been very very close She backed up slowly ran into Ben jumped He put an arm around her tight The rat scurried down the length of the counter jumped to the floor ran into the pantry and was gone It wanted me to shoot at it Beverly said in a faint voice Use up half of our ammunition on it Yes Bill said Its lllike the FBI training rrange at QuhQuhQuantico in a wwway They sehsend yyou down this ffhake street and ppop up tuhhargets If you shuhshoot any honest citizens ihinstead of just cruhcrooks you llose puhhoints I cant do this Bill she said Ill mess it up Here You She held the Bullseye out but Bill shook his head Richie looked inside and an expression of sick disgust crossed his face He slammed the cupboard shut with a bang that produced a dead echo in the empty house A litter Richie sounded ill Biggest litter I ever saw anyone ever saw probably He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth Theres hundreds of them in there He looked at them his mouth twitching a little on one side Their tails they were all tangled up Bill Knotted together He grimaced Like snakes They looked at the cupboard door The mewling was muffled but still audible Rats Ben thought looking at Bills white face and over Bills shoulder Mikes ashygray one Everyones ascared of rats It knows it too CCCome on Bill said HHere on NuhNuhNeibolt Street the fffun just nehhever stops They went down the front hall Here the unlovely smells of rotting plaster and old urine were intermixed They were able to look out at the street through dirty panes of glass and see their bikes Bevs and Bens were heeled over on their kickstands Bills leaned against a stunted maple tree To Ben the bikes looked a thousand miles away like things seen through the wrong end of a telescope The deserted street with its casual patchings of asphalt the faded humid sky the steady dingdingding of a locomotive running on a siding these things seemed like dreams to him hallucinations What was real was this squalid hallway with its stinks and shadows There was a shatter of broken brown glass in one cornerRheingold bottles In the other corner wet and swelled was a digestsized girlybook The woman on the cover was bent over a chair her skirt up in the back to show the tops of her fishnet hose and her black panties The picture did not look particularly sexy to Ben nor did it embarrass him that Beverly had also glanced at it Moisture had yellowed the womans skin and moisture had humped the cover in ripples that became wrinkles on her face Her salacious wink had become the leer of a dead whore Years later as Ben recounted this Bev suddenly cried out startling all of themthey were not so much listening to the story as reliving it It was her Bev yelled Mrs Kersh It was her As Ben looked the youngold crone on the girlybook cover winked at him She wiggled her fanny in an obscene comeon Bill pushed open a door on the left and they followed him into a vaultlike room that might once have been a parlor A crumpled pair of green pants was hung over the lightfixture which depended from the ceiling Like the cellar this room seemed much too big to Ben almost as long as a freightcar Much too long for a house as small as this one had appeared from the outside Oh but that was outside a new voice spoke inside his mind It was a jocular squealing voice and Ben realized with sudden numbing certainty that he was hearing Pennywise Itself Pennywise was speaking to him on some crazy mental radio Outside things always look smaller than they really are dont they Ben Richie turned to look at him his face still strained and pale You say something Ben shook his head The voice was gone That was an important thing a good thing Yet he had understood This house was a special place a kind of station one of the places in Derry one of the many perhaps from which It was able to find its way into the overworld This stinking rotted house where everything was somehow wrong It wasnt just that it seemed too big the angles were wrong the perspective crazy Ben was standing just inside the door between the parlor and the hallway and the others were moving away from him across a space that now looked almost as big as Bassey Park but as they moved away they seemed to grow larger instead of smaller The floor seemed to slope and Mike turned Ben he called and Ben saw alarm on his face Catch up Were losing you He could barely hear the last word It trailed away as if the others were being swept off on a fast train Suddenly terrified he began to run The door behind him swept shut with a muffled bang He screamed and something seemed to sweep through the air just behind him ruffling his shirt He looked back but there was nothing there That did not change his belief however that something had been He caught up with the others He was panting out of breath and would have sworn he had run half a mile at least but when he looked back the parlors far wall was not ten feet away You scared me man he said Richie Stan and Eddie were looking at Mike questioningly He looked small Mike said Like he was a mile away We gotta make sure everybody stays close Ben panted This place its like the funhouse in a carnival or something Well get lost I think It wants us to get lost To get separated Bill looked at him for a moment lips thin All right he said We aall stay cluhcluhhose No ssstragglers They nodded back frightened clustered outside the hall door Stans hand groped at the birdbook in his back pocket Eddie was holding his aspirator in one hand crunching it loosening up then crunching it again like a ninetyeightpound weakling trying to build up his muscles with a tennis ball Bill opened the door and here was another narrower hall The wallpaper which showed runners of roses and elves wearing green caps was falling away from the spongy plaster in draggling leaves Yellow waterstains spread in senile rings on the ceiling overhead A scummy wash of light fell through a dirty window at the end of the hall Abruptly the corridor seemed to elongate The ceiling rose and then began to diminish above them like some weird rocket The doors grew with the ceiling pulled up like taffy The faces of the elves grew long and became alien their eyes bleeding black holes It is Stan screamed back his small closed fists plugging his eyes Its real you know it is God Im going crazy this is crazy this is crazy WuhwuhWATCH Bill bellowed at Stan at all of them and Ben his head reeling watched as Bill bent down coiled and suddenly flung himself upward His closed left fist struck nothing nothing at all but there was a heavy crrrack sound Plaster dust puffed from a place where there was no longer any ceiling and then there was The hallway was just a hallway again narrow lowceilinged dirty But the walls no longer stretched up into forever There was only Bill looking at them and nursing his bleeding hand which was floury with plasterdust Overhead was the clear mark his fist had made in the soft plaster of the ceiling NNNot ruhruhreal he said to Stan to all of them Just a fffalse ffuhface Like a HuhHuhHuhHalloween muhmuhhask To you maybe Stan said dully His face was shocked and horrified He looked around as if no longer sure where he was Looking at him smelling the sour reek coming out of his pores Ben who had been overjoyed at Bills victory got scared all over again Stan was close to cracking up Soon he would go into hysterics begin to scream perhaps and what would happen then To you Stan said again But if Id tried that nothing would have happened Because youve got your brother Bill but I dont have anything He looked aroundfirst back toward the parlor which had taken on a somber brown atmosphere so thick and smoggy they could barely see the door through which they had entered it to this hall which was bright but somehow dark somehow filthy somehow utterly mad Elves capered on the decaying wallpaper under runners of roses Sun glared on the panes of the window at the end of the hall and Ben knew that if they went down there they would see dead flies more broken glass and then what The floorboards spreading apart spilling them into a dead darkness where grasping fingers waited to catch them Stan was right God why had they come into Its lair with nothing but their two stupid silver slugs and a fucking slingshot He saw Stans panic leap from one of them to the next to the nextlike a grassfire driven by a hot wind it widened in Eddies eyes dropped Bevs mouth into a wounded gasp made Richie push his glasses up with both hands and stare around as if followed from close behind by a fiend They trembled on the brink of flight Bills warning to stay together almost forgotten They were listening to galeforce panicwinds blowing between their ears As if in a dream Ben heard Miss Davies the assistant librarian reading to the little ones Who is that triptrapping on my bridge And he saw them the little ones the babies leaning forward their faces still and solemn their eyes reflecting the eternal fascination of the fairystory would the monster be bested or would It feed I dont have anything Stan Uris wailed and he seemed very small almost small enough to slip through one of the cracks in the hallways plank flooring like a human letter You got your brother man but I dont have anything You duhduhduhdo Bill yelled back He grabbed Stan and Ben felt sure he was going to bust him one and his thoughts moaned No Bill please thats Henrys way if you do that Itll kill us all right now But Bill didnt hit Stan He whirled him around with rough hands and tore the paperback from the back pocket of Stans jeans Gimme it Stan screamed beginning to cry The others stood stunned shrinking away from Bill whose eyes now seemed to actually burn His forehead glowed like a lamp and he held the book out to Stan like a priest holding out a cross to ward off a vampire He turned his head up the cords in his neck standing out like cables his adams apple like an arrowhead buried in his throat Ben was filled with both fear and pity for his friend Bill Denbrough but there was also a strong sense of wonderful relief Had he doubted Bill Had any of them Oh Bill say it please cant you say it He thrust the book at Stan Stan took it and looked at Bill dumbly Tears glimmered on his cheeks He held the book so tightly that his fingers were white Bill looked at him then at the others Will the birds work Stan asked His voice was low husky Richie clapped him on the shoulder Come on Stankid he said Is you a man or is you a mouse I must be a man Stan said shakily and wiped tears from his face with the heel of his left hand so far as I know mice dont shit their pants They laughed and Ben could have sworn he felt the house pulling away from them from that sound Mike turned That big room The one we just came through Look They looked The parlor was now almost black It was not smoke nor any kind of gas it was just blackness a nearly solid blackness The air had been robbed of its light The blackness seemed to roll and flex as they stared into it to almost coalesce into faces They turned away from the black and walked down the hall Three doors opened off it two with dirty white porcelain doorknobs the third with only a hole where the knobs shaft had been Bill grabbed the first knob turned it and pushed the door open Bev crowded up next to him raising the Bullseye Ben drew back aware that the others were doing the same crowding behind Bill like frightened quail It was a bedroom empty save for one stained mattress The rusty ghosts of the coils in a boxspring long departed were tattooed into the mattresss yellow hide Outside the rooms one window sunflowers dipped and nodded Theres nothing Bill began and then the mattress began to bulge in and out rhythmically It suddenly ripped straight down the middle A black sticky fluid began to spill out staining the mattress and then running over the floor toward the doorway It came in long ropy tendrils Bill slammed it shut looked around at them and nodded Come on He had barely touched the knob of the second doorthis one on the other side of the narrow hallwhen the buzzing scream began behind the cheap wood Even Bill drew back from that rising inhuman cry Ben felt the sound might drive him mad his mind visualized a giant cricket behind the door like something from a movie where radiation made all the bugs get bigThe Beginning of the End maybe or The Black Scorpion or that one about the ants in the Los Angeles stormdrains He could not have run even if that buzzing rugose horror had splintered the panels of the door and begun caressing him with its great hairy legs Beside him he was dimly aware that Eddie was breathing in hacking gasps The scream rose in pitch never losing that buzzing insectile quality Bill fell back another step no blood in his face now his eyes bulging his lips only Shoot it Beverly Ben heard himself cry shoot it through the door shoot it before it can get us And the sun fell through the dirty window at the end of the hall a heavy feverish weight Beverly raised the Bullseye like a girl in a dream as the buzzing scream rose louder louder louder But before she could pull the sling back Mike was shouting No No Dont Bev Oh gosh Ill be dipped And incredibly Mike was laughing He pushed forward grabbed the knob turned it and shoved the door open It came free of the swollen jamb with a brief grinding noise Its a mooseblower Just a mooseblower thats all something to scare the crows The room was an empty box Lying on the floor was a Sterno can with both ends cut off In the middle strung tight and knotted outside holes punched in the cans sides was a waxed length of string Although there was no breeze in the roomthe one window was shut and indifferently boarded over letting light pass only in chinks and raysthere could be no doubt that the buzzing was coming from the can Mike walked to it and fetched it a solid kick The buzzing stopped as the can tumbled into a far corner Just a mooseblower he said to the others as if apologizing We put cm on the scarecrows Its nothing Only a cheap trick But I aint a crow He looked at Bill not laughing anymore but smiling still Im still scared of ItI guess we all arebut Its scared of us too Tell you the truth I think Its scared pretty bad They went down to the door at the end of the hall and as Ben watched Bill hook his finger into the hole where the doorknobs shaft had been he understood that this was where it was going to end there would be no trick behind this door The smell was worse now and that thundery feeling of two opposing powers swirling around them was much stronger He glanced at Eddie one arm in a sling his good hand clutching his aspirator He looked at Bev on his other side whitefaced holding the slingshot up like a wishbone He thought If we have to run Ill try to protect you Beverly I swear Ill try She might have heard his thought because she turned toward him and offered him a strained smile Ben smiled back Bill pulled the door open Its hinges uttered a dull scream and then were silent It was a bathroom but something was wrong with it Someone broke something in here was all that Ben could make out at first Not a booze bottle what White chips and shards glimmering wickedly lay strewn everywhere Then he understood It was the crowning insanity He laughed Richie joined him Somebody must have let the granddaddy of all farts Eddie said and Mike began to giggle and nod his head Stan was smiling a little Only Bill and Beverly remained grim The white pieces littered across the floor were shards of porcelain The toiletbowl had exploded The tank stood drunkenly at an angle in a puddle of water saved from falling over by the fact that the toilet had been placed in one corner of the room and the tank had landed kittycorner They crowded in behind Bill and Beverly their feet gritting on bits of porcelain Whatever it was Ben thought it blew that poor toilet right to hell He had a vision of Henry Bowers dropping two or three of his Ms into it slamming the lid down then bugging out in a hurry He couldnt think of anything else short of dynamite that would have done such a cataclysmic job There were a few chunks but damned few most of what was left were wickedlooking slivers like blowgun darts The wallpaper roserunners and capering elves as in the hall was peppered with holes all the way around the room It looked like shotgun blasts but Ben knew it was more porcelain driven into the walls by the force of the explosion There was a bathtub standing on claw feet with generations of grimy toejam between each blunt talon Ben peeked into it and saw a tidalflat of silt and grit on the bottom A rusty showerhead glared down from above There was a basin and a medicine cabinet standing ajar above it disclosing empty shelves There were small rustrings on these shelves where bottles had once stood I wouldnt get too close to that big Bill Richie said sharply and Ben looked around Bill was approaching the mouth of the drainhole in the floor over which the toilet had once sat He leaned toward it and then turned back to the others I can hhhear the pubpumping muhmuhmachinery just like in the BuhBuhharrens Bev drew closer to Bill Ben followed her and yes he could hear it that steady thrumming noise Except echoing up through the pipes it didnt sound like machinery at all It sounded like something alive ThThThis is wwwhere It cuhcuhhame frfrom Bill said His face was still deadly pale but his eyes were alight with excitement This is wwhere it cuhhame from that ddday and thhats wwwhere it aaalways comes frrom The druhdruhdrains Richie was nodding We were in the cellar but that isnt where It wasIt came down the stairs Because this is where It could get out Ben looked into the pipe It was about three feet in diameter and dark as a mineshaft The inner ceramic surface of the pipe was crusted with stuff he didnt want to know about That thrumming sound floated up hypnotically and suddenly he saw something He did not see it with his physical eyes not at first but with one buried deep in his mind It was rushing toward them moving at expresstrain speed filling the throat of this dark pipe from side to side It was in Its own form now whatever that might be It would take some shape from their minds when It got here It was coming coming up from Its own foul runs and black catacombs under the earth Its eyes glowing a feral yellowish green coming coming It was coming And then at first like sparks he saw Its eyes down in that darkness They took shapeflaring and malignant Over the thrumming sound of the machinery Ben could now hear a new noiseWhoooooooo A fetid smell belched from the ragged mouth of the drainpipe and he fell back coughing and gagging Something exploded out of the drainpipe Ben trying to recall that first confrontation later could only remember a silveryorange shifting shape It was not ghostly it was solid and he sensed some other shape some real and ultimate shape behind it but his eyes could not grasp what he was seeing not precisely Then Richie was stumbling backward his face a scrawl of terror screaming over and over again The Werewolf Bill Its the Werewolf The Teenage Werewolf And suddenly the shape locked into reality for Ben for all of them Richies It became their It The Werewolf stood poised over the drainpipe one hairy foot on either side of where the toilet had once been Its green eyes glared at them from Its feral face Its muzzle wrinkled back and yellowishwhite foam seeped through Its teeth It uttered a shattering growl Its arms pistoned out toward Beverly the cuffs of Its highschool letter jacket pulling back from Its furcovered arms Its smell was hot and raw and murderous Beverly screamed Ben grabbed the back of her blouse and yanked so hard that the seams under the arms tore One clawed hand swept through the air where she had been only a moment before Beverly went stumbling backwards against the wall The silver ball popped out of the cup of the Bullseye For a moment it glimmered in the air Mike quicker than quick snatched it and gave it back to her Shoot it baby he said His voice was perfectly calm almost serene You shoot it right now The Werewolf uttered a shattering roar that became a fleshfreezing howl Its snout turned up toward the ceiling The howl became a laugh It lunged at Bill as Bill turned to look at Beverly Ben shoved him aside and Bill went sprawling The Werewolf sprang forward and there was no question in Bens mind then or later that It knew exactly who was in charge here Bill was the one It was after Beverly drew and fired The ball flew and again it was off the mark but this time there was no saving curve It missed by more than a foot punching a hole in the wallpaper above the tub Bill his arms peppered with bits of porcelain and bleeding in a dozen pieces uttered a screaming curse The Werewolf s head snapped around its gleaming green eyes considered Beverly Not thinking Ben stepped in front of her as she groped in her pocket for the other silver slug The jeans she wore were too tight She had donned them with no thought of provocation it was just that like the shorts she had worn on the day of Patrick Hockstetter and the refrigerator she was still wearing last years model Her fingers closed on the ball but it squirted away She groped again and got it She pulled it turning her pocket inside out and spilling fourteen cents the stubs of two Aladdin tickets and a quantity of pocketlint onto the floor The Werewolf lunged at Ben who was standing protectively in front of her and blocking her field of fire Its head was cocked at the predators deadly questing angle its jaws snapping Ben reached blindly for It There seemed to be no room in his reactions now for terrorhe felt a clearheaded sort of anger instead mixed with bewilderment and a sense that somehow time had come to a sudden unexpected screechhalt He snagged his hands in tough matted hairthe pelt he thought Ive got Its peltand he could feel the heavy bone of Its skull beneath He thrust at that wolvish head with all of his force but although he was a big boy it did no good at all If he had not stumbled back and struck the wall the thing would have torn his throat open with its teeth It came after him Its greenishyellow eyes flaring It growled with each breath It smelled of the sewer and something else some wild yet unpleasant odor like rotten hazelnuts One of Its heavy paws rose and Ben skittered aside as best he could The paw tipped with heavy claws ripped bloodless wounds through the wallpaper and into the cheesy plaster beneath He could dimly hear Richie bellowing something Eddie howling at Beverly to shoot it shoot it But Beverly did not This was her only other chance It didnt matter she intended that it be the only one she would need A clear coldness she never saw again in her life fell over her sight In it everything stood out and forward never again would she see the three dimensions of reality so clearly denned She possessed every color every angle every distance Fear departed She felt the hunters simple lust of certainty and oncoming consummation Her pulse slowed The hysterical trembling grip in which she had been holding the Bullseye loosened then firmed and became natural She drew in a deep breath It seemed to her that her lungs would never fill completely Dimly faintly she heard popping sounds Didnt matter whatever they were She tracked left waiting for the Werewolfs improbable head to fall with cool perfection into the wishbone beyond the extended V of the drawnback sling The Werewolfs claws descended again Ben tried to duck under them but suddenly he was in Its grip It jerked him forward as if he had been no more than a ragdoll Its jaws snapped open He thrust a thumb into one of Its eyes It bellowed with pain and one of those clawtipped paws ripped through his shirt Ben sucked his stomach in but one of the claws pulled a sizzling line of pain down his chest and stomach Blood gushed out of him and splattered on his pants his sneakers the floor The Werewolf threw him into the bathtub He thumped his head saw stars struggled into a sitting position and saw his lap was full of blood The Werewolf whirled around Ben observed with that same lunatic clarity that It was wearing faded Levi Strauss bluejeans The seams had split open A snotcaked red bandanna the sort a trainman might carry hung from one back pocket Written on the back of Its silver and orange high school jacket were the words DERRY HIGH SCHOOL KILLING TEAM Below this the name PENNYWISE And in the center a number It went for Bill again He had gotten to his feet and now stood with his back to the wall looking at It steadily Beepbeep Richie she heard herself reply from roughly a thousand miles away The Werewolfs head was suddenly there in the wishbone She covered one of its green eyes with the cup and released There was no shake in either of her hands she fired as smoothly and naturally as she had fired at the cans in the dump on the day they had all taken turns to see who was the best There was time for Ben to think Oh Beverly if you miss this time were all dead and I dont want to die in this dirty bathtub but I cant get out There was no miss A round eyenot green but dead blacksuddenly appeared high up in the center of Its snout she had aimed for the right eye and missed by less than half an inch Its screaman almost human scream of surprise pain fear and ragewas deafening Bens ears rang with it Then the perfect round hole in Its snout was gone obscured by freshets of blood It was not flowing it gouted from the wound in a highpressure torrent The freshet drenched Bills face and hair Doesnt matter Ben thought hysterically Dont worry Bill Nobody will be able to see it anyway when we get out of here If we ever do Bill and Beverly advanced on the Werewolf and behind them Richie cried out hysterically shoot It again Beverly Kill it Kill it Bill cried his mouth drawn down in a quivering bow There was a whitishyellow streak of plaster dust in his hair Kill It Beverly dont let it get away No ammo left Ben thought incoherently were slugged out What are you talking about kill it But he looked at Beverly and understood If his heart had never been hers before that moment it would have flown to her then She had pulled the sling back again Her fingers were closed over the cup hiding its emptiness Kill It Ben screamed and flopped clumsily over the edge of the tub His jeans and underwear were soaked against his skin with blood He had no idea if he was hurt badly or not Following the original hot sizzle there hadnt been much pain but there sure was an awful lot of blood The Werewolfs greenish eyes flickered among them now filled with uncertainty as well as pain Blood poured down the front of Its jacket in freshets Bill Denbrough smiled It was a gentle rather lovely smile but it did not touch his eyes You shouldnt have started with my brother he said send the fucker to hell Beverly The uncertainty left the creatures eyesIt believed With lithe smooth grace It turned and dove into the drain As It went It changed The Derry High jacket melted into its pelt and the color ran out of both The shape of Its skull elongated as if it had been made of wax which was now softening and beginning to run Its shape changed For one instant Ben believed he had nearly seen what shape It really was and his heart froze inside his chest leaving him gasping Ill kill you all a voice roared from inside the drainpipe It was thick savage not in the least human Kill you all kill you all kill you all The words faded back and back diminishing washing out growing distant at last joining the low throbbing hum of the pumping machinery floating through the pipes The house seemed to settle with a heavy subaudible thud But it wasnt settling Ben realized in some strange way it was shrinking coming back to its normal size Whatever magic It had used to make the house at Neibolt Street seem bigger was now withdrawn The house snapped back like an elastic It was only a house now smelling damp and a little rotten an unfurnished house where winos and hobos sometimes came to drink and talk and sleep out of the rain WWWe guhgot to ggget owowout of this pplace Bill said He walked over to where Ben was trying to get up and grabbed one of his outstretched hands Beverly was standing near the drain She looked down at herself and that coldness disappeared in a flush that seemed to turn all her skin into one warm stocking It must have been a deep breath indeed The dim popping sounds had been the buttons on her blouse They were gone every single one of them The blouse hung open and her small breasts were clearly revealed She snatched the blouse closed Richie joined him then Stan and Mike The four of them got Ben to his feet Eddie had gone to Beverly and put his good arm awkwardly around her shoulders You did great he said and Beverly burst into tears Ben took two big staggering steps to the wall and leaned against it before he could fall over again His head felt light Color kept washing in and out of the world He felt decidedly pukey Ben forced himself to look down at his stomach He found performing two simple actionsbending his neck and spreading apart the slit in his shirttook more courage than he had needed to enter the house in the first place He expected to see half his insides hanging down in front of him like grotesque udders Instead he saw that the flow of blood had slowed to a sluggish trickle The Werewolf had slashed him long and deep but apparently not mortally Richie joined them He looked at the cut which ran a twisting course down Bens chest and petered out on the upper bulge of his stomach then soberly into Bens face It just about had your guts for suspenders Haystack You know it He and Richie stared at each other for a long considering moment and then they broke into hysterical giggles at the same instant spraying each other with spittle Richie took Ben into his arms and pounded his back We beat It Haystack We beat It WWWe dihdihdihdidnt beat It Bill said grimly We got lllucky Lets gget out bbbefore IhIhIt dddecides to come buhback Beverly made her way over to them still holding her blouse closed Her cheeks were bright red The clubhouse Can I have someones shirt Beverly asked blushing more furiously than ever Bill glanced down at her and the blood came into his own face all in a rush He turned his eyes away hastily but in that instant Ben felt a rush of knowledge and dismal momentary jealousy In that instant that one bare second Bill had become aware of her in a way that only Ben had himself been before The others had also looked and then looked away Richie coughed against the back of his hand Stan turned red And Mike Hanlon dropped back a step or two as if actually frightened by the sideswell of that one small white breast visible below her hand Beverly threw her head up shaking her tangled hair back behind her She was still blushing but her face was lovely I cant help it that Im a girl she said or that Im starting to get big on top now cant I please have someones shirt Shshsure Bill said He pulled his white tshirt over his head baring his narrow chest the visible rack of his ribs his sunburned freckled shoulders HHHere Thank you Bill she said and for one hot smoking moment their eyes locked directly Bill did not look away this time His gaze was firm adult Good luck Big Bill Ben thought and he turned away from that gaze It was hurting him hurting him in a deeper place than any Vampire or Werewolf would ever be able to reach But all the same there was such a thing as propriety The word he didnt know on the concept he was very clear Looking at them when they were looking at each other that way would be as wrong as looking at her breasts when she let go of the front of her blouse to pull Bills tshirt over her head If thats the way it is But youll never love her the way I do Never Bills tshirt came down almost to her knees If not for the jeans poking out from beneath its hem she would have looked as if she was wearing a slip LLLets guhguhgo Bill repeated I duhdont nunknow about you gguys but Ive hhhad eeeeenough for wuhwuhone dday The passage of an hour found them in the clubhouse both the window and the trapdoor open It was cool inside and the Barrens were blessedly silent that day They sat without talking much each lost in his or her own thoughts Richie and Bev passed a Marlboro back and forth Eddie took a brief snort from his aspirator Mike sneezed several times and apologized He said he was catching a cold Thass the oney theeng you could catch senhorr Richie said companionably enough and that was all Ben kept expecting the mad interlude in the house on Neibolt Street to take on the hues of a dream Itll recede and fall apart he thought the way that bad dreams do You wake up gasping and sweating all over but fifteen minutes later you cant remember what the dream was even about But that didnt happen Everything that had happened from the time he had forced his way in through the cellar window to the moment Bill had used the chair in the kitchen to break a window so they could get out remained bright and clearly fixed in his memory It had not been a dream The clotted wound on his chest and belly was not a dream and it didnt matter if his mom could see it or not At last Beverly stood up I have to go home she said I want to change before my mom gets home If she sees me wearing a boys shirt shell kill me Keel you senhorrita Richie agreed but she will keel you slow He nodded and waved a hand to show that this wasnt important She nodded bit her full underlip a girl of eleven who was tall for her age and simply beautiful More silver slugs she asked him He found he could barely stand to meet her glance I love you Beverly just let me have that You can have Bill or the world or whatever you need Just let me have that let me go on loving you and I guess itll be enough I dont know Ben said We could but He trailed off vaguely shrugged He could not say what he felt was somehow not able to bring it outthat this was like being in a monster movie but it wasnt The Mummy had looked different in some ways ways that confirmed its essential reality The same was true of the Werewolfhe could testify to that because he had seen it in a paralyzing closeup no film not even one in D allowed he had had his hands in the wiry underbrush of Its tangled pelt he had seen a small balefulorange firespot like a pompom in one of Its green eyes These things were well they were dreamsmadereal And once dreams became real they escaped the power of the dreamer and became their own deadly things capable of independent action The silver slugs had worked because the seven of them had been unified in their belief that they would But they hadnt killed It And next time It would approach them in a new shape one over which silver wielded no power Power power Ben thought looking at Beverly It was okay now her eyes had met Bills again and they were looking at each other as if lost It was only for a moment but to Ben it seemed very long It always comes back to power I love Beverly Marsh and she has power over me She loves Bill Denbrough and so he has power over her ButI thinkhe is coming to love her Maybe it was her face how it looked when she said she couldnt help being a girl Maybe it was seeing one breast for just a second Maybe just the way she looks sometimes when the light is right or her eyes Doesnt matter But if hes starting to love her shes starting to have power over him Superman has power except when theres Kryptonite around Batman has power even though he cant fly or see through walls My mom has power over me and her boss down in the mill has power over her Everyone has some except maybe for link kids and babies Then he thought that even little kids and babies had power they could cry until you had to do something to shut them up Ben Beverly asked looking back at him Cat got your tongue Huh No I was thinking about power The power of the slugs IhIhIt Bill began and then shut his mouth A thoughtful vague expression drifted over his face I really have to go Beverly said Ill see you all huh Sure come on down tomorrow Stan said Were going to break Eddies other arm They all laughed Eddie pretended to throw his aspirator at Stan Ben looked at Bill and saw that he hadnt joined in the laughter That thoughtful expression was still on his face and Ben knew you would have to call his name two or three times before he would answer He knew what Bill was thinking about he would be thinking about it himself in the days ahead Not all the time no There would be clothes to hang out and take in for his mother games of tag and guns in the Barrens and during a rainy spell the first four days of August the seven of them would go on a mad Parcheesi jag at Richie Toziers house making blockades sending each other back with great abandon deliberating exactly how to split the roll of the dice while rain dripped and ran outside His mother would announce to him that she believed Pat Nixon was the prettiest woman in America and be horrorstruck when Ben opted for Marilyn Monroe except for the color of her hair he thought that Bev looked like Marilyn Monroe There would be time to eat as many Twinkies and RingDings and Devil Dogs as he could get his hands on and time to sit on the back porch reading Lucky Starr and the Moons of Mercury There would be time for all of those things while the wound on his chest and belly healed to a scab and began to itch because life went on and at eleven although bright and apt he held no real sense of perspective He could live with what had happened in the house on Neibolt Street The world was after all full of wonders But there would be odd moments of time when he pulled the questions out again and examined them The power of the silver the power of the slugswhere does power like that come from Where does any power come from How do you get it How do you use it It seemed to him that their lives might depend on those questions One night as he was falling asleep the rain a steady lulling patter on the roof and against the windows it occurred to him that there was another question perhaps the only question It had some real shape he had nearly seen it To see the shape was to see the secret Was that also true of power Perhaps it was For wasnt it true that power like It was a shapechanger It was a baby crying in the middle of the night it was an atomic bomb it was a silver slug it was the way Beverly looked at Bill and the way Bill looked back Tell you what friends and neighborsIm drunk tonight Fuckdrunk Rye whiskey Went down to Wallys and got started went to the greenfront down on Center Street half an hour before they closed and bought a fifth of rye I know what Im up to Drink cheap tonight pay dear tomorrow So here he sits one drunk nigger in a public library after closing with this book open in front of me and the bottle of Old Kentucky on my left Tell the truth and shame the devil my mom used to say but she forgot to tell me that sometimes you cant shame Mr Splitfoot sober The Irish know but of course theyre Gods white niggers and who knows maybe theyre a step ahead Want to write about drink and the devil Remember Treasure Island The old seadog at The Admiral Benbow Well do em yet Jacky I bet the bitter old fuck even believed it Full of rumor ryeyou can believe anything Amuses me sometimes to think how long Id last if I actually published some of this stuff I write in the dead of night If I flashed some of the skeletons in Derrys closet There is a library Board of Directors Eleven of them One is a seventyyearold writer who suffered a stroke two years ago and who now often needs help to find his place on each meetings printed agenda and who has sometimes been observed picking large dry boogers out of his hairy nostrils and placing them carefully in his ear as if for safekeeping Another is a pushy woman who came here from New York with her doctor husband and who talks in a constant whiny monologue about how provincial Derry is how no one here understands THE JEWISH EXPERIENCE and how one has to go to Boston to buy a skirt one would care to be seen in Last time this anorexic babe spoke to me without the services of an intermediary was during the Boards Christmas party about a year and a half ago She had consumed a pretty large amount of gin and asked me if anyone in Derry understood THE BLACK EXPERIENCE I had also consumed a pretty large amount of gin and answered Mrs Gladry Jews may be a great mystery but niggers are understood the whole world round She choked on her drink whirled around so sharply that her panties were momentarily visible under her flaring skirt not a very interesting view would that it had been Carol Danner and so ended my last informal conversation with Mrs Ruth Gladry No great loss The other members of the Board are the descendants of the lumber barons Their support of the library is an act of inherited expiation they raped the woods and now care for these books the way a libertine might decide in his middle age to provide for the gaily gotten bastards of his youth It was their grandfathers and greatgrandfathers who actually spread the legs of the forests north of Derry and Bangor and raped those greengowned virgins with their axes and peaveys They cut and slashed and striptimbered and never looked back They tore the hymen of those great forests open when Grover Cleveland was President and had pretty well finished the job by the time Woodrow Wilson had his stroke These laceruffled ruffians raped the great woods impregnated them with a litter of slash and junk spruce and changed Derry from a sleepy little shipbuilding town into a booming honkytonk where the ginmills never closed and the whores turned tricks all night long One old campaigner Egbert Thoroughgood now ninetythree told me of taking a slatthin prostitute in a crib on Baker Street a street which no longer exists middleclass apartment housing stands quietly where Baker Street once boiled and brawled I only realized after I spent mspunk in her that she was laying in a pool of jizzum maybe an inch deep Stuff had just about gone to jelly Girl I says aint you never cared for yself She looks down and says Ill put on a new sheet if you want to go again Theres two in the cubud down the hall I think I knows pretty much what Im layin in until nine or ten but by midnight my cunts so numb it mights well be in Ellsworth So that was Derry right through the first twenty or so years of the twentieth century all boom and booze and balling The Penobscot and the Kenduskeag were full of floating logs from iceout in April to icein in November The business began to slacken off in the twenties without the Great War or the hardwoods to feed it and it staggered to a stop during the Depression The lumber barons put their money in those New York or Boston banks that had survived the Crash and left Derrys economy to liveor dieon its own They retreated to their gracious houses on West Broadway and sent their children to private schools in New Hampshire Massachusetts and New York And lived on their interest and political connections Whats left of their supremacy seventysome years after Egbert Thoroughgood spent his love with a dollar whore in a spermy Baker Street bed are empty wildwoods in Penobscot and Aroostook Counties and the great Victorian houses which stand for two blocks along West Broadway and my library of course Except those good folks from West Broadway would take my library away from me in jig time pun definitely intended if I published anything about the Legion of Decency the fire at the Black Spot the execution of the Bradley Gang or the affair of Claude Heroux and the Silver Dollar The Silver Dollar was a beerjoint and what may have been the queerest mass murder in the entire history of America took place there in September of There are still a few old timers in Derry who claim to remember it but the only account that I really trust is Thoroughgoods He was eighteen when it happened Thoroughgood now lives in the Paulson Nursing Home Hes toothless and his St Johns Valley FrancoDowncast accent is so thick that probably only another old Mainer could understand what he was saying if his talk were written down phonetically Sandy Ives the folklorist from the University of Maine whom I have mentioned previously in these wild pages helped me to translate my audio tapes Claude Heroux was according to Thoroughgood Un bat Canuck sonofawhore widdin eye thatd roll adju like a marts in dem oonlight Translation One bad Canuck son of a whore with an eye that would roll at you like a mares in the moonlight Thoroughgood said that heand everyone else who had worked with Herouxbelieved the man was as sly as a chickenstealing dog which made his hatchetwielding foray into the Silver Dollar all the more startling It was not in character Up until then lumbermen in Derry had believed Herouxs talents ran more to lighting fires in the woods The summer of was long and hot and there had been many fires in the woods The biggest of them which Heroux later admitted he set by simply putting a lighted candle in the middle of a pile of woodchips and kindling happened in Havens Big Injun Woods It burned twenty thousand acres of prune hardwood and you could smell the smoke of it thirtyfive miles away as the horsedrawn trollies breasted UpMile Hill in Derry In the spring of that year there had been some brief talk about unionizing There were four lumbermen involved in organizing not that there was much to organize Maine workingmen were antiunion then and are for the large part antiunion now and one of the four was Claude Heroux who probably saw his union activities mostly as a chance to talk big and spend a lot of time drinking down on Baker and Exchange Streets Heroux and the other three called themselves organizers the lumber barons called them ringleaders A proclamation nailed to the cooksheds in lumber camps from Monroe to Haven Village to Sumner Plantation to Millinocket informed lumbermen that any man overheard talking union would be fired off the job immediately In May of that year there was a brief strike up near Trapham Notch and although the strike was broken in short order both by scabs and by town constables and that was rather peculiar you understand since there were nearly thirty town constables swinging axehandles and creasing skulls but before that day in May there hadnt been so much as a single constable in Trapham Notchwhich had a population of in the census of so far as anyone knew Heroux and his organizing friends considered it a great victory for their cause Accordingly they came down to Derry to get drunk and to do some more organizing or ringleading depending on whose side you favored Whichever it must have been dry work They hit most of the bars in Hells HalfAcre finishing up in The Sleepy Silver Dollar arms around each others shoulders pissingdownyourleg drunk alternating union songs with bathetic tunes like My Mothers Eyes Are Looking Down from Heaven although I myself think any mother looking down from there and seeing her son in such a state might well have been excused for turning away According to Egbert Thoroughgood the only reason anyone could figure for Heroux being in the movement at all was Davey Hartwell Hartwell was the chief organizer or ringleader and Heroux was in love with him Nor was he the only one most of the men in the movement loved Hartwell deeply and passionately with that proud love men save for those of their own sex who possess a magnetism that seems to approach divinity davvey Ardwell wadda main who walk lak e ohn heffa de worl an haddim a daylah on de resp Thoroughgood said Translation davey Hartwell was a man who walked like he owned half of the world and had him a deadlock on the rest He wadda great main inniz way no use sayn he woint He haddim foce he haddim some big dinnity iniz walk anniz talk Ainno use sayin he wadda good main Just trine dellya he wadda great un Heroux followed Hartwell into the organizing business the way he would have followed him if he had decided to go for a shipbuilder up in Brewer or down in Bath or building the Seven Trestles over in Vermont or trying to bring back the Pony Express out west for that matter Heroux was sly and he was mean and I suppose that in a novel that would preclude any good qualities at all But sometimes when a man has spent a life being distrusted and distrustful being a loner or a Loser both by choice and by reason of societys opinions of him he can find a friend or a lover and simply live for that person the way a dog lives for its master Thats the way it appeared to have been between Heroux and Hartwell Anyway there were four of them who spent that night in the Brentwood Arms Hotel which was then called the Floating Dog by the lumbermen the reason why is lost in obscuritynot even Egbert Thoroughgood remembers Four checked in none checked out One of them Andy DeLesseps was never seen again for all history tells he might have spent the rest of his life living in pleasant ease in Portsmouth But somehow I doubt it Two of the other ringleaders Amsel Bickford and Davey Hartwell himself were found floating facedown in the Kenduskeag Bickford was missing his head someone had taken it off with the swipe of a woodsmans twohander Both of Hartwells legs were gone and those who found him swore that they had never seen such an expression of pain and horror on a human face Something had distended his mouth stuffing out his cheeks and when his discoverers turned him over and spread his lips seven of his toes fell out onto the mud Some thought he might have lost the other three during his years working in the woods others held the opinion that he might have swallowed them before he died Pinned to the back of each mans shirt was a paper with the word UNION on it Claude Heroux was never brought to trial for what happened in the Silver Dollar on the night of September th so theres no way of knowing exactly how he escaped the fate of the others that night in May We could make assumptions he had been on his own a long time had learned how to jump fast had perhaps developed the knack some curdogs have of getting out just before real trouble develops But why didnt he take Hartwell with him Or was he perhaps taken into the woods with the rest of the agitators Maybe they were saving him for last and he was able to get away even while Hartwells screams which would have grown muffled as they jammed his toes into his mouth were echoing in the dark and scaring birds off their roosts Theres no way of knowing not for sure but that last feels right to my heart Claude Heroux became a ghostman He would come strolling into a camp in the St Johns Valley line up at the cookshed with the rest of the loggers get a bowl of stew eat it and be gone before anyone realized he wasnt one of the topping gang Weeks after that hed show up in a Winterport beerjoint talking union and swearing hed have his revenge on the men that had murdered his friendsHamilton Tracker William Mueller and Richard Bowie were the names he mentioned the most frequently All of them lived in Derry and their gabled gambrelled cupolaed houses stand on West Broadway to this day Years later they and their descendants would fire the Black Spot That there were people who would have liked Claude Heroux put out of the way cannot be doubted particularly after the fires started in June of that year But although Heroux was seen frequently he was quick and had an animals awareness of danger So far as I have been able to find out no official warrant was ever sworn out against him and the police never took a hand Maybe there were fears about what Heroux might say if he was brought to trial for arson Whatever the reasons the woods around Derry and Haven burned all that hot summer Children disappeared there were more fights and murders than usual and a pall of fear as real as the smoke you could smell from the top of UpMile Hill lay over the town The rains finally came on September first and it rained for a solid week Downtown Derry was flooded out which was not unusual but the big houses on West Broadway were high above downtown and in some of those big houses there must have been sighs of relief Let the crazy Canuck hide out in the woods all whiter if thats what he wants they might have said His works done for this summer and well get him before the roots dry next June Then came September th I cannot explain what happened Thoroughgood cannot explain it so far as I know no one can I can only relate the events which occurred The Sleepy Silver Dollar was full of loggers drinking beer Outside it was drawing down toward misty dark The Kenduskeag was high and silversullen filling its channel from bank to bank and according to Egbert Thoroughgood a fallish wind was blowinthe kine dat alms fine de hole in ypaints and blow strayduppa cracka yo ais The streets were quagmires There was a card game going on at one of the tables in the back of the room They were William Muellers men Mueller was part owner of the GS ampWM rail line as well as a lumber potentate who owned millions of acres of prime timber and the men who were playing poker around an oilclothcovered table in the Dollar that night were parttime lumbermen parttime railroad bulls and full time trouble Two of them Tinker McCutcheon and Floyd Calderwood had done jailtime With them were Lathrop Rounds his nickname as obscure as The Floating Dog Hotel was El Katook David stugley Grenier and Eddie Kinga bearded man whose spectacles were almost as fat as his gut It seems very likely that they were at least some of the men who had spent the last two and a half months keeping an eye out for Claude Heroux It seems just as likelyalthough there is not a shred of proofthat they were in on the little cutting party in May when Hartwell and Bickford were laid low The bar was crowded Thoroughgood said dozens of men were bellied up there drinking beer and eating bar lunches and dripping onto the sawdustcovered dirt floor The door opened and in came Claude Heroux He had a woodsmans doublebitted axe in his hand He stepped up to the bar and elbowed himself a place Egbert Thoroughgood was standing on his left he said that Heroux smelled like a polecat stew The barman brought Heroux a schooner of beer two hardcooked eggs in a bowl and a shaker of salt Heroux paid him with a twodollar bill and put his changea dollareightyfiveinto one of the flap pockets of his lumbermans jacket He salted his eggs and ate them He salted his beer drank it off and uttered a belch More room out than there is in Claude Thoroughgood said just as if half the enforcers in northern Maine hadnt been on the prod for Heroux all that summer You know thats the truth Heroux said except being a Canuck what he probably said came out sounding more like You know dot da troot He ordered himself another schooner drank up and belched again Talk at the bar went on there was no silence like the ones in the western movies when the good guy or the bad guy pushes his way through the batwings and makes his ominous way to the bar Several people called to him Claude nodded and waved but he didnt smile Thoroughgood said he looked like a man who was half in a dream At the table in back the poker game went on El Katook was dealing No one bothered to tell any of the players that Claude Heroux was in the bar although since their table was no more than twenty feet away and since Claudes name was hollered more than once by people who knew him it is hard to know how they could have gone on playing unaware of his potentially murderous presence But that is what occurred After he finished his second schooner of beer Heroux excused himself to Thoroughgood picked up his twohander and went back to the table where Muellers men were playing fivecard stud Then he started cutting Floyd Calderwood had just poured himself a glass of rye whiskey and was setting the bottle back down when Heroux arrived and chopped Calderwoods hand off at the wrist Calderwood looked at his hand and screamed it was still holding the bottle but all of a sudden wasnt attached to anything but wet gristle and trailing veins For a moment the severed hand clutched the bottle even tighter and then it fell off and lay on the table like a dead spider Blood spouted from his wrist At the bar somebody called for more beer and someone else asked the bartender whose name was Jonesy if he was still dying his hair Never dyed it Jonesy said in an illtempered way he was vain of his hair Met a whore down at Ma Courtneys who said what grows around your pecker is just as white as snow the fellow said Drop your pants and lets us see said a lumberman named Falkland with whom Egbert Thoroughgood had been matching for drinks before Heroux came in This provoked general laughter Behind them Floyd Calderwood was shrieking A few of the men leaning against the bar took a casual look around in time to see Claude Heroux bury his woodsmans axe in Tinker McCutcheons head Tinker was a big man with a black beard going gray He got halfway up blood pouring down his face in freshets then sat down again Heroux pulled the axe out of his head Tinker started to get up again and Heroux slung the axe sideways burying it in his back It made a sound Thoroughgood said like a load of laundry being dropped on a rug Tinker flopped over the table his cards spraying out of his hand The others players were hollering and bellowing Calderwood still shrieking was trying to pick up his right hand with his left as his lifes blood ran out of his stump of a wrist in a steady stream Stugley Grenier had what Thoroughgood called a clutchpistol meaning a gun in a shoulderholster and he was grabbing for it with no success whatsoever Eddie King tried to get up and fell right out of his chair on his back Before he could get up Heroux was standing astride him the axe slung up over his head King screamed and held up both hands in a wardingoff gesture The axe came down its head almost disappearing in Kings ample gut Blood sprayed all the way up to the Dollars beamed roof Eddie began to crawfish on the floor Claude pulled the axe out of him the way a good woodsman will pull his axe out of a softwood tree kind of rocking it back and forth to loosen the clinging grip of the sappy wood When it was free he slung it up over his head He brought it down again and Eddie King stopped screaming Claude Heroux wasnt done with him however he began to chop King up like kindlingwood At the bar conversation had turned to what sort of winter lay ahead Veraon Stanchfield a farmer from Palmyra claimed it would be a mild onefall rain uses up winter snow was his scripture Alfie Naugler who had a farm out on the Naugler Road in Derry it is gone now where Alfie Naugler once grew his peas and beans and beets the Interstate extension now runs its mile sixlane course begged to disagree Alfie claimed the coming winter was going to be a jeezer He had seen as many as eight rings on some of the mohair caterpillars he said an unheardof number Another man held out for ice another for mud The Buzzard of  was duly recalled Jonesy sent schooners of beer and bowls of hardcooked eggs skidding down the bar Behind them the screaming went on and the blood flowed in rivers At this point in my questioning of Egbert Thoroughgood I turned off my cassette recorder and asked him How did it happen Are you saying you didnt know it was going on or that you knew but you let it go on or just what Thoroughgoods chin sank down to the top button of his foodspotted vest His eyebrows drew together He said nothing for a long long time Outside it was winter and I could hearvery faintlythe yells and laughter of the children sliding down the big hill in McCarron Park The silence in Thoroughgoods room small cramped and medicinalsmelling spun out so long that I was about to repeat my question when he replied We knew But it didnt seem to matter It was like politics in a way Ayuh like that Like town business Best let people who understand politics take care of that and people who understand town business take care of that Such things be best done if working men dont mix in Are you really talking about fate and just afraid to come out and say so I asked suddenly The question was simply jerked out of me and I certainly did not expect Thoroughgood who was old and slow and unlettered to answer it but he did with no surprise at all While the men at the bar went on talking about the weather Claude Heroux went on cutting Stugley Grenier had finally managed to clear his clutchpistol The axe was descending for another chop at Eddie King who was by then in pieces The bullet Grenier fired struck the head of the axe and richocheted off with a spark and a whine El Katook got to his feet and started backing away He was still holding the deck he had been dealing from cards were fluttering off the bottom and onto the floor Claude came after him El Katook held out his hands Stugley Grenier got off another round which didnt come within ten feet of Heroux Stop Claude El Katook said Thoroughgood said it appeared like Katook was trying to smile I wasnt with them I didnt mix in at all I was in Millinocket El Katook said his voice starting to rise toward a scream I was in Millinocket I swear it on my mothers name Ask anybody if you dont believe meeeee Claude raised the dripping axe and El Katook sprayed the rest of the cards into his face The axe came down whistling El Katook ducked The axehead buried itself in the planking that formed the Silver Dollars back wall El Katook tried to run Claude hauled the axe out of the wall and poked it between his ankles El Katook went sprawling Stugley Grenier shot at Heroux again this time having a bit more luck He had been aiming at the crazed lumbermans head the bullet struck home in the fleshy part of Herouxs thigh Meantime El Katook was crawling busily toward the door with his hair hanging in his face Heroux swung the axe again snarling and gibbering and a moment later Katooks severed head was rolling across the sawduststrewn floor the tongue popped bizarrely out between the teeth It rolled to a stop by the booted foot of a lumberman named Varney who had spent most of the day in the Dollar and who by then was so exquisitely slopped that he didnt know if he was on land or at sea He kicked the head away without looking down to see what it was and hollered for Jonesy to run him down another beer El Katook crawled another three feet blood spraying from his neck in a hightension jet before he realized he was dead and collapsed That left Stugley Heroux turned on him but Stugley had run into the outhouse and locked the door Heroux chopped his way in hollering and blabbering and raving slobber falling from bis jaws When he got in Stugley was gone although the cold leaky little room was windowless Heroux stood there for a moment head lowered powerful arms slimed and splattered with blood and then with a roar he flipped up the lid of the threeholer He was just in time to see Stugleys boots disappearing under the ragged board skirting of the outhouse wall Stugley Grenier ran screaming down Exchange Street in the rain beshitted from top to toe crying that he was being murdered He survived the cutting party in the Silver Dollarhe was the only one who didbut after three months of listening to jokes about his method of escape he quitted the Derry area forever Heroux stepped out of the toilet and stood in front of it like a bull after a charge head down his axe held in front of him He was puffing and blowing and covered with gore from head to foot Shut the door Claude that shitpot stinks to high heaven Thoroughgood said Claude dropped his axe on the floor and did as he had been asked He walked over to the cardstrewn table where his victims had been sitting kicking one of Eddie Kings severed legs out of his way Then he simply sat down and put his head in his arms The drinking and conversation at the bar went on Five minutes later more men began to pile in three or four sheriffs deputies among them the one in charge was Lal Machens father and when he saw the mess he had a heart attack and had to be taken away to Dr Shratts office Claude Heroux was led away He was docile when they took him more asleep than awake That night the bars all up and down Exchange and Baker Streets boomed and hollered with news of the slaughter A righteous drunken sort of fury began to build up and when the bars closed better than seventy men headed downtown toward the jail and the courthouse They had torches and lanterns Sonic were carrying guns some had axes some had peavies The County Sheriff wasnt due from Bangor until the noon stage the next day so he wasnt there and Goose Machen was laid up in Dr Shratts infirmary with his heart attack The two deputies who were sitting in the office playing cribbage heard the mob coming and got out of there fast The drunks broke in and dragged Claude Heroux out of his cell He didnt protest much he seemed dazed vacant They carried him on their shoulders like a football hero down to Canal Street they carried him and there they lynched him from an old elm that overhung the Canal He was so far gone that he didnt kick but twice Egbert Thoroughgood said It was so far as the town records show the only lynching to ever take place in this part of Maine And almost needless to say it was not reported in the Derry News Many of those who had gone on drinking unconcernedly while Heroux went about his business in the Silver Dollar were in the necktie party that strung him up By midnight their mood had changed I asked Thoroughgood my final question had he seen anyone he didnt know during that days violent activities Someone who struck him as strange out of place funny even clownish Someone who would have been drinking at the bar that afternoon someone who had maybe turned into one of the rabblerousers that night as the drinking went on and the talk turned to lynching Mayhap there was Thoroughgood replied He was tired by then drooping ready for his afternoon nap It were a long time ago mister Long and long I remember thinkin that there must be a county fair up Bangor way Thoroughgood said I was having a beer in the Bloody Bucket that night The Bucket was about six doors from the Silver Dollar There was a fella in there comical sort of fella doing flips and rollovers jugglin glasses tricks put four dimes on his forrid and theyd stay right there comical you know His bony chin had sunk to his chest again He was going to sleep right in front of me Spittle began to bubble at the corners of his mouth which had as many tucks and wrinkles as a ladys changepurse Seen him a few now n thens since Thoroughgood said Figure maybe he had such a good time that night that he decided to stick around His only response was a weak snore Thoroughgood had gone to sleep in his chair by the window with his medicines and nostrums lined up beside him on the sill soldiers of old age at muster I turned off my taperecorder and just sat looking at him for a moment this strange timetraveller from the year or so who remembered when there were no cars no electric lights no airplanes no state of Arizona Pennywise had been there guiding them down the path toward another gaudy sacrificejust one more in Derrys long history of gaudy sacrifices That one in September of  ushered in a heightened period of terror that would include the Eastertide explosion of the Kitchener Ironworks the following year This raises some interesting and for all I know vitally important questions What does It really eat for instance I know that some of the children have been partially eatenthey show bitemarks at leastbut perhaps it is we who drive It to do that Certainly we have all been taught since earliest childhood that what the monster does when it catches you in the deep wood is eat you That is perhaps the worst thing we can conceive But its really faith that monsters live on isnt it I am led irresistibly to this conclusion Food may be life but the source of power is not food but faith And who is more capable of a total act of faith than a child But theres a problem kids grow up In the church power is perpetuated and renewed by periodic ritualistic acts In Derry power seems to be perpetuated and renewed by periodic ritualistic acts too Can it be that It protects Itself by the simple fact that as the children grow into the adults they become either incapable of faith or crippled by a sort of spiritual and imaginative arthritis Yes I think thats the secret here And if I make the calls how much will they remember How much will they believe Enough to end this horror once and for all or only enough to get them killed They are being calledI know that much Each murder in this new cycle has been a call We almost killed It twice and in the end we drove It deep in Its warren of tunnels and stinking rooms under the city But I think It knows another secret although It may be immortal or almost so we are not It had only to wait until the act of faith which made us potential monsterkillers as well as sources of power had become impossible Twentyseven years Perhaps a period of sleep for It as short and refreshing as an afternoon nap would be for us And when It awakes It is the same but a third of our lives has gone by Our perspectives have narrowed our faith in the magic that makes magic possible has worn off like the shine on a new pair of shoes after a hard days walking Why call us back Why not just let us die Because we nearly killed It because we frightened It I think Because It wants revenge And now now that we no longer believe in Santa Claus the Tooth Fairy Hansel and Gretel or the troll under the bridge It is ready for us Come on back It says Come on back lets finish our business in Derry Bring your jacks and your marbles and your yoyos Well play Come on back and well see if you remember the simplest thing of all how it is to be children secure in belief and thus afraid of the dark On that one at least I score a thousand per cent I am frightened So goddam frightened When Ben Hanscom finished the story of the silver slugs they wanted to talk but Mike told them he wanted them all to get some sleep Youve had enough for now he said but Mike was the one who looked as if he had had enough his face was tired and drawn and Beverly thought he looked physically ill But were not done Eddie said What about the rest of it I still dont remember Mikes rrright Bill said Either well remember or we wwont I think we wwill Weve remembered all that we nuhneed to Mike nodded Well meet tomorrow Then he glanced at the clock Later today I mean Mike shook his head slowly I suggest we meet on Kansas Street Where Bill used to hide his bike Were going down into the Barrens Eddie said and suddenly shivered There was a moment of quiet while they looked around at each other Then Bill got to his feet and the others rose with him I want you all to be careful for the rest of the night Mike said Its been here It can be wherever you are But this meeting has made me feel better He looked at Bill Id say it still can be done wouldnt you Bill Bill nodded slowly Yes I think it still can be done It will know that too Mike said and It will do whatever It can to slug the odds in Its favor What do we do if It shows up Richie asked Hold our noses shut our eyes turn around three times and think good thoughts Puff some magic dust in Its face Sing old Elvis Presley songs What Mike shook his head If I could tell you that there would be no problem would there All I know is that theres another forceat least there was when we were kidsthat wanted us to stay alive and to do the job Maybe its still there He shrugged It was a weary gesture I thought two maybe as many as three of you would be gone by the time we started our meeting tonight Missing or dead Just seeing you turn up gave me reason to hope Richie looked at his watch Quarter past one How the time flies when youre having fun right Haystack You want to walk back to the TuhTuhTownhouse with me Beverly Bill asked All right She was putting on her coat The library seemed very silent now shadowy frightening Bill felt the last two days catching up with him all at once piling up on his back If it had just been weariness that would have been okay but it was more a feeling that he was cracking up dreaming having delusions of paranoia A sensation of being watched Maybe Im really not here at all he thought Maybe Im in Dr Sewards lunatic asylum with the Counts crumbling townhouse next door and Renfield just across the hall him with his flies and me with my monsters both of us sure the party is really going on and dressed to the nines for it not in tuxedos but in straitwaistcoats Richie shook his head Im going to let Haystack and Kaspbrak lead me home he said Right fellers Sure Ben said He looked briefly at Beverly who was standing close to Bill and felt a pain he had almost forgotten A new memory trembled almost within his grasp then floated away What about you MMMike Bill asked Want to walk with Bev and mme That was when Beverly screamed a highpitched hurt sound in the stillness The vaulted dome overhead picked it up and the echoes were like the laughter of banshees flying and flapping around them Bill turned toward her Richie dropped his sportcoat as he was taking it off the back of his chair there was a crash of glass as Eddies arm swept an empty gin bottle onto the floor Beverly was backing away from them her hands held out her face as white as good bond paper Her eyes deep in duskypurple sockets bulged My hands She screamed My hands What Bill began and then he saw the blood dripping slowly between her shaking fingers He started forward and felt sudden lines of painful warmth cross his own hands The pain was not sharp it was more like the pain one sometimes feels in an old healed wound The old scars on his palms the ones which had reappeared in England had broken open and were bleeding He looked sideways and saw Eddie Kaspbrak peering stupidly down at his own hands They were also bleeding So were Mikes And Richies And Bens Were in it to the end arent we Beverly asked She had begun to cry This sound was also magnified in the librarys still emptiness the building itself seemed to be weeping with her Bill thought that if he had to listen to that sound for long he would go mad God help us were in it to the end She sobbed and a runner of snot depended from one of her nostrils She wiped it off with the back of one shaking hand and more blood dripped on the floor He held out his other hand and after a moment Beverly took it She was still crying Yes Mike said He looked dazedalmost drugged Yes thats right isnt it Its starting again isnt it Bill Its all starting to happen again Mike took Eddies hand and Richie took Beverlys other hand For a moment Ben only looked at them and then like a man in a dream he raised his bloody hands to either side and stepped between Mike and Richie He grasped their hands The circle closed Ah Chud this is the Ritual of Chud and the Turtle cannot help us Bill tried to scream but no sound came out He saw Eddies head tilt back the cords on his neck standing out Bevs hips bucked twice fiercely as if in an orgasm as short and sharp as the crack of a pistol Mikes mouth moved strangely seeming to laugh and grimace at the same time In the silence of the library doors banged open and shut the sound rolling like bowling balls In the Periodicals Room magazines flew in a windless hurricane In Carole Banners office the librarys IBM typewriter whirred into life and typed The typeball jammed The typewriter sizzled and uttered a thick electronic belch as everything inside overloaded In Stack Two the shelf of occult books suddenly tipped over spilling Edgar Cayce Nostradamus Charles Fort and the Apocrypha everywhere Bill felt an exalting sense of power He was dimly aware that he had an erection and that every hair on his head was standing up straight The sense of force in the completed circle was incredible Then it was gone as if someone had flicked off a switch They dropped their hands looking at each other dazed No one said anything As the sense of power ebbed Bill felt a terrible sense of doom creep over him He looked at their white strained faces and then down at his hands Blood was smeared there but the wounds which Stan Uris had made with a jagged piece of Coke bottle in August had closed up again leaving only crooked white lines like knotted twine He thought That was the last time the seven of us were together the day Stan made those cuts in the Barrens Stans not here hes dead And this is the last time the six of us are going to be together I know it I feel it Beverly was pressed against him trembling Bill put an arm around her They all looked at him their eyes huge and bright in the dimness the long table where they had sat littered with empty bottles glasses and overflowing ashtrays a little island of light Thats enough Bill said huskily Enough entertainment for one evening Well save the ballroom dancing for another time I remembered Beverly said She looked up at Bill her eyes huge her pale cheeks wet I remembered everything My father finding out about you guys Running Bowers and Criss and Huggins How I ran The tunnel the birds It I remember everything No I have to lock up And I have to write a few things down the minutes of the meeting if you like I wont be long Go ahead They moved toward the door not talking much Bill and Beverly were together Eddie Richie and Ben behind them Bill held the door for her and she murmured thanks As she went out onto the wide granite steps Bill thought how young she looked how vulnerable He was dismally aware that he might be falling in love with her again He tried to think of Audra but Audra seemed far away She would be sleeping in their house in Fleet now as the sun came up and the milkman began his rounds Derrys sky had clouded over again and a low groundfog lay across the empty street in thick runners Further up the street the Derry Community House narrow tall Victorian brooded in blackness Bill thought And whatever walked in Community House walked alone He had to stifle a wild cackle Their footfalls seemed very loud Beverlys hand touched his and Bill took it gratefully The touch of her hand was suddenly both wonderful and necessary He wondered what it would be like to touch her breasts for the second time in his life and suspected that before this long night was over he would know Fuller now mature and his hand would find hair when he cupped the swelling of her mons veneris He thought I loved you Beverly I love you Ben loved you he laves you We loved you then we love you now We better because its starting No way out now He glanced behind and saw the library half a block away Richie and Eddie were on the top step Ben was standing at the bottom looking after them His hands were stuffed in his pockets his shoulders were slumped and seen through the drifting lens of the low fog he might almost have been eleven again If he had been able to send Ben a thought Bill would have sent this one It doesnt matter Ben The love is what matters the caring its always the desire never the time Maybe thats all we get to take with us when we go out of the blue and into the black Cold comfort maybe but better than no comfort at all My father knew Beverly said suddenly I came home one day from the Barrens and he just knew Did I ever tell you what he used to say to me when he was mad I worry about you Bevvie Thats what he used to say I worry a lot She laughed and shivered at the same time I think he meant to hurt me Bill I mean hed hurt me before but that last time was different He was well in many ways he was a strange man I loved him I loved him very much but She looked at him perhaps wanting him to say it for her He wouldnt it was something she was going to have to say for herself sooner or later Lies and selfdeceptions had become a ballast they could not afford I hated him too she said and her hand bore down convulsively upon Bills for a long second I never told that to anyone in my life before I thought God would strike me dead if I ever said it out loud Go on Itll hurt but maybe its festered in there long enough Say it I hated my dad she said and began to sob helplessly I hated him I was scared of him I hated him I could never be a good enough girl to suit him and I hated him I did but I loved him too He stopped and held her tight Her arms went around him in a panicky grip Her tears wet the side of his neck He was very conscious of her body ripe and firm He moved his torso away from hers slightly not wanting her to feel the erection he was getting but she moved against him again Wed spent the morning down there she said playing tag or something like that Something harmless We hadnt even talked about It that day at least not then we usually talked about It every day at some point though Remember It was overcast hot We played most of the morning I went home around eleventhirty I thought Id have a sandwich and a bowl of soup after I took a shower And then Id go back and play some more My parents were both working But he was there He was home He threw her across the room before she had even gotten all the way through the door A startled scream was jerked out of her and then cut off as she hit the wall with shouldernumbing force She collapsed onto their sagging sofa looking around wildly The door to the front hall banged shut Her father had been standing behind it I worry about you Bevvie he said sometimes I worry a lot You know that I tell you that dont I You bet I do He was walking slowly toward her across the living room his face thoughtful sad deadly She didnt want to see that last but it was there like the blind shine of dirt on still water He was nibbling reflectively on a knuckle of his right hand He was dressed in his khakis and when she glanced down she saw that his hightopped shoes were leaving tracks on her mothers carpet Ill have to get the vacuum out she thought incoherently Vacuum that up If he leaves me able to vacuum If he It was mudBlack mud Her mind sideslipped alarmingly She was back in the Barrens with Bill Richie Eddie and the others There was black viscous mud like the kind on Daddys shoes down there in the Barrens in the swampy place where the stuff Richie called bamboo stood in a skeletal white grove When the wind blew the stalks rattled together hollowly producing a sound like voodoo drums and had her father been down in the Barrens Had her father His hand rocketed down in a wide sweeping orbit and struck her face Her head thudded back against the wall He hooked his thumbs in his belt and looked at her with that expression of deadly disconnected curiosity She felt a trickle of blood running warmly from the left corner of her lower lip I have seen you getting big he said and she thought he would say something more but for the time being that seemed to be all Daddy what are you talking about she asked in a low trembling voice If you lie to me Ill beat you within an inch of your life Bevvie he said and she realized with horror that he wasnt looking at her he was looking at the Currier and Ives picture over her head on the wall above the sofa Her mind sideslipped crazily again and she was four sitting in the bathtub with her blue plastic boat and her Popeye soap her father so big and so wellloved was kneeling beside her dressed in gray twill pants and a strappy teeshirt a washcloth in one hand and a glass of orange soda in the other soaping her back and saying Lemme see those ears Bevvie your ma needs taters for supper And she could hear her small self giggling looking up at his slightly grizzled face which she had then believed must be eternal I I wont lie Daddy she said Whats wrong Her view of him was gradually shivering apart as the tears came You been down there in the Barns with a gang of boys Her heart leaped her eyes dropped to his mudcaked shoes again That black clingy mud If you stepped into it too deep it would suck your sneaker or your loafer right off and both Richie and Bill believed that if you went in all the way it turned to quickmud Whap the hand covered with hard calluses rocketing down again She cried out hurt afraid That look on his face scared her and the way he wouldnt look at her scared her too There was something wrong with him He had been getting worse What if he meant to kill her What if oh stop it Beverly hes your FATHER and FATHERS dont kill DAUGHTERS Her confusion increased Nothing he said seemed connected to anything else Trying to follow him made her feel seasick almost His hand rose she flinched back Take them off Bevvie I want to see if you are intact Now there was a new image crazier than the rest she saw herself pulling her jeans off and one of her legs coming off with them Her father belting her around the room as she tried to hop away from him on her one good leg Daddy shouting I knew you wasnt intact I knew it I knew it His hand came down not slapping this time but clutching It bit into her shoulder with furious strength She screamed He pulled her up and for the first time looked directly into her eyes She screamed again at what she saw there It was nothing Her father was gone And Beverly suddenly understood that she was alone in the apartment with It alone with It on this dozey August morning There was not the thick sense of power and untinctured evil she had felt in the house on Neibolt Street a week and a half agoIt had been diluted somehow by her fathers essential humanitybut It was here working through him He threw her aside She struck the coffee table tripped over it and went sprawling on the floor with a cry This is how it happens she thought Ill tell Bill so he understands Its everywhere in Derry It just It just fills the hollow places thats all She rolled over Her father was walking toward her She skidded away from him on the seat of her jeans her hair in her eyes I know you been down there he said I was told I didnt believe it I didnt believe my Bevvie would be hanging around with a gang of boys Then I seen you myself this morning My Bevvie with a bunch of boys Not even twelve and hanging around with a bunch of boys This latter thought seemed to send him into a fresh rage it trembled through his scrawny frame like volts Not even twelve years old he shouted and fetched a kick at her thigh that made her scream His jaws snapped over this fact or concept or whatever it was to him like the jaws of a hungry dog worrying a piece of meat Not even twelve Not even twelve Not even TWELVE He kicked Beverly scrambled away They had worked their way into the kitchen area of the apartment now His workboot struck the drawer under the stove making the pots and pans inside jangle Dont you run from me Bevvie he said You dont want to do that or itll be the worse for you Believe me now Believe your dad This is serious Hanging around with the boys letting them do God knows what to younot even twelvethats serious Christ knows He grabbed her and jerked her to her feet by her shoulder Youre a pretty girl he said Theres plenty of people happy to roon a pretty girl Plenty of pretty girls willing to be roont You been a slutchild to them boys Bevvie At last she understood what It had put in his head except part of her knew the thought might almost have been there all along that It might only have used the tools that had been there just lying around waiting to be picked up I seen you smoking he bellowed This time he struck her with the palm of his hand hard enough to send her reeling back in drunken strides to the kitchen table where she sprawled a flare of agony in the small of her back The salt and pepper shakers fell to the floor The pepper shaker broke Black flowers bloomed and disappeared before her eyes Sounds seemed too deep She saw his face Something in his face He was looking at her chest She was suddenly aware that her blouse had come untucked that some of the buttons had popped off and that she wasnt wearing a bra as of yet she owned only one a training bra Her mind sideslipped back to the house at Neibolt Street when Bill had given her his shirt She had been aware of the way her breasts poked at the thin cotton material but their occasional skittering glances had not bothered her these had seemed perfectly natural And Bills look had seemed more than naturalit had seemed warm and wanted if deeply dangerous Now she felt guilt mix with her terror Was her father so wrong Hadnt she had thoughts Bad thoughts Thoughts of whatever it was that he was talking about Its not the same thing Its not the same thing as the way Daddy we just play thats all We play We we dont do anything like anything bad We I seen you smoking he said again walking toward her His eyes moved across her chest and her narrow uncurved hips He chanted suddenly in a high schoolboys voice that frightened her even more A girl who will chew gum will smoke A girl who will smoke will drink And a girl who will drink everyone knows what a girl like that will do I DIDNT DO ANYTHING she screamed at him as his hands descended on her shoulders He was not pinching or hurting now His hands were gentle And that was somehow scariest of all Beverly he said with the inarguable mad logic of the totally obsessed I seen you with boys Now you want to tell me what a girl does with boys down in all that trashwood if it aint what a girl does on her back Let me alone she cried at him The anger flashed up from a deep well she had never suspected The anger made a bluishyellow flame in her head It threatened her thoughts All the times he had scared her all the times he had shamed her all the times he had hurt her You just let me alone Dont talk to your daddy like that he said sounding startled Maybe Maybe not Im going to check and make sure I know how Take your pants off His eyes widened showing yellowed cornea all the way around the deep blue irises What did you say I said no His eyes were fixed on hers and perhaps he saw the blazing anger there the bright upsurge of rebellion Who told you Who told you we play down there Was it a stranger Was it a man dressed in orange and silver Did he wear gloves Did he look like a clown even if he wasnt a clown What was his name He swung his hand again not open but this time closed in a fist meant to break something Beverly ducked His fist whistled over her head and crashed into the wall He howled and let go of her putting the fist to his mouth She backed away from him in quick mincing steps No she said You want to hurt me I love you Daddy but I hate you when youre like this You cant do it anymore Its making you do it but you let It in I dont know what youre talking about he said but you better get over here to me I am not going to ask you no more Dont make me come over there and collect you Bevvie Youre going to be one sorry little girl if I have to do that Come to me He leaped at her with such scrawny catlike agility that although she suspected such a leap was coming she was almost caught She fumbled for the kitchen doorknob pulled the door open just wide enough so she could slip though and then she was running down the hall toward the front door running in a dream of panic as she would run from Mrs Kersh twentyseven years later Behind her Al Marsh crashed against the door slamming it shut again cracking it down the center YOU GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW BEVVIE he howled yanking it open and coming after her The front door was on the latch she had come home the back way One of her trembling hands worked at the lock while the other yanked fruitlessly at the knob Behind her father howled again the sound of an animal She turned the lockknob and the front door finally swept open Hot breath plunged up and down in her throat She looked over her shoulder and saw him right behind her reaching for her grinning and grimacing his horsey yellow teeth a beartrap in his mouth Beverly bolted out through the screen door and felt his fingers skid down the back of her blouse without catching hold She flew down the steps overbalanced and went sprawling on the concrete walkway erasing the skin from both knees YOU GET BACK HERE NOW BEVVIE OR BEFORE GOD Ill WHIP THE SKIN OFF YOU He came down the steps and she scrambled to her feet holes in the legs of her jeans her kneecaps sizzling blood exposed nerveendings singing Onward Christian Soldiers She looked back and here he came again Al Marsh janitor and custodian a gray man dressed in khaki pants and a khaki shirt with two flap pockets a keyring attached to his belt by a chain his hair flying But he wasnt in his eyesthe essential he who had washed her back and punched her in the gut and had done both because he worried about her worried a lot the he who had once tried to braid her hair when she was seven made a botch of it and then got giggling with her about the way it stuck out everyway the he who knew how to make cinnamon eggnogs on Sunday that tasted better than anything you could buy for a quarter at the Derry Ice Cream Bar the fatherhe maleman of her life delivering a mixed post from that other sexual state None of that was in his eyes now She saw blank murder there She saw It there Mr Pasquale looked up startled from where he was watering his crabgrassy lawn and listening to the Red Sox game on a portable radio sitting on his porch rail The Zinnerman kids stood back from the old Hudson Hornet which they had bought for twentyfive dollars and washed almost every day One of them was holding a hose the other a bucket of soapsuds Both were slackjawed Mrs Denton looked out of her secondfloor apartment one of her six daughters dresses in her lap more mending in a basket on the floor her mouth full of pins Little Lars Theramenius pulled his Red Ball Flyer wagon quickly off the cracked sidewalk and stood on Bucky Pasquales dying lawn He burst into tears as Bevvie who had spent a patient morning that spring showing him how to tie his sneakers so they would stay tied flashed by him screaming her eyes wide A moment later her father passed hollering at her and Lars who was then three and who would die twelve years later in a motorcycle accident saw something terrible and inhuman in Mr Marshs face He had nightmares for three weeks after In them he saw Mr Marsh turning into a spider inside his clothes Beverly ran She was perfectly aware that she might be running for her life If her father caught her now it wouldnt matter that they were on the street People did crazy things in Derry sometimes she didnt have to read the newspapers or know the towns peculiar history to understand that If he caught her he would choke her or beat her or kick her And when it was over someone would come and collect him and he would sit in a cell the way Eddie Cochrans stepfather was sitting in a cell dazed and uncomprehending She ran toward downtown passing more and more people as she went They staredfirst at her then at her pursuing fatherand they looked surprised some of them even amazed But what was on their faces went no further They looked and then they went on toward wherever they had been going The air circulating in her lungs was growing heavier now She crossed the Canal feet pounding on cement while cars rumbled over the heavy wooden slats of the bridge to her right To her left she could see the stone semicircle where the Canal went under the downtown area She cut suddenly across Main Street oblivious of the honking horns and squealing brakes She went right because the Barrens lay in that direction It was still almost a mile away and if she was to get there she would somehow have to outdistance her father on the gruelling slope of UpMile Hill or one of the even steeper sidestreets But that was all there was As she gained the sidewalk on the far side of the street she snatched another glance behind her the heavy weight of her red hair shifting over her shoulder as she did Her father was crossing the street as heedless of the traffic as she had been his face a bright sweaty red She ducked down an alley that ran behind Warehouse Row This was the rear of the buildings which fronted on UpMile Hill Star Beef Armour Meatpacking Hemphill Storage amp Warehousing Eagle Beef amp Kosher Meats The alley was narrow and cobbled made narrower still by the bunches of fuming garbage cans and bins set out here The cobbles were slimy with God knew what offal and ordure There was a mixture of smells some bland some sharp some simply titanic but all spoke of meat and slaughter Flies buzzed in clouds From inside some of the buildings she could hear the bloodcurdling whine of bonesaws Her feet stuttered unevenly on the slick cobbles One hip struck a galvanized garbage can and packages of tripe wrapped in newspaper fell out like great meaty jungle blossoms YOU GET RIGHT THE HELL BACK HERE BEVVIE I MEAN IT NOW DONT MAKE IT ANY WORSE THAN IT ALREADY IS GIRL Two men lounged in the loading doorway of the Kirshner Packing Works munching thick sandwiches open dinnerbuckets near at hand You in a woeful place girl one of them said mildly Looks like youre goin to the woodshed with your pa The other laughed He was gaining She could hear his thundering footfalls and heavy respiration almost behind her now looking to her right she could see the black wing of his shadow flying along the high board fence there Then he yelled in surprise and fury as his feet slipped out from under him and he thumped to the cobblestones He was up a moment later no longer bellowing words but only shrieking out his incoherent fury while the men in the doorway laughed and slapped each other on the back The alley zigged to the left and Beverly came to a skittering halt her mouth opening in dismay A city dumpster was parked across the alleys mouth There was not even nine inches of clearance on either side Its motor was idling Under that sound barely audible she could hear the murmur of conversation from the dumpsters cab More men on lunchbreak It lacked no more than three or four minutes of noon soon the courthouse clock would begin to chime the hour She could hear him coming again closing in She threw herself down and hooked her way under the dumpster using her elbows and wounded knees The stink of exhaust and diesel fuel mixed with the smell of ripe meat and made her feel a kind of giddy nausea In a way the ease of her progress was worse she was skidding greasily over a coating of slime and garbagey crud She kept moving once rising too high off the cobbles so that her back came in contact with the dumpsters hot exhaustpipe She had to bite back a scream Beverly You under there Each word separated from the last by an outofbreath gasp for air She looked back and met his eyes as he bent and peered under the truck You bitch he replied in a thick spitchoked voice He threw himself flat keys jingling and began to crawl after her using a grotesque swimming stroke to pull himself along Beverly clawed her way from under the trucks cab grabbed one of the huge tiresher fingers hooked their way into a tread up to the second knuckleand yanked herself up She banged her tailbone on the dumpsters front bumper and then she was running again heading up UpMile Hill now her blouse and jeans smeared with goop and stinking to high heaven She looked back and saw her fathers hands and freckled arms shoot out from under the dumpsters cab like the claws of some imagined childhood monster from under the bed Quickly hardly thinking at all she darted between Feldmans Storage and the Tracker Brothers Annex This covert too narrow to even be called an alley was filled with broken crates weeds sunflowers and of course more garbage Beverly dived behind a pile of crates and crouched there A few moments later she saw her father pound by the mouth of the covert and on up the hill Beverly got up and hurried to the far end of the covert There was a chainlink fence here She monkeyed her way to the top got over and worked her way down the far side She was now on Derry Theological Seminary property She ran up the manicured back lawn and around the side of the building She could hear someone inside playing something classical on an organ The notes seemed to engrave their pleasant calm selves on the still air There was a tall hedge between the Seminary and Kansas Street She peered through it and saw her father on the far side of the street breathing hard patches of sweat darkening his gray workshirt under the arms He was peering around hands on hips His keyring twinkled brightly in the sun Beverly watched him also breathing hard her heart beating rabbitfast in her throat She was very thirsty and her simmering smell disgusted her If I was drawn in a comicstrip she thought distractedly thered be all those wavy stinklines coming up from me Please God I cant run anymore Help me God Dont let him find me Al Marsh walked slowly down the sidewalk directly past where his daughter crouched on the far side of the hedge He didntperhaps because after a tumble in the alleyway and crawling under the dumpster himself Al smelled as bad as she did He walked on She watched him go back down UpMile Hill until he was out of sight Beverly picked herself up slowly Her clothes were covered with garbage her face was dirty her back hurt where she had burnt it on the exhaustpipe of the dumpster These physical things paled before the confused swirl of her thoughtsshe felt that she had sailed off the edge of the world and none of the normal patterns of behavior seemed to apply She could not imagine going home but she could not imagine not going home She had defied her father defied him She had to push that thought away because it made her feel weak and trembly sick to her stomach She loved her father Wasnt one of the Ten Commandments Honor thy mother and father that thy days may be long upon the earth Yes But he hadnt been himself Hadnt been her father Had in fact been someone completely different An imposter It Suddenly she went cold as a terrible question occurred to her Was this happening to the others Or something like it She ought to warn them They had hurt It and perhaps now It was taking steps to assure Itself they would never hurt It again And really where else was there to go They were the only friends she had Bill Bill would know what to do Bill would tell her what to do Bill would supply the what next She stopped where the Seminary walk joined the Kansas Street sidewalk and peered around the hedge Her father was truly gone She turned right and began to walk along Kansas Street toward the Barrens Probably none of them would be there right now they would be at home eating their lunches But they would be back Meantime she could go down into the cool clubhouse and try to get herself under some kind of control She would leave the little window wide open so she could have some sunshine and perhaps she would even be able to sleep Her tired body and overstrained mind grasped eagerly at the thought Sleep yes that would be good Her head drooped as she plodded past the last bunch of houses before the land grew too steep for houses and plunged down into the Barrensthe Barrens where as incredible as it seemed to her her father had been lurking and spying She certainly did not hear footfalls behind her The boys there were at great pains to be quiet They had been outrun before they did not intend to be outrun again They drew closer and closer to her walking catsoft Belch and Victor were grinning but Henrys face was both vacant and serious His hair was uncombed and snarly His eyes were as unfocused as Al Marshs had been in the apartment He held one dirty finger pressed over his lips in a shhh gesture as they closed the distance from seventy feet to fifty to thirty Through that summer Henry had been edging steadily out over some mental abyss walking on a bridge that had grown relentlessly more and more narrow On the day when he had allowed Patrick Hockstetter to caress him that bridge had narrowed to a tightrope The tightrope had snapped this morning He had gone out into the yard naked except for his ragged yellowing undershorts and looked up into the sky The ghost of last nights moon still lingered there and as he looked at it the moon had suddenly changed into a skeletal grinning face Henry had fallen on his knees before this face exalted with terror and joy Ghostvoices came from the moon The voices changed sometimes seemed to merge together in a soft babble that was barely understandable but he sensed the truth which was simply that all these voices were one voice one intelligence The voice told him to hunt up Belch and Victor and be at the corner of Kansas Street and Costello Avenue around noon The voice told him he would know what to do then Sure enough the cunt had come bopping along He waited to hear what the voice would tell him to do next The answer came as they continued to close the distance The voice came not from the moon but from the sewergrating they were passing The voice was low but clear Belch and Victor glanced toward the grating in a dazed almost hypnotized way then back at Beverly Henry Bowers reached into the pocket of his jeans and brought out a slim nineinchlong instrument with imitationivory inlays along its sides A small chromium button glittered at one end of this dubious objet dart Henry pushed it A sixinch blade popped out of the slit at the end of the handle He bounced the switchblade on his palm He began to walk a little faster Victor and Belch still looking dazed increased their own walking speed to keep up with him Beverly did not hear them precisely that was not what made her turn her head as Henry Bowers closed the distance Bentkneed shuffling a frozen grin on his face Henry was as silent as an Indian No it was simply a feeling too clear and direct and powerful to be denied of Mike Hanlon laid his pen aside and looked across the shadowy inverted bowl of the librarys main room He saw islands of light thrown by the hanging globes he saw books fading into dimness he saw the iron staircases making their graceful trellised spirals up to the stacks He saw nothing out of place All the same he did not believe he was alone in here Not anymore After the others were gone Mike had cleaned up with a care that was only habit He was on autopilot his mind a million milesand twentyseven yearsaway He dumped ashtrays threw away the empty liquor bottles putting a layer of waste over them so that Carole wouldnt be shocked and the returnable cans in a box behind his desk Then he got the broom and swept up the remains of the gin bottle Eddie had broken When the table was clean he had gone into the Periodicals Room and picked up the scattered magazines As he did these simple chores his mind sifted the stories they had toldconcentrating the most perhaps on what they had left out They believed they remembered everything he thought that Bill and Beverly almost did But there was more It would come to them if it allowed them the time In there had been no chance for preparation They had talked endlesslytheir talk interrupted only by the rockfight and that one act of group heroism at  Neibolt Streetand might in the end have done no more than talk Then August th had come and Henry and his friends had simply chased them into the sewers Maybe I should have told them he thought putting the last of the magazines back in their places But something spoke strongly against the ideathe voice of the Turtle he supposed Perhaps that was part of it and perhaps that sense of circularity was part of it too Maybe that last act was going to repeat itself in some updated fashion as well He had put flashlights and miners helmets carefully by against tomorrow he had the blueprints of the Derry sewer and drain systems neatly rolled up and held with rubber bands in that same closet But when they were kids all their talk and all their plans halfbaked or otherwise had come to nothing in the end in the end they had simply been chased into the drains hurled into the confrontation which had followed Was that going to happen again Faith and power he had come to believe were interchangeable Was the final truth even simpler That no act of faith was possible until you were rudly pushed out into the screaming middle of things like a newborn child skydiving chutelessly out of his mothers womb Once you were falling you were forced to believe in the chute into existence werent you Pulling the ring as you fell became your final statement on the subject one way or the other Jesus Christ its Fulton Sheen in blackface Mike thought and laughed a little Mike cleaned neatened thought his thoughts while another part of his brain expected that he would finish and finally find himself tired enough to go home and sleep for a few hours But when he finally did finish he found himself as wide awake as ever So he had gone to the single closed stack behind his office unlocking the wire gate with a key from his ring and letting himself in This stack supposedly fireproof when the vaulttype door was closed and locked contained the librarys valuable first editions books signed by writers long since dead among the signed editions were Moby Dick and Whitmans Leaves of Grass historical matter relating to the town and the personal papers of the few writers who had lived and worked in Derry Mike hoped if all of this ended well to persuade Bill to leave his manuscripts to the Derry Public library Walking down the third aisle of the stack beneath tinshaded lightbulbs smelling the familiar library scents of must and dust and cinnimony ageing paper he thought When I die I guess Ill go with a library card in one hand and an OVERDUE stamp in the other Well maybe thats better than dying with a gun in your hand nigger He stopped halfway down this third aisle His dogeared steno notebook which contained the jotted tales of Derry and his own troubled wanderings was tucked between Frickes Old DerryTown and Michauds History of Derry He had pushed the notebook so far back it was nearly invisible No one would stumble across it unless they were looking for it Mike took it and went back to the table where they had held their meeting pausing to turn off the lights in the closed stack and to relock the wire mesh He sat down and flipped through the pages he had written thinking what a strange crippled affidavit he had created halfhistory halfscandal part diary part confessional He had not entered since April th Have to get a new book soon he thought thumbing the few blank pages that were left He thought bemusedly for a moment of Margaret Mitchells first draft of Gone with the Wind written in longhand in stacks and stacks and stacks of school composition books Then he uncapped his pen and wrote May st two lines below the end of his last entry He paused looking vaguely across the empty library and then began to write about everything that had happened during the last three days beginning with his telephone call to Stanley Uris He wrote carefully for fifteen minutes and then his concentration began to come unravelled He paused more and more frequently The image of Stan Uriss severed head in the refrigerator tried to intrude Stans bloody head the mouth open and full of feathers falling out of the refrigerator and rolling across the floor toward him He banished it with an effort and went on writing Five minutes later he jerked upright and whirled around convinced he would see that head rolling across the old black and red tiles of the main floor eyes as glassy and avid as the eyes in the mounted head of a deer There was nothing No head no sound except the muffled drum of his own heart Got to get ahold of yourself Mikey Its the jimjams thats all Nothing else to it But it was no use The words began to get away from him the thoughts seemed to dangle just out of reach There was a pressure on the back of his neck and it seemed to grow heavier He put his pen down and got up from the table Is anyone here he called and his voice echoed back from the rotunda giving him a jolt He licked his lips and tried again Bill Ben Suddenly Mike decided he wanted to be home He would simply take the notebook with him He reached for it and heard a faint sliding footstep He looked up again Pools of light surrounded by deepening lagoons of shadow Nothing else at least nothing he could see He waited heart beating hard The footstep came again and this time he pinpointed the location The glassedin passageway that connected the adult library to the Childrens Library In there Someone Something Moving quietly Mike walked across to the checkout desk The double doors leading into the passageway were held open by wooden chocks and he could see a little way in He could see what looked like feet and with sudden swooning horror he wondered if maybe Stan had come after all if maybe Stan was going to step out of the shadows with his bird encyclopedia in one hand his face white his lips purple his wrists and forearms cut open I finally came Stan would say It took me awhile because I had to pull myself out of a hole in the ground but I finally came There was another footstep and now Mike could see shoes for sureshoes and ragged pantslegsdenim with strings hanging down against sockless ankles And in the darkness almost six feet above those ankles he could see glittering eyes He groped over the surface of the semicircular checkout desk and felt along the other side without taking his gaze from those moveless glittering eyes His fingers felt one wooden corner of a small boxthe overdue cards A paper boxpaper clips and rubber bands They happened on something that was metal and seized it It was a letteropener with the words JESUS SAVES stamped on the handle A flimsy thing that had come in the mail from the Grace Baptist Church as part of a fundraising drive Mike had not attended services in fifteen years but Grace Baptist had been his mothers church and he had sent them five dollars he could not really afford He had meant to throw the letteropener out but it had stayed here amid the clutter on his side of the desk Caroles side was always spotlessly clean until now He clutched it with feverish strength and stared into the shadowy hallway There was another step another Now the ragged denim pants were visible up to the knees He could see the shape these lower legs belonged to it was big hulking The shoulders were rounded There was a suggestion of ragged hair The figure was apelike There was no answer The shape merely stood there contemplating him Although still afraid Mike had gotten over the debilitating idea that it might be Stan Uris returned from the grave called back by the scars on his palms some eldritch magnetism which had brought him back like a zombie in a Hammer horror film Whoever this was it wasnt Stan Uris who had finished at fiveseven when he had his full growth The shape took another step and now the light from the globe closest to the passageway fell across the beltless loops of the jeans around the shapes waist Why its the nigger the shape said Been throwing rocks at anyone nigger Want to know who poisoned your fucking dog The shape stepped forward The light fell on the face of Henry Bowers It had grown fat and sagging the skin had an unhealthy tallowy hue the cheeks had become hanging jowls that were specked with stubble almost as much white in that stubble as black Wavy linesthree of themwere engraved in the shelf of the forehead above the bushy brows Other lines formed parentheses at the corners of the fulllipped mouth The eyes were small and mean inside discolored pouches of fleshbloodshot and thoughtless It was the face of a man being pushed into a premature age a man who was thirtynine going on seventythree But it was also the face of a twelveyearold boy Henrys clothes were still green with whatever bushes he had spent the day hiding in Hellow Henry It occurred to him dimly that he had not listened to the radio for the last two days and he had not even read the paper which was a ritual with him Too much going on Too busy Henry emerged from the corridor between the Childrens Library and the adult library and stood there peering at Mike with his piggy little eyes His lips parted in an unspeakable grin revealing rotted backMaine teeth Which voices are those Henry He put both hands behind his back like a schoolboy called upon to recite and transferred the letteropener from his left hand to his right The grandfather clock given by Horst Mueller in ticked solemn seconds into the smooth pond of library silence From the moon Henry said He put a hand in his pocket Came from the moon Lots of voices He paused frowned slightly then shook his head Lots but really only one Its voice Yep Henry said Frankenstein Tore off Victors head You should have heard it Made a sound like a great big zipper going down Then It went after Belch Belch fought It Dont you say that Henrys cheeks flushed a dull red He took two steps forward The farther he walked from the umbilicus connecting the Childrens Library to the adult library the younger he looked to Mike He saw the same old meanness in Henrys face but he saw something else as well the child who had been brought up by crazy Butch Bowers on a good farm that had gone to shitshack shambles over the years dont you say that It would have killed me too Henrys eyes gleamed with rancid humor Not yet But It will Less I dont leave any of you for It to get He pulled his hand out of his pocket In it was a slim nineinchlong instrument with imitationivory inlay along its sides A small chromium button glittered at one end of this dubious objet dart Henry pushed it A sixinch steel blade popped out of the slit at the end of the handle He bounced the switchblade on his palm and began to walk toward the checkout desk a little faster Look what I found he said I knew where to look Obscenely one redrimmed eyelid drooped in a wink The man in the moon told me Henry revealed his teeth again Hid today Hitchhiked a ride tonight Old man Hit him Killed him I think Ditched the car over in Newport Just over the Derry town line I heard that voice I looked in a drain There was these clothes And the knife My old knife We got away and you got away If It wants us It wants you too I think yes Maybe you yoyos did Its work but It didnt exactly play favorites did It It got both of your friends and while Belch was fighting It you got away But now youre back I think youre part of Its unfinished business Henry I really do Maybe Frankensteins what youll see Or the Werewolf A Vampire The Clown Or Henry Maybe youll really see what It looks like Henry We did Want me to tell you Want me to Mike stepped aside and stuck out one foot Henry tripped over it and went skidding over the footworn tiles like a shuffleboard weight His head struck a leg of the table where the Losers had sat earlier that night telling their tales For a moment he was stunned the knife hung loose in his hand Mike went after him went after the knife In that moment he could have finished Henry it would have been possible to have planted the JESUS SAVES letteropener which had come in the mail from his mothers old church in the back of Henrys neck and then called the police There would have been a certain amount of official nonsense but not too much of itnot in Derry where such weird and violent events were not entirely exceptional What stopped him was a realization almost too lightninglike to be conscious that if he killed Henry he would be doing Its work as surely as Henry would be doing Its work by killing Mike And something else that other look he had seen on Henrys face the tired bewildered look of the badly used child who has been set on a poisonous path for some unknown purpose Henry had grown up within the contaminated radius of Butch Bowerss mind surely he had belonged to It even before he suspected it existed So instead of planting the letteropener in Henrys vulnerable neck he dropped to his knees and snatched at the knife It twisted in his handseemingly of its own volitionand his ringers closed on the blade There was no immediate pain only red blood flowing down the first three fingers of his right hand and into his scarred palm He pulled back Henry rolled away and grabbed the knife again Mike got to his knees and the two of them faced each other that way each bleeding Mikes fingers Henrys nose Henry shook his head and droplets flew away into the darkness Thought you were so smart he cried hoarsely Fucking sissies is all you were We could have beat you in a fair fight Put the knife down Henry Mike said quietly Ill call the police Theyll come and get you and take you back to Juniper Hill Youll be out of Derry Youll be safe Henry tried to talk and couldnt He couldnt tell this hateful jig that he wouldnt be safe in Juniper Hill or Los Angeles or the rainforests of Timbuktu Sooner or later the moon would rise bonewhite and snowcold and the ghostvoices would start and the face of the moon would change into Its face babbling and laughing and ordering He swallowed slickslimy blood Mike leaned back to avoid his blundering awkward rush overbalanced and went sprawling on his back Henry struck the table again rebounded turned and clutched Mikes arm Mike swept the letteropener around and felt it go deep into Henrys forearm Henry screamed but instead of letting go he tightened his grip He pulled himself toward Mike his hair in his eyes blood flowing from his ruptured nose over his thick lips Mike tried to get a foot in Henrys side and push him away Henry swung the switchblade in a glittering arc and all six inches of it went into Mikes thigh It went in effortlessly as if into a warm cake of butter Henry pulled it out dripping and with a scream of combined pain and effort Mike shoved him away He struggled to his feet but Henry was up more quickly and Mike was barely able to avoid Henrys next blundering rush He could feel blood pouring down his leg in an alarming flood filling his loafer He got my femoral artery I think Jesus he got me bad Blood everywhere Blood on the floor Shoes wont be any good shit just bought them two months ago Henry came again panting and puffing like a bull in heat Mike staggered aside and swept the letteropener at him again It tore through Henrys ragged shirt and pulled a deep cut across his ribs Henry grunted as Mike shoved him away again There was a titter from behind them Henry looked and then screamed in utter horror clapping his hands to his cheeks like an offended old maid Mikes gaze jerked toward the circulation desk There was a loud vibrating kaspanggg sound and Stan Uriss head popped up from behind the desk A spring corkscrewed up and into his severed dripping neck His face was livid with greasepaint There was a fever spot of rouge on each cheek Great orange pompoms flowered where the eyes had been This grotesque Staninthebox head nodded back and forth at the end of its spring like one of the giant sunflowers beside the house on Neibolt Street Its mouth opened and a squealing laughing voice began to chant Kill him Henry Kill the nigger kill the coon kill him kill him KILL HIM Mike wheeled back toward Henry dismally aware that he had been tricked wondering faintly whose face Henry had seen at the end of that spring Stans Victor Crisss His fathers perhaps Henry shrieked and rushed at Mike the switchblade plunging up and down like the needle of a sewing machine Gaaaah nigger Henry was screaming Gaaaah nigger Gaaaah nigger Mike backpedaled and the leg Henry had stabbed buckled under him almost at once spilling him to the floor There was hardly any feeling at all left in that leg It felt cold and distant Looking down he saw that his creamcolored slacks were now bright red Mike stabbed out with the JESUS SAVES letteropener as Henry turned back for another go Henry ran into it like a bug onto a phi Warm blood doused Mikes hand There was a snap and when he drew his hand back he only had the haft of the letteropener The blade was in Henrys stomach Gaaah Nigger Henry screamed clapping a hand over the protruding jag of blade Blood poured through his fingers He looked at it with bulging unbelieving eyes The head of the end of the creaking dipping jackinthebox squealed and laughed Mike feeling sick and dizzy now looked back at it and saw Belch Huggins head a human champagne cork wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap turned backward He groaned aloud and the sound was far away echoey in his own ears He was aware that he was sitting in a pool of warm blood his own If I dont get a tourniquet on my leg Im going to die Gaaaaaaaaaah Neeeeeeegaaaa Henry screamed Still holding his bleeding belly with one hand and the switchblade with the other he staggered away from Mike and toward the library doors He wove drunkenly from side to side progressing across the echoing main room like a pinball in an electronic game He struck one of the easychairs and knocked it over His groping hand spilled a rack of newspapers onto the floor He reached the doors straightarmed one of them and plunged out into the night Mikes consciousness was fading now He worked at the buckle of his belt with fingers he could barely feel At last he got it unhooked and managed to pull it free of its loops He put it around his bleeding leg just below the groin and cinched it tight Holding it with one hand he began to crawl toward the circulation desk The phone was there He wasnt sure how he was going to reach it but for now that didnt matter The trick was just to get there The world wavered blurred grew faint behind waves of gray He stuck his tongue out and bit down on it savagely The pain was immediate and exquisite The world swam back into focus He became aware that he was still holding the ragged haft of the letteropener and he tossed it away Here at last was the circulation desk looking as tall as Everest Mike got his good leg under him and pushed himself up clutching at the edge of the desk with the hand that wasnt holding the belt tight His mouth was drawn down in a trembling grimace his eyes slitted At last he managed to get all the way up He stood there storklike and groped the telephone over to him Taped to the side were three numbers fire police and hospital With one shaking finger that looked at least ten miles away Mike dialed the hospital He closed his eyes as the phone began to ring and then they opened wide as the voice of Pennywise the Clown answered Howdy nigger Pennywise cried and then screamed laughter as sharp as broken glass into Mikes ear What do you say How you doon I think youre dead what do you think I think Henry did the job on you Want a balloon Mikey Want a balloon How you doon Hello there Mikes eyes turned up to the face of the grandfather clock the Mueller Clock it was called and saw with no surprise at ail that the clockface had been replaced with his fathers face gray and raddled with cancer The eyes were turned up to show only bulging whites Suddenly his father popped his tongue out and the clock began to strike Mike lost his grip on the circulation desk He swayed for a moment on his good leg and then he fell down again The phone swung before him at the end of its cord like a mesmerists amulet It was becoming very hard to hold onto the belt now Hello dere Amos Pennywise cried brightly from the swinging telephone handset dis heres de Kingfish I is de Kingish in Derry anyhow and dats de troof Wouldnt you say so boy If theres anyone there Mike croaked a real voice behind the one I am hearing please help me My name is Michael Hanlon and Im at the Derry Public Library I am bleeding to death If youre there I cant hear you Im not being allowed to hear you If youre there please hurry He lay on his side drawing his legs up until he was in a fetal position He took two turns around his right hand with the belt and concentrated on holding it as the world drifted away in those cottony balloonlike clouds of gray Hello dere howyadoon Pennywise screamed from the dangling swinging phone Howyadoon you dirty coon Hello Beverly reacted instantly turning to run It was a quicker reaction than any of them had expected and she might actually have gotten a running start but for her hair Henry snatched at it caught part of its long flow and pulled her back He grinned into her face His breath was thick and warm and stinking Howyadoon Henry Bowers asked her Where ya goin Back to play with your asshole friends some more I think Ill cut off your nose and make you eat it You like that She struggled to get free Henry laughed and shook her head back and forth by the hair The knife flashed dangerously in the hazy August sunshine Here Here What are you boys doing Let that girl go It was an old lady behind the wheel of a wellpreserved Ford She had pulled up to the curb and was leaning across the blanketcovered seat to peer out the passengerside window At the sight of her angry honest face the blank dazed look left Victor Crisss eyes for the first time and he looked nervously at Henry What The old ladys anger now became concern surprise and fear as well What are you boys doing Let her alone Across the streetBev saw this quite clearlyHerbert Ross got out of the lawnchair on his porch approached the porch rail and looked over His face was as blank as Belch Hugginss He folded his paper turned and went quietly into the house Henry bared his teeth and suddenly ran at her car dragging Beverly after him by the hair She stumbled went to one knee was dragged The pain in her scalp was excruciating monstrous She felt some of her hair rip out The old lady screamed and cranked the passenger side window frantically Henry still roaring stabbed down and the switchblade skated across glass The womans foot came off the old Fords clutchpedal and it went down Kansas Street in three big jerks bouncing up over the curb where it stalled Henry went after it still pulling Beverly along Victor licked his lips and looked around Belch pushed the New York Yankees baseball cap he was wearing up on his forehead and then dug at his ear in a puzzled gesture Bev saw the old womans white frightened face for one moment and then saw her pawing at the doorlocks first on the passenger side then on her own The Fords engine ground and caught Henry lifted one booted foot and kicked out a taillight The tires screamed as the old lady pulled back out in the street An oncoming pickup truck swerved to avoid her its horn blasted Henry turned back toward Bev beginning to smile again and she hiked one sneakered foot directly into his balls The smile on Henrys face turned into a grimace of agony The switchknife dropped from his hand and clattered onto the sidewalk His other hand left its nestingplace in the tangle of her hair pulling once more terribly as it went and then he sank to his knees trying to scream holding his crotch She could see strands of her own coppery hair on one hand and in that instant all of her terror turned to bright hate She drew in a great hitching breath and hocked a remarkably large looey onto the top of his head Belch lumbered three steps after her and then stopped He and Victor went to Henry who threw them aside and then staggered to his feet both hands still cupping his balls it was not the first time that summer that he had been kicked there He leaned over and picked up the switchblade on he wheezed Henry turned a face toward him that was so full of sweating pain and sick blazing hate that Belch fell back a step I said come on he managed and began to stagger and lurch up the street after Beverly holding his crotch We cant catch her now Henry Victor said uneasily Hell you can hardly walk Well catch her Henry panted His upper lip was rising and falling in an unconscious doglike sneer Beads of sweat stood out on his forehead and ran down his hectic cheeks Well catch her all right Because I know where shes going Shes going down into the Barrens to be with her asshole Hmmm Bill looked at her His thoughts had been far away They had been walking handinhand the silence between them companionable slightly charged with mutual attraction He had caught only the last word of what she had said A block ahead the lights of the Town House shone through the low groundfog I said you were my best friends The only friends I ever had back then She smiled Making friends has never been my strong suit I guess although Ive got a good one back in Chicago A woman named Kay McCall I think youd like her Bill Probably would Ive never been real fast to make friends myself He smiled Back then we were all we nuhnuhneeded He saw beads of moisture in her hair appreciated the way the lights made a nimbus about her head Her eyes were turned gravely up to his He thought of Audra and for the first time it occurred to him that she looked like Beverly He wondered if maybe that had been the attraction all along the reason he had been able to find guts enough to ask Audra out near the end of the Hollywood party where they had been introduced He felt a pang of unhappy guilt and then he took Beverly his childhood friend in his arms Her kiss was firm and warm and sweet Her breasts pushed against his open coat and her hips moved against him away and then against him again When her hips moved away a second tune he plunged both of his hands into her hair and moved against her When she felt him growing hard she uttered a little gasp and put her face against the side of his neck He felt her tears on his skin warm and secret He took her hand and they walked the rest of the way to the Town House The lobby was old festooned with plants and still possessed of a certain fading charm The decor was very much Nineteenth Century Lumberman It was deserted at this hour except for the desk clerk who could be dimly seen in the inner office his feet cocked up on the desk watching TV Bill pushed the thirdfloor button with a finger that trembled just slightlyexcitement nervousness guilt all of the above Oh yeah sure and a kind of almost insane joy and fear as well These feelings did not mix pleasantly but they seemed necessary He led her down the hallway toward his room deciding in some confused way that if he were to be unfaithful it should be a complete act of infidelity consummated in his place not hers He found himself thinking of Susan Browne his first bookagent and at the age of not quite twenty his first lover Cheating Cheating on my wife He tried to get this through his head but it seemed both real and unreal at the same time What seemed strongest was an unhappy sense of homesickness an oldfashioned feeling of falling away Audra would be up by now making coffee sitting at the kitchen table in her robe perhaps studying lines perhaps reading a Dick Francis novel His key rattled in the lock of room If they had gone to Beverlys room on the fifth floor they would have seen the messagelight on her phone blinking the TVwatching desk clerk would have given her a message to call her friend Kay in Chicago after Kays third frantic call he had finally remembered to post the message things might have taken a different course the five of them might not have been fugitives from the Derry police when that days light finally broke But they went to hisas things had perhaps been arranged The door opened They were inside She looked at him eyes bright cheeks flushed her breast rising and falling rapidly He took her in his arms and was overwhelmed by the feeling of rightnessthe feeling of the circle between past and present closing with a triumphant seamlessness He kicked the door shut clumsily with one foot and she laughed her warm breath into his mouth My heart She said and put his hand on her left breast He could feel it below that firm almost maddening softness racing like an engine They were on the bed still dressed kissing Her hand slipped inside his shirt then out again She traced a finger down the row of buttons paused at his waist and then that same finger slipped lower tracing down the stony thickness of his cock Muscles he hadnt been aware of jumped and fluttered in his groin He broke the kiss and moved his body away from hers on the bed Got to stuhstuhstop for a mmminute he said Or else Im going to shoot in my pppants like a kkid She laughed again softly and looked at him Is it that Or are you having second thoughts I didnt know it all the way to the top of my mind until tonight she said Oh I knew itsomewhereall along I guess He hits and he hurts I married him because because my father always worried about me I guess No matter how hard I tried he worried And I guess I knew hed approve of Tom Because Tom would worry too He worried a lot And as long as someone was worrying about me Id be safe More than safe Real She looked at him solemnly Her blouse had pulled out of the waistband of her slacks revealing a white stripe of stomach He wanted to kiss it But it wasnt real It was a nightmare Being married to Tom was like going back into the nightmare Why would a person do that Bill Why would a person go back into the nightmare of her own accord Bill said The ooonly reason I can ffigure is that ppeople go back to fffind themssselves The nightmares here Bev said The nightmare is Derry Tom looks small compared to that I can see him better now I loathe myself for the years I spent with him You dont know the things he made me do and oh I was happy enough to do them you know because he worried about me Id cry but sometimes theres too much shame You know Dont he said quietly and put his hand over hers She held it tightly Her eyes were overbright but the tears didnt fall Everybody gggoofs it But its not an ehehexam You just go through it the bbbest you can What I mean she said is that Im not cheating on Tom or trying to use you to get my own back on him or anything like that For me it would be like something sane and normal and sweet But I dont want to hurt you Bill Or trick you into something youll be sorry for later He thought about this thought about it with a real and deep seriousness But the odd little mnemoniche thrusts his fists and so onhad begun to circle back breaking into his thoughts It had been a long day Mikes call and the invitation to lunch at Jade of the Orient seemed a hundred years ago So many stories since then So many memories like photographs from Georges album Friends dont tttrick each oother he said and leaned toward her on the bed Their lips touched and he began to unbutton her blouse One of her hands went to the back of his neck and held him closer while the other first unzipped her slacks and then pushed them down For a moment his hand was on her stomach warm then her panties were gone in a whisper then he nudged and she guided As he entered her she arched her back gently toward the thrust of his sex and muttered Be my friend I love you Bill I love you too he said smiling against her bare shoulder They began slowly and he felt sweat begin to flow out of his skin as she quickened beneath him His consciousness began to drain downward becoming focused more and more strongly on their connection Her pores had opened releasing a lovely musky odor Beverly felt her climax coming She moved toward it working for it never doubting that it would come Her body suddenly stuttered and seemed to leap upward not orgasming but reaching a plateau far above any she had reached with Tom or the other two lovers she had had before Tom She became aware that this wasnt going to be just a come it was going to be a tactical nuke She became a little afraid but her body picked up the rhythm again She felt Bills long length stiffen against her his whole body suddenly becoming as hard as the part of him inside herself and at that same moment she climaxedbegan to climax pleasure so great it was nearly agony spilled out of unsuspected floodgates and she bit down on his shoulder to stifle her cries Oh my God Bill gasped and although she was never sure later she believed he was crying He pulled back and she thought he was going to withdraw from hershe tried to prepare for that moment which always brought a fleeting inexplicable sense of loss and emptiness something like a footprintand then he thrust forward strongly again Right away she had a second orgasm something she hadnt known was possible for her and the window of memory opened again and she saw birds thousands of birds descending onto every roofpeak and telephone line and RFD mailbox in Derry spring birds against a white April sky and there was pain mixed with pleasurebut mostly it was low as a white spring sky seems low Low physical pain mixed with low physical pleasure and sense of affirmation She had bled she had had He did pull back and out of her this time but in the sudden shock of the revelation she barely felt him go She saw shocked surprise on Bills face the drop of his jaw and sudden understanding But it was not her revelation even in her own shock she saw that It was his own That was yyyour way to get us out he said and now his eyes blazed so brightly they frightened her Beverly duhduhdont you uhunderstand That was yyyour way to get us out We all but we were Suddenly he looked frightened unsure He shook his head slowly Not the spuhspuhspecifics But He looked at her and she saw he was badly frightened What it really cccame down to was we wuhwuhwished our way out And Im not ssure Beverly Im not sure that grownups can do that She looked at him without speaking for a long moment and sat on the edge of the bed and took her clothes off with no particular selfconsciousness Her body was smooth and lovely the line of her backbone barely discernible in the dimness as she bent to take off the kneehigh nylon stockings she had been wearing Her hair was a sheaf coiled over one shoulder He thought he would want her again before morning and that feeling of guilt came again tempered only by the guilty comfort of knowing that Audra was an ocean away Put another nickle in the jukebox he thought This tune is called What She Dont Know Wont Hurt Her But it hurts somewhere In the spaces between people maybe Beverly got up and turned the bed down Come to bed We need sleep Both of us AAAll right Because that was right that was a big tenfour More than anything else he wanted to sleep but not alone not tonight The latest shock was wearing offtoo quickly perhaps but he felt so tired now so usedup Secondtosecond reality had the quality of a dream and in spite of the guilt he felt he also felt that this was a safe place It would be possible to lie here for a little while to sleep in her arms He wanted her warmth and her friendliness Both were sexually charged but that could hurt neither of them now He stripped off his socks and shirt and got in next to her She pressed against him her breasts warm her long legs cool Bill held her aware of the differencesher body was longer than Audras and fuller at the breast and the hip But it was a welcome body It should have been Ben with you dear he thought drowsily I think that was the way it was really supposed to be Why wasnt it Ben Because it was you then and its you now thats all Because what goes around always comes around I think Bob Dylan said that or maybe it was Ronald Reagan And maybe its me now because Bens the one whos supposed to see the lady home Beverly wriggled against him not in a sexual way although even as he fled toward sleep she felt him stir again against her leg and was glad but only wanting his warmth She was already half asleep herself Her happiness here with him after all these years was real She knew that because of its bitter undertaste There was tonight and perhaps there would be another tune for them tomorrow morning Then they would go down in the sewers as they had before and they would find their It The circle would close even tighter and their present lives would merge smoothly with their own childhoods they would become like creatures on some crazy Moebius strip She turned over He slipped an arm between her side and her arm and cupped one breast gently She did not have to lie awake wondering if the hand might suddenly clamp down in a hard pinch Her thoughts began to break up as sleep slid into her As always she saw brilliant wildflower patterns as she crossed overmasses and masses of them nodding brightly under a blue sky These faded and there was a falling sensationthe sort of sensation that had sometimes snapped her awake and sweating as a child a scream on the other side of her face Childhood dreams of falling she had read in her college psychology text were common But she didnt snap back this time she could feel the warm and comforting weight of Bills arm his hand cradling her breast She thought that if she was falling at least she wasnt falling alone Then she touched down and was running this dream whatever it was moved fast She ran after it pursuing sleep silence maybe just time The years moved fast The years ran If you turned around and ran after your own childhood youd have to really let out your stride and bust your buns Twentynine the year she had streaked her hair faster Twentytwo the year she had fallen in love with a football player named Greg Mallory who had damn near raped her after a fraternity party faster faster Sixteen getting drunk with two of her girlfriends on the Bluebird Hill Overlook in Portland Fourteen twelve She ran into sleep chasing twelve catching it running through the barrier of memory that It had cast over all of them it tasted like cold fog in her laboring dreamlungs running back into her eleventh year running running like hell running to beat the devil looking back now looking back over her shoulder for any sign of them as she slipped and scrambled her way down the embankment No sign at least not yet She had really fetched it to him as her father sometimes said and just thinking of her father brought another wave of guilt and despondency washing over her She looked under the rickety bridge hoping to see Silver heeled over on his side but Silver was gone There was a cache of toy guns which they no longer bothered to take home and that was all She started down the path looked back and there they were Belch and Victor supporting Henry between them standing on the edge of the embankment like Indian sentries in a Randolph Scott movie Henry was horribly pale He pointed at her Victor and Belch began to help him down the slope Dirt and gravel spilled from beneath their heels Beverly looked at them for a long moment almost hypnotized Then she turned and sprinted through the trickle of brookwater that ran out from under the bridge ignoring Bens steppingstones her sneakers spraying out flat sheets of water She ran down the path the breath hot in her throat She could feel the muscles in her legs trembling She didnt have much left now The clubhouse If she could get there she might still be safe She ran along the path branches whipping even more color into her cheeks one striking her eye and making it water She cut to the right blundered through tangles of underbrush and came out into the clearing Both the camouflaged trapdoor and the slit window stood open rock n roll drifted up At the sound of her approach Ben Hanscom popped up He had a box of Junior Mints in one hand and an Archie comic book in the other He got a good look at Bev and his mouth fell open Under other circumstances it would have been almost funny Bev what the hell She didnt bother replying Behind her and not too far behind either she could hear branches snapping and whipping there was a muffled shouted curse It sounded as if Henry was getting livelier So she just ran at the square trapdoor opening her hair tangled now with green leaves and twigs as well as the crud from her scramble under the garbage truck streaming out behind her Ben saw she was coming in like the st Airborne and disappeared as quickly as he had come out Beverly jumped and he caught her clumsily Shut everything she panted Hurry up Ben for heavens sake Theyre coming Henry and his friends Henrys gone crazy hes got a knife That was enough for Ben He dropped his Junior Mints and his funny book He pulled the trapdoor shut with a grunt The top was covered with sods TangleTrack was still holding them remarkably well A few blocks of sod had gotten a little loose but that was all Beverly stood on tiptoe and closed the window They were in darkness She groped for Ben found him and hugged him with panicky tightness After a moment he hugged her back They were both on their knees With sudden horror Beverly realized that Richies transistor radio was still playing somewhere in the blackness Little Richard singing The Girl Cant Help It He bunted her with one meaty hip and almost knocked her sprawling in the dark She heard the radio fall to the floor The girl cant help it if the menfolks stop and stare Little Richard informed them with his customary hoarse enthusiasm Cant help it the backup group testified the girl cant help it Ben was panting now too They sounded like a couple of steamengines Suddenly there was a crunch and silence Oh shit Ben said I just squashed it Richies gonna have a bird He reached for her in the dark She felt his hand touch one of her breasts then jerk away as if burned She groped for him got hold of his shirt and drew him close He quieted They sat together arms around each other looking up The darkness was not quite perfect there was a narrow line of light down one side of the trapdoor and three others outlined the slit window One of these three was wide enought to let a slanted ray of sunlight fall into the clubhouse She could only pray they wouldnt see it She could hear them approaching At first she couldnt make out the words and then she could Her grip on Ben tightened If she went into the bamboo we can pick up her trail easy Victor was saying They play around here Henry replied His voice was strained his words emerging in little puffs as if with great effort Boogers Taliendo said so And the day we had that rockfight they were coming from here Suddenly there were thudding footfalls right above them the sodcovered cap vibrated up and down Dirt sifted onto Beverlys upturned face One two maybe even all three of them were standing on top of the clubhouse A cramp laced her belly she had to bite down against a cry Ben put one big hand on the side of her face and pressed it against his arm as he looked up waiting to see if they would guess or if they knew already and were just playing games They got a place Henry was saying Thats what Boogers told me Some kind of a treehouse or something They call it their club Ill club em if they want a club Victor said Belch uttered a thunderous heehawing of laughter at this Thump thump thump overhead The cap moved up and down a little more this time Surely they would notice it ordinary ground just didnt have that kind of give Lets look down by the river Henry said I bet shes down there Thump thump They were moving off Bev let a little sigh of relief trickle through her clamped teeth and then Henry said You stay here and guard the path Belch Okay Belch said and he began to march back and forth sometimes leaving the cap sometimes coming back across it More dirt sifted down Ben and Beverly looked at each other with strained dirty faces Bev became aware that there was more than the smell of smoke in the clubhousea sweaty garbag stink was rising as well Thats me she thought dismally In spite of the smell she hugged Ben even tighter His bulk seemed suddenly very welcome very comforting and she was glad there was a lot of him to hug He might have been nothing but a frightened fatboy when school let out for the summer but he was more than that now like all of them he had changed If Belch discovered them down here Ben just might give him a surprise Ill club em if they want a club Belch said and chuckled A Belch Huggins chuckle was a low trolllike sound Club em if they want a club Thats good Thats pretty much okeydokey She became aware that Bens upper body was heaving up and down in short sharp movements he was pulling air into his lungs and letting it out in sharp little bursts For one alarmed moment she thought he was starting to cry and then she got a closer look at his face and realized he was struggling against laughter His eyes leaking tears caught hers rolled madly and looked away In the faint light which leaked in through the cracks around the closed trapdoor and the window she could see his face was nearly purple with the strain of holding it in Club em if they want an ole clubbydubby Belch said and sat down heavily right in the center of the cap This time the roof trembled more alarmingly and Bev heard a low but ominous crrrack from one of the supports The cap had been meant to support the chunks of camouflaging sod laid on top of it but not the added one hundred and sixty pounds of Belch Hugginss weight If he doesnt get up hes going to land in our laps Bev thought and she began to catch Bens hysteria It was trying to boil out of her in rancid whoops and brays In her minds eye she suddenly saw herself pushing the window up enough on its hinges for her hand to creep out and administer a really good goose to Belch Hugginss backside as he sat there in the hazy afternoon sunshine muttering and giggling She buried her face against Bens chest in a lastditch effort to keep it inside It might if he doesnt fart Ben said and a moment later Belch did cut onea loud and fruity trumpetblast that seemed to go on for at least three seconds They held each other even tighter muffling each others frantic giggles Beverlys head hurt so badly that she thought she might soon have a stroke What Belch bellowed getting up with a thump and a thud that sifted more dirt down on Ben and Beverly What Henry Henry yelled something back Beverly could only make out the words bank and bushes Okay Belch bawled and his feet crossed the cap for the last time There was a final cracking noise this one much louder and a splinter of wood landed in Bevs lap She picked it up wonderingly Five more minutes Ben said in a low whisper Thats all it would have taken Did you hear him when he let go Beverly asked beginning to giggle again Sounded like World War III Ben said also beginning to laugh It was a relief to be able to let it out and they laughed wildly trying to do it in whispers Finally unaware she was going to say it at all and certainly not because it had any discernible bearing on this situation Beverly said Thank you for the poem Ben Ben stopped laughing all at once and regarded her gravely cautiously He took a dirty handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped his face with it slowly Poem The haiku The haiku on the postcard You sent it didnt you No Ben said I didnt send you any haiku Cause if a kid like mea fat kid like medid something like that the girl would probably laugh at him Bill will write she agreed But hell never write anything as nice as that May I use your handkerchief He gave it to her and she began to clean her face as best she could Bens throat worked convulsively He looked down at his hands I didnt mean anything by it She looked at him gravely You better not mean that she said If you do its really going to spoil my day and Ill tell you its going downhill already He continued to look down at his hands and spoke at last in a voice she could barely hear Well I mean I love you Beverly but I dont want that to spoil anything It wont she said and hugged him I need all the love I can get right now Maybe I do she said but that doesnt matter If we were grownups maybe it would a little But I like you all specially Youre the only friends I have I love you too Ben Thank you he said He paused trying and brought it out He was even able to look at her as he said it I wrote the poem They sat without saying anything for a little while Beverly felt safe Protected The images of her fathers face and Henrys knife seemed less vivid and threatening when they sat close like this That sense of protection was hard to define and she didnt try although much later she would recognize the source of its strength she was in the arms of a male who would die for her with no hesitation at all It was a fact that she simply knew it was in the scent that came from his pores something utterly primitive that her own glands could respond to The others were coming back Ben said suddenly What if they get caught out She straightened up aware that she had almost been dozing Bill she remembered had invited Mike Hanlon home to lunch with him Richie was going to go home with Stan and have sandwiches And Eddie had promised to bring back his Parcheesi board They would be arriving soon totally unaware that Henry and his friends were in the Barrens Weve got to get to them Beverly said Henrys not just after me Yes but at least we know theyre here Bill and the other guys dont Eddie cant even run they already broke his arm Yeah She swallowed and looked at her Timex It was hard to read in the dimness but she thought it was a little past one Ben Henrys really gone crazy Hes like that kid in The Blackboard Jungle He was going to kill me and the other two were going to help him Aw no Ben said Henrys crazy but not that crazy Hes just Just what Beverly said She thought of Henry and Patrick in the automobile graveyard in the thick sunshine Henrys blank eyes Ben didnt answer He was thinking Things had changed hadnt they When you were inside the changes they were harder to see You had to step back to see them you had to try anyway When school let out hed been afraid of Henry but only because Henry was bigger and because he was a bullythe kind of kid who would grab a firstgrader Indianrub his arm and send him away crying That was about all Then he had engraved Bens belly Then there had been the rockfight and Henry had been chucking Ms at peoples heads You could kill somebody with one of those things You could kill somebody easy He had started to look different haunted almost It seemed that you always had to be on the watch for him the way youd always have to be on the watch for tigers or poisonous snakes if you were in the jungle But you got used to it so used to it that it didnt even seem unusual just the way things were But Henry was crazy wasnt he Yes Ben had known that on the day school ended and had willfully refused to believe it or remember it It wasnt the kind of thing you wanted to believe or remember And suddenly a thoughta thought so strong it was almost a certaintycrept into his mind fullblown as cold as October mud Its using Henry Maybe the others too but Its using them through Henry And if thats the truth then shes probably right Its not just Indian rubs or rabbitpunches in the back of the neck during studytime near the end of the schoolday while Mrs Douglas reads her book at her desk not just a push on the playground so that you fall down and skin your knee If Its using him then Henry will use the knife An old lady saw them trying to beat me up Beverly was saying Henry went after her He kicked her taillight out This alarmed Ben more than anything else He understood instinctively as most kids did that they lived below the sightlines and hence the thoughtlines of most adults When a grownup was dittybopping down the street thinking his grownup thoughts about work and appointments and buying cars and whatever else grownups thought about he never noticed kids playing hopscotch or guns or kickthecan or ringalevio or hideandgoseek Bullies like Henry could get away with hurting other kids quite a lot if they were careful to stay below that sightline At the very most a passing adult was apt to say something like Why dont you quit that and then just continue dittybopping along without waiting to see if the bully stopped or not So the bully would wait until the grownup had turned the corner and then go back to business as usual It was like adults thought that real life only started when a person was five feet tall If Henry had gone after some old lady he had gone above that sightline And that more than anything else suggested to Ben that he really was crazy Beverly saw the belief in Bens face and felt relief sweep over her She would not have to tell him about how Mr Ross had simply folded his paper and walked into his house She didnt want to tell him about that It was too scary Lets go up to Kansas Street Ben said and abruptly pushed open the trapdoor Get ready to run He stood up in the opening and looked around The clearing was silent He could hear the chuckling voice of the Kenduskeag close by birdsong the thumthudthumthud of a diesel engine snorting its way into the trainyards He heard nothing else and that made him uneasy He would have felt much better if hed heard Henry Victor and Belch cursing their way through the neavy undergrowth down by the stream But he couldnt hear them at all Come on he said and helped Beverly up She also looked around uneasily brushing her hair back with her hands and grimacing at its greasy feel He took her hand and they pushed through a screen of bushes toward Kansas Street Wed better stay off the path They got to the path and started toward Kansas Street Once she stumbled over a rock in the path and fell heavily on the moonsilvered sidewalk A grunt was forced out of him and a runner of blood came with the grunt splatting on the cracked concrete In the moonlight it looked as black as beetleblood Henry looked at it for a long dazed moment then raised his head to look around Kansas Street was earlymorning silent the houses shut up and dark except for a scatter of nightlights A balloon with a smileysmile face was tied to one of its iron bars It bobbed and dipped in the faint breeze Henry got to his feet again one sticky hand pressed to his belly The nigger had stuck him pretty good but Henry had gone him one better Yessir As far as the nigger was concerned Henry felt like he was pretty much okeydokey Kids a gone goose Henry muttered and made his shaky staggering way past the floating balloon Fresh blood glimmered on his hand as it continued to flow from his stomach Kids all done Greased the sucker Gonna grease them all Teach them to throw rocks The world was coming in slowrolling waves big combers like the ones they used to show at the beginning of every Hawaii FiveO episode on the ward TV book em Danno haha Jack Fuckin Lord okay Jack Fuckin Lord was pretty much okeydokey hear the sound those Oahu big boys make as they rise curl and shake the reality of the world Pipeline Chantays Remember Pipeline Pipeline was pretty much okeydokey WipeOut Crazy laugh there at the start Sounded like Patrick Hockstetter Fucking queerboy Got greased himself and as far as I fuck of a lot better than okeydokey that was just FINE that was JUST AS FINE AS PAINT okay Pipeline shoot the line dont back down not my boys catch a wave and an ear inside his head it kept hearing that kaspanggg sound an eye inside his head it kept seeing Victors head rising on the end of that spring eyelids and cheeks and forehead tattooed with rosettes of blood Henry looked blearily to his left and saw that the houses had been replaced with a tall black stand of hedge Looming above it was the narrow gloomily Victorian pile of the Theological Seminary Not a window shone light The Seminary had graduated its last class in June of It had closed its doors that summer and whatever walked there now walked alone and only by permission of the chattering womens club that called itself the Derry Historical Society He came to the walk which led up to the front door It was barred by a heavy chain from which a metal sign hung NO TRESPASSIN THIS ORDER ENFORCED BY DERRY POLICE DEPT Henrys feet tangled on this track and he fell heavily againwhapto the sidewalk Up ahead a car turned onto Kansas Street from Hawthorne Its headlights washed down the street Henry fought the dazzle long enough to see the lights on top it was a fuzzmobile He crawled under the chain and crabbed his way to the left so he was behind the hedge The nightdew on his hot face was wonderful He lay face down turning his head from side to side wetting his cheeks drinking what he could drink Then suddenly its bubblelights came on washing the darkness with erratic blue pulses of light There was no need for the siren on the deserted streets but Henry heard its null suddenly crank up to full revs Rubber blistered a startled scream from the pavement Caught Im caught his mind gibbered and then he realized that the policecar was heading away from him up Kansas Street A moment later a hellish warbling sound filled the night heading toward him from the south He imagined some huge silky black cat loping through the dark all green eyes and silky flexing pelt It in a new shape coming for him coming to gobble him up Little by little and only as the warbling began to veer away he realized it was an ambulance heading in the direction the fuzzmobile had gone He lay shuddering on the wet grass too cold now struggling fuzzit cousin buzzit cousin rock it roll it we got chicken in the barn what bam whose barn my not to vomit He was afraid that if he vomited all of his guts would come up and there were five of them still to get Ambulance and police car Where are they heading The library of course The nigger But theyre too late I greased him Might as well turn off your sireen boys He aint gonna hear it Hes just as dead as a fencepost He Henry licked his peeling lips with his arid tongue If he was dead there would be no warbling siren in the night like the cry of a wounded panther Not unless the nigger had called them So maybejust maybethe nigger wasnt dead No Henry breathed He rolled over on his back and stared up at the sky at the billions of stars up there It had come from there he knew From somewhere up in that sky It came from outer space with a lust for Earthwomen came to rob all the women and rape all the men say Frank dont you mean rob all the men and rape all the women whoth running this show thilly man you or Jesse Victor used to tell that one and that was pretty much came from the spaces between the stars Looking up at that starry sky gave him the creeps it was too big too black It was all too possible to imagine it turning bloodred all too possible to imagine a Face forming in lines of fire He closed his eyes shivering and holding his arms crossed on his belly and he thought The nigger is dead Someone heard us fighting and sent the cops to investigate thats all Shut up shut up Henry groaned He felt the old baffled rage again he remembered how they had beaten him again and again in the old daysold days that seemed so close and so vital nowhow every time when he believed he had them they had somehow slipped through his fingers It had been like that on the last day after Belch saw the bitch running down Kansas Street toward the Barrens He remembered that oh yes he remembered that clearly enough When you got kicked in the balls you remembered it It had happened to him again and again that summer Henry struggled to a sitting position wincing at the deep dagger of pain in his guts Victor and Belch had helped him down into the Barrens He had walked as fast as he could in spite of the agony that griped and pulled at his groin and the root of his belly The time had come to finish it They had followed the path to a clearing from which five or six paths radiated like strands of a spiderweb Yes there had been kids playing around there you didnt have to be Tonto to see that There were scraps of candywrapper the curled tail of a shotoff roll of Bang caps red and black A few boards and a fluffy scatter of sawdust as if something had been built there He remembered standing in the center of the clearing and scanning the trees looking for their baby treehouse He would spot it and then he would climb up and the girl would be cowering there and he would use the knife to cut her throat and feel her titties nice and easy until they stopped moving But he hadnt been able to see any treehouse neither had Belch or Victor The old familiar frustration rose in his throat He and Victor left Belch to guard the clearing while they went down the river But there had been no sign of her there either He remembered bending over and picking up a rock and heaving it far down the stream furious and bewildered Where the fuck did she go he demanded wheeling toward Victor Victor shook his head slowly dont know he said Youre bleeding Henry looked down and saw a dark spot the size of a quarter on the crotch of his jeans The pain had withdrawn to a low throbbing ache but his underpants felt too small and too tight His balls were swelling He felt that anger inside him again something like a knotted rope around his heart She had done this Dont know Victor said again in that same dull voice He seemed hypnotized sunstruck not really there at all Ran away I guess She could be all the way over to the Old Cape by now Shes not Henry said shes hiding Theyve got a place and shes hiding there Maybe its not a treehouse Maybe its something else Henry stood in the Kenduskeag the cold water boiling over the tops of his sneakers looking around His eyes fixed on a cylinder poking out of the embankment about twenty feet downstreama pumpingstation He climbed out of the water and walked down to it feeling a sort of necessary dread settle into him His skin seemed to be tightening his eyes widening so that they were able to see more and more it seemed he could feel the tiny hairs in his ears stirring and moving like kelp in an underwater tidal flow Low humming came from the pumpingstation and beyond it he could see a pipe jutting out of the embankment over the Kenduskeag A steady flow of sludge pulsed out of the pipe and ran into the water Henry paid no attention He put his eye to one of the round holes in the iron and saw nothing but blackness He exchanged eye for ear The voice drifted up to him from the blackness inside and Henry felt his interior temperature plummet to zero his veins and arteries freezing into crystal tubes of ice But with these sensations came an almost unknown feeling love His eyes widened A clownish smile spread his lips in a large nerveless arc It was the voice from the moon Now It was down in the pumpingstation down in the drains He waited but there was no more only the steady soporific drone of the pumping machinery He walked back down to where Victor stood on the bank watching him cautiously Henry ignored him and hollered for Belch In a little while Belch came They crept back toward the clearing and sat down Henry tried to pull his underpants away from his aching balls but it hurt too much Belch fell obligingly silent Henry had Camels but he didnt share them out He didnt want the bitch to smell cigarette smoke if she was around He could have explained but there was no need The voice had only spoken two words to him but they seemed to explain everything They played down here Soon the others would come back Why settle for just the bitch when they could have all seven of the little shitepokes They waited and watched Victor and Belch seemed to have gone to sleep with their eyes open It was not a long wait but there was time for Henry to think of a good many things How he had found the switchblade this morning for instance It wasnt the same one hed had on the last day of school hed lost that one somewhere This one looked a lot cooler He had stood on the porch looking at their battered leaning RFD box trying to grasp what he was seeing The box was decked with balloons Two were tied to the metal hook where the postman sometimes hung packages others were tied to the flag Red yellow blue green It was as if some weird circus had crept by on Witcham Road in the dead of night leaving this sign As he approached the mailbox he saw there were faces on the balloonsthe faces of the kids who had deviled him all this summer the kids who seemed to mock him at every turn He had stared at these apparitions gapemouthed and then the balloons popped one by one That had been good it was as if he were making them pop just by thinking about it killing them with his mind The front of the mailbox suddenly swung down Henry walked toward it and peered in Although the mailman didnt get this far out until the middle of the afternoon he felt no surprise when he saw a flat rectangular package inside He pulled it out MR HENRY BOWERS RFD DERRY MAINE the address read There was even a returnaddress of sorts MR ROBERT GRAY DERRY MAINE He opened the package letting the brown paper drift down heedlessly by his feet There was a white box inside He opened it Lying on a bed of white cotton had been the switchknife He took it into the house His father was lying on his pallet in the bedroom they shared surrounded by empty beer cans his belly bulging over the top of his yellow underpants Henry knelt beside him listening to the snort and flutter of his fathers breathing watching his fathers horsy lips purse and pucker with each breath Henry placed the businessend of the switchknife against his fathers scrawny neck His father moved a little and then settled back into beery sleep again Henry kept the knife like that for almost five minutes his eyes distant and thoughtful the ball of his left thumb caressing the silver button set into the switchblades neck The voice from the moon spoke to himit whispered like the spring wind which is warm with a cold blade buried somewhere in its middle it buzzed like a paper nest full of roused hornets it huckstered like a hoarse politician Everything the voice said seemed pretty much okeydokey to Henry and so he pushed the silver button There was a click inside the knife as the suicidespring let go and six inches of steel drove through Butch Bowerss neck It went in as easily as the tines of a meatfork into the breast of a wellroasted chicken The tip of the blade popped out on the other side dripping Butchs eyes flew open He stared at the ceiling His mouth dropped open Blood ran from the corners of it and down his cheeks toward the lobes of his ears He began to gurgle A large bloodbubble formed between his slack lips and popped One of his hands crept to Henrys knee and squeezed convulsively Henry didnt mind Presently the hand fell away The gurgling noises stopped a moment later Butch Bowers was dead Henry pulled the knife out wiped it on the dirty sheet that covered his fathers pallet and pushed the blade back in until the spring clicked again He looked at his father without much interest The voice had told him about the days work while he knelt beside Butch with the knife against Butchs neck The voice had explained everything So he went into the other room to call Belch and Victor Now here they were all three and although his balls still ached horribly the knife made a comforting bulge in his left front pants pocket He felt that the cutting would begin soon The others would come back down to resume whatever baby game they had been playing and then the cutting would begin The voice from the moon had laid it out for him as he knelt by his father and on his way into town he had been unable to take his eyes from that pale ghostdisc in the sky He saw that there was indeed a man in the moona grisly glimmering ghostface with cratered holes for eyes and a glabrous grin that seemed to reach halfway up Its cheekbones It talked we float down here Henry we all float youll float too all the way to town Kill them all Henry the ghostvoice from the moon said and Henry could dig it Henry felt he could second that emotion He would kill them all his tormentors and then those feelingsthat he was losing his grip that he was coming inexorably to a larger world he would not be able to dominate as he had dominated the playyard at Derry Elementary that in the wider world the fatboy and the nigger and the stuttering freak might somehow grow larger while he somehow only grew olderwould be gone He would kill them all and the voicesthose inside and the one which spoke to him from the moonwould leave him alone He would kill them and then go back to the house and sit on the back porch with his fathers souvenir Jap sword across his lap He would drink one of his fathers Rheingolds He would listen to the radio too but no baseball Baseball was strictly Squaresville He would listen to rock and roll instead Although Henry didnt know it and wouldnt have cared if he did on this one subject he and the Losers agreed rock and roll was pretty much okeydokey We got chicken in the barn whose barn what barn my barn Everything would be good then everything would be the ginchiest then everything would be okeyfine then and anything which might come next would not matter The voice would take care of himhe sensed that If you took care of It It would take care of you That was how things had always been in Derry But the kids had to be stopped stopped soon stopped today The voice had told him so Henry took his new knife out of his pocket looked at it turned it this way and that admiring the way the sun winked and slid off the chrome facing Then Belch was grabbing his arm and hissing Look that Henry Jeezlyoldcrow Look that Henry looked and felt the clear light of understanding burst over him A square section of the clearing was rising as if by magic revealing a growing slice of darkness beneath For just a moment he felt a jolt of terror as it occurred to him that this might be the owner of the voice for surely It lived somewhere under the city Then he heard the gritty squall of dirt in the hinges and understood They hadnt been able to see the treehouse because there was none By God we was standin right on top of em Victor grunted and as Bens head and shoulders appeared in the square hatchway in the center of the clearing he made as if to charge forward Henry grabbed him and held him back Aint we gonna get em Henry Victor asked as Ben boosted himself up Both of them were puffing and blowing Well get em Henry said never taking his eyes from the hated fatboy Another ballkicker Ill kick your balls so high up you can wear them for earrings you fat fuck Wait and see if I dont dont worry The fatboy was helping the bitch out of the hole She looked around doubtfully and for a moment Henry believed she looked right at him Then her eyes passed on The two of them murmured together and then they pushed their way into the thick undergrowth and were gone Come on Henry said when the sound of snapping branches and rustling leaves had faded almost to inaudibility Well follow em But keep back and keep quiet I want em all together The three of them crossed the clearing like soldiers on patrol bent low their eyes wide and moving Belch paused to look down into the clubhouse and shook his head in admiring wonder sittin right over their heads I was he said They took the path because it was quieter They were halfway back to Kansas Street when the bitch and the fatboy holding hands isnt that cute Henry thought in a kind of ecstasy emerged almost directly in front of them Luckily their backs were to Henrys group and neither of them looked around Henry Victor and Belch froze then drew into the shadows at the side of the path Soon Ben and Beverly were just two shirts seen through a tangle of shrubs and bushes The three of them began to pursue again cautiously Henry took the knife out again and pressed the chrome button in the handle The blade popped out He looked at it dreamily in the moonlight He liked the way the starlight ran along the blade He had no idea exactly what time it was He was drifting in and out of reality now A sound impinged on his consciousness and began to grow It was a car engine It drew closer Henrys eyes widened in the dark He held the knife more tightly waiting for the car to pass by It didnt It drew up at the curb beyond the seminary hedge and simply stopped there engine idling Grimacing his belly was stiffening now it had gone boardhard and the blood seeping sluggishly between his fingers had the consistency of sap just before you took the taps out of the maples in late March or early April he got on his knees and pushed aside the stiff hedgebranches He could see headlights and the shape of a car Cops His hand squeezed the knife and relaxed squeezed and relaxed squeezed and relaxed I sent you a ride Henry the voice whispered Sort of a taxi if you can dig that After all we have to get you over there to the Town House pretty soon The nights getting old The voice uttered one thin bonelike chuckle and fell silent Now the only sounds were the crickets and the steady rumble of the idling car Sounds like cherrybomb mufflers Henry thought distractedly He got awkwardly to his feet and worked his way back to the seminary walk He peeked around at the car Not a fuzzmobile no bubbles on the roof and the shape was all wrong The shape was old Henry heard that giggle again or perhaps it was only the wind He emerged from the shadow of the hedge crawled under the chain got to his feet again and began to walk toward the idling car which existed in a blackandwhite Polaroidsnapshot world of bright moonlight and impenetrable shadow Henry was a mess his shirt was black with blood and it had soaked through his jeans almost to the knees His face was a white blotch under an institutional crewcut He reached the intersection of the seminary path and the sidewalk and peered at the car trying to make sense out of the hulk behind the wheel But it was the car he recognized firstit was the one his father always swore he would own someday a Plymouth Fury It was red and white and Henry knew hadnt his father told him often enough that the engine rumbling under the hood was a V  Available horsepower of  able to hit seventy from the gitgo in just about nine seconds gobbling hitest through its fourbarrel carb Im gonna get that car and then when I die they can bury me in it Butch had been fond of saying except of course he had never gotten the car and the state had buried him after Henry had been taken away raving and screaming of monsters to the funny farm If thats him inside I dont think I can take it Henry thought squeezing down on the knife swaying drunkenly back and forth looking at the shape behind the wheel Then the passenger door of the Fury swung open the domelight came on and the driver turned to look at him It was Belch Huggins His face was a hanging ruin One of his eyes was gone and a rotted hole in one parchment cheek revealed blackened teeth Perched on Belchs head was the New York Yankees baseball cap he had been wearing the day he died It was turned around backward Graygreen mold oozed along the bill Belch Henry cried and agony ripped its way up from his belly making him cry out again wordlessly Belchs dead lips stretched in a grin splitting open in whitishgray bloodless folds He held one twisted hand out toward the open door in invitation Henry hesitated then shuffled around the Furys grille allowing one hand to touch the Vshaped emblem there just as he had always touched it when his father took him into the Bangor showroom when he was a kid to look at this same car As he reached the passenger side grayness overwhelmed him in a soft wave and he had to grab the open door to keep his feet He stood there head down breathing in snuffling gasps At last the world came backpartway anyhowand he was able to work his way around the door and fall into the seat Pain skewered his guts again and fresh blood squirted out into his hand It felt like warm jelly He put his head back and gritted his teeth the cords on his neck standing out At last the pain began to subside a little The door swung shut by itself The domelight went out Henry saw one of Belchs rotted hands close over the transmission lever and drop it into drive The bunched white knots of Belchs knuckles glimmered through the decaying flesh of his fingers The Fury began to move down Kansas Street toward UpMile Hill How you doin Belch Henry heard himself say It was stupid of courseBelch couldnt be here dead people couldnt drive carsbut it was all he could think of Belch didnt reply His one sunken eye stared at the road His teeth glared sickly at Henry through the hole in his cheek Henry became vaguely aware that ole Belch smelled pretty ripe Ole Belch smelled in fact like a bushelbasket of tomatoes that had gone bad and watery The glove compartment flopped open banging Henrys knees and in the light of the small bulb inside he saw a bottle of Texas Driver halffull He took it out opened it and had himself a good shot It went down like cool silk and hit his stomach like an explosion of lava He shuddered all over moaning and then began to feel a little better a little more connected to the world Belchs head turned toward him Henry could hear the tendons in Belchs neck the sound was like the scream of rusty screendoor hinges Belch regarded him for a moment with a dead oneeyed stare and Henry realized for the first time that most of Belchs nose was gone It looked like something had been at the ole Belchers nose Dog maybe Or maybe rats Rats seemed more likely The tunnels they had chased the little kids into that day had been full of rats Moving just as slowly Belchs head turned toward the road again Henry was glad Ole Belch staring at him that way well Henry hadnt been able to dig it too much There had been something in Belchs single sunken eye Reproach Anger What There is a dead boy behind the wheel of this car Henry looked down at his arm and saw that huge goosebumps had formed there He quickly had another snort from the bottle This one hit a little easier and spread its warmth farther The Plymouth rolled down UpMile Hill and made its way around the counterclockwise traffic circle except at this time of night there was no traffic all the trafficlights had changed to yellow bunkers splashing the empty streets and closed buildings with steady pulses of light It was so quiet that Henry could hear the relays clicking inside each light or was that his imagination Never meant to leave you behind that day Belcher Henry said I mean if that was you know on your mind That scream of dried tendons again Belch looking at him again with his one sunken eye And his lips stretched in a terrible grin that revealed grayblack gums which were growing their own garden of mold What sort of a grin is that Henry asked himself as the car purred silkily up Main Street past Freeses on the one side Nans Luncheonette and the Aladdin Theater on the other Is it a forgiving grin An oldpals grin Or is it the kind of grin that says Im going to get you Henry Im going to get you for running out on me and Vie What kind of grin You have to understand how it was Henry said and then stopped How had it been It was all confused in his mind the pieces jumbled up like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that had just been dumped out on one of the shitty cardtables in the rec room at Jumper Hill How had it been exactly They had followed the fatboy and the bitch back to Kansas Street and had waited back in the bushes watching them climb up the embankment to the top If they had disappeared from view he and Victor and Belch would have dropped the stalking game and simply gone after them two of them were better than none at all and the rest would be along in time But they hadnt disappeared They had simply leaned against the fence talking and watching the street Every now and then they would check down the slope into the Barrens but Henry kept his two troops well out of sight The sky Henry remembered had become overcast clouds moving in from the east the air thickening There would be rain that afternoon A bony leathery hand closed over his forearm and Henry screamed He had been drifting away again into that cottony grayness but Belchs dreadful touch and the dagger of pain in his stomach from the scream brought him back He looked around and Belchs face was less than two inches from Henrys he gasped in breath and wished he hadnt The ole Belcher really had gone to seed Henry was again reminded of tomatoes going quietly putrescent in some shadowy shed comer His stomach roiled He remembered the end suddenlythe end for Belch and Vie anyway How something had come out of the darkness as they stood in a shaft with a sewergrating at the top wondering which way to go next Something Henry hadnt been able to tell what Until Victor shrieked Frankenstein Its Frankenstein And so it was it was the Frankenstein monster with bolts coming out of its neck and a deep stitched scar across its forehead lurching along in shoes like a childs blocks Frankensteinl Vie had screamed FrAnd then Vics head was gone Vics head was flying across the shaftway to strike the stonework of the far side with a sour sticky thud The monsters watery yellow eyes had fallen on Henry and Henry had frozen His bladder let go and he felt warmth flood down his legs Listen I know I ran Henry said I shouldnt have done that But but I got lost Henry whispered as if to tell the ole Belcher that he had paid too It sounded weak like saying Yeah I know you got killed Belch but I got one fuck of a splinter under my thumbnail But it had been bad really bad He had wandered around in a world of stinking darkness for hours and finally he remembered he had started to scream At some point he had fallena long dizzying fall in which he had time to think Oh good in a minute Ill be dead Ill be out of thisand then he had been in fastrunning water Under the Canal he supposed He had come out into fading sunlight had flailed his way toward the bank and had finally climbed out of the Kenduskeag less than fifty yards from the place where Adrian Mellon would drown twentysix years later He slipped fell bashed his head blacked out When he woke up it was after dark He had somehow found his way out to Route and had hooked a ride to the home place And there the cops had been waiting for him But that was then and this was now Belch had stepped in front of Frankensteins monster and it had peeled the left side of his face down to the skullso much Henry had seen before fleeing But now Belch was back and Belch was pointing at something Henry saw that they had pulled up in front of the Derry Town House and suddenly he understood perfectly The Town House was the only real hotel left in Derry Back in there had also been the Eastern Star at the end of Exchange Street and the Travellers Rest on Torrault Street Both had disappeared during urban renewal Henry knew all about this he had read the Derry News faithfully every day in Juniper Hill Only the Town House was left and a bunch of tickytacky little motels out by the Interstate Thats where theyll be he thought Right in there All of them that are left Asleep in their beds with visions of sugarplumsor sewers maybedancing in their heads And Ill get them One by one Ill get them He took the bottle of Texas Driver out again and bit off a snort He could feel fresh blood trickling into his lap and the seat was tacky beneath him but the wine made it better the wine seemed to make it not matter He could have done with some good bourbon but the Driver was better than nothing Look he said to Belch Im sorry I ran I dont know why I ran Please dont be mad Belch spoke for the first and only time but the voice wasnt his voice The voice that came from Belchs rotting mouth was deep and powerful terrifying Henry whimpered at the sound of it It was the voice from the moon the voice of the clown the voice he had heard in his dreams of drains and sewers where water rushed on and on He put the bottle back in the glove compartment Its neck chattered briefly like teeth And he saw a paper where the bottle had been He took it out and unfolded it leaving bloody fingerprints on the corners Embossed across the top was this logo in bright scarlet Their room numbers That was good That saved time Thanks Be But Belch was gone The drivers seat was empty There was only the New York Yankees baseball cap lying there mold crusted on its bill And some slimy stuff on the knob of the gearshift Henry stared his heart beating painfully in his throat and then he seemed to hear something move and shift in the back seat He got out quickly opening the door and almost falling to the pavement in his haste He gave the Fury which still burbled softly through its dual cherrybomb mufflers cherrybombs had been outlawed in the State of Maine in a wide berth It was hard to walk each step pulled and tore at his belly But he gained the sidewalk and stood there looking at the eightfloor brick building which along with the library and the Aladdin Theater and the seminary was one of the few he remembered clearly from the old days Most of the lights on the upper floors were out now but the frostedglass globes which flanked the main doorway blazed softly in the darkness haloed with moisture from the lingering groundfog Henry made his laborious way toward and between them shouldering open one of the doors The lobby was weehours silent There was a faded Turkish rug on the floor The ceiling was a huge mural executed in rectangular panels which showed scenes from Derrys logging days There were overstuffed sofas and wing chairs and a great fireplace which was now dead and silent a birch log thrown across the andironsa real log no gas the fireplace in the Town House was not just a piece of lobby stage dressing Plants spilled out of low pots The glass double doors leading to the bar and the restaurant were closed From some inner office Henry could hear the gabble of a TV turned low He lurched across the lobby his pants and shirt streaked with blood Blood was grimed into the folds of his hands it ran down his cheeks and slashed his forehead like warpaint His eyes bulged from their sockets Anyone in the lobby who had seen him would have run screaming in terror But there was no one The elevator doors opened as soon as he pushed the UP button He looked at the paper in his hand then at the floor buttons After a moment of deliberation he pushed and the doors closed There was a faint hum of machinery as the elevator began to rise Might as well start at the top and work my way down He slumped against the rear wall of the car eyes halfclosed The hum of the elevator was soothing Like the hum of the machinery in the pumpingstations of the drainage system That day it kept coming back to him How everything seemed almost prearranged as if all of them were just playing parts How Vie and the ole Belcher had seemed well almost drugged He remembered The car came to a stop jolting him and sending another wave of griping pain into his stomach The doors slid open Henry stepped out into the silent hallway more plants here hanging ones spiderplants he didnt want to touch any of them not those oozy green runners they reminded him too much of the things that had been hanging down there in the dark He rechecked the paper Kaspbrak was in Henry started down that way running one hand along the wall for support leaving a faint bloody track on the wallpaper as he went ah but he stepped away whenever he came close to one of the hanging spiderplants he wanted no truck with those His breathing was harsh and dry Here it was Henry pulled the switchblade from his pocket swashed his dry lips with his tongue and knocked on the door Nothing He knocked again louder this time Whozit Sleepy Good Hed be in his jammies only halfawake And when he opened the door Henry would drive the switchblade directly into the hollow at the base of his neck the vulnerable hollow just below the adams apple Bellboy sir Henry said Message from your wife Did Kaspbrak have a wife Maybe that had been a stupid thing to say He waited coldly alert He heard footstepsthe shuffle of slippers From Myra He sounded alarmed Good He would be more alarmed in a few seconds A pulse beat steadily in Henrys right temple I guess so sir Theres no name It just says your wife There was a pause then a metallic rattle as Kaspbrak fumbled with the chain Grinning Henry pushed the button on the switchblades handle Click He held the blade up by his cheek ready He heard the thumbbolt turn In just a moment he would plunge the blade into the skinny little creeps throat He waited The door opened and Eddie saw Stan and Richie just coming out of the Costello Avenue Market each of them eating a Rocket on a pushup stick Hey he shouted Hey wait up They turned around and Stan waved Eddie ran to join them as quickly as he could which was not in truth very quickly One arm was immured in a plasterofParis cast and he had his Parcheesi board under the other Whatchoo say Eddie Whatchoo say boy Richie asked in his grandly rolling Southern Gentleman Voice the one that sounded more like Foghorn Leghorn in the Warner Brothers cartoons than anything else Ah say Ah say the boys got a broken ahm Lookit that Stan the boys got a broken ahm Ah say be a good spote and carreh the boys Pawcheeseh bowud for him I can carry it Eddie said a little out of breath How about a lick on your Rocket Your mom wouldnt approve Eddie Richie said sadly He began to eat faster He had just gotten to the chocolate stuff in the middle his favorite part Germs boy Ah say Ah say you kin get germs eatin after someone else Reluctantly Richie held his Rocket up to Eddies mouth and snatched it away quickly as soon as Eddie had gotten in a couple of moderately serious licks You can have the rest of mine if you want Stan said Im still full from lunch Jews dont eat much Richie instructed Its part of their religion The three of them were walking along companionably enough now headed up toward Kansas Street and the Barrens Derry seemed lost in a deep hazy afternoon doze The blinds of most of the houses they passed were pulled down Toys stood abandoned on lawns as if their owners had been hastily called in from play or put down for naps Thunder rumbled thickly in the west No Richies just pulling your leg Stan said Jews eat as much as normal people He pointed at Richie Like him You know youre pretty fucking mean to Stan Eddie told Richie How would you like somebody to say all that madeup shit about you just because youre a Catholic Oh Catholics do plenty Richie said My dad told me once that Hitler was a Catholic and Hitler killed billions of Jews Right Stan My mom was furious when my dad told me that Richie went on A little reminiscent grin had surfaced on his face Absolutely fyoorious Us Catholics also had the Inquisition that was the little dealie with the rack and the thumbscrews and all that stuff I figure all religions are pretty weird Me too Stan said quietly Were not Orthodox or anything like that I mean we eat ham and bacon I hardly even know what being a Jew is I was born in Derry and sometimes we go up to synagogue in Bangor for stuff like Yom Kippur but He shrugged Ham Bacon Eddie was mystified He and his mom were Methodists Orthodox Jews dont eat stuff like that Stan said It says something in the Torah about not eating anything that creeps through the mud or walks on the bottom of the ocean I dont know exactly how it goes But pigs are supposed to be out also lobster But my folks eat them I do too Thats weird Eddie said and burst out laughing I never heard of a religion that told you what you could eat Next thing theyll be telling you what kind of gas you can buy Kosher gas Stan said and laughed by himself Neither Richie nor Eddie understood what he was laughing about You gotta admit Stanny it is pretty weird Richie said I mean not being able to eat a sausage just because you happen to be Jewish Jeez no Richie said shocked You cant eat meat on Friday because He began to grin a little Oh okay I see what you mean Do Catholics really go to hell if they eat meat on Fridays Eddie asked fascinated totally unaware that until two generations before his own people had been devout Polish Catholics who would no more have eaten meat on Friday than they would have gone outside with no clothes on Well Ill tell you what Eddie Richie said I dont really think God would send me down to the Hot Place just for forgetting and having a baloney sandwich for lunch on a Friday but why take a chance Right I guess not Eddie said But it seems so So stupid he was going to say and then he remembered a story Mrs Portleigh had told the Sundayschool class when he was just a little kida first grader in Little Worshippers According to Mrs Portleigh a bad boy had once stolen some of the communion bread when the tray was passed and put it in his pocket He took it home and threw it into the toilet bowl just to see what would happen At onceor so Mrs Portleigh reported to her rapt Little Worshippersthe water in the toilet bowl had turned a bright red It was the Blood of Christ she said and it had appeared to that little boy because he had done a very bad act called a BLASPHEMY It had appeared to warn him that by throwing the flesh of Jesus into the toilet he had put his immortal soul in danger of Hell Up until then Eddie had rather enjoyed the act of communion which he had only been allowed to take since the previous year The Methodists used Welchs grape juice instead of wine and the Body of Christ was represented by cutup cubes of fresh springy Wonder Bread He liked the idea of taking in food and drink as a religious rite But following Mrs Portleighs story his awe of the ritual darkened into something more potent something rather dreadful Simply reaching for the cubes of bread became an act which required courage and he always feared an electrical shock or worse that the bread would suddenly change color in his hand become a bloodclot and a disembodied Voice would begin to thunder in the church Not worthy Not worthy Damned to Hell Damned to Hell Often after he had taken communion his throat would close up his breath would begin to wheeze in and out and he would wait with panicky impatience for the benediction to be over so he could hurry into the vestibule and use his aspirator You dont want to be so silly he told himself as he grew older That was nothing but a story and Mrs Portleigh sure wasnt any saintMamma said she was divorced down in Kittery and that she plays Bingo at Saint Marys in Bangor and that real Christians dont gamble real Christians leave gambling for pagans and Catholics All that made perfect sense but it didnt relieve his mind The story of the communion bread that turned the water in the toilet bowl to blood worried at him gnawed at him even caused him to lose sleep It came to him one night that the way to get this behind him once and for all would be to take a piece of the bread himself toss it in the toilet and see what happened But such an experiment was far beyond his courage his rational mind could not stand against that sinister image of the blood spreading its cloud of accusation and potential damnation in the water it could not stand against that talismanic magical incantation This is my body take eat this is my blood shed for you and for many I guess all religions are weird Eddie said now But powerful his mind added almost magical or was that BLASPHEMY He began to think about the thing they had seen on Neibolt Street and for the first time he saw a crazy parallelthe Werewolf had after all come out of the toilet Boy I guess everybodys asleep Richie said tossing his empty Rockettube nonchalantly into the gutter You ever see it so quiet What did everybody go to Bar Harbor for the day HHHHey you guhguhguys Bill Denbrough shouted from behind them WuhWuhhait up Eddie turned delighted as always to hear Big Bills voice He was wheeling Silver around the corner of Costello Avenue outdistancing Mike although Mikes Schwinn was almost brandnew Hiyo Silver AWAYYYY Bill yelled He rolled up to them doing perhaps twenty miles an hour the playing cards clothespinned to the fenderstruts roaring Then he backpedalled locked the brakes and produced an admirably long skidmark Stuttering Bill Richie said Howaya boy M say Ah say how aw you boy Im oookay Bill said seen Ben or BuhBuhheverly is Mike rode up and joined them Sweat stood out on his face in little drops How fast does that bike go anyway I havent seen them Richie said Theyre probably down there hanging out Singing twopart harmony Shboom shboom yadadadadadada you look like a dream shweetheart They started toward the Barrens again Mike and Bill pushing their bikes Conversation was brisk at first but then it lagged Looking at Bill Eddie saw an uneasy look on his face and he thought that maybe the quiet was getting to him too He knew Richie had meant it as a joke but it really did seem that everyone in Derry had gone to Bar Harbor for the day to somewhere Not a car moved on the street there wasnt a single old lady pushing a carrier full of groceries back to her house or apartment Sure is quiet isnt it Eddie ventured but Bill only nodded They crossed to the Barrens side of Kansas Street and then they saw Ben and Beverly running toward them shouting Eddie was shocked by Beverlys appearance she was usually so neat and clean her hair always washed and tied back in a ponytail Now she was streaked with what looked like every kind of gluck in the universe Her eyes were wide and wild There was a scratch on one cheek Her jeans were caked with crap and her blouse was torn Cant go down in the Barrens Beverly was panting The boys Henry Victor theyre down there somewhere the knife he has a knife Sluhslow down Bill said taking charge at once in that effortless almost unconscious way of his He glanced at Ben as he ran up his cheeks flushed bright his considerable chest heaving Shit you mean he used to be sane Richie asked and spat between his teeth ShShut uhup RuhRichie Bill said and then looked back at Beverly TehTell he said Eddies hand crept into his pocket and touched his aspirator He didnt know what all this was but he already knew it wasnt good Forcing herself to speak as calmly as possible Beverly managed to get out an edited version of the storya version that began with Henry Victor and Belch catching up to her on the street She didnt tell them about her fathershe was desperately ashamed of that When she was finished Bill stood silent for a moment hands in his pockets chin down Silvers handlebars leaning against his chest The others waited throwing frequent glances at the railing that ran along the edge of the dropoff Bill thought for a long time and no one interrupted him Eddie became aware suddenly and effortlessly that this might be the final act That was how the days silence felt wasnt it The feeling that the whole town had up and left leaving only the deserted husks of buildings behind Richie was thinking about the picture in Georges album that had suddenly Beverly was thinking about her father how pale his eyes had been Ben was thinking about the mummy and a smell like dead cinnamon Stan Uris was thinking of bluejeans black and dripping and hands as white Bill Ben said His face was troubled Beverly said Henry was really crazy That he meant to kill IhIts nuhnot theirs Bill said gesturing at the green daggershaped slash of the Barrens to their right and below themthe underbrush the choked groves of trees the bamboo the glint of water IhIhIts not their pruhpruhhopperty He looked around at them his face grim Im tttired of bbeing scuhschuhhared by them We bbbeat them in the ruhrockfight and if we hhhave to beat them aaagain well duhduhdo it Bill turned to Eddie and with real shock Eddie saw how tired and drawn Bills face wasthere was something frightening about that face but it wasnt until much much later as an adult drifting toward sleep after the meeting at the library that he understood what that frightening thing was it was the face of a boy driven close to the brink of madness a boy who was perhaps ultimately no more sane or in control of his own decisions than Henry was Yet the essential Bill was still there looking out of those haunted scarified eyes an angry determined Bill No one answered him Thunder boomed closer now Eddie looked at the sky and saw the stormclouds moving in from the west in black thunderheads It was going to rain a bitch as his mother sometimes said Nuhnuhhow Ill tttell you what Bill said looking at them None of you have to guhguhgo wwith me if you ddont want to Thats uhuhup to you I dont think so Eddie Richie said Your arms not you know looking too cool I wwwant hhim Bill said You wwwalk with muhmuhme EhEhEddie Ill keep an eye on yuhyou Thanks Bill Eddie said Bills tired halfcrazy face seemed suddenly lovely to himlovely and well loved He felt a dim sense of amazement Id die for him I guess if he told me to What kind of power is that If it makes you look like Bill looks now its maybe not such a good power to have Yeah Bills got the ultimate weapon Richie said BO bombs He raised his left arm and fluttered his right hand under the exposed armpit Ben and Mike laughed a little and Eddie smiled Thunder boomed again close and loud enough this time to make them jump and huddle closer together The wind was picking up rattling trash around in the gutter The first of the dark clouds sailed over the hazy ringed disc of the sun and their shadows melted away The wind was cold chilling the sweat on Eddies uncovered arm He shivered They went down the embankment singlefile except for Bill who stayed with Eddie as he had promised He allowed Richie to push Silver down and when they had reached the bottom Bill put his bike in its accustomed place under the bridge Then they stood together looking around The coming storm did not produce a darkness not even precisely a dimness But the quality of the light had changed and things stood out in a kind of dreamlike steely relief shadowless clear chiselled Eddie felt a sinking of horror and apprehension in his guts as he realized why the quality of this light seemed so familiarit was the same sort of light he remembered from the house at Neibolt Street A streak of lightning tattooed the clouds bright enough to make him wince He put a hand up to his face and found himself counting One two three And then the thunder came in a single coughing bark an explosive sound a sound like an M firecracker and they drew even closer together Wasnt any rain forecast this morning Ben said uneasily The paper said hot and hazy Mike was scanning the sky The clouds up there were blackbottomed keelboats high and heavy swiftly overrunning the blue haze that had covered the sky from horizon to horizon when he and Bill came out of the Denbrough house after lunch Its comin fast he said Never saw a storm come so fast And as if in confirmation thunder whacked again CCCome on Bill said LLets put EhEhEddies Parcheeheesi board in the cluhcluhclubhouse They started along the path they had beaten in the weeks since the incident of the dam Bill and Eddie were at the head of the line their shoulders brushing the broad green leaves of the shrubs the others behind them The wind gusted again making the leaves on the trees and bushes whisper together Farther ahead the bamboo rattled eerily like drums in a jungle tale I thought this was just in the movies but Eddie laughed a little I feel like somebodys watching me Eddie looked around nervously and held his Parcheesi board a link tighter He A gorestreaked apparition stood there and it could only be Henry Bowers Henry looked like a corpse which has returned from the grave Henrys face was a frozen witchdoctors mask of hate and murder His right hand was cocked at cheeklevel and even as Eddies eyes widened and he began to draw in his first shocked breath the hand pistoned forward the switchblade glittering like silk With no thoughtthere was no time if he had stopped to think he would have diedEddie slammed the door closed It struck Henrys forearm deflecting the knifes course so that it swung in a savage sidetoside arc less than an inch from Eddies neck There was a crunch as the door pinched Henrys arm against the jamb Henry uttered a muffled cry His hand opened The knife clattered to the floor Eddie kicked it It skittered under the TV Henry threw his weight against the door He outweighed Eddie by over a hundred pounds and Eddie was driven back like a doll his knees struck the bed and he fell on it Henry came into the room and swept the door shut behind him He twisted the thumbbolt as Eddie sat up wideeyed his throat already starting to whistle Okay fag Henry said His eyes dropped momentarily to the floor hunting for the knife He didnt see it Eddie groped on the nighttable and found one of the two bottles of Perrier water he had ordered earlier that day This was the full one he had drunk the other before going to the library because his nerves were shot and he had a bad case of acidburn Perrier was very good for the digestion As Henry dismissed the knife and started toward him Eddie gripped the green pearshaped bottle by the neck and smashed it on the edge of the nighttable Perrier foamed and fizzed across it flooding out most of the pillbottles that stood there Henrys shut and pants were heavy with blood both fresh and semidried His right hand now hung at a strange angle He made it to the bed and reached for Eddie who still hardly realized what was happening No more than forty seconds had elapsed since he had opened the door Henry grabbed for him Eddie thrust the ragged base of the Perrier bottle at him It ripped into Henrys face pulling open his right cheek in a twisted flap and puncturing Henrys right eye Henry uttered a breathless scream and staggered backward His slit eye leaking whitishyellow fluid hung loosely from its socket His cheek sprayed blood in a gaudy fountain Eddies own cry was louder He got off the bed and went toward Henryto help him perhaps he wasnt really sureand Henry lurched at him again Eddie thrust with the Perrier bottle as if with a fencing sword and this time the jagged points of green glass punched deep into Henrys left hand and sawed at his fingers Fresh blood flowed Henry made a thick grunting noise the sound almost of a man clearing his throat and shoved Eddie with his right hand Eddie flew back and struck the writingdesk His left arm twisted behind him somehow and he fell on it heavily The pain was a sudden sickening flare He felt the bone go along the faultline of that old break and he had to clench his teeth against a scream of agony Henry Bowers was standing over him swaying back and forth His knees buckled His left hand was dripping blood on the front of Eddies robe Eddie had held onto the stump of the Perrier bottle and now as Henrys knees came completely unhinged he got it in front of him jagged base pointing upward the cap braced against his sternum Henry came down like a tree impaling himself on the bottle Eddie felt it shatter in his hand and a fresh bolt of grinding agony shuddered through his left arm which was still trapped under his body Fresh warmth cascaded over him He wasnt sure if this batch was Henrys blood or his Henry twitched like a landed trout His shoes rattled an almost syncopated beat on the carpet Eddie could smell his rotten breath Then Henry stiffened and rolled over The bottle protruded grotesquely from his midsection capped end pointing toward the ceiling as if it had grown there Gug Henry said and said no more He looked up at the ceiling Eddie thought he might be dead Eddie fought off the waves of faintness that wanted to cover him over and drag him down He got to his knees and finally to his feet There was fresh pain as his broken arm swung out in front of him and that cleared his head a little Wheezing fighting for breath he made it to the nighttable He picked his aspirator out of a puddle of carbonated water stuck it in his mouth and triggered it off He shuddered at the taste then gave himself another blast He looked around at the body on the carpetcould that be Henry could it possibly be It was Grown old his crewcut more gray than black his body now fat and white and sluglike it was still Henry And Henry was dead At long last Henry was Gug Henry said and sat up His hands clawed at the air as if for holds which only Henry could see His gouged eye leaked and dribbled its bottom arc now bulged pregnantly down onto his cheek He looked around saw Eddie shrinking back against the wall and tried to get up He opened his mouth and a stream of blood gushed out Henry collapsed again Heart racing Eddie fumbled for the telephone and succeeded only in knocking it off the table and onto the bed He snatched it up and dialed The phone rang again and again and again Come on Eddie thought what are you doing down there jacking off Come on please answer the frigging phone It rang again and again Eddie kept his eyes on Henry expecting him to start trying to gain his feet again at any moment Blood Dear God so much blood Ring Mr Denbroughs room Eddie said Quick as you can With his other ear he was now listening to the rooms around him How loud had they been Was someone going to pound on the door and ask if everything was all right in there You sure you want me to ring the clerk asked Its ten after three Yes do it Eddie nearly screamed The hand holding the phone was trembling in convulsive little bursts There was a nest of waspy rottenugly singing in his other arm Had Henry moved again No surely not There was a click and then the hoarse burr of a roomphone ringing Come on Bill come on c A sudden thought gruesomely plausible occurred to him Suppose Henry had visited Bills room first Or Richies Bens Bevs Or had Henry perhaps paid a visit to the library Surely he had been somewhere else first if someone hadnt softened Henry up it would have been Eddie lying dead on the floor with a switchblade growing out of his chest the way the neck of the Perrier bottle was growing out of Henrys gut Or suppose Henry had visited all the others first catching them bleary and halfasleep as Henry had caught him Suppose they were all dead And that thought was so awful Eddie believed he would soon begin screaming if someone didnt answer the phone in Bills room The phone was picked up and Bills voice uncharacteristically cautious said HHHello Eddie Bills voice grew momentarily fainter speaking to someone else telling the someone who it was Then he was back strong WWhats the muhhatter Eddie Its Henry Bowers Eddie said He looked at the body on the floor again Had it changed position This time it was not so easy to persuade himself it hadnt Bill he came here and I killed him He had a knife I think He lowered his voice I think it was the same knife he had that day When we went into the sewers Do you remember I rrremember Bill said grimly Eddie listen to me I want you to Okay Eddie said and dropped back at once They were approaching the clearing now Thunder rumbled in the overcast sky and the bushes sighed in the rising breeze Ben joined him as they came into the clearing The trapdoor to the clubhouse stood open an improbable square of blackness in the green The sound of the river was very clear and Bill was suddenly struck by a crazy certainty that he was experiencing that sound and this place for the last time in his childhood He drew a deep breath smelling earth and air and the distant sooty dump fuming like a sullen volcano that cannot quite make up its mind to erupt He saw a flock of birds fly off the railroad trestle and toward the Old Cape He looked up at the boiling clouds Why hhhavent they tried to guhguhhet uus Bill asked Theyre ththere EhEhEddie was ruhhight about that I can fuhfuhheel them Yeah Ben said I guess they might be stupid enough to think were going back into the clubhouse Then theyd have us trapped Muhmuhmaybe Bill said and he felt a sudden helpless fury at his stutter which made it impossible for him to talk fast Perhaps they were things he would have found impossible to say anywayhow he felt he could almost see through Henry Bowerss eyes how he felt that although on opposite sides pawns controlled by opposing forces he and Henry had grown very close A chilly explosion of white light seemed to fill his head They would be victims of the killer that had been stalking Derry ever since Georges deathall seven of them Perhaps their bodies would be found perhaps not It all depended on whether or not It could or would protect Henryand to a lesser degree Belch and Victor Yes To the outside to the rest of this town well have been victims of the killer And thats right in a funny sort of way that really is right It wants us dead Henrys the tool to get it done so It doesnt have to come out Me first I thinkBeverly and Richie might be able to hold the others or Mike but Stans scared and sos Ben although I think hes stronger than Stan And Eddies got a broken arm Why did I lead them down here Christ Why did I Bill Ben said anxiously The others joined them beside the clubhouse Thunder whacked again and the bushes began to rustle more urgently The bamboo rattled on in the fading stormy light Shhh The others fell uneasily silent under his blazing haunted eyes He stared at the underbrush at the path twisting away through it and back toward Kansas Street and felt his mind suddenly go up another notch as if to a higher plane There was no stuttering in his mind he felt as if his thoughts had been borne away on a mad flow of intuitionas if everything were coming to him George at one end me and my friends at the other And then it will stop again yes again because this has happened before and there always has to be some sacrifice at the end some terrible thing to stop it I dont know how I can know that but I do and they they They luhluhlet it happen Bill muttered staring wideeyed at the ratty pigtail of path shuhShuhSure they dddo Bill Bev asked pleading Stan stood on one side of her small and neat in a blue polo shirt and chinos Mike stood on the other looking at Bill intensely as if reading his thoughts They let it happen they always do and things quiet down things go on It It sleeps or hibernates like a bear and then it starts again and they know people know they know it has to be so It can be Oh please God oh please God he thrusts his fists please God against the posts let me get this out the posts and still insists oh God oh Christ OH PLEASE LET ME BE ABLE TO TALK I lled you ddown huhhere bbbbbecause nuhnuhnoplace is sssafe Bill said Spittle blabbered from his lips he wiped them with the back of one hand duhDuhDerry is It DDDo you uhuhunderstand mmme He glared at them they drew away a little their eyes shiny almost thanotropic with fright duhherry is IhIhIt EhEhhennyppplace we gggo

fuhhinish wwhat wwwwe stuhharted Beverly saw Mr Ross getting up looking at her folding his paper and simply going into his house They wont see they wont hear they wont know And my father Mike thought of lunch with Bill Bills mother had been off in her own dreamy world seeming not to see either of them reading a Henry James novel while the boys made sandwiches and gobbled them standing at the counter Richie thought of Stans neat but utterly empty house Stan had been a little surprised his mother was almost always home at lunch time On the few occasions when she wasnt she left a note saying where she could be reached But there had been no note today The car was gone and that was all Probably went shopping with her friend Debbie Stan said frowning a little and had set to work making eggsalad sandwiches Richie had forgotten about it Until now Eddie thought of his mother When he had gone out with his Parcheesi board there had been none of the usual cautions Be careful Eddie get under cover if it rains Eddie dont you dare play any rough games Eddie She hadnt asked if he had his aspirator hadnt told him what time to be home hadnt warned him against those rough boys you play with She had simply gone on watching her soapopera story on TV as if he didnt exist A version of the same thought went through all of the boys minds they had at some point between getting up this morning and lunchtime simply become ghosts Bill Stan said harshly if we cut across Through the Old Cape Bill shook his head I dont thuhthuhhink ssso Wed ggget cccaught in the buhbuhbambbboo the quhquhquickmmud or thered bbbe ruhruhreal ppppirahna fuhfuhfish in the KKKenduskeag ooor suhsuhhomething eeelse Each had his or her own different vision of the same end Ben saw bushes which suddenly became maneating plants Beverly saw flying leeches like the ones that had come out of that old refrigerator Stan saw the mucky ground in the bamboo vomiting up the living corpses of children caught in there by the fabled quickmud Mike Hanlon imagined small Jurassic reptiles with horrid sawteeth suddenly boiling out of the cleft of a rotten tree attacking them biting them to pieces Richie saw the Crawling Eye oozing down on top of them as they ran under the railroad trestle And Eddie saw them climbing the Old Cape embankment only to look up and see the leper standing at the top his sagging flesh acrawl with beetles and maggots waiting for them If we could get out of town somehow Richie muttered then winced as thunder shouted a furious negative from the sky More rain fellit was still only squalling but soon it would begin to come down seriously in sheets and torrents The days hazy peace was now utterly gone as if it had never been at all Wed be safe if we could just get out of this fucking town Beverly began Beepb And then a rock came flying out of the shaggy bushes and struck Mike on the side of the head He staggered backward blood flowing through the tight cap of his hair and would have fallen if Bill hadnt caught him Teach you to throw rocks Henrys voice floated mockingly to them Bill could see the others looking around wildeyed ready to bolt in six different directions And if they did that it really would be over Two more rocks flew out of the bushes One struck Stan on the upper thigh He yelled more surprised than hurt Beverly sidestepped the second It struck the ground and rolled through the clubhouse trapdoor DDDo you rrruhremember the fffirst duhday you cccame ddown here Bill shouted over the thunder The dddday schuhhool llet owout Bill thrust a shushing hand at him his eyes remained fixed on Ben pinning him to the spot Sure Ben said miserably trying to look in all directions at once The bushes were now wavering and dancing wildly their motion nearly tidal The druhdruhdrain Bill said The pppumpingstuhhation Thahthats where were suhsuhhupposed to gggo Take us there A fusillade of rocks whizzed out of the bushes and for a moment Bill saw Victor Crisss face somehow frightened drugged and avid all at the same time Then a rock smashed into his cheekbone and it was Mikes turn to keep Bill from falling down For a moment he couldnt see straight His cheek felt numb Then sensation returned in painful throbs and he felt blood running down his face He swiped at his cheek wincing at the painful knob that was rising there looked at the blood wiped it on his jeans His hair whipped wildly in the freshening wind Teach you to throw rocks you stuttering asshole Henry halflaughed halfscreamed TuhTuhTake us Bill yelled He understood now why he had sent Eddie back to get Ben it was that pumpingstation they were supposed to go to that very one and only Ben knew exactly which one it wasthey ran along both banks of the Kenduskeag at irregular intervals Ihihhits the pluhpluhhace The wwway ihin The wuhwuhwuhway to It Ben stood there for a moment wetting his lips looking at Bill Then he struck off across the clearing heading toward the river A brilliant bolt of lightning streaked across the sky purplishwhite followed by a rip of thunder that made Bill reel on his feet A fistsized chunk of rock sailed past his nose and struck Bens buttocks He yipped with pain and his hand went to the spot Yaahfatboy Henry cried in that same halflaughing halfscreaming voice The bushes rustled and crashed and Henry appeared as the rain stopped fooling around and came in a downpour Water ran in Henrys crewcut in his eyebrows down his cheeks His grin showed all his teeth Teach you to throw r Mike had found one of the pieces of scrapwood left over from building the clubhouse roof and now he threw it It flipped over twice and struck Henrys forehead He screamed clapped one hand to the spot like a man whos just had one hell of a good idea and sat down hard More crashings and stumblings in the bushes and as the rest of the Losers ran after Ben Hanscom Victor and Belch appeared Henry stood up and the three of them gave chase Even later when the rest of that day had come back to Ben he recalled only jumbled images of their run through the bushes He remembered branches overloaded with dripping leaves slapping against his face dousing him with cold water he remembered that the thunder and lightning seemed to have become almost constant and he remembered that Henrys screams for them to come back and fight seemed to merge with the sound of the Kenduskeag as they drew closer to it Every time he slowed Bill would whack him on the back to make him hurry up What if I cant find it What if I cant find that particular pumpingstation The breath tore in and out of his lungs hot and bloodytasting in the back of his throat A stitch was sinking into his side His buttocks sang where the rock had hit him Beverly had said Henry and his friends meant to kill them and Ben believed it now yes he did He came to the Kenduskeags bank so suddenly that he nearly plunged over the edge He managed to get his balance and then the embankment undercut by the spring runoff collapsed and he went tumbling over anyway skidding all the way to the edge of the fastrunning water his shirt rucking up in the back clayey mud streaking and sticking to his skin The others burst out of the bushes which overhung the bank one after the other Richie and Eddie were last Richie with one arm slung around Eddies waist his dripping specs clinging precariously to the end of his nose Ben looked first left and then right aware that the time was suicidally short The river seemed higher already and the raindark sky had given it a dangerous slategray color as it boiled its way along Its banks were choked with underbrush and stunted trees all of them now dancing to the winds tune He could hear Eddie sobbing for breath I dont kn he began and then he saw the leaning tree and the eroded cave beneath it That was where he had hidden that first day He had dozed off and when he woke up he had heard Bill and Eddie goofing around Then the big boys had come seen conquered Tata bays it was a real baby dam believe me Lightning flashed again and this time Ben could hear it a buzzing noise like an overloaded Lionel traintransformer It struck the tree and bluewhite electric fire sizzled its gnarly base into splinters and toothpicks sized for a fairytale giant It fell toward the river with a rending crash driving spray high into the air Ben drew in a dismayed gasp and smelled something hot and punky and wild A fireball rolled up the bole of the downed tree seemed to flash brighter and went out Thunder exploded not above them but around them as if they stood in the center of the thunderclap The rain sheeted down Bill thumped him on the back awaking him from his dazed contemplation of these things GuhguhGO Ben went splashing and stumbling along the verge of the river his hair hanging in his eyes He reached the treethe little rootcave beneath it had been obliteratedand climbed over it digging his toes into its wet hide scraping his hands and forearms Bill and Richie manhandled Eddie over and as he stumbled off the treetrunk Ben caught him They both went tumbling to the ground Eddie cried out I guess so Eddie shouted back getting to his feet He fumbled for his aspirator and almost dropped it Ben grabbed it for him and Eddie gave him a grateful look as he stuffed it into his mouth and triggered it Richie came over then Stan and Mike Bill boosted Beverly up onto the tree and Ben and Richie caught her coming down on the far side her hair plastered to her head her blue jeans now black Bill came last pulling himself onto the trunk and swinging his legs around He saw Henry and the other two splashing down the river toward them and as he slid off the fallen tree he shouted Ruhruhrocks Throw rocks There were plenty of them here on the bank and the lightningstruck tree made a perfect barricade In a moment or two all seven of them were chucking rocks at Henry and his pals They had nearly reached the tree the range was pointblank They were driven back yelling with pain and fury as rocks struck their faces their chests their arms and legs Teach us to throw rocks Richie shouted and chucked one the size of a hens egg at Victor It struck his shoulder and bounced almost straight up into the air Victor howled Ah say Ah say go on an teach us boy We learn good Yeeeehaaaah Mike screamed How do you like it How do you like it The answer was not much They retreated until they were out of range and huddled together A moment later they climbed the bank slipping and stumbling on the slick wet earth which was already honeycombed with little running streamlets holding onto branches to stay upright Theyre gonna go around us Big Bill Richie said pushing his glasses up on his nose Ben trotted along the embankment paused expecting that Henry and the others would burst out into his face at any moment and saw the pumpingstation twenty yards farther down the streambed The others followed him to it They could see other cylinders on the opposite bank one fairly close the other forty yards upstream Those two were both shooting torrents of muddy water into the Kenduskeag but only a trickle was coming from the pipe sticking out of the embankment below this one It wasnt humming either Ben noticed The pumping machinery had broken down Bill was looking at Richie Stan and Mike WWWe gguhhotta get the lllid ohohoff he said HHHelp mmme There were handholds in the iron but the rain had made them slippery and the lid itself was incredibly heavy Ben moved in next to Bill and Bill shifted his hands a little to make room Ben could hear water dripping insidean echoey unpleasant sound like water dripping into a well NuhnuhNOW Bill shouted and the five of them heaved in unison The lid moved with an ugly grating sound Beverly grabbed on beside Richie and Eddie pushed with his good arm One two three push Richie chanted The lid grated a little farther off the top of the cylinder Now a crescent of darkness showed Ben shoved until red spots danced in front of his eyes They stood away and watched as the big circular cap overbalanced then fell It dug a slash in the wet earth and landed upside down like an oversized checker Beetles scurried off its surface and into the matted grass Bill peered inside Iron rungs descended to a circular pool of black water its surface now pocked with raindrops The silent pump brooded in the middle of this halfsubmerged He could see water flowing into the pumpingstation from the mouth of its inflow pipe and with a sinking in his guts he thought Thats where we have to go In there Like a puhpuhpiggerback Hold on with yyour gggood ahaharm He demonstrated Eddie grabbed on around Bills neck Stan and Mike boosted him up so he could hook his legs around Bills midsection As Bill swung clumsily over the lip of the cylinder Ben saw that Eddies eyes were tightly shut Over the rain he could hear another sound whipping branches snapping twigs voices Henry Victor and Belch The worlds ugliest cavalry charge Bill gripped the rough concrete lip of the cylinder and felt his way down step by careful step The iron rungs were slippery Eddie had him in what was almost a deathgrip and Bill supposed he was getting a pretty graphic demonstration of what Eddies asthma was really all about He let go of the concrete rim and grabbed the topmost rung Although Eddie was nearly choking him and felt as if he had already gained forty pounds Bill paused a moment looking at the Barrens the Kenduskeag the racing clouds A voice insidenot a frightened voice just a firm onehad told him to take a good look in case he never saw the upper world again So he looked then began to descend with Eddie clinging to his back One of his feet went into chilly water He felt for the next rung and found it There was another below that and then the ladder ended He was standing in kneedeep water beside the pump He squatted wincing as the cold water soaked his pants and let Eddie off He drew a deep breath The smell wasnt so hot but it was great not to have Eddies arm wrapped around his throat He looked up at the cylinders mouth It was about ten feet over his head The others were grouped around the rim looking down CCCome on he shouted Wuhone at a tttime Be quick Beverly came first swinging easily over the rim and grabbing the ladder and Stan next The others followed Richie came last pausing to listen to the progress of Henry and friends He thought from the sound of their blundering progress that they would probably pass a little to the left of this pumpingstation but almost certainly not by enough to make a difference Richie looked around and saw them rushing toward him Victor was in the lead and then Henry pushed him aside so savagely that Victor skidded to his knees Henry had a knife all right a regular pigsticker Drops of water were falling from the blade Richie glanced into the cylinder saw Ben and Stan helping Mike off the ladder and swung over himself Henry understood what he was doing and screamed at him Richie laughing crazily slammed his left hand in the crook of his right elbow and stuck his forearm skyward his hand fisted in what may be the worlds oldest gesture To be sure Henry got the point he popped his middle finger up Prove it Richie shouted laughing He was terrified of going into this concrete throat but he still couldnt stop laughing And in his Irish Cops Voice he bugled sure an begorrah the luck of the Irish never runs out me foine lad Henry slipped on the wet grass and went sprawling on his butt less than twenty feet from where Richie stood his feet on the top rung of the ladder bolted to the inner curve of the pumpingstation his head and chest out Hey bananaheels Richie shouted delirious with triumph and then scooted down the ladder The iron rungs were slick and once he almost fell Then Bill and Mike grabbed him and he was standing up to his knees in water with the rest of them in a loose circle around the pump He was trembling all over he felt hot and cold chills chasing each other up his back and still he couldnt stop laughing You should have seen him Big Bill clumsy as ever still cant get out of his own frockin way Henrys head appeared in the circular opening at the top Scratches from branches and brambles crisscrossed his cheeks His mouth was working and his eyes blazed Okay he shouted down at them His words had a flat resonance inside the concrete cylinder not quite an echo Here I come Got you now He swung one leg over felt for the topmost rung with his foot found it swung the other one over Speaking loud Bill said WWhen hhhe guhgets dddown cluhhose eeenough wwwe all gruhgruhgrab hhim PPPull hhim dddown DuhDuhDuck him uhunder GGGot iit Righto guvnor Richie said and snapped a salute with one trembling hand Stan tipped a wink at Eddie who didnt understand what was going onexcept it seemed to him that Richie had gone crazy He was laughing like a loon while Henry Bowersthe dreaded Henry Bowersprepared to come down and kill them all like rats in a rainbarrel Henry froze three rungs down He looked down at the Losers over his shoulder His face seemed for the first time doubtful Eddie suddenly got it If they came down they would have to come one at a time It was too high to jump especially with the pumping machinery to land on and here they were the seven of them waiting in a tight little circle Cuhcuhhome ohon HHenry Bill said pleasantly Wuhwuhwhat are you wwwaiting for Thats right Richie chimed in You like to beat up little kids right Come on Henry Were waiting Henry Bev said sweetly I dont think youll like it when you get down here but come on if you want to Unless youre chicken Ben added He began to make chicken sounds Richie joined him at once and soon all of them were doing it The derisive clucking rebounded between the damp trickling walls Henry looked down at them the knife clutched in his left hand his face the color of old bricks He put up with perhaps thirty seconds of it and then climbed out again The Losers sent up catcalls and insults OOOkay Bill said He spoke in a lower voice WWe gungot to get ihihinto that druhhain Quhquhquick Why Beverly asked but Bill was spared the effort of an answer Henry reappeared at the rim of the pumpingstation and dropped a rock the size of a soccer ball into the pipe Beverly screamed and Stan pulled Eddie against the circular wall with a hoarse yell The rock struck the pumping machinerys rusty housing and produced a musical bonggg It ricocheted left and struck the concrete wall missing Eddie by less than half a foot A chip of concrete flicked painfully against his cheek The rock fell into the water with a splash Quhquhquick Bill shouted again and they crowded around the pumpingstations inflow pipe Its bore was about five feet in diameter Bill sent them in one after another a vague circus imageall the big clowns coming out of the little carpassed across his consciousness in a meteoric flash years later he would use the same image in a book called The Black Rapids and climbed in last after ducking another rock As they watched more rocks flew down most striking the pump housing and rebounding at crazy angles When they stopped falling Bill looked out and saw Henry coming down the ladder again as quick as he could GGGet hhhim he shouted to the others Richie Ben and Mike floundered out behind Bill Richie leaped high and grabbed Henrys ankle Henry cursed and shook his leg as if trying to kick away a small dog with big teetha terrier perhaps or a Pekinese Richie grabbed a rung scrabbled up even higher and actually did manage to sink his teeth into Henrys ankle Henry screamed and pulled himself up quickly One of his loafers came off and splashed into the water where it sank with no ado at all Yeah good thing I had a tetanus shot this spring Richie flung at him Bash them Henry was raving Bash them bomb them back to the stone age bash their brains in More rocks flew The boys backed into the drain again quickly Mike was struck on the arm by a small rock and he held it tight wincing until the pain began to abate Its a standoff Ben said They cant get down and we cant get up Were not ssupposed to get up Bill said quietly and yyyou all know it WWere nuhhot eever supposed to ggget up aagain They looked at him their eyes hurt and afraid No one said anything Henrys voice fury masquerading as mockery floated down We can wait up here all day you guys Beverly had turned away and was looking back along the bore of the inflow pipe The light grew diffuse quickly and she could not see much What she could see was a concrete tunnel its lower third filled with rushing water It was higher on her now than it had been when they first squeezed in here she realized that would be because this pump wasnt working and only some of the water was exiting on the Kenduskeag side She felt claustrophobia touch her throat turning the skin there to something that felt like flannel If the water rose enough they would drown He shrugged It said everything Yeah they had to what else was there Be killed by Henry Victor and Belch in the Barrens Or by something elsemaybe something worsein town She understood his thought well enough now there was no stutter in his shrug Better for them to go to It Have it out like the showdown in a Western movie Cleaner Braver Richie said What was that ritual you told us about Big Bill The one in the library book Chud Richie nodded You bite Its tongue and It bites yours right Funny Richie said looking into the dark pipe I cant think of a single one Me either Ben said The fear was heavy in his chest almost suffocating He felt that the only thing keeping him from just sitting down in the water and blubbering like a babyor just going crazywas Bills calm sure presence and Beverly He felt he would rather die than show Beverly how afraid he was Well know when were getting close Richie said suddenly He drew a deep trembling breath If we have to do it then lets go Bill nodded Ill be fffirst Then EhEddie BBBen Bev Stuhhan the MMMan MMMike You luhlast RihRichie EEveryone kkkeep one hhhand on the shuhhoulder of the ppperson in fruhfruhfront of yyyou Its gonna be ddark They formed up like a procession of blindmen Bill looked back once confirming that each had a hand on the shoulder of the person ahead Then bending forward slightly against the rush of the current Bill Denbrough led his friends into the dark where the boat he had made for his brother had gone almost a year before Tom Rogan was having one fuck of a crazy dream In it he was killing his father Part of his mind understood how crazy this was his father had died when Tom was only in the third grade Well maybe died wasnt such a good word Maybe committed suicide was actually the truth Ralph Rogan had made himself a ginandlye cocktail One for the road you might say Tom had been put in nominal charge of his brother and sisters and then he began to receive whuppins if anything went wrong with them So he couldnt have killed his father except there he was in this frightening dream holding what looked like a harmless handle of some sort to his fathers neck only it wasnt really harmless was it There was a button in the end of the handle and if he pushed it a blade would pop out and go right through his fathers neck Im not going to do anything like that Daddy dont worry his dreaming mind thought just before his finger jammed down on the button and the blade popped out His fathers sleeping eyes opened and stared up at the ceiling his fathers mouth opened and a bloody gargling sound came out Daddy I didnt do it his mind screamed Someone else He struggled to wake up and couldnt The best he could do and it turned out to be not very good at all was to fade into a new dream In this one he was splashing and slogging his way down a long dark tunnel His balls hurt and his face stung because it was crisscrossed with scratches There were others with him but he could only make out vague shapes It didnt matter anyway What mattered were the kids somewhere up ahead They needed to pay They needed Whatever purgatory this was it was a smelly one Water dripped and echoed His shoes and pants were soaked The little shitpots were somewhere up ahead in this maze of tunnels and perhaps they thought Tom and his friends would get lost but the joke was on them because he had another friend oh yes a special friend and this friend had marked the path they were to take with with thingamajigs that were big and round and somehow lighted from within so that they shed a glow like that which falls mysteriously from oldfashioned streetlamps One of these balloons floated and drifted at each intersection and on the side of each was an arrow pointing the way into the tunnelbranch he and his unseen friends were to take And it was the right path oh yes he could hear the others ahead their splashing progress echoing back the distorted murmurs of their voices They were getting closer catching up And when they did Tom looked down and saw that he still had the switchknife in his hand For a moment he was frightenedthis was like one of those crazy astral experiences he sometimes read about in the weekly tabloids when your spirit left your body and entered someone elses The shape of his body felt different to him as if he were not Tom but someone else someone younger He began to fight his way out of the dream panicked and then a voice was talking to him a soothing voice whispering in his ear It doesnt matter when this is and it doesnt matter who you are What matters is that Beverly is up there shes with them my good friend and do you know what Shes been doing something one hell of a lot worse than sneaking smokes You know what Shes been fucking her old friend Bill Denbrough Yes indeed She and that stuttering freak going right at it They But he knew it was no lie She had used a belt on his balls and run off and she now had cheated on him the slutty little roundheels bitch had actually cheated on him and oh dear friends oh good neighbors she was going to get the whuppin of all whuppinsfirst her and then Denbrough her novelwriting friend And anyone who tried to get in his way you could count them in for a piece of the action too He stepped up his pace although the breath was already whistling in and out of his throat Up ahead he could see another luminous circle bobbing in the darknessanother MoonBalloon He could hear the voices of the people ahead of him and the fact that they were childish voices no longer bothered him It was as the voice said it didnt matter where when or who Beverly was up there and oh dear friends oh good neighbors Come on you guys move your asses he said and it didnt even matter that his voice wasnt his own but the voice of a boy Then as they approached the MoonBalloon he looked around and saw his companions for the first time Both of them were dead One was headless The face of the other had been split open as if by a great talon Were moving as fast as we can Henry the boy with the split face said and his lips moved in two pieces grotesquely out of sync with each other and that was when Tom shrieked the dream to pieces and came back to himself tottering on the brink of what felt like some great empty space He struggled to keep his balance lost it and tumbled to the floor The floor was carpeted but the fall still sent a sickening burst of pain through his hurt knee and he Stifled another cry against his forearm He became aware of a faint but clear white light and for a frightening moment he thought he was back in the dream again that it was light cast by one of those crazy balloons Then he remembered leaving the bathroom door partially open and the fluorescent light in there on He always left the light on when staying in a strange place it saved you barking your shins if you had to get up in the night to pee That clicked reality into place It had been a dream all some crazy dream He was in a Holiday Inn This was Derry Maine He had chased his wife here and in the middle of a crazy nightmare he had fallen out of bed That was all that was the long and the short of it He jumped as if the words had been spoken beside his ear instead of inside his own mind It didnt seem like his own interior voice at allit was cold alien but somehow hypnotic and believable He got up slowly fumbled a glass of water off the table beside the bed and drank it down He ran shaky hands through his hair The clock on the table said ten past three That alien voice answered But there will be people around in the morningtoo many people And besides you can beat them down there this time This time you can be first Down there He thought of his dream the water the dripping dark The light suddenly seemed brighter He turned his head not wanting to but helpless to stop A groan slipped out of his mouth A balloon was tied to the knob of the bathroom door It floated at the end of a string about three feet long The balloon glowed full of a ghostly white light it looked like a willothewisp glimpsed in a swamp floating dreamily between trees overhung with gray ropes of moss An arrow was printed on the balloons gently bulging skin an arrow that was bloodscarlet It was pointing at the door leading out into the hall It doesnt really matter who I am the voice said soothingly and Tom realized now that it wasnt coming from either his own head or from beside his ear it was coming from the balloon from the center of that strange lovely white light All that matters is that I am going to see that everything turns out to your satisfaction Tom I want to see her take a whuppin I want to see them all take a whuppin Theyve crossed my path once too often and much too late in the day for them So listen Tom Listen very carefully All together now follow the bouncing ball When it was done it popped in one final flash of light and Tom began to dress She awoke with a start sitting boltupright in bed the sheet pulled around her waist her small breasts moving with her quick agitated breathing Like Toms her dreaming had been a jumbled distressful experience Like Tom she had had the sensation of being someone elseor rather of having her own consciousness deposited and partially submerged in another body and another mind She had been in a dark place with a number of others around her and she had been aware of an oppressive sensation of dangerthey were going into the danger deliberately and she wanted to scream at them to stop to explain to her what was happening but the person with whom she had merged seemed to know and to believe it was necessary She was also aware that they were being chased and that their pursuers were catching up little by little Bill had been in the dream but his story about how he had forgotten his childhood must have been on her mind because in her dream Bill was only a boy ten or twelve years oldhe still had all his hair She was holding his hand and was dimly aware that she loved him very much and that her willingness to go on was based on the rocksolid belief that Bill would protect her and all of them that Bill Big Bill would somehow bring them through this and back into the daylight again They came to a branching of many tunnels and Bill stood there looking from one to the next and one of the othersa boy with his arm in a cast which glimmered a ghostlywhite in the darknessspoke up That one Bill The bottom one And so they had gone that way and then there had been a door a wee wooden door no more than three feet high the sort of door you might see in a fairytale book and there had been a mark on the door She could not remember what that mark had been what strange rune or symbol But it had brought all her terror to a focusingpoint and she had yanked herself out of that other body that girls body whoever she might have been She awoke boltupright in a strange bed sweaty wideeyed gasping as if she had just run a race Her hands flew to her legs halfexpecting to find them wet and cold with the water she had been walking through in her head But she was dry Disorientation followedthis was not their home in Topanga Canyon or the rented house in Fleet It was noplacelimbo furnished with a bed a dresser two chairs and a TV She scrubbed her hands viciously across her face and that sickening feeling of mental vertigo receded She was in Derry Derry Maine where her husband had grown through a childhood he claimed no longer to remember Not a familiar place to her or a particularly good place by its feel but at least a known place She was here because Bill was here and she would see him tomorrow at the Derry Town House Whatever terrible thing was wrong here whatever those new scars on his hands meant they would face it together She would call him tell him she was here then join him After that well Actually she had no idea what came after that The vertigo that sense of being in a place that was really noplace was threatening again When she was nineteen she had done a whistlestop tour with a scraggy little production company forty notsowonderful performances of Arsenic and Old Lace in forty notsowonderful towns and small cities All of this in fortyseven notsowonderful days They began at the Peabody Dinner Theater in Massachusetts and ended at Play It Again Sam in Sausalito And somewhere in between in some Midwestern town like Ames Iowa or Grand Isle Nebraska or maybe Jubilee North Dakota she had awakened like this in the middle of the night panicked by disorientation unsure what town she was in what day it was or why she was wherever she was Even her name seemed unreal to her That feeling was back now Her bad dreams had carried over into her waking and she felt a nightmarish freefloating terror The town seemed to have wrapped itself around her like a python She could sense it and the feelings it produced were not good She found herself wishing that she had heeded Freddies advice and stayed away Her mind fixed on Bill grasping at the thought of him the way a drowning woman would grip at a spar a lifepreserver anything that A chill raced through her and she crisscrossed her arms across her naked breasts She shivered and saw goosebumps ripple their way up her flesh For a moment it seemed to her that a voice had spoken aloud but inside her head As if there was an alien presence in there No her mind responded Its just disorientation jetlag worry over your man Nobodys talking inside your head Nobody We all float down here Audra a voice said from the bathroom It was a real voice real as houses And sly Sly and duty and evil Youll float too The voice uttered a fruity little giggle that dropped in pitch until it sounded like a clogged drain bubbling thickly Audra cried out then pressed her hands against her mouth She said it out loud daring the voice to contradict her It didnt The room was silent Somewhere far away a train whistled in the night Suddenly she needed Bill so badly that waiting until daylight seemed impossible She was in a standardized motel room exactly like the other thirtynine units in the place but suddenly it was too much Everything When you started hearing voices it was just too much Too creepy She seemed to be slipping back into the nightmare shed so lately escaped She felt scared and terribly alone Its worse than that she thought I feel dead Her heart suddenly skipped two beats in her chest making her gasp and utter a startled cough She felt an instant of prisonpanic claustrophobia inside her own body and wondered if all this terror didnt have a stupidly ordinary physical root after all maybe she was going to have a heart attack Or was already having one Audra turned on the light by the bedtable and looked at her watch Twelve past three He would be sleeping but that didnt matter to her nownothing mattered except hearing his voice She wanted to finish the night with him If Bill was beside her her clockwork would fall in sync with his and settle down The nightmares would stay away He sold nightmares to othersthat was his tradebut to her he had never given anything but peace Outside that odd cold nut imbedded in his imagination peace seemed to be all he was made for or meant for She got the Yellow Pages found the number for the Derry Town House and dialed it Does that guy ever get any calls in the daytime the clerk said and before she could think to ask what that was supposed to mean he had plugged her call through The phone burred once twice three times She could imagine him sleeping with everything under the covers except the top of his head she could imagine one hand coming out feeling for the phone She had seen him do it before and a fond little smile touched her lips It faded as the phone rang a fourth time and a fifth and a sixth Halfway through the seventh ring the connection was broken No shit Sherlock Audra said more upset and frightened than ever Are you sure you rang the right room Ayup the clerk said Mr Denbrough had an interroom call not five minutes ago I know he answered that one because the light stayed on the switchboard a minute or two He must have gone to the persons room She dropped the phone back into its cradle A queer disheartening certainty came to her It was a woman Some woman had called him and he had gone to her Well what now Audra How do we handle this She felt tears threaten They stung her eyes and her nose she could feel the lump of a sob in the back of her throat No anger at least not yet only a sick sense of loss and abandonment Audra get hold of yourself Youre jumping to conclusions Its the middle of the night and you had a bad dream and now youve got Bill with some other woman But it aint necessarily so What youre going to do is sit upyoull never get back to sleep now anyway Turn on some lights and finish the novel you brought to read on the plane Remember what Bill says Finest kind of dope BookValium No more heebiejeebies No more whimwhams and hearing voices Dorothy Sayers and Lord Peter thats the ticket The Nine Tailors Thatll take you through to dawn Thatll The bathroom light suddenly went on she could see it under the door Then the latch clicked and the door juddered open She stared at this eyes widening arms instinctively crossing over her breasts again Her heart began to slam against her ribcage and the sour taste of adrenaline flooded her mouth That voice low and dragging said We all float down here Audra The last word became a long low fading screamAudraaaaathat ended once again in that sick clogged bubbly sound that was so much like laughter Whos there she cried backing away That wasnt my imagination no way youre not going to tell me that The TV clicked on She whirled around and saw a clown in a silvery suit with big orange buttons capering around on the screen There were black sockets where its eyes should have been and when its madeup lips stretched even wider in a grin she saw teeth like razors It held up a dripping severed head Its eyes were turned up to the whites and the mouth sagged open but she could see well enough that it was Freddie Firestones head The clown laughed and danced It swung the head around and drops of blood splashed against the inside of the TV screen She could hear them sizzling in there Audra tried to scream and nothing came out but a little whine She grabbed blindly for the dress lying over the back of the chair and for her purse She bolted into the hall and slammed the door behind her gasping her face paperwhite She dropped the purse between her feet and slipped the dress over her head Float a low chuckling voice said from behind her and she felt a cold finger caress her bare heel She uttered another high outofbreath scream and danced away from the door White corpsefingers were seeking back and forth under it the nails peeled away to show purplishwhite bloodless quicks They made hoarse whispering noises on the rough nap of the hall carpet Audra snagged the strap of her purse and ran barefooted for the door at the end of the corridor She was in a blind panic now her only thought that she had to find the Derry Town House and Bill It didnt matter if he was in bed with enough other women to make up a harem She would find him and get him to take her away from whatever unspeakable thing there was in this town She fled down the walkway and into the parkinglot looking around wildly for her car For a moment her mind froze and she couldnt even remember what she had been driving Then it came Datsun tobaccobrown She spotted it standing hubcapdeep in the still curdled groundmist and hurried over to it She couldnt find the keys in her purse She swept through it with steadily increasing panic shuffling Kleenex cosmetics change sunglasses and sticks of gum into a meaningless jumble She didnt notice the battered LTD wagon parked nosetonose with her rented car or the man sitting behind the wheel She didnt notice when the LTDs door opened and the man got out she was trying to cope with the growing certainty that she had left the Datsuns keys in the room She couldnt go back in there she couldnt Her fingers touched hard serrated metal under a box of Altoid mints and she seized at it with a little cry of triumph For a terrible moment she thought it might be the key to their Rover now sitting in the Fleet railway stations carpark three thousand miles away and then she felt the lucite rentalcar tab She fumbled the key into the doorlock breathing in harsh little gasps and turned it That was when a hand fell on her shoulder and she screamed screamed loudly this time Somewhere a dog barked in answer but that was all The hand as hard as steel bit cruelly in and forced her around The face she saw looming over hers was puffed and lumpy The eyes glittered When the swelled lips spread in a grotesque smile she saw that some of the mans front teeth had been broken The stumps looked jagged and savage She tried to speak and could not The hand squeezed tighter digging in Beverly and Bill dressed quickly without speaking and went up to Eddies room On their way to the elevator they heard a phonebell begin somewhere behind them It was muffled a somewhereelse sound CCould have bbbeen he said One of the uhothers ccalling muhhaybe He punched the UP button Eddie opened the door for them his face white and strained His left arm was at an angle both peculiar and weirdly evocative of old times Im okay he said I took two Darvon Pains not bad right now But it was clearly not good either His lips pressed so tightly together they had almost disappeared were purple with shock Bill looked past him and saw the body on the floor One look was enough to satisfy him of two thingsit was Henry Bowers and he was dead He moved past Eddie and knelt by the body The neck of a Perrier bottle had been driven into Henrys midsection pulling the tatters of his shirt in after it Henrys eyes were halfopen glazed His mouth filled with coagulating blood snarled His hands were claws A shadow fell over him and Bill looked up It was Beverly She looked down at Henry with no expression at all She nodded He doesnt look old You know that Bill He doesnt look old at all Abruptly she looked back at Eddie who was sitting on the bed Eddie looked old old and haggard His arm lay in his lap useless Weve got to call the doctor for Eddie Its the same as luhluhlast tttime Bill said He got to his feet and held her by the arms looking into her face Once we ggo outside once wwwe ihinvvholve the tttown Theyll arrest me for murder Eddie said dully Or theyll arrest all of us Or theyll detain us Or something Then therell be an accident One of the special accidents that only happen in Derry Maybe theyll stick us in jail and a deputy sheriff will go berserk and shoot us all Maybe well all die of ptomaine or decide to hang ourselves in our cells But were grownups now Surely you dont think I mean he came here in the middle of the night attacked you She looked around didnt see it and dropped on her knees to look under the bed Dont bother Eddie said in that same faint whistly voice I slammed the door on his arm when he tried to stick me with it He dropped it and I kicked it under the TV Its gone now I already looked BBBeheverly ccall the others Bill said I can spuhsplint EEEddies arm I thhink She looked at him for a long moment then she looked down at the body on the floor again She thought that the picture this room presented should tell a perfectly clear story to any policeman with half a brain The place was a mess Eddies arm was broken This man was dead It was a clear case of selfdefense against a nightprowler And then she remembered Mr Ross Mr Ross getting up and looking and then simply folding his newspaper and going back into the house That made her remember Bill as a kid his face white and tired and halfcrazy Bill saying Derry is It Do you understand me Any place we go when It gets us they wont see they wont hear they wont know Dont you see how it is All we can do is to try and finish what we started Standing here now looking down at Henrys corpse Beverly thought Theyre both saying weve all become ghosts again That its started to repeat All of it As a kid I could accept that because kids almost are ghosts But He was sitting on the bed with Eddie gently touching his arm AAArent yyou he asked After aaall thats huhhappened ttoday Yes All that had happened The gruesome mess at the end of their reunion The beautiful old woman who had turned into a crone before her eyes the round of stories at the library tonight with the accompanying phenomena All of those things And still her mind shouted at her desperately to stop this now to spike it with sanity because if she did not they were surely going to finish up this night by going down to the Barrens and finding a certain pumpingstation and I dont know she said I just I dont know Even after everything thats happened Bill it seems to me that we could call the police Maybe CCCall the uhothers he said again Well sssee what they ththink She called Richie first then Ben Both agreed to come right away Neither asked what had happened She found Mikes telephone number in the book and dialed it There was no answer after a dozen rings she hung up TTTry the luhluhhibrary Bill said He had taken the short curtain rods down from the smaller of the two windows in Eddies room and was binding them firmly to Eddies arm with the belt of his bathrobe and the drawstring from his pyjamas Before she could find the number there was a knock at the door Ben and Richie had arrived together Ben in jeans and an untucked shirt Richie in a pair of smart gray cotton trousers and his pyjama top His eyes looked warily around the room from behind his glasses Oh my God Ben cried He had seen Henry on the floor Ben took three steps toward the corpse and then stopped as if afraid it might bite him He looked helplessly at Bill YYYou ttell he said to Eddie GGGoddam stuhhuhhutter is ggetting wuhwuhworse all the tttime Eddie sketched in what had happened while Beverly hunted up the number for the Derry Public Library and called it She expected that perhaps Mike had fallen asleep therehe might even have a bunk in his office What she did not expect was what happened the phone was picked up on the second ring and a voice she had never heard before said hello Hello she answered looking toward the others and making a shushing gesture with one hand Is Mr Hanlon there She wet her lips with her tongue Bill was looking at her piercingly Ben and Richie had looked around The beginnings of real alarm stirred inside her Im Derry Chief of Police Andrew Rademacher the voice said Mr Hanlon is at the Derry Home Hospital right now He was assaulted and badly wounded a short time ago Now who are you please I want your name But she barely heard this last Waves of shock rode through her lifting her dizzily up and up outside of herself The muscles in her stomach and legs and crotch all went loose and numb and she thought in a detached way This must be how it happens when people get so scared they wet their pants Sure You just lose control of those muscles How badly has he been hurt she heard herself asking in a papery voice and then Bill was beside her his hand on her shoulder and Ben was there and Richie and she felt such a rush of gratitude for them She held her free hand out and Bill took it Richie placed his hand over Bills and Ben put his over Richies Eddie had come over and now he put his good hand on top I want your name please Rademacher said briskly and for a moment the skittering little craven inside of her the one that had been bred by her father and cared for by her husband almost answered Im Beverly Marsh and Im at the Derry Town House Please send Mr Nell over Theres a dead man here whos still half a boy and were all very frightened She said I Im afraid I cant tell you Not just yet Nothing she said shocked What makes you think I do Jesus Christ You just make a habit of calling the library every morning about threethirty Rademacher said is that it Can the bullshit young lady This is assault and the way the guy looks it could be murder by the time the sun comes up Ill ask you again who are you and how much do you know about this Closing her eyes gripping Bills hand with all her strength she asked again He might die Youre not just saying that to scare me He really might die Please tell me Hes very badly hurt And if that doesnt scare you miss it ought to Now I want to know who you are and why As if in a dream she watched her hand float through space and drop the phone back into the cradle She looked over at Henry and felt shock as keen as a slap from a cold hand One of Henrys eyes had closed The other one the shattered one oozed as nakedly as before Richie called the hospital Bill led Beverly over to the bed where she sat with Eddie looking off into space She thought she would cry but no tears came The only feeling she was strongly and immediately aware of was a wish that someone would cover Henry Bowers That winky look was really not cool at all In one giddy instant Richie became a reporter from the Derry News He understood that Mr Michael Hanlon the towns head librarian had been assaulted while working late Did the hospital have any word on Mr Hanlons condition I understand Mr Kerpaskiando you spell that with two ks You do Okay And you are He listened now enough into his own fiction to make doodling motions with one finger as if writing on a pad Uhhuh uhhuh yes Yes I understand Well what we usually do in cases like this is to quote you as a source Then later on we can uhhuh right Just right Richie laughed heartily and armed a film of sweat from his forehead He listened again Okay Mr Kerpaskian Yes Ill yes I got it KERPASKIAN right CzechJewish is it Really Thats thats most unusual Yes I will Goodnight Thank you He hung up and closed his eyes Jesus he cried in a thick low voice Jesus Jesus Jesus He made as if to shove the phone off the table and then simply let his hand fall He took his glasses off and wiped them on his pyjama top Hes alive but in grave condition he told the others Henry sliced him up like a Christmas turkey One of the cuts chopped into his femoral artery and hes lost all the blood a man can and still stay alive Mike managed to get some kind of tourniquet on it or he would have been dead when they found him Beverly began to cry She did it like a child with both hands plastered to her face For a little while her hitching sobs and the rapid whistle of Eddies breathing were the only sounds in the room Mike wasnt the only one who got sliced up like a Christmas turkey Eddie said at last Henry looked like he just went twelve rounds with Rocky Balboa in a Cuisinart There were Kleenex on the nighttable but they were a caked and sodden mass in the middle of a puddle of Perrier She went into the bathroom making a wide circle around Henry got a washcloth and ran cool water on it It felt delicious against her hot puffy face She felt that she could think clearly againnot rationally but clearly She was suddenly sure that rationality would kill them if they tried to use it now That cop Rademacher He had been suspicious Why not People didnt call the library at threethirty in the morning He had assumed some guilty knowledge What would he assume if he found out that she had called him from a room where there was a dead man on the floor with a jagged bottleneck planted in his guts That she and four other strangers had just come into town the day before for a little reunion and this guy just happened to drop by Would she buy the tale if the shoe were on the other foot Would anyone Of course they could buttress their tale by adding that they had come back to finish the monster that lived in the drains under the city That would certainly add a convincing note of gritty realism She came out of the bathroom and looked at Bill No she said I dont want to go to the police I think Eddies rightsomething might happen to us Something final But that isnt the real reason She looked at the four of them We swore it she said We swore Bills brother Stan all the others and now Mike Im ready Bill Ben said The odds look worse than ever Were two short now Eddie smiled wanly I guess I get another piggerback down that ladder huh If the ladders still there No one throwing rocks this time though Beverly said Theyre dead All three of them You guys are still the best friends I ever had Ben said No matter how this turns out I just you know wanted to tell you that He looked around at them and they looked solemnly back at him Im glad I remembered you he added Richie snorted Beverly giggled Then they were all laughing looking at each other in the old way in spite of the fact that Mike was in the hospital perhaps dying or already dead in spite of the fact that Eddies arm was broken again in spite of the fact that it was the deepest ditch of the morning Haystack you have such a way with words Richie said laughing and wiping his eyes He should have been the writer Big Bill They took Eddies borrowed limo Richie drove The groundfog was thicker now drifting through the streets like cigarette smoke not quite reaching the hooded streetlamps The stars overhead were bright chips of ice spring stars but by cocking his head to the halfopen window on the passenger side Bill thought he could hear summer thunder in the distance Ram was being ordered up somewhere over the horizon Richie turned on the radio and there was Gene Vincent singing BeBopALula He hit one of the other buttons and got Buddy Holly A third punch brought Eddie Cochran singing summertime Blues Id like to help you son but youre too young to vote a deep voice said He reached for it and then his hand froze stay tuned for more of the Richie Tozier AllDead Rock Show the clowns laughing screaming voice cried over the fingerpops and guitarchops of the Eddie Cochran tune dont touch that dial keep it tuned to the rockpile theyre gone from the charts but not from our hearts and you keep coming come right along come on everybody We play aaaalll the hits down here Aaallllll the hits And if you dont believe me just listen to this mornings graveyardshift guest deejay Georgie Denbrough Tell em Georgie You sent me out and It killed me I thought It was in the cellar Big Bill I thought It was in the cellar but It was in the drain It was in the drain and It killed me you let It kill me Big Bill you let It Richie snapped the radio off so hard the knob spun away and hit the floormat Rock and roll in the sticks really sucks he said His voice was not quite steady Bevs right well leave it off what do you say No one replied Bills face was pale and still and thoughtful under the glow of the passing streetlamps and when the thunder muttered again in the west they all heard it Richie parked beside it and they got out and moved to the railingsame old railingand looked down It seemed untouched by the last twentyseven years to Bill the turnpike overpass which was the only new feature looked unreal something as ephemeral as a matte painting or a rearscreen projection effect in a movie Cruddy little trees and scrub bushes glimmered in the twining fog and Bill thought I guess this is what we mean when we talk about the persistence of memory this or something like this something you see at the right time and from the right angle image that kicks off emotion like a jet engine You see it so clear that all the things which happened in between are gone If desire is what closes the circle between world and want then the circle has closed CuhCuhCome on he said and climbed over the railing They followed him down the embankment in a scatter of scree and pebbles When they reached the bottom Bill checked automatically for Silver and then laughed at himself Silver was leaning against the wall of Mikes garage It seemed Silver had no pan to play in this at all although that was strange after the way it had turned up Ben looked at him and Bill read the thought in his eyesIts been twentyseven years Bill dream onand then he nodded and headed into the undergrowth The paththeir pathhad long since grown over and they had to force themselves through tangles of thornbushes prickers and wild hydrangea so fragrant it was cloying Crickets sang somnolently all around them and a few lightningbugs early arrivals at summers luscious party poked at the dark Bill supposed kids still played down here but they had made their own runs and secret ways They came to the clearing where the clubhouse had been but now there was no clearing here at all Bushes and lackluster scrub pines had reclaimed it all Look Ben whispered and crossed the clearing in their memories it was still here simply overlaid with another of those matte paintings He yanked at something It was the mahogany door they had found on the edge of the dump the one they had used to finish off the clubhouse roof It had been cast aside here and looked as if it hadnt been touched in a dozen years or more Creepers were firmly entrenched across its dirty surface So they went down to the Kenduskeag following him bearing left away from the clearing that didnt exist anymore The sound of running water grew steadily louder but they still almost fell into the Kenduskeag before any of them saw it the foliage had grown up in a tangled wall on the edge of the embankment The edge broke off under the heels of Bens cowboy boots and Bill yanked him back by the scruff of the neck De nada In the oold ddays you wuhhould have puhpulled me ihin aaafter you DDown this wuhway Ben nodded and led them along the overgrown bank fighting through the tangles of bushes and brambles thinking how much easier this was when you were only four feet five and able to go under most tangles those in your mind as well as those in your path he supposed in one nonchalant duck Well everything changed Our lesson for today boys and girls is the more things change the more things change Whoever said the more things change the more things stay the same was obviously suffering severe mental retardation Because His foot hooked under something and he fell over with a thud nearly striking his head on the pumpingstations concrete cylinder It was almost completely buried in a wallow of blackberry bushes As he got to his feet again he realized that his face and arms and hands had been striped by blackberry thorns in two dozen places Make that three dozen he said feeling thin blood running down his cheeks Nothing He bent down to see what he had tripped over A root probably But it wasnt a root It was the iron manhole cover Someone had pushed it off But he realized that was crazy even before he saw fresh metal twinkling through the rust in parallel scrapemarks The pump hadnt been working that day Sooner or later someone would have come down to fix it and would have replaced the cover in the bargain He stood up and the five of them gathered around the cylinder and looked in They could hear the faint sound of dripping water That was all Richie had brought all the matches from Eddies room Now he lit an entire book of them and tossed it in For a moment they could see the cylinders damp inner sleeve and the silent bulk of the pumping machinery That was all Could have been off for a long time Richie said uneasily didnt necessarily have to happen t Its happened fairly recently Ben said since the last rain anyway He took another book of matches from Richie lit one and pointed out the fresh scratches Theres suhsuhsomething uhunder it Bill said as Ben shook out the match CCCouldnt tuhtuhtell Looked like a struhstruhstrap You and RihRichie help me ttturn it oover They grabbed the cover and flipped it like a giant coin This time Beverly lit the match and Ben cautiously picked up the purse which had been under the manhole cover He held it up by the strap Beverly started to shake out the match and then looked at Bills face She froze until the flame touched the ends of her fingers and then dropped it with a little gasp Bill What is it Whats wrong Bills eyes felt too heavy They couldnt leave that scuffed leather bag with its long leather strap Suddenly he could remember the name of the song which had been playing on the radio in the back room of the leathergoods shop when he had bought it for her sausalito Summer Nights It was the surpassing weirdism All the spit was gone out of his mouth leaving his tongue and inner cheeks as smooth and dry as chrome He could hear the crickets and see the lightningbugs and smell big green growing dark out of control all around him and he thought Its another trick another illusion shes in England and this is just a cheap shot because Its scared oh yes Its maybe not as sure as It was when It called us all back and really Bill get serioushow many scuffed leather purses with long straps do you think there are in the world A million Ten million Probably more But only one like this He had bought it for Audra in a Burbank leathergoods store while sausalito Summer Nights played on the radio in the back room Bill Beverlys hand on his shoulder shaking him Far away Twentyseven leagues under the sea What was the name of the group that sang sausalito Summer Nights Richie would know I know Bill said calmly into Richies scared wideeyed face and smiled It was Diesel Hows that for total recall Bill screamed He snatched the matches out of Beverlys hand lit one and then yanked the purse away from Ben He unzipped the purse and turned it over What fell out was so much Audra that for a moment he was too unmanned to scream again Amid the Kleenex sticks of chewing gum and items of makeup he saw a tin of Altoid mints and the jewelled compact Freddie Firestone had given her when she signed for Attic Room My wuhwuhwifes down there he said and fell on his knees and began pushing her things back into the purse He brushed hair that no longer existed out of his eyes without even thinking about it He had found her alligator wallet He opened it and held it up Richie lit another match and was looking at a face he had seen in half a dozen movies The picture on Audras California drivers license was less glamorous but completely conclusive But HuhHuhHenrys dead and Victor and BBBelch so whos got her He stood up staring around at them with febrile intensity Whos got her Ben put a hand on Bills shoulder I guess we better go down and find out huh Bill looked around at hull as if unsure of who Ben might be and then his eyes cleared YYeah he said EhEhEddie Bill bent over and Eddie hooked his right arm around Bills neck Ben and Richie boosted him up until he could hook his legs around Bills midsection As Bill swung one leg clumsily over the lip of the cylinder Ben saw that Eddies eyes were tightly shut and for a moment he thought he heard the worlds ugliest cavalry charge bashing its way through the bushes He turned expecting to see the three of them come out of the fog and the brambles but all he had heard was the rising breeze rattling the bamboo a quarter of a mile or so from here Their old enemies were all gone now Bill gripped the rough concrete lip of the cylinder and felt his way down step by step and rung by rung Eddie had him in a deathgrip and Bill could barely breathe Her purse dear God how did her purse get here Doesnt matter But if Youre there God and if Youre taking requests let her be all right dont let her suffer for what Bev and I did tonight or for what I did one summer when I was a boy and was it the clown Was it Bob Gray who got her If it was I dont know if even God can help her Bills foot touched cold standing water He lowered himself into it remembering the feel and the dank smell remembering the claustrophobic way this place had made him feel and just by the way what had happened to them How had they fared down in these drains and tunnels Where exactly had they gone and how exactly had they gotten out again He still couldnt remember any of that all he could think of was Audra I am tttoo He halfsquatted wincing as the cold water ran into his pants and over his balls and let Eddie off They stood shindeep in the water and watched the others descend the ladder Before the universe there had been only two things One was Itself and the other was the Turtle The Turtle was a stupid old thing that never came out of its shell It thought that maybe the Turtle was dead had been dead for the last billion years or so Even if it wasnt it was still a stupid old thing and even if the Turtle had vomited the universe out whole that didnt change the fact of its stupidity It had come here long after the Turtle withdrew into its shell here to Earth and It had discovered a depth of imagination here that was almost new almost of concern This quality of imagination made the food very rich Its teeth rent flesh gone stiff with exotic terrors and voluptuous fears they dreamed of nightbeasts and moving muds against their will they contemplated endless gulphs Upon this rich food It existed in a simple cycle of waking to eat and sleeping to dream It had created a place in Its own image and It looked upon this place with favor from the deadlights which were Its eyes Derry was Its killingpen the people of Derry Its sheep Things had gone on When It had burst up into the house on Neibolt Street meaning to kill them all vaguely uneasy that It had not been able to do so already and surely that unease had been the first new thing something had happened which was totally unexpected utterly unthought of and there had been pain pain great roaring pain all through the shape it had taken and for one moment there had also been fear because the only thing It had in common with the stupid old Turtle and the cosmology of the macroverse outside the puny egg of this universe was just this all living things must abide by the laws of the shape they inhabit For the first time It realized that perhaps Its ability to change Its shapes might work against It as well as for It There had never been pain before there had never been fear before and for a moment It had thought It might dieoh Its head had been filled with a great white silver pain and it had roared and mewled and bellowed and somehow the children had escaped But now they were coming They had entered Its domain under the city seven foolish children blundering through the darkness without lights or weapons It would kill them now surely It had made a great selfdiscovery It did not want change or surprise It did not want new things ever It wanted only to eat and sleep and dream and eat again Following the pain and that brief bright fear another new emotion had arisen as all genuine emotions were new to It although It was a great mocker of emotions anger It would kill the children because they had by some amazing accident hurt It But It would make them suffer first because for one brief moment they had made It fear them Come to me then It thought listening to their approach Come to me children and see how we float down here how we all float And yet there was a thought that insinuated itself no matter how strongly It tried to push the thought away It was simply this if all things flowed from It as they surely had done since the Turtle sicked up the universe and then fainted inside its shell how could any creature of this or any other world fool It or hurt It no matter how briefly or triflingly How was that possible And so a last new thing had come to It this not an emotion but a cold speculation suppose It had not been alone as It had always believed And suppose further that these children were agents of that Other Hate was new Hun was new Being crossed in Its purpose was new But the most terrible new thing was this fear Not fear of the children that had passed but the fear of not being alone No There was no other Surely there was not Perhaps because they were children their imaginations had a certain raw power It had briefly underestimated But now that they were coming It would let them come They would come and It would cast them one by one into the macroverse into the deadlights of Its eyes When they got here It would cast them shrieking and insane into the deadlights Bev and Richie had maybe ten matches between them but Bill wouldnt let them use them For the time being at least there was still dim light in the dram Not much but he could make out the next four feet in front of him and as long as he could keep doing that they would save the matches He supposed the little light they were getting must be coming from vents in curbings over their heads maybe even from the circular vents in manhole covers It seemed surpassingly strange to think they were under the city but of course by now they must be The water was deeper now Three times dead animals had floated past a rat a kitten a bloated shiny thing that might have been a woodchuck He heard one of the others mutter disgustedly as that baby cruised by The water they were crawling through was relatively placid but all that was going to come to an end fairly soon there was a steady hollow roaring not too far up ahead It grew louder rising to a onenote roar The drain elbowed to the right They made the turn and here were three pipes spewing water into their pipe They were lined up vertically like the lenses on a traffic light The drain deadended here The light was marginally brighter Bill looked up and saw they were in a square stonefaced shaft about fifteen feet high There was a sewergrating up there and water was sloshing down on them in buckets It was like being in a primitive shower Bill surveyed the three pipes helplessly The top one was venting water which was almost clear although there were leaves and sticks and bits of trash in itcigarette butts chewinggum wrappers things like that The middle pipe was venting gray water And from the lowest one came a grayishbrown flood of lumpy sewage Eddie floundered up beside him His hair was plastered to his head His cast was a soaking drippy mess WhWhWhich wuhwuhone If you wanted to know how to build something you asked Ben if you wanted to know which way to go you asked Eddie They didnt talk about this but they all knew it If you were in a strange neighborhood and wanted to get back to a place you knew Eddie could get you there making lefts and rights with undiminished confidence until you were reduced simply to following him and hoping that things would turn out right which they always seemed to do Bill told Richie once that when he and Eddie first began to play in the Barrens he Bill was constantly afraid of getting lost Eddie had no such fears and he always brought the two of them out right where he said he was going to If I gggot luhlost in the Hainesville Woods and EhEddie was with me I wouldnt wuhhurry a bbit Bill told Richie He just nuhnuhknows My dddad says some people ihhits Hike they got a cuhhuhhompass in their heads Eddies lllike that Which one what Eddie had his aspirator clutched in his good hand and Bill thought he actually looked more like a drowned muskrat than a kid Well that all depends on where we want to go Eddie said and Bill could have cheerfully throttled him even though the question made perfect sense Eddie was looking dubiously at the three pipes They could fit into all of them but the bottom one looked pretty snug Bill motioned the others to move up into a circle Where the fuck is IhIhIt he asked them Middle of town Richie said promptly Right under the middle of town Yes he said Thats where It is Near the Canal Or under it Eddie pointed reluctantly at the lower pipe and although Bills heart sank he wasnt at all surprised That one We dont Mike began and then broke off He cocked his head in a listening gesture His eyes were alarmed What Bill began and Mike put a finger across his lips in a Shhhh gesture Now Bill could hear it too splashing sounds Approaching Grunts and muffled words Henry still hadnt given up Stan looked back the way they had come then he looked at the lowest of the three pipes He pressed his lips tightly together and nodded Lets go he said shit washes off Stan the Man Gets Off A Good One Richie cried Wackawackawa Bill led them to the pipe grimacing at the smell and crawled in The smell it was sewage it was shit but there was another smell here too wasnt there A lower more vital smell If an animals grunt could have a smell and Bill supposed if the animal in question had been eating the right things it could it would be like this undersmell Were headed in the right direction all right Its been here and Its been here a lot By the time they had gone twenty feet the air had grown rancid and poisonous He squished slowly along moving through stuff that wasnt mud He looked back over his shoulder and said You fuhfuhfollow right behind mme EhEhEddie Ill nuhneed yyou The light faded to the faintest gray held that way briefly and then it was gone and they were into the black Bill shuffled forward through the sunk feeling that he was almost cutting through it physically one hand held out before him part of him expecting that at any moment it would encounter rough hair and green lamplike eyes would open in the darkness The end would come in one hot flare of pain as It walloped his head off his shoulders The dark was stuffed with sounds all of them magnified and echoing He could hear his friends shuffling along behind him sometimes muttering something There were gurglings and strange clanking groans Once a flood of sickeningly warm water washed past and between his legs wetting him to the thighs and rocking him back on his heels He felt Eddie clutch frantically at the back of his shirt and then the small flood slackened From the end of the line Richie bellowed with sorry good humor I think we just been pissed on by the Jolly Green Giant Bill Bill could hear water or sewage running in controlled bursts through the network of smaller pipes which now must be over their heads He remembered the conversation about Berrys sewers with his father and thought he knew what this pipe must beit was to handle the overflow that only occurred during heavy rains and during the flood season The stuff up there would be leaving Derry to be dumped in Torrault Stream and the Penobscot River The city didnt like to pump its shit into the Kenduskeag because it made the Canal stink But all the socalled gray water went into the Kenduskeag and if there was too much for the regular sewerpipes to handle there would be a dumpoff like the one that had just happened If there had been one there could be another He glanced up uneasily not able to see anything but knowing that there must be grates in the top arch of the pipe possibly in the sides as well and that any moment there might be He wasnt aware hed reached the end of the pipe until he fell out of it and staggered forward pinwheeling his arms in a helpless effort to keep his balance He fell on his belly into a semisolid mass about two feet below the mouth of the pipe hed just tumbled out of Something ran squeaking over his hand He screamed and sat up clutching his tingling hand to his chest aware that a rat had just run over it he had felt the loathsome plated drag of the things hairless tail He tried to stand up and rapped his head on the new pipes low ceiling It was a hard hit and Bill was driven back to his knees with large red flowers exploding in the darkness before his eyes Be cccareful He heard himself shouting His words echoed flatly It drops off here EhEddie Where aaare yuhyou Here One of Eddies waving hands brushed Bills nose Help me out Bill I cant see Its There was a huge watery kerwhasssh Beverly Mike and Richie all screamed in unison In the daylight the almost perfect harmony the three of them made would have been funny down here in the dark in the sewers it was terrifying Suddenly all of them were tumbling out Bill clutched Eddie in a bearhug trying to save his arm Oh Christ I thought I was gonna drown Richie moaned We got dousedoh boy a shitshower oh great they ought to have a class trip down here sometime Bill we could get Mr Carson to lead it And Miss Jimmison could give a health lecture afterward Ben said in a trembling voice and they all laughed shrilly As the laughter was tapering off Stan suddenly burst into miserable tears Dont man Richie said putting a fumbling arm around Stans sticky shoulders Youll get us all cryin man Im all right Stan said loudly still crying I can stand to be scared but I hate being dirty like this I hate not knowing where I am DDo yyyou ththink aaany of the muhmatches are still aaany guhgood Bill asked Richie Bill felt a hand touch his in the darkness and press a folder of matches into it They felt dry I kept them in my armpit she said They might work You can try them anyway Bill tore a match out of the folder and struck it It popped alight and he held it up His friends were huddled together wincing at the brief bright flare of light They were splashed and daubed with ordure and they all looked very young and very afraid Behind them he could see the sewerpipe they had come out of The pipe they were in now was smaller still It ran straight in both directions its floor caked with layers of filthy sediment And He drew in a quick hiss and shook the match out as it burned his fingers He listened and heard the sounds of fastrunning water dripping water the occasional gushing roar as the overflow valves worked sending more sewage into the Kenduskeag which was now God only knew how far behind them He didnt hear Henry and the othersyet He said quietly Theres a dddead bobbody on my rrright About ttten fuhfeet aaaway from uhus I think it mmight be PuhPuhPuh Patrick Beverly asked her voice trembling on the edge of hysteria Is it Patrick Hockstetter Eddie said You got to Bill If I dont see how the pipe runs I wont know which way to go Bill lit the match In its glow they all saw the green swelled thing that had been Patrick Hockstetter The corpse grinned at them in the dark with horrid chumminess but with only half a face sewer rats had taken the rest Patricks summerschool books were scattered around him bloated to the size of dictionaries in the damp The acoustics must have carried her voice to them as well Henry bellowed down the sewerpipe and for a moment it was as if he was standing right there You come on right ahead Richie shouted His eyes were bright dancing febrile Keep coming bananaheels This is just like the YMCA swimming pool down here Keep Then a shriek of such mad fear and pain came through the pipe that the guttering match fell from Bills fingers and went out Eddies arm had curled around him and Bill hugged Eddie back feeling his body trembling like a wire as Stan Uris packed close to him on the other side That shriek rose and rose and then there was an obscene thick flapping noise and the shriek was cut off Something got one of them Mike choked horrified in the darkness something some monster Bill we got to get out of here please Bill could hear whoever was leftone or two with the acoustics it was impossible to tellstumbling and scrabbling through the sewerpipe toward them WuhWhich wwway EhEddie he asked urgently dDo you nuhknow To the right Past Patrick or over him Eddies voice suddenly hardened I dont care that much He was one of the ones that broke my arm Spit in my face too Lets guhgo Bill said looking back at the sewerpipe they had just quitted sSingle luhline Keep a tttouch on eeach uhuhother like bbbefore He groped forward dragging his right shoulder along the slimy porcelain surface of the pipe gritting his teeth not wanting to step on Patrick or into him So they crawled farther into the darkness while waters rushed around them and while outside the storm walked and talked and brought an early darkness to Derrya darkness that screamed with wind and stuttered with electric fire and racketed with falling trees that sounded like the deathcries of huge prehistoric creatures Now they were coming again and while everything had gone much as It had foreseen something It had not foreseen had returned that maddening galling fear that sense of Another It hated the fear would have turned on it and eaten it if It could have but the fear danced mockingly out of reach and It could only kill the fear by kitting them Surely there was no need for such fear they were older now and their number had been reduced from seven to five Five was a number of power but it did not have the mystical talismanic quality of seven It was true that Its dogsbody hadnt been able to kill the librarian but the librarian would die in the hospital Later just before dawn touched the sky It would send a male nurse with a bad pill habit to finish the librarian once and for all The writers woman was now with It alive yet not aliveher mind had been utterly destroyed by her first sight of It as It really was with all of Its little masks and glamours thrown asideand all of the glamours were only mirrors of course throwing back at the terrified viewer the worst thing in his or her own mind heliographing images as a mirror may bounce a reflection of the sun into a wide unsuspecting eye and stun it to blindness Now the mind of the writers wife was with It in It beyond the end of the macroverse in the darkness beyond the Turtle in the outlands beyond all lands Oh but the glamours were amusing Hanlon for instance He would not remember not consciously but his mother could have told him where the bird he had seen at the Ironworks came from When he was a baby only six months old his mother had left him sleeping in his cradle in the side yard while she went around back to hang sheets and diapers on the line His screams had brought her on the run A large crow had lighted on the edge of the carriage and was pecking at baby Mikey like an evil creature in a nursery tale He had been screaming in pain and terror unable to drive away the crow which had sensed weak prey She had struck the bird with her fist and driven it off seen that it had brought blood in two or three places on baby Mikeys arms and taken him to Dr Stillwagon for a tetanus shot A part of Mike had remembered that alwaystiny baby giant birdand when It came to Mike Mike had seen the giant bird again But when the dogsbody husband of the girl from before brought the writers woman It had put on no faceIt did not dress when It was at home The dogsbody husband had looked once and had dropped dead of shock his face gray his eyes filling with the blood that had squirted out of his brain in a dozen places The writers woman had put out one powerful horrified thoughtOH DEAR JESUS IT IS FEMALEand then all thoughts ceased She swam in the deadlights It came down from Its place and took care of her physical remains prepared them for later feeding Now Audra Denbrough hung high up in the middle of things crisscrossed in silk her head lolling against the socket of her shoulder her eyes wide and glazed her toes pointing down But there was still power in them Diminished but still there They had come here as children and somehow against all the odds against all that was supposed to be all that could be they had hurt It badly had almost killed It had forced It to flee deep into the earth where it huddled hurt and hating and trembling in a spreading pool of Its own strange blood So another new thing if you please for the first time in Its neverending history It needed to make a plan for the first time It found Itself afraid simply to take what It wanted from Derry Its private gamepreserve It had always fed well on children Many adults could be used without knowing they had been used and It had even fed on a few of the older ones over the yearsadults had their own terrors and their glands could be tapped opened so that all the chemicals of fear flooded the body and salted the meat But their fears were mostly too complex The fears of children were simpler and usually more powerful The fears of children could often be summoned up in a single face and if bait were needed why what child did not love a clown It understood vaguely that these children had somehow turned Its own tools against Itthat by coincidence surely not on purpose surely not guided by the hand of any Other by the bonding of seven extraordinarily imaginative minds It had been Drought into a zone of great danger Any of these seven alone would have been Its meat and drink and if they had not happened to come together It surely would have picked them off one by one drawn by the quality of their minds just as a lion might be drawn to one particular waterhole by the scent of zebra But together they had discovered an alarming secret that even It had not been aware of that belief has a second edge If there are ten thousand medieval peasants who create vampires by believing them real there may be oneprobably a childwho will imagine the stake necessary to kill it But a stake is only stupid wood the mind is the mallet which drives it home Yet in the end It had escaped had gone deep and the exhausted terrified children had elected not to follow It when It was at Its most vulnerable They had elected to believe It dead or dying and had retreated It was aware of their oath and had known they would come back just as a lion knows the zebra will eventually return to the waterhole It had begun to plan even as It began to drowse When It woke It would be healed renewedbut their childhoods would be burned away like seven fatty candles The former power of their imaginations would be muted and weak They would no longer imagine that there were piranha in the Kenduskeag or that if you stepped on a crack you might really break your mothers back or that if you killed a ladybug which lit on your shin your house would catch fire that night Instead they would believe in insurance Instead they would believe in wine with dinnersomething nice but not too pretentious like a PouillyFuisse and let that breathe waiter would you Instead they would believe that Rolaids consume fortyseven times their own weight in excess stomach acid Instead they would believe in public television Gary Hart running to prevent heart attacks giving up red meat to prevent colon cancer They would believe in Dr Ruth when it came to getting well fucked and Jerry Falwell when it came to getting well saved As each year passed their dreams would grow smaller And when It woke It would call them back yes back because fear was fertile its child was rage and rage cried for revenge Only now that they were coming the fear had returned They had grown up and their imaginations had weakenedbut not as much as It had believed It had felt an ominous upsetting growth in their power when they joined together and It had wondered for the first time if It had perhaps made a mistake But why be gloomy The die was cast and not all the omens were bad The writer was halfmad for his wife and that was good The writer was the strongest the one who had somehow trained his mind for this confrontation over all the years and when the writer was dead with his guts falling out of his body when their precious Big Bill was dead the others would be Its quickly It would feed well and then perhaps It would go deep again And doze For awhile Bill Richie shouted into the echoing pipe He was moving as fast as he could but that wasnt very fast He remembered that as kids they had walked bent over in this pipe which led away from the pumpingstation in the Barrens He was crawling now and the pipe seemed impossibly tight His glasses kept wanting to slide off the end of his nose and he kept pushing them up again He could hear Bev and Ben behind him Up ahead Eddie called He was very close now and Richie sensed rather than saw him just ahead He wouldnt wait Richies head butted Eddies leg A moment later Bevs head butted Richies ass Bill Richie screamed at the top of his voice The pipe channelled his shout and sent it back at him hurting his own ears Bill wait for us We have to go together dont you know that Goddam you Big Bill Richie cried softly His glasses fell off He cursed groped for them and set them dripping back on his nose He pulled in breath and shouted again Youll get lost without Eddie you fucking asshole Wait up Wait up for us You hear me Bill WAIT UP FOR US DAMMIT There was an agonizing moment of silence It seemed that no one breathed All Richie could hear was distant dripping water the drain was dry this time except for the occasional stagnant puddle Bill He ran a trembling hand through his hair and fought the tears COME ON PLEASE MAN WAIT UP PLEASE Thank God for small favors Richie muttered He slapped Eddies can Go I dont know how long I can with just one arm Eddie said apologetically Bill looking haggard and almost usedup was waiting for them in the sewershaft where the three pipes were lined up like lenses on a dead traffic light There was room enough here for them to stand up They looked Beverly moaned and Ben put an arm around her The skeleton of Belch Huggins clad in moldering rags seemed more or less intact What remained of Victor was headless Bill looked across the shaftway and saw a grinning skull There it was there was the rest of him Should have left it alone guys Bill thought and shivered This section of the sewer system had fallen into disuse Richie thought the reason why was pretty clear The wastetreatment plant had taken over Sometime during the years when they were all busy learning to shave to drive to smoke to fuck around a little all that good shit the Environmental Protection Agency had come into being and the EPA had decided dumping raw sewageand even gray waterinto rivers and streams was a nono So this part of the sewer system had simply moldered and the bodies of Victor Criss and Belch Huggins had moldered along with it Like Peter Pans Wild Boys Victor and Belch had never grown up Here were the skeletons of two boys in the shredded remains of teeshirts and jeans that had rotted away to rags Moss had grown over the warped xylophone of Victors ribcage and over the eagle on the buckle of his garrisonbelt Monster got em Ben said softly do you remember We heard it happen You dont know any such thing Beverly said with such fury that Bill stirred and looked at her All you know for sure is that a lot of other people have died most of them children She walked across to him and stood before him with her hands on her hips Her face and hands were streaked with grime her hair matted with dirt Richie thought she looked absolutely magnificent And you know what did it I nuhnever should have tttold her where I was guhgoing Bill said Why did I do that Why did I Her hands pistoned out and seized him by the shirt Amazed Richie watched as she shook him No more You know what we came for We swore and were going to do it Do you understand me Bill If shes dead shes dead but Its not Now we need you Do you get it We need you She was crying now so you stand up for us You stand up for us like before or none of us are going to get out of here He looked at her for a long time without speaking and Richie found himself thinking Come on Big Bill Come on come on Bill looked around at the rest of them and nodded EhEddie Eddie pointed past Victor and said That the one Looks pretty small doesnt it Bill nodded again Can you do it With your aaarm broken Bill smiled the weariest most terrible smile Richie had ever seen Tuhhake us there EhEddie Lets gget it done As he crawled Bill reminded himself of the dropoff at the end of this pipe but it still surprised him At one moment his hands were shuffling along the crusted surface of the old pipe at the next they were skating on air He pitched forward and rolled instinctively landing on his shoulder with a painful crunch Here One of Eddies waving hands brushed across Bills forehead Can you help me out He got his arms around Eddie and lifted him out trying to be careful of the bad arm Ben came next then Bev then Richie I do Beverly said Bill felt a hand touch his in the darkness and press a folder of matches into it Theres only eight or ten but Bens got more From the room Not this time she said and put her arms around him in the dark He hugged her tight eyes closed trying to take the comfort that she wanted so badly to give He released her gently and struck a match The power of memory was greatthey all looked at once to their right What remained of Patrick Hockstetters body was still there amid a few lumpy overgrown things that might have been books The only really recognizable thing was a jutting semicircle of teeth two or three of them with fillings And something nearby A gleaming circle barely seen in the matchs guttering light Bill shook the match out and lit another He picked it up Audras wedding ring he said His voice was hollow expressionless how long they had been wandering through the tunnels under Derry since they had left the place where Patrick Hockstetters body was but Bill was sure he could never find his way back He kept thinking about what his father had said You could wander for weeks If Eddies sense of direction failed them now they wouldnt need It to kill them they would wander until they died or if they got into the wrong set of pipes until they were drowned like rats in a rainbarrel But Eddie didnt seem a bit worried Every now and then he would ask Bill to light one of their diminishing store of matches look around thoughtfully and then set off again He made rights and lefts seemingly at random Sometimes the pipes were so big Bill could not reach their tops even by stretching his hand up all the way Sometimes they had to crawl and once for five horrible minutes which felt more like five hours they wormed their way along on their bellies Eddie now leading the others following with their noses to the heels of the person ahead The only thing Bill was completely sure of was that they had somehow gotten into a disused section of the Derry sewer system They had left all the active pipes either far behind or far above The roar of running water had dimmed to a faroff thunder These pipes were older not kilnfired ceramic but a crumbly claylike stuff that sometimes oozed springs of unpleasantsmelling fluid The smells of human wastethose ripe gassy smells that had threatened to suffocate them allhad faded but they had been replaced by another smell yellow and ancient that was worse Ben thought it was the smell of the mummy To Eddie it smelled like the leper Richie thought it smelled like the worlds oldest flannel jacket now moldering and rottinga lumbermans jacket a very big one big enough for a character like Paul Bunyan perhaps To Beverly it smelled like her fathers sockdrawer In Stan Uris it woke a dreadful memory from his earliest childhoodan oddly Jewish memory in a boy who had only the haziest understanding of his own Jewishness It smelled like clay mixed with oil and made him think of an eyeless mouthless demon called the Golem a clay man that renegade Jews were supposed to have raised in the Middle Ages to save them from the goyim who robbed them and raped their women and then sent them packing Mike thought of the dry smell of feathers in a dead nest When they finally reached the end of the narrow pipe they slithered like eels down the curved surface of another which ran at an oblique angle to the one they had been in and found they could stand up again Bill felt the heads of the matches left in the book Four His mouth tightened and he resolved not to tell the others how close they were to the end of their light not unless he absolutely had to They murmured replies and he nodded in the dark No panic and no tears since Stans That was good He felt for their hands and they stood together in the dark that way for awhile both taking and giving from the touch Bill felt clear exultation in this a sure sense that they were somehow producing more than the sum of their seven selves they had been readded into a more potent whole He lit one of the remaining matches and they saw a narrow tunnel stretching ahead on a downward slant The top of this pipe was festooned with sagging cobwebs some waterbroken and hanging in shrouds Looking at them gave Bill an atavistic chill The floor here was dry but thick with ancient mold and what might have been leaves fungus or some unimaginable droppings Farther up he saw a pile of bones and a drift of green rags They might once have been that stuff they called polished cotton workmans clothes Bill imagined some Sewer Department or Water Department worker who had gotten lost wandered down here and been discovered The match guttered He tipped its head downward wanting the light to last a little longer Eddie pointed down the slightly crooked bore of the tunnel Canals that way he said Lessn half a mile unless this thing turns in a different direction Were under UpMile Hill right now I think But Bill The match burned Bills ringers and he let it drop They were in darkness again SomeoneBill thought it was Beverlysighed But before the match had gone out he had seen the worry on Eddies face When I say were under UpMile Hill I mean were really under it We been going down for a long time now Nobodyd ever put sewerpipe in this deep When you put a tunnel this deep you call it a mineshaft These arent sewerpipes anyway Stan said from behind them You can tell by that smell Its bad but its not a sewery smell I think Id rather smell the sewer Ben said It smells like A scream floated down to them issuing from the mouth of the pipe they had just left lifting the hair on the nape of Bills neck The seven of them drew together clutching each other gonna get you sons of bitches Were gonna get youuuuuuu Im not surprised Richie said some people are too stupid to quit They could hear faint panting the scrape of shoes the whisper of cloth They started down the pipe now walking double except for Mike who was at the back of the line Bill and Eddie Richie and Bev Ben and Stan I couldnt tell Big Bill Eddie said The echoes are bad He dropped his voice did you see that pile of bones There was a toolbelt with the clothes I think it was a Water Department guy I dddont nuhnuhknow I Eddie closed his good hand over Bills arm in the darkness It was perhaps fifteen minutes later when they heard something coming toward them in the dark Richie stopped frozen cold all the way through Suddenly he was three years old again He listened to that squelching shifting movementclosing in on them closingand to the whispering branchlike sounds that accompanied it and even before Bill struck a match he knew what it would be For a moment the others were not sure what they were seeing Beverly had an impression that her father had found her even down here and Eddie had a fleeting vision of Patrick Hockstetter come back to life somehow Patrick had flanked them and gotten in front of them but Richies cry Richies certainty froze the shape for all of them They saw what Richie saw A gigantic Eye filled the tunnel the glassy black pupil two feet across the iris a muddy russet color The white was bulgy membranous laced with red veins that pulsed steadily It was a lidless lashless gelatinous horror that moved on a bed of rawlooking tentacles These fumbled over the tunnels crumbly surface and sank in like fingers so that the impression given in the glow of Bills guttering match was of an Eye that had somehow grown nightmare fingers which were pulling It along It stared at them with blank feverish avarice The match went out In the darkness Bill felt those branchlike tentacles caress his ankles his shins but he could not move His body was frozen solid He sensed It approaching he could feel the heat radiating out from It and could hear the wet pulse of blood wetting Its membranes He imagined the stickiness he would feel when It touched him and still he could not scream Even when fresh tentacles slipped around his waist and hooked themselves into the loops of his jeans and began to drag him forward he could not scream or struggle A deadly sleepiness seemed to have suffused his whole body Beverly felt one of the tentacles slip around the cup of her ear and suddenly draw noosetight Paul flared and she was dragged forward twisting and moaning as if an oldlady schoolteacher were giving her an outofpatience comealong to the back of the room where she would be forced to sit on a stool and wear a duncecap Stan and Richie tried to back away but a forest of unseen tentacles now wavered and whispered about them Ben put an arm around Beverly and tried to tug her back She clasped his hands with panicky tightness He pulled with all his might and Beverly screamed as pain tore through her ear and blood began to flow A tentacle dry and hard scraped over Bens shirt paused then twisted in a painful knot around his shoulder Bill put out a hand and it slapped into a gluey yielding wetness The Eye his mind screamed Oh God I got my hand in the Eye Oh God Oh dear sweet God The Eye My hand in the Eye He began to fight now but the tentacles drew him forward inexorably His hand disappeared into that wet avid heat His forearm Now his arm was lunged into the Eye up to the elbow At any moment the rest of his body would come against that sticky surface and he felt that he would go mad in that instant He fought frantically chopping at the tentacles with his other hand Eddie stood like a boy in a dream hearing the muffled screams and sounds of struggle as his friends were being pulled in He sensed the tentacles around him but none had as yet actually landed on him Run home his mind commanded him quite loudly Run home to your mamma Eddie You can find the way Bill screamed in the darka high despairing sound that was followed by hideous squishings and slobberings Eddies paralysis broke wide openIt was trying to take Big Bill No Eddie bellowedit was a fullblown roar One might never have guessed such a Norsewarrior sound could issue from such a thin chest Eddie Kaspbraks chest Eddie Kaspbraks lungs which were of course afflicted with the most terrible case of asthma in Derry He bolted forward jumping over questing tentacles without seeing them his broken arm thumping his own chest as it swung back and forth in its soggy cast He fumbled in his pocket and brought out his aspirator He collided with Bill Denbroughs back and slammed him aside There was a watery ripping sound followed by a low eager mewling that Eddie did not so much hear with his ears as feel with his mind He raised the aspirator acid its acid if I want it to be so eat it eat it eat BATTERY ACID FUCKNUTS Eddie screamed and triggered off a blast At the same time he kicked at the Eye His foot went deep into the jelly of Its cornea There was a gush of hot fluid over his leg He pulled his foot back only dimly aware that he had lost his shoe FUCK OFF CRAM IT SAM GO AWAY JOSE GET LOST FUCK OFF He felt tentacles touch him but tentatively He triggered the aspirator again coating the Eye and feltheard that mewling again now a hurt surprised sound Fight It Eddie raved at the others Its just a fucking Eye Fight It You hear me Fight It Bill Kick the shit out of the sucker Jesus Christ you fucking pussies Im doing the Mashed Potatoes all over It AND I GOT A BROKEN ARM Bill felt his strength return He ripped his dripping arm out of the Eye and then slammed it fistfirst back in A moment later Ben was beside him He ran into the Eye grunted with surprise and disgust and then began to rain punches onto its jellied quivering surface Let her go he yelled You hear me Let her go Get outta here Get outta here Just an Eye Just a fucking Eye Eddie was screaming deliriously He triggered his aspirator again and felt It draw back The tentacles which had settled on him now dropped away Richie Richie Get it Its just an Eye Richie stumbled forward unable to believe he was doing this actually approaching the worst most terrible monster in the world But he was He only threw a single weak punch and the feel of his fist sinking into the Eyeit was thick and wet and somehow gristlymade him throw his guts up in one big tasteless convulsion A sound came out of himglurtand the thought that hed actually puked on the Eye caused him to do it again It was only a single punch but since he had created this particular monster perhaps that was all that was necessary Suddenly the tentacles were gone They could hear It withdrawing and then the only sounds were Eddie panting and Beverly crying softly one hand to her bleeding ear Bill struck one of their three remaining matches and they stared at each other with dazed shocked faces Bills left arm was running with a thick cloudy goo that looked like a mixture of partially congealed eggwhite and snot Blood was trickling slowly down the side of Beverlys neck and there was a fresh cut on Bens cheek Richie slowly pushed his glasses up on his nose YYYeah He turned to Eddie and hugged the smaller boy with fierce intensity You suhsuhsaved my luhlife man It ate your shoe Beverly said and uttered a wild laugh Isnt that too bad Ill buy you a new pair of Keds when we get out of here Richie said He clapped Eddie on the back in the dark How did you do it Eddie Shot it with my aspirator Pretended it was acid Thats how it tastes after awhile if Im having you know a bad day Worked great Im doing the Mashed Potatoes all over It and I GOT A BROKEN ARM Richie said and giggled madly Not too shabby Eds Actually pretty chuckalicious tell you what I know Richie said hugging him tightly but somebody has to toughen you up Eds When you stop leading the sheltered igszistence of a child and grow up you gonna Ah say Ah say you gonna find out life aint always this easy boy Eddie began to shriek with laughter Thats the shittiest Voice I ever heard Richie Well keep that aspirator thing handy Beverly said We might need it again You didnt see It anywhere Mike asked When you lit the match IhIhIts gggone Bill said and then added grimly But were getting close to It To the pluhhace where IhIt stuhstuhstays And I ththink we hhhurt Ihhit ththat time Henrys still coming Stan said His voice was low and hoarse I can hear him back there They did The tunnel progressed steadily downward and that smellthat low wild stenchgrew steadily stronger At times they could hear Henry behind them but now his cries seemed far away and not at all important There was a feeling in all of themsimilar to that feeling of skew and disconnection they had felt in the house on Neibolt Streetthat they had progressed over the edge of the world and into some queer nothingness Bill felt although he did not have the vocabulary to express what he knew that they were approaching Derrys dark and ruined heart It seemed to Mike Hanlon that he could almost feel that hearts diseased arrhythmic beat Beverly felt a sense of evil power growing around her seeming to enfold her certainly trying to split her off from the others and make her alone Nervously she reached out on either side of herself and clasped Bills hand and Bens It seemed to her that she had to reach too far and she called out nervously Hang onto hands Its like were moving away from each other It was Stan who first realized he could see again There was a low strange radiance in the air At first he could only see handshis clasping Bens on one side and Mikes on the other Then he realized he could see the buttons on Richies muddy shirt and the Captain Midnight ringjust some junky cerealbox prizethat Eddie liked to wear on his little finger Can you guys see Stan asked coming to a stop The others stopped too Bill looked around first aware that he could seea little anywayand then that the tunnel had widened out amazingly They were now in a curved chamber easily as big as the Sunnier Tunnel in Boston Bigger he amended as he looked around with a growing sense of awe They craned their necks back to see the ceiling which was now fifty feet or more above them and held up by outcurving buttresses of stone like ribs Nets of dirty cobweb hung between them The floor was now stoneflagged but overlaid with such a drift of ancient dirt that the quality of their footfalls had never changed The upcurving walls were easily fifty feet away on either side Waterworks must have really gone crazy down here Richie said and laughed uneasily A loud braying cry split the gloom and then the ruffling heavy thunder of wings A shape came cruising out of the dark one eye glaringthe other was a dark lamp It dived at them like an obscene fighterplane Its plated orange beak opening and closing to reveal the pink inner lining of Its mouth plush as a satin pillow in a coffin Its beak raked his shoulder and he felt pain sink into his flesh like acid Blood flowed down his chest He cried out as the backwash of Its beating wings blew noxious tunnel air in his face It wheeled back Its eye glaring malevolently rolling in Its socket blurring only as Its nictitating eyelid jittered down momentarily to cover the eye with tissuethin film Its claws sought Eddie who ducked screaming They razored through the back of his shirt cutting it open drawing shallow scarlet lines along his shoulderblades Eddie yelled and tried to crawl away but the bird wheeled back again Mike broke forward digging in his pocket He came out with a oneblade Buck knife As the bird dived on Eddie again he swept it in a quick tight arc across one of the birds talons It cut deep and blood poured out The bird banked away and then came back folding Its wings diving in like a bullet Mike fell to one side at the last moment slashing upward with the Buck knife He missed and the birds claw hit his wrist with such force that his hand went numb and tinglythe bruise that later bloomed there went most of the way to his elbow The Buck flew into the dark The bird came back screeching triumphantly and Mike rolled his body over Eddies and waited for the worst Stan walked forward toward the two boys huddled on the floor as the bird returned He stood small and somehow trim in spite of the dirt grimed into his hands and arms and pants and shirt and suddenly held his hands out in a curious gesturepalms up fingers down The bird uttered another squawk and sheared off bulleting by Stan missing him by inches lifting his hair and then dropping it in the buffeting wake of Its passage He turned in a tight circle to face Its return I believe in scarlet tanagers even though I never saw one he said in a high clear voice The bird screamed and banked away as if hed shot at it same with vultures and the New Guinea mudlark and the flamingos of Brazil The bird screamed circled and suddenly flew on up the tunnel squawking I believe in the golden bald eagle Stan screamed after it And I think there really might be a phoenix somewhere But I dont believe in you so get the fuck out of here Get out Hit the road Jack Bill Ben and Beverly went to Mike and Eddie they helped Eddie to his feet and Bill looked at the cuts Nuhnot dddeep he said But I bbet they hhurt like hhhell It tore my shirt to pieces Big Bill Eddies cheeks glistened with tears and he was wheezing again The bellowing barbarians voice was gone it was hard to believe it had ever been there What am I going to tell my mom Bill smiled a little Why dddont we wuhworry about that when we gggget out of here Give yourself a bluhhast EEddie That was great man Richie told Stan That was just frockin greatl Stan was shivering all over Theres no bird like that thats all There never has been and there never will be Were coming Henry screamed from behind them His voice was utterly demented He was laughing and howling now He sounded like something that has crawled out of a crack in the roof of hell Men Belch Were coming and well get you little punks You cant get away Henrys response was a hollow inarticulate scream They heard a hustle of footsteps and in a burst of comprehension Bill understood Henrys whole purpose he was real he was mortal he could not be stopped by an aspirator or a birdbook Magic would not work on Henry He was too stupid They went on again holding hands Eddies tattered shirt flapping behind him The light grew brighter the tunnel ever huger As it canted downward the ceiling flew away above until they could barely see it It now seemed to them that they were not walking in a tunnel at all but making their way through a titanic underground courtyard the approach to some cyclopean castle The light from the walls had become a running greenyellow fire The smell was stronger and they began to pick up a vibration that might have been real or might have been only in their minds It was steady and rhythmic It ends up ahead Beverly cried Look Its a blank wall But as they drew closer antlike now on this great floor of dirty stone blocks each block bigger than Bassey Park it seemed they saw that the wall was not entirely blank after all It was broken by a single door And although the wall itself towered hundreds of feet above them the door was very small It was no more than three feet high a door of the sort you might see in a fairytale book made of stout oaken boards bound with iron strips in an Xpattern It was they all realized at once a door made only for children Ghostly in his mind Ben heard the librarian reading to the little ones Who is that triptrapping upon my bridge The children lean forward all the old fascination glistening in their eyes will the monster be bested or will It feed There was a mark on the door and heaped at its foot was a pile of bones Small bones The bones of God alone knew how many children Stan saw it as a bird rising toward the skya phoenix perhaps Michael saw a hooded facethat of crazy Butch Bowers perhaps if it could only be seen Eddie believed it to be the face of the leper all sunken eyes and wrinkled snarling mouthall disease all sickness was stamped into that face Ben Hanscom saw a tattered pile of wrappings and seemed to smell old sour spices Later arriving at that same door with Belchs screams still echoing in his ears alone at the end of it Henry Bowers would see it as the moon full ripe and black Im scared Bill Ben said in a wavering voice do we have to Bill toed the bones and suddenly scattered them in a powdery raiding drift with one foot He was scared too but there was George to consider It had ripped off Georges arm Were those small and fragile bones among these Yes of course they were They were here for the owners of the bones George and all the othersthose who had been brought here those who might be brought here those who had been left in other places simply to rot IhIts not llocked Bill said and then told her what he knew from deeper inside Pluhhaces like this are nnever luhluhlocked He placed the tented fingers of his right hand on the door and pushed It swung open on a flood of sick yellowgreen light That zoo smell wafted out at them incredibly strong incredibly potent now One by one they passed through the fairytale door and into the lair of It Bill stopped so suddenly that the others piled up like freightcars when the engine suddenly comes to a panicstop What is it Ben called I remember Richie said Eddie stopped it with his aspirator By pretending it was acid He said something about some dance Pretty chuckalicious but I cant remember exactly what it was It dddoesnt mmmatter We wont suhsee anything we saw bbbefore Bill said He struck a light and looked around at the others Their faces were luminous in the glow of the match luminous and mystic And they seemed very young HHHow you guys ddoin Were okay Big Bill Eddie said but his face was drawn with pain Bills makeshift splint was coming apart How bout you OhOhkay Bill said and shook out the match before his face could tell them any different story How did it happen Beverly asked him touching his arm in the dark Bill how could she BBBecause I muhhentioned the nname of the town ShShe cccame ahhafter mmme Even whwhen I was dddoing it suhsuhhomething ihhinside was tttelling me to shshshut uhup BBut I dddidnt luhluhhisten He shook his head helplessly in the dark But even if shshe came to DuhDuhDerry I dddont uhhunderstand hhhow she ccould have guhhotten dddown hhere If HHHenry dihdidnt bbbring her then who ddid It Ben said It doesnt have to look bad we know that It could have shown up and said you were in trouble Taken her here in order to to fuck you up I suppose To kill our guts Cause thats what you always were Big Bill Our guts She was looking at him with a kind of desperate honesty Tom My husband He knew too At least I think I mentioned the name of the town to him the way you mentioned it to Audra I I dont know if it took or not He was pretty angry with me at the time Jesus what is this some kind of soap opera where everybody turns up sooner or later Richie said Not a soap opera Bill said sounding sick a show Like the circus Bev here went and married Henry Bowers When she left why wouldnt he come here After all the real Henry did No Beverly said I didnt marry Henry I married my father They did Bill reached out to either side and found Eddies good hand and one of Richies hands Soon they stood in a circle as they had done once before when their number was greater Eddie felt someone put an arm around his shoulders The feeling was warm and comforting and deeply familiar Bill felt the sense of power that he remembered from before but understood with some desperation that things really had changed The power was nowhere near as strongit struggled and flickered like a candleflame in foul air The darkness seemed thicker and closer to them more triumphant And he could smell It Down this passageway he thought and not so terribly far is a door with a mark on it What was behind that door Its the one thing I still cant remember I can remember making my fingers stiff because they wanted to tremble and I can remember pushing the door open I can even remember the flood of light that streamed out and how it seemed almost alive as if it wasnt just light but fluorescent snakes I remember the smell like the monkeyhouse in a big zoo but even worse And then nothing I think Richie began and then Bill could almost feel him shake his head in the dark No Huhuh That was Ben Thats the one thing I still cant remember What It was or how we fought It Chud Beverly said Thats how we fought it But I dont remember what that means Stand by mme Bill said and IIll stuhstuhhand by yyyou guys Bill Ben said His voice was very calm something is coming Bill listened He heard dragging shambling footsteps approaching them in the dark and he was afraid AAAudra he called and knew already that it was not her The first wrong thing happened on that latespring day in two minutes before official sunrise To understand how wrong it was one would have to have known two facts that were known to Mike Hanlon who lay unconscious in the Derry Home Hospital as the sun came up both concerning the Grace Baptist Church which had stood on the corner of Witcham and Jackson since  The church was topped with a slender white spire which was the apotheosis of every Protestant churchsteeple in New England There were clockfaces on all four sides of the steeplebase and the clock itself had been constructed and shipped from Switzerland in the year  The only one like it stood in the town square of Haven Village forty miles away Stephen Bowie a timber baron who lived on West Broadway donated the clock to the town at a cost of some Bowie could afford it He was a devout churchgoer and deacon for forty years during several of those later years he was also president of Derrys Legion of White Decency chapter In addition he was known for his devout layman sermons on Mothers Day which he always referred to reverently as Mothers Sunday From the time of its installation until May st that clock had faithfully chimed each hour and each halfwith one notable exception On the day of the explosion at the Kitchener Ironworks it had not chimed the noonhour Residents believed that the Reverend Jollyn had silenced the clock to show that the church was in mourning for the dead children and Jollyn never disabused them of this notion although it was not true The clock had simply not chimed Nor did it chime the hour of five on the morning of May st At that moment all over Derry oldtimers opened their eyes and sat up disturbed for no reason they could put their fingers on Medicines were gulped false teeth put in pipes and cigars lit One of them was Norbert Keene now in his nineties He hobbled to the window and looked out at a darkening sky The weather report the night before had called for clear skies but his bones told him it was going to rain and hard He felt scared deep inside him in some obscure way he felt threatened as if a poison were working its way relentlessly toward his heart He thought randomly of the day the Bradley Gang had ridden heedlessly into Derry into the sights of seventyfive pistols and rifles That kind of work left a man feeling kind of warm and lazy inside like everything was was somehow confirmed He couldnt put it any better than that even to himself Work like that left a man feeling like he maybe might live forever and Norbert Keene damn near had Ninetysix years old come June th and he still walked three miles every day But now he felt scared Those kids he said looking out his window unaware he had spoken What is it with them damn kids What they monkeying around with this time Egbert Thoroughgood ninetynine who had been in the Silver Dollar when Claude Heroux tuned up his axe and played The Dead March for four men on it awoke at the same moment sat up and let out a rusty scream that no one heard He had dreamed of Claude only Claude had been coming after him and the axe had come down and a moment after it did Thoroughgood had seen his own severed hand twitching and curling on the counter Something wrong he thought in his muddy way frightened and shaking all over in his peestained longjohns Something dreadful wrong Dave Gardener who had discovered George Denbroughs mutilated body in October of and whose son had discovered the first victim of this new cycle earlier in the spring opened his eyes on the stroke of five and thought even before looking at the clock on the bureau Grace Church clock didnt chime the hour Whats wrong He felt a large illdefined fright Dave had prospered over the years in  he had purchased The Shoeboat and now there was a second Shoeboat at the Derry Mall and a third up in Bangor Suddenly all of those thingsthings he had spent his life working forseemed in jeopardy From what he cried to himself looking at his sleeping wife From what why you so goddam antsy just because that clock didnt chime But there was no answer He got up and went to the window hitching at the waistband of his pyjamas The sky was restless with clouds racing in from the west and Daves disquiet grew For the first time in a very long while he found himself thinking of the screams that had brought him to his porch twentyseven years ago to see that writhing figure in the yellow rainslicker He looked at the approaching clouds and thought Were in danger All of its Derry Chief Andrew Rademacher who really believed he had tried his best to solve the new string of childmurders that had plagued Derry stood on the porch of his house thumbs in his Sam Browne belt looking up at the clouds and felt the same disquiet Something getting ready to happen Looks like its going to pour buckets for one thing But thats not all He shuddered and as he stood there on his porch the smell of the bacon his wife was cooking wafting out through the screen door the first dimesized drops of rain darkened the sidewalk in front of his pleasant Reynolds Street home and somewhere just over the horizon from Bassey Park thunder rumbled Bill held the match up and uttered a long trembling despairing screech It was George wavering up the tunnel toward him George still dressed in his bloodspattered yellow rainslicker One sleeve dangled limp and useless Georges face was white as cheese and his eyes were shiny silver They fixed on Bills own My boat Georgies lost voice rose wavering in the tunnel I cant find it Bill Ive looked everywhere and I cant find it and now Im dead and its your fault your fault YOUR FAULT JuhJuhGeorgie Bill shrieked He felt his mind tottering ripping free of its moorings George stumblestaggered toward him and now his one remaining arm rose toward Bill the white hand at the end of it hooked into a claw The nails were dirty and grasping Your fault George whispered and grinned His teeth were fangs they opened and closed slowly like the teeth in a beartrap You sent me out and its all your fault Kill you George cried and a mixture of doglike sounds came out of that fanged mouth yips yelps howls A kind of laughter Bill could smell him now could smell George rotting It was a cellarsmell squirmy the smell of some final monster standing slumped and yelloweyed in the corner waiting to unzip some small boys guts Georges teeth gnashed together The sound was like billiard balls clicking off one another Yellow pus began to leak from his eyes and dribble down his face and the match went out Bill felt his friends disappearthey were running of course they were they were leaving him alone They were cutting him off as his parents had cut him off because George was right it was all his fault Soon he would feel that single hand seize his throat soon he would feel those fangs pulling him open and that would be right That would be only just He had sent George out to die and he had spent his whole adult life writing about the horror of that betrayaloh he had put many faces on it almost as many faces as It had put on for their benefit but the monster at the bottom of everything was only George running out into the receding flood with his paraffincoated paper boat Now would come the atonement You deserve to die for killing me George whispered He was very close now Bill closed his eyes Then yellow light splashed the tunnel and he opened them Richie was holding up a match Fight It Bill Richie shouted Gods sake Fight It What are you doing here He looked at them bewildered They hadnt run after all How could that be How could that be after they had seen how foully he had murdered his own brother Fight It Beverly was screaming Oh Bill fight It Only you can do this one Please George was less than five feet away now He suddenly stuck his tongue out at Bill It was crawling with white fungoid growths Bill screamed again Kill It Bill Eddie shouted Thats not your brother Kill It while its small Kill It NOW George glanced at Eddie cutting his shinysilver eyes that way for just a moment and Eddie reeled back and struck the wall as if he had been pushed Bill stood mesmerized watching his brother come toward him George again after all these years it was George at the end as it had been George at the beginning oh yes and he could hear the creak of Georges yellow slicker as George closed the distance he could hear the jingle of the buckles on his overshoes and he could smell something like wet leaves as if underneath the slicker Georges body was made of them as if the feet inside Georges galoshes were leaffeet yes a leafman that was it that was George he was a rotted balloon face and a body made of dead leaves the kind that sometimes choke the sewers after a flood Well look for my boat together George said Thick yellow pus mock tears rolled down his cheeks He reached for Bill and his head cocked sideward his teeth peeling back from those fangs Well find it George said and Bill could smell Its breath and it was a smell like exploded animals lying on the highway at midnight As Georges mouth yawned he could see things squirming around inside there Its still down here everything floats down here well float Bill well all float HE SEES THE GHOSTS WE SEE THE GHOSTS THEY WE YOU SEE THE GHOSTS He thrusts his fists against the posts Bill cried His voice was deeper hardly his own at all and in a searing flash of memory Richie remembered that Bill only stuttered in his own voice when he pretended to be someone else he never did The Georgething recoiled hissing Its hand going to Its face in a wardingoff gesture Thats it Richie screamed deliriously You got It Bill Get It Get It Get It He thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts Bill thundered He advanced on the Georgething Youre no ghost George knows I didnt mean for him to die My folks were wrong They took it out on me and that was wrong Do you hear me The Georgething abruptly turned squealing like a rat It began to run and ripple under the yellow slicker The slicker itself seemed to be dripping running in bright blots of yellow It was losing Its shape becoming amorphous He thrusts his fists against the posts you son of a bitch Bill Denbrough screamed and still insists he sees the ghosts He leaped at It and his fingers snagged in the yellow rainslicker that was no longer a rainslicker What he grabbed felt like some strange warm taffy that melted under his fingers as soon as he had closed his fist around it He fell to his knees Then Richie yelled as the guttering match burned his fingers and they were plunged into darkness again Bill felt something begin to grow in his chest something hot and choking and as painful as fiery nettles He gripped his knees and drew them up to his chin hoping it would stop the pain or perhaps ease it he was dimly thankful for the dark glad that the others couldnt see this agony He heard a sound escape hima wavering moan There was a second a third George he cried George Im sorry I never meant for anything bbbbad to huhhuhhappen Perhaps there was something else to say but he could not say it He was sobbing then lying on his back with one arm over his eyes remembering the boat remembering the steady beat of the rain against his bedroom windows remembering the medicines and the tissues on the nighttable the faint ache of fever in his head and in his body remembering George most of all that remembering George George in his yellow hooded slicker George Im sorry he cried through his tears Im sorry Im sorry please Im suhsuhSORRY And then they were around him his friends and no one lit a match and someone held him he didnt know who Beverly maybe or maybe Ben or Richie They were with him and for that little while the darkness was kind By it was raining hard The weather forecasters on the Bangor radio stations expressed mild surprise and tendered mild apologies to all the people who had made plans for picnics and outings on the basis of yesterdays forecasts Tough break folks just one of those odd weather patterns that sometimes developed in the Penobscot Valley with startling suddenness On WZON meteorologist Jim Witt described what he called an extraordinarily disciplined lowpressure system That was putting it mildly Conditions went from cloudy in Bangor to showery in Hampden to drizzly in Haven to moderate rain in Newport But in Derry only thirty miles from downtown Bangor it was pouring Travellers on Route found themselves moving through water that was eight inches deep in places and beyond the Rhulin Farms a plugged culvert in a dip had covered the highway with so much water that the highway was actually impassable By six that morning the Derry Highway Patrol had orange DETOUR signs on both sides of the dip Those who waited under the shelter on Main Street for the first bus of the day to take them to work stood looking over the railing at the Canal where the water was ominously high in its concrete channel There would be no flood of course all agreed on that The water was still four feet below the highwater mark of and there had been no flood that year But the rain came down with steady pounding persistence and thunder grumbled in the low clouds Water ran down UpMile Hill in streams and roared in the stormdrains and sewers No flood they agreed but there was a patina of unease on every face At a powertransformer on a pole beside the abandoned Tracker Brothers Truck Depot exploded in a flash of purple light spraying twisted chunks of metal onto the shingled roof One of the flying chunks of metal severed a hightension wire which also fell on the roof spluttering and twisting like a snake shooting an almost liquid stream of sparks The roof caught fire in spite of the downpour and soon the depot was blazing The powercable tumbled from the roof to the weedy verge that led around to the lot where small boys had once played baseball The Derry Fire Department rolled for the first time that day at  AM and arrived at Tracker Brothers at  One of the first firemen off the truck was Calvin Clark one of the Clark twins with whom Ben Beverly Richie and Bill had gone to school His third step away from the truck brought the sole of his leather boot down on the live line Calvin was electrocuted almost instantly His tongue popped out of his mouth and his rubber firemans coat began to smolder He smelled like burning tires at the town dump At AM residents of Merit Street in the Old Cape felt something that might have been an underground explosion Plates fell from shelves and pictures from walls At  every toilet on Merit Street suddenly exploded in a geyser of shit and raw sewage as some unimaginable reversal took place in the pipes which fed the holding tanks of the new wastetreatment plant in the Barrens In some cases these explosions were strong enough to tear holes in bathroom ceilings A woman named Anne Stuart was killed when an ancient gearwheel catapulted from her toilet along with a gout of sewage The gearwheel went through the frosted glass of the shower door and passed through her throat like a terrible bullet as she washed her hair She was nearly decapitated The gearwheel was a relic of the Kitchener Ironworks and had found its way into the sewers almost threequarters of a century before Another woman was killed when the sudden violent reversal of sewage driven by expanding methane gases caused her toilet to explode like a bomb The unfortunate woman who was sitting on the John at the time and reading the current Banana Republic catalogue was torn to pieces At AM a bolt of lightning struck the socalled Kissing Bridge which spanned the Canal between Bassey Park and Derry High School The splintered pieces were thrown high into the air and then rained down into the swiftly moving Canal to be carried away The wind was rising At AM the gauge in the lobby of the courthouse building registered it at just over fifteen miles an hour By  it had risen to twentyfour miles an hour At AM Mike Hanlon awoke in his room at the Derry Home Hospital His return to consciousness was a kind of slow dissolvefor a long time he thought he was dreaming If so it was an odd sort of dreaman anxiety dream his old psych prof Doc Abelson might have called it There seemed to be no overt reason for the anxiety but it was there all the same the plain white room seemed to shriek menace He gradually realized that he was awake The plain white room was a hospital room Bottles hung over his head one full of clear liquid the other a deep dark red one Whole blood He saw a blank TV set bolted to the wall and became aware of the steady sound of rain beating against the window Mike tried to move his legs One moved freely but the other his right leg wouldnt move at all The feeling in that leg was very faint and he realized it was tightly bandaged Little by little it came back He had settled down to write in his notebook and Henry Bowers had turned up A real blast from the past a golden gasser There had been a fight and Mike groped for the callbell It was draped over the head of the bed and he had it in his hands when the door opened A nurse stood there Two buttons of his white tunic were unbuttoned and his dark hair was mussed giving him a rumpled Ben Casey look He wore a Saint Christopher medal around his neck Even in his soupy onlythreequartersawake state Mike placed him immediately In a sixteenyearold girl named Cheryl Lamonica had been killed in Derry killed by It The girl had had a fourteenyearold brother named Mark and this was him Shhh Mark said His hand was in his pocket No talk He walked into the room and as he stood at the foot of the bed Mike saw with a hopeless chill how blank Mark Lamonicas eyes were His head was slightly cocked as if hearing distant music He took his hand out of his pocket This will put you to sleep Mark said and began to walk toward the bed Shhhhh Bill cried suddenly although there had been no sound except their own faint footsteps Richie struck a light The walls of the tunnel had moved away and the five of them seemed very small in this space under the city They huddled together and Beverly felt a dreamy sense of deja vu as she observed the gigantic flagstones on the floor and the hanging nets of cobweb They were close now Close What do you hear she asked Bill trying to look everywhere as the match in Richies hand burned down expecting to see some new surprise come lurching or flying out of the darkness Rodan anyone The alien from that gruesome movie with Sigourney Weaver A great scuttering rat with orange eyes and silver teeth But there was nothingonly the dusty smell of the dark and far away the thunder of running water as if the drains were filling up I felt it too Ben said Is it Bill did he die No Bill said His eyes were hazy and distant unemotionalall of his alarm was in his tone and the defensive posture of his body He HHHe He swallowed There was a click in his throat His eyes widened Oh Oh no Richie dropped the match and seized one of Bills hands Beverly grabbed the other She groped with her free hand and Eddie grasped it feebly with the hand at the end of his broken arm Ben grasped his other hand and completed the circle by holding Richies hand Send him our power Bill cried in that same strange deep voice send him our power whatever You are send him our power Now Now Now Beverly felt something go out from them and toward Mike Her head rolled on her shoulders in a kind of ecstasy and the harsh whistle of Eddies breathing merged with the headlong thunder of water in the drains Now Mark Lamonica said in a low voice He sighedthe sigh of a man who feels orgasm approaching Mike pushed the callbutton in his hands again and again He could hear it ringing at the nurses station down the hall but no one came With a kind of hellish second sight he understood that the nurses were sitting around down there reading the morning paper drinking coffee hearing his callbell but not hearing it hearing but not responding they would respond only later when it was all over because that was how things worked in Derry In Derry some things were better not seen or heard until they were over Mark bent toward him the tip of the syringe glittering His Saint Christopher medal swung hypnotically back and forth as he drew the sheet down Mike suddenly felt power wash into himsome primitive power that crammed his body like volts He stiffened fingers splaying out as if in a convulsion His eyes widened A grunt jerked out of him and that sense of dreadful paralysis was driven from him as if by a roundhouse slap His right hand pistoned out toward the nighttable There was a plastic pitcher there and a heavy cafeteriastyle waterglass beside it His hand closed around the glass Lamonica sensed the change that dreamy pleased light disappeared from his eyes and was replaced by wary confusion He drew back a bit and then Mike brought the glass up and smashed it into his face Lamonica screamed and staggered backward dropping the syringe His hands went to his spouting face blood ran down his wrists and splashed on his white tunic The power left as suddenly as it had come Mike looked dully at the shards of broken glass on the bed and his hospital johnny and his own bleeding hand He heard the quick light sound of crepesoled shoes in the hall approaching Now they come he thought Oh yes now And after theyre gone wholl show As they burst into his room the nurses who had sat calmly on station as his callbell rang frantically Mike closed his eyes and prayed for it to be over He prayed his friends were somewhere under the city he prayed they were all right he prayed they would end it He didnt know exactly Who he prayed to but he prayed nonetheless Ben didnt know how long they had stood in the darkness holding hands It seemed to him that he had felt somethingsomething from them from their circlego out and then come back But he did not know where that thingif it existed at allhad gone or done YYYes Bill released Richies hand and Beverlys But we hhave to finish this as kwuhquick as we ccan CCome ohohon They went on Richie or Bill periodically lighting matches We dont have so much as a peashooter among us Ben thought But thats part of it too isnt it Chud What does that mean What was It exactly What was Its final face And even if we didnt kill It we hurt It How did we do that The chamber they walked throughit could no longer be called a tunnelgrew larger and larger Their footfalls echoed Ben remembered the smell that thick zoo smell He became aware that the matches were no longer necessarythere was light now light of a sort a ghastly effulgence that was growing steadily stronger In that marshy light his friends all looked like walking corpses Ben felt his heart begin to pick up speed There was a sour taste in his mouth and his head had begun to ache He felt slow and frightened He felt fat Yes here it was Once twentyseven years before they had been able to pass through that door by doing no more than ducking their heads Now they would have to duckwalk their way through or crawl on hands and knees They had grown here was final proof if final proof were needed The pulsepoints in Bens neck and wrists felt hot and bloody his heart had picked up a light and rapid flutter that was close to arrhythmia Pigeonpulse he thought randomly and licked his lips Bright greenishyellow light flooded out from under the door it shot through the ornate keyhole in a twisting shaft that looked almost thick enough to cut The mark was on the door and again they all saw something different in that strange device Beverly saw Toms face Bill saw Audras severed head with blank eyes that stared at him in dreadful accusation Eddie saw a grinning skull poised over two crossed bones the symbol for poison Richie saw the bearded face of a degenerate Paul Bunyan eyes narrowed to killers slits And Ben saw Henry Bowers Bill are we strong enough he asked Can we do this What if its locked Beverly asked in a small voice Toms face mocked her IhIts not Bill said Pluhhaces like this are nnever luhluhlocked He placed the tented fingers of his right hand on the doorhe had to bend over to do itand pushed It swung open on a flood of sick yellowgreen light That zoo smell wafted out at them the smell of the past become the present horribly alive obscenely vital Roll wheel Bill thought randomly and looked around at them Then he dropped to his hands and knees Beverly followed then Richie then Eddie Ben came last his flesh crawling at the feel of the ancient grit on the floor He passed through the portal and as he straightened up in the weird glow of fire crawling up and down the dripping stone walls in snakes of light the last memory socked home with the force of a psychic battering ram He cried out staggering back one hand going to his head and his first incoherent thought was No wonder Stan committed suicide Oh God I wish I had He saw the same expressions of stunned horror and dawning realization on the faces of the others as the last key turned in the last lock Then Beverly was shrieking clinging to Bill as It raced down the gossamer curtain of Its webbing a nightmare Spider from beyond time and space a Spider from beyond the fevered imaginings of whatever inmates may live in the deepest depths of hell No Bill thought coldly not a Spider either not really but this shape isnt one It picked out of our minds its just the closest our minds can come to It was perhaps fifteen feet high and as black as a moonless night Each of Its legs was as thick as a musclebuilders thigh Its eyes were bright malevolent rubies bulging from sockets filled with some dripping chromiumcolored fluid Its jagged mandibles opened and closed opened and closed dripping ribbons of foam Frozen in an ecstasy of horror tottering on the brink of utter lunacy Ben observed with an eyeofthestorm calm that this foam was alive it struck the stinking stoneflagged floor and then began to writhe away into the cracks like protozoa But Its something else theres some final shape one that I can almost see the way you might see the shape of a man moving behind a movie screen while the show is on some other shape but I dont want to see It please God dont let me see It And it didnt matter did it They were seeing what they were seeing and Ben understood somehow that It was imprisoned in this final shape the shape of the Spider by their common unsought and unfathered vision It was against this It that they would live or die The creature was squealing and mewling and Ben became quite sure he was hearing sounds It made twicein his head and then a split second later in his ears Telepathic he thought Im reading Its mind Its shadow was a squat egg that raced along the ancient wall of this keep that was Its lair Its body was covered by coarse hair and Ben saw that It was possessed of a stinger long enough to impale a man A clear fluid dripped from its tip and Ben saw that this was also alive like the saliva the poison writhed away into the cracks of the floor Its stinger yes but below that Its belly bulged grotesquely almost dragging on the floor as It moved now changing direction slightly heading unerringly toward their leader toward Big Bill Thats Its eggsac Ben thought and his mind seemed to shriek at the implication Whatever It is beyond what we see this representation is at least symbolically correct Its female and Its pregnant It was pregnant then and none of us knew except Stan oh Jesus Christ YES it was Stan Stan not Mike Stan who understood Stan who told us Thats why we had to come back no matter what because It is female Its pregnant with some unimaginable spawn and Its time has drawn close StuhStuhStay bbback Bill shouted without looking around And then Richie was running toward him shouting his name and Ben found his own legs in motion He seemed to feel a phantom stomach swaying in front of him and he welcomed the sensation Got to become a child again he thought incoherently Thats the only way I can keep It from driving me crazy Got to become a kid again got to accept it Somehow Running Shouting Bills name Vaguely aware that Eddie was running beside him his broken arm flopping the belt of the bathrobe Bill had cinched around it now trailing on the floor Eddie had drawn his aspirator He looked like a crazed malnourished gunslinger with some weird pistol Ben heard Bill bellow You kkkilled my brother you fuhfuhfucking BITCH Then It was rearing up over Bill burying Bill in Its shadow Its legs pawing the air Ben heard Its eager mewling looked into Its timeless evil red eyes and for an instant did see the shape behind the shape saw lights saw an endless crawling hairy thing which was made of light and nothing else orange light dead light that mocked life It was Bill who held them together as that great black Spider raced down Its web creating a noxious breeze that tousled their hair Stan shrieked like a baby his brown eyes bulging from their sockets his fingers harrowing his cheeks Ben backed slowly away until his ample ass struck the wall to the left of the door He felt cold fire burn through his pants and stepped away again but dreamily Surely none of this could be happening it was simply the worlds worst nightmare He found he could not lift his hands They seemed to have big weights tied to them Richie found his eyes drawn to that web Hanging here and there partially wrapped in silken strands that seemed to move as if alive were a number of rotted halfeaten bodies He thought he recognized Eddie Corcoran near the ceiling although both of Eddies legs and one of his arms were gone Beverly and Mike clung to each other like Hansel and Gretel in the woods watching paralyzed as the Spider reached the floor and scrabbled toward them Its distorted shadow racing along beside It on the wall Bill looked around at them a tall skinny boy in a mudandsewagesplattered teeshirt that had once been white jeans with cuffs mudcaked Keds His hair lay across his forehead and his eyes were blazing He surveyed them seemed to dismiss them and turned back toward the Spider And incredibly he began to cross the room toward It not running but walking fast his elbows cocked his forearms corded his hands fisted No Bill Beverly shrieked struggling free of Mikes embrace and running toward Bill her red hair flying out behind her Leave him alone she screamed at the Spider dont you touch him Shit Beverly Ben thought and then he was running too stomach swaying back and forth in front of him legs pumping He was vaguely aware that Eddie Kaspbrak was running on his left holding his aspirator in his good hand like a pistol And then It was rearing up over Bill who was unarmed It buried Bill in Its shadow Its legs pawing at the air Ben grabbed for Beverlys shoulder His hand slapped it then slipped off She turned toward him her eyes wild her lips drawn back from her teeth How Ben screamed back He wheeled toward the Spider heard Its eager mewling looked into Its timeless evil eyes and saw something behind the shape something much worse than a spider Something that was all insane light His courage faltered but it was Bev who had asked him Bev and he loved her A moment later a hand swatted his back so hard he almost fell over It was Richie and although tears were running down his cheeks Richie was grinning madly The corners of his mouth seemed to reach almost to the lobes of his ears Spit leaked out between his teeth Lets get her Haystack Richie screamed Chud Chud Frocked if I know Richie yelled then ran toward Bill and into the shadow of It It had somehow squatted on Its rear legs Its front legs pawed the air just over Bills head And Stan Uris forced to approach compelled to approach in spite of every instinct in his mind and body saw that Bill was staring up at It his blue eyes fixed on Its inhuman orange ones eyes from which that awful corpselight spilled Stan stopped understanding that the Ritual of Chudwhatever that washad begun Im Bill Denbrough You know who I am and why Im here You killed my brother and Im here to kill You You picked the wrong kid bitch you have no power here is the power feel the power brat and then speak again of how you come to kill the Eternal You think you see Me You see only what your mind will allow Would you see Me Come then Come brat Come No not thrown fired fired like a living bullet like the Human Cannonball at the Shrine Circus that came to Derry each May He was picked up and heaved across the Spiders chamber Its only in my mind he screamed at himself My bodys still standing right there eye to eye with It be brave its only a mindtrick be brave be true stand stand Roaring forward slamming into a black and dripping tunnel lined with decaying crumbling tiles that were fifty years old a hundred a thousand a millionbillion who knew rushing in deadly silence past intersections some lit by that twisting greenyellow fire some by glowing balloons full of a ghastly white skulllight others dead black he was thrown at a speed of a thousand miles an hour past piles of bones some human some not speeding like a rocketpowered dart in a windtunnel now angling upward but not toward light but toward dark some titanic dark and exploding outward into utter blackness the blackness was everything the blackness was the cosmos and the universe and the floor of the blackness was hard hard it was like polished ebonite and he was skidding along on his chest and belly and thighs like a weight on a shuffleboard He was on the ballroom floor of eternity and eternity was black stop that why do you say that that wont help you stupid boy and still insists he sees the ghosts he thrusts his fists against the posts and still insists he sees the ghosts stop it stop it I demand I command that you stop it Dont like that do you And thinking If I could only say it out loud say it without stuttering I could break this illusion this is no illusion you foolish little boythis is eternity My eternity and you are lost in it lost forever never to find your way back you are eternal now and condemned to wander in the black after you meet Me face to face that is But there was something else here Bill sensed it felt it in a crazy way smelled it some large presence ahead in the dark A Shape He felt not fear but a sense of overmastering awe here was a power which dwarfed Its power and Bill had only time to think incoherently Please please whatever You are remember that I am very small He rushed toward it and saw it was a great Turtle its shell plated with many blazing colors Its ancient reptilian head slowly poked out of its shell and Bill thought he felt a vague contemptuous surprise from the thing that had cast him out here The eyes of the Turtle were kind Bill thought it must be the oldest thing anyone could imagine older by far than It which had claimed to be eternal Im the Turtle son I made the universe but please dont blame me for it I had a bellyache has his own place in the macroverse energy is eternal as even a child such as yourself must understand He was flying past the Turtle now and even at his tremendous skidding speed the Turtles plated side seemed to go on and on to his right He thought dimly of riding in a train and passing one going in the other direction a train that was so long it seemed eventually to stand still or even move backward He could still hear It yammering and buzzing Its voice high and angry not human full of mad hate But when the Turtle spoke Its voice was blanked out utterly The Turtle spoke in Bills head and Bill understood somehow that there was yet Another and that Final Other dwelt in a void beyond this one This Final Other was perhaps the creator of the Turtle which only watched and It which only ate This Other was a force beyond the universe a power beyond all other power the author of all there was Suddenly he thought he understood It meant to thrust him through some wall at the end of the universe and into some other place where It really lived where It existed as a titanic glowing core which might be no more than the smallest mote in that Others mind he would see It naked a thing of unshaped destroying light and there he would either be mercifully annihilated or live forever insane and yet conscious inside Its homicidal endless formless hungry being He had reached the Turtles heavily scaled back legs now there was time enough to observe its titanic yet ancient flesh time to be struck with the wonder of its heavy toenailsthey were an odd bluishyellow color and he could see galaxies swimming in each one Please you are good I sense and believe that you are good and I am begging you wont you please help me son youve got to thrust your fists against the posts and still insist you see the ghosts thats all I can tell you once you get into cosmological shit like this you got to throw away the instruction manual He realized the voice of the Turtle was fading He was beyond it now bulleting into a darkness that was deeper than deep The Turtles voice was being overcome overmastered by the gleeful gibbering voice of the Thing that had thrust him out and into this black voidthe voice of the Spider of It how do you like it out here Little Friend do you like it do you love it do you give it ninetyeight points because it has a good beat and you can dance to it can you catch it on your tonsils and heave it left and right did you enjoy meeting my friend the Turtle I thought that stupid old fuck died years ago and for all the good he could do you he might as well have did you think he could help you stop babbling the time is short let us talk while we still can tell me about yourself Little Friend tell me do you love all the cold dark out here are you enjoying your grand tour of the nothingness that lies Outside wait until you break through Little Friend wait until you break through to where I am wait for that wait for the deadlights youll look and youll go mad but youll live and live and live inside them inside Me It screamed noxious laughter and Bill became aware that Its voice was beginning both to fade and to swell as if he was simultaneously drawing out of Its range and hurtling into it And wasnt that just what was happening Yes He thought it was Because while the voices were in perfect sync the one he was now rushing toward was totally alien speaking syllables no human tongue or throat could reproduce Thats the voice of the deadlights he thought the time is short let us talk while we still can Its human voice fading the way the Bangor radio stations faded when you were in the car and travelling south Bright flaring terror filled him He would shortly be beyond sane communication with It and some part of him understood that for all Its laughter for all Its alien glee that was what It wanted Not just to send him out to whatever It really was but to break their mental communication If that ceased he would be utterly destroyed To pass beyond communication was to pass beyond salvation he understood that much from the way his parents had behaved toward him after George had died It was the only lesson their refrigerator coldness had had to teach him Leaving It and approaching It But the leaving was somehow more important If It wanted to eat little kids out here or suck them in or whatever It did why hadnt It sent them all out here Why just him Because It had to rid Its Spiderself of him that was why Somehow the SpiderIt and the It which It called the deadlights were linked Whatever lived out here in the black might be invulnerable when It was here and nowhere else but It was also on earth under Derry in a form that was physical However repulsive It might be in Derry it was physical and what was physical could be killed Bill skidded through the dark his speed still increasing Why do I sense so much of Its talk is nothing but a bluff a big shuckand jive Why should that be How can that be There is only Chud the Turtle had said And suppose this was it Suppose they had bitten deep into each others tongues not physically but mentally spiritually And suppose that if It could throw Bill far enough into the void far enough toward Its eternal discorporate self the ritual would be over It would have ripped him free killed him and won everything all at the same youre doing good son but very shortly its going to be too late Its scared Scared of me Scared of all of us skidding he was skidding and there was a wall up ahead he sensed it sensed it in the dark the wall at the edge of the continuum and beyond it the other shape the deadlights dont talk to me son and dont talk to yourselfits tearing you loose bite in if you care if you dare if you can be brave if you can stand bite in son Bill bit innot with his teeth but with teeth in his mind Dropping his voice a full register making it not his own making it in fact his fathers voice although Bill would go to his grave not knowing this some secrets are never known and its probably better so drawing in a great breath he cried HE THRUSTS HIS FISTS AGAINST THE POSTS AND STILL INSISTS HE SEES THE GHOSTS NOW LET ME GO He felt It scream in his mind a scream of frustrated petulant rage but it was also a scream of fear and pain It was not used to not having Its own way such a thing had never happened to It and until the most recent moments of Its existence It had not suspected such a thing could Bill felt It writhing at him not pulling but pushingtrying to get him away BRING ME BACK YOU MUST I COMMAND IT I DEMAND IT It screamed again Its pain more intense nowperhaps partly because while It had spent Its long long existence inflicting pain feeding on it It had never experienced it as a part of Itself Still It tried to push him to get rid of him blindly and stubbornly insisting on winning as It had always won before It pushed but Bill sensed that his outward speed had slowed and a grotesque image came into his mind Its tongue covered with that living spittle extended like a thick rubber band cracking bleeding He saw himself clinging to the tip of that tongue by his teeth ripping through it a little at a time his face bathed in the convulsive ichor that was Its blood drowning in Its dead stench yet still holding on holding on somehow while It struggled in Its blind pain and towering rage not to let Its tongue snap back Chud this Chud stand be brave be true stand for your brother your friends believe believe in all the things you have believed in believe that if you tell the policeman youre lost hell see that you get home safely that there is a Tooth Fairy who lives in a huge enamel castle and Santa Claus below the North Pole making toys with his trove of elves and that Captain Midnight could be real yes he could be in spite of Calvin and Cissy Clarks big brother Carlton saying that was all a lot of baby stuff believe that your mother and father will love you again that courage ts possible and words will come smoothly every time no more Losers no more cowering in a hole in the ground and calling it a clubhouse no more crying in Georgies room because you couldnt save him and didnt know believe in yourself believe in the heat of that desire He suddenly began to laugh in the darkness not in hysteria but in utter delighted amazement OH SHIT I BELIEVE IN ALL OF THOSE THINGS he shouted and it was true even at eleven he had observed that things turned out right a ridiculous amount of the tune Light flared around him He raised his arms out and above his head He turned his face up and suddenly he felt power rush through him He heard It scream again and suddenly he was being drawn back the way he had come still holding that image of his teeth planted deep in the strange meat of Its tongue his teeth locked together like grim old death He flew through the dark legs trailing behind him the tips of his mudcrusted sneaker laces flying like pennants the wind of this empty place blowing in his ears He was pulled past the Turtle and saw that its head had withdrawn into its shell its voice emerged hollow and distorted as if even the shell it lived in were a well eternities deep not bad son but Id finish it now dont let It get away energy has a way of dissipating you know what can be done when youre eleven can often never be done again The voice of the Turtle faded faded faded There was only the rushing dark and then the mouth of a cyclopean tunnel smells of age and decay cobwebs brushing at his face like rotted skeins of silk in a haunted house moldering tiles blurring by intersections all dark now the moonballoons all gone and It was screaming screaming let me go let me go Ill leave never come back let me GO IT HURTS IT HURTS IT HURRRRRRRRRR Thrusts his fists Bill screamed nearly delirious now He could see light ahead but it was fading guttering like great candles which had at last burned low and for a moment he saw himself and the others holding hands in a line Eddie on one side of him and Richie on the other He saw his own body sagging his head rolled back on his neck staring up at the Spider which twisted and whirled like a dervish Its coarse spiny legs beating at the floor poison dripping from Its stinger Then he was slamming back into his body with all the impact of a line drive slamming into a baseball glove the force of it tearing his hands loose from Richies and Eddies driving him to his knees and skidding him across the floor to the edge of the web He reached out for one of the strands without thinking and his hand immediately went numb as if it had been injected with a hypo full of novocaine The strand itself was as thick as a telephonepole guywire Dont touch that Bill Ben yelled and Bill yanked his hand away in one quick jerk leaving a raw place across his palm just below the fingers It filled with blood and he staggered to his feet eyes on the Spider It was scrabbling away from them making Its way into the growing dimness at the back of the chamber as the light failed It left puddles and pools of black blood behind as It went somehow their confrontation had ruptured Its insides in a dozen maybe a hundred places He stepped backward craning his neck up as strands of Its web came floating down striking the stoneflagged floor on either side of him like the bodies of meaty white snakes They immediately began to lose shape to flow into the cracks between the stones The web was falling apart coming loose from its many moorings One of the bodies wrapped up like a fly came plunging down to strike the floor with a sickening rottedgourd sound He could still hear It in his head mewling and crying out in Its pain and understood dimly that It had gone into the same tunnel It had thrown Bill into but had It gone in there to flee back to the place where It had meant to send Bill or to hide until they were gone To die Or escape Christ the lights Richie shouted The lightsre going out What happened Bill Where did you go We thought you were dead In some confused part of his mind Bill knew that wasnt true if they had really thought him dead they would have run scattered and It would have picked them off easily one by one Or perhaps it would be truer to say that they had thought him dead but believed him alive We have to make sure If Its dying or gone back to where It came from where the rest of It is thats fine But what if Ifs just hurt What if It can get better What Stans shriek cut across his thoughts like broken glass In the fading light Bill saw that one of the strands of webbing had come down on Stans shoulder Before Bill could reach him Alike had thrown himself at the smaller boy in a flying tackle He drove Stan away and the piece of webbing snapped back taking a piece of Stans polo shirt with it Get back Ben yelled at them Get away from it its all coming down He seized Beverlys hand and pulled her back toward the childsized door while Stan struggled to his feet looked dazedly around and then grabbed Eddie The two of them started toward Ben and Beverly helping each other looking like phantoms in the fading light Overhead the spiderweb was drooping collapsing on itself losing its fearful symmetry Bodies twirled lazily in the air like nightmarish plumbbobs Crossstrands fell in like the rotted rungs of some strange complex of ladders Severed strands hit the stone flagging hissed like cats lost their shape began to run Mike Hanlon wove his way through them as he would later weave his way through the opposing lines of nearly a dozen highschool football teams head down ducking and dodging Richie joined him Incredibly Richie was laughing although his hair was standing straight up on his head like the quills of a porcupine The light grew dimmer the phosphorescence that had coiled on the walls now dying away Bill Mike shouted Come on Get the frock out of there What if Its not dead Bill screamed back We got to go after It Mike We got to make sure A snarl of webbing sagged outward like a parachute and then fell with a nasty ripping sound that was like skin being pulled apart Mike grabbed Bills arm and pulled him stumbling out of the way Its dead Eddie cried joining them His eyes were febrile lamps his breathing a chilly winterwhistle in his throat Fallen strands of webbing had sizzled complex scars into the plaster of Paris of his cast I heard It It was dying you dont sound like that if youre on your way to a sock hop It was dying Im sure of it Richies hands groped out of the darkness seized Bill and pulled him into a rough embrace He began to pound Bills back ecstatically I heard It tooIt was dying Big Bill It was dying and youre not stuttering Not at all Howdja do it How in the hell Bills brain was whirling Exhaustion tugged at him with thick and clumsy hands He could not remember ever feeling this tired but in his mind he heard the drawling almost weary voice of the Turtle Id finish it now dont let It get away what can be done when youre eleven can often never be done again The shadows were joining hands and now the darkness was almost complete But before the light failed utterly he thought he saw the same hellish doubt on Beverlys face and in Stans eyes And still as the last of the light gave way they could hear the tenebrous whispershudderthump of Its unspeakable web falling to pieces well here you are again Little Buddy but whats happened to your hair youre just as bald as a cueball sad what sad short lives humans live each life a short pamphlet written by an idiot tuttut and all that Im still Bill Denbrough You killed my brother and you killed Stan the Man you tried to kill Mike And Im going to tell you something this time Im not going to stop until the jobs done the Turtle was stupid too stupid to lie he told you the truth Little Buddy the time only comes around once you hurt me you surprised me never again I am the one who called you back I your friend the Turtle he died a few years ago the old idiot puked inside his shell and choked to death on a galaxy or two very sad dont you think but also quite bizarre deserves a place in Ripleys Believe It or Not thats what I think happened right around the same time you had that writers block you must have felt him go Little Buddy oh youll believe youll see this time Little Buddy I intend you to see everything including the deadlights He sensed Its voice rising buzzing and racketingat last he sensed the full extent of Its fury and he was terrified He reached for the tongue of Its mind concentrating trying desperately to recapture the full extent of that childish belief understanding at the same time that there was a deadly truth in what It had said last time It had been unprepared This time well even if It had not been the only one to call them It sure had been waiting He felt his own fury clean and singing as his eyes fixed on Its eyes He sensed Its old scars sensed that It had truly been hurt and that It was still hurt And as It threw him as he felt his mind swatted out of his body he concentrated all of his being on seizing Its tongue and missed his grip The other four watched paralyzed It was an exact replay of what had happened beforeat first The Spider which seemed about to seize Bill and gobble him up grew suddenly still Bills eyes locked with Its ruby ones There was a sense of contact a contact just beyond their ability to divine But they felt the struggle the clash of wills Then Richie glanced up into the new web and saw the first difference There were bodies there some halfeaten and halfrotted and that was the same but high up in one corner was another body and Richie was sure this one was still fresh possibly even still alive Beverly had not looked upher eyes were fixed on Bill and the Spiderbut even in his terror Richie saw the resemblance between Beverly and the woman in the web Her hair was long and red Her eyes were open but glassy and unmoving A line of spittle had run from the left corner of her mouth down to her chin She had been attached to one of the webs main cables by a gossamer harness that went around her waist and under both arms so that she lolled forward in a halfbow arms and legs dangling limply Her feet were bare Richie saw another body crumpled at the foot of her web a man he had never seen before and yet his mind registered an almost subconscious resemblance to the late unlamented Henry Bowers Blood had run from both of the strangers eyes and caked in a foam around his mouth and on his chin He Then Beverly was screaming somethings wrong Somethings gone wrong do something for Christs sake wont somebody DO something Richies gaze snapped back to Bill and the Spider and he sensed heard monstrous laughter Bills face was stretching in some subtle way His skin had gone parchmentsallow as shiny as the skin of a very old person His eyes were rolled up to the whites As Richie watched blood suddenly burst from Bills nose in a foam His mouth was writhing trying to scream and now the Spider was advancing on him again It was turning presenting Its stinger It means to kill him kill his body anyway while his mind is somewhere else It means to shut him out forever Its winning Bill where are you For Christs sake where are you And somewhere faintly from some unimaginable distance he heard Bill scream and the words although meaningless were crystalclear and full of sickening the Turtle is dead oh God the Turtle really is dead Bev shrieked again and put her hands to her ears as if to shut out that fading voice The Spiders stinger rose and Richie bolted at It a grin spreading up toward his ears and he called out in his best Irish Cops Voice Here here me foine girl Just what in the hell do ye think yere doin Belay that guff before I snatch yer pettiskirts and snap yer smithyriddles The Spider stopped laughing and Richie felt a rising howl of anger and pain inside Its head Hurt It he thought triumphantly Hurt It how about that hurt It and guess what Ive GOT ITS TONGUE I THINK BILL MISSED IT SOMEHOW BUT WHILE IT WAS DISTRACTED I GOT Then screaming at him Its cries a hive of furious bees in his head Richie was whacked out of himself and into darkness dimly aware that It was trying to shake him loose It was doing a pretty good job too Terror washed through him and then was replaced by a sense of cosmic absurdity He remembered Beverly with his Duncan yoyo showing him how to make it sleep walk the dog go around the world And now here he was Richie the Human YoYo and Its tongue was the string Here he was and this wasnt called walking the dog but maybe walking the Spider and if that wasnt funny what was Richie laughed It wasnt polite to laugh with your mouth full of course but he doubted if anybody out here read Miss Manners The Spider screamed and shook him furiously howling Its anger at being surprised againIt had believed only the writer would challenge It and now this man who was laughing like a crazy boy had seized It when It was least prepared hold eet a secon senhorrita we ees gain out here together or I ain gonna sell you no tickets in la loteria after all and every one is a big winner I swear on my mammas name He felt his teeth catch again more firmly this time And there was a fainting sort of pain as It drove Its fangs into his own tongue Boy it was still pretty funny though Even in the dark being hurled after Bill with only the tongue of this unspeakable monster left to connect him to his own world even with the pain of Its poisonous fangs suffusing his mind like a red fog it was pretty goddamned funny Check it out folks Youll believe a disc jockey can fly Richie was in greater darkness than he had ever known than he had ever suspected might exist travelling at what felt like the speed of light and being shaken as a terrier shakes a rat He sensed that there was something up ahead some titanic corpse The Turtle he had heard Bill lamenting in his fading voice Must be It was only a shell a dead husk Then he was past rushing on into the darkness Really steaming now he thought and felt that wild urge to cackle again hes gone hes in the deadlights let me go LET ME GO bill bill here I am catch hold for Gods sake catch hold hes dead youre all dead youre too old dont you understand that now let here I come Big Bill Richie to the rescue Gonna save your old cracked ass Owe you one from that day on Neibolt Street remember It was hurting badly now and Richie understood how completely he had caught It by surpriseIt had believed It had only Bill to deal with Well good Good miff Richie didnt care about killing It right now he was no longer sure It could be killed But Bill could be killed and Richie sensed that Bills time was now very very short Bill was closing in on some large nasty surprise out here something best not thought about Richie no Go back Its the edge of everything up here The deadlights souns like what you turn on when you drivinn you hearse at midnie senhorr and where is you honey chile smile so I can see where you is one side or the other And beyond him coming up fast Richie could seesense something that finally dried up his laughter It was a barrier something of a strange nongeometrical shape that his mind could not grasp Instead his mind translated it as best it could as it had translated the shape of It into a Spider allowing Richie to think of it as a colossal gray wall made of fossilized wooden stakes These stakes went forever up and forever down like the bars of a cage And from between them shone a great blind light It glared and moved smiled and snarled The light was alive More than alive it was full of a forcemagnetism gravity perhaps something else Richie felt himself lifted and dropped swirled and pulled as if he were shooting a fast throat of rapids in an innertube He could feel the light moving eagerly over his face and the light was thinking I know but sometimes honeychile I liemy mamma she beat me fo it but my daddy he done just about give up He sensed Bill tumbling and flailing toward one of the gaps in the wall sensed evil fingers of light reaching for him and with a final despairing effort he reached for his friend Bill Your hand Give me your hand YOUR HAND GODDAMMIT YOUR HAND Bills hand shot out the fingers opening and closing that living fire crawling and twisting over Audras wedding ring in runic Moorish patternswheels crescents stars swastikas linked circles that grew into rolling chains Bills face was overlaid with the same light making him look tattooed Richie stretched out as far as he could hearing It scream and yammer I missed him oh dear God I missed hes going to shoot through Then Bills fingers closed over Richies and Richie clenched his hand into a fist Bills legs flew through one of the gaps in the frozen wood and for one mad moment Richie realized he could see all the bones and veins and capillaries inside them as if Bill had shot halfway into the maw of the worlds strongest Xray machine Richie felt the muscles in his arm stretch like taffy felt the ballandsocket joint in his shoulder creak and groan in protest as the footpounds of pressure built up He summoned all of his force and shouted Pull us back Pull us back or Ill kill you I Ill Voice you to death The Spider screeched again and Richie suddenly felt a great snapping whiplash curl through his body His arm was a whitehot bar of agony His grip on Bills hand began to slip You better Richie thought grimly because I think you could walk ten billion miles out here and never find a fucking pay toilet They whistled back that crazy light fading becoming a series of brilliant pinpoints that finally winked out They drove through the darkness like torpedoes Richie gripping Its tongue with his teeth and Bills wrist with one aching hand There was the Turtle there and gone in a single eyeblink Richie sensed them drawing closer to whatever passed for the real world although he believed he would never think of it as exactly real again he would see it as a clever canvas scene underlaid with a crisscrossing of supportcables cables like the strands of a spiderweb But were going to be all right he thought Were going to get back We The buffeting began thenthe whipping slamming sidetoside flailing as It tried one final time to shake them off and leave them Outside And Richie felt his grip slipping He heard Its guttural roar of triumph and concentrated his being on holding but he continued to slip He bit down frantically but Its tongue seemed to be losing substance and reality it seemed to be becoming gossamer Eddie was halfaware of what was happening he felt it somehow saw it somehow but as if through a gauzy curtain Somewhere Bill and Richie were struggling to come back Their bodies were here but the rest of themthe real of themwas far away He had seen the Spider turn to impale Bill with Its stinger and then Richie had run forward yelling at It in that ridiculous Irish Cops Voice he used to use only Richie must have improved his act a hell of a lot over the years because this Voice sounded eerily like Mr Nell from the old days The Spider had turned toward Richie and Eddie had seen Its unspeakable red eyes bulge in their sockets Richie yelled again this time in his Pancho Vanilla Voice and Eddie had felt the Spider scream in pain Ben yelled hoarsely as a split appeared in Its hide along the line of one of Its scars from the last time A stream of ichor black as crude oil sprayed out Richie had started to say something else and his voice had begun to diminish like the fade at the end of a pop song His head had rolled back on his neck his eyes fixed on Its eyes The Spider grew quiet again Time passedEddie had no idea just how much Richie and the Spider stared at each other Eddie sensed the connection between them felt a swirl of talk and emotion somewhere far away He could make out nothing exactly but sensed the tones of things in colors and hues Bill lay slumped on the floor nose and ears bleeding fingers twitching slightly his long face pale his eyes closed The Spider was now bleeding in four or five places badly hurt again badly hurt but still dangerously vital and Eddie thought Why are we just standing around here We could hurt It while Its occupied with Richie Why doesnt somebody move for Christs sake He sensed a wild triumphand that feeling was dearer sharper Closer Theyre coming back he wanted to shout but his mouth was too dry his throat too tight Theyre coming back Then Richies head began to turn slowly from side to side His body seemed to ripple inside his clothes His glasses hung on the end of his nose for a moment then fell off and shattered on the stone floor The Spider stirred its spiny legs making a dry clittering on the floor Eddie heard It cry out in terrible triumph and a moment later Richies voice burst clearly into his head Eddie ran forward then yanking his aspirator from his pocket with his good hand his lips drawn back in a grimace his breath whistling painfully in and out of a throat that now felt the size of a pinhole Crazily his mothers face danced before him and she was crying Dont go near that Thing Eddie Dont go near It Things like that give you cancer Shut up Ma Eddie screamed in a high shrieky voiceall the voice he had left The Spiders head turned toward the sound Its eyes momentarily leaving Richies Here Eddie howled in his fading voice Here have some of this He leaped at It triggering the aspirator at the same time and for an instant all his childhood belief in the medicine came back to him the childhood medicine that could solve everything that could make him feel better when the bigger boys roughed him up or when he was knocked over in the rush to get through the doors when school let out or when he had to sit on the edge of the Tracker Brothers vacant lot out of the game because his mother wouldnt allow him to play baseball It was good medicine strong medicine and as he leaped into the Spiders face smelling Its foul yellow stench feeling himself overwhelmed by Its singleminded fury and determination to wipe them all out he triggered the aspirator into one of Its ruby eyes He feltheard Its screamno rage this time only pain a horrid screaming agony He saw the mist of droplets settle on that bloodred bulge saw the droplets turn white where they landed saw them sink in as a splash of carbolic acid would sink in he saw Its huge eye begin to flatten out like a bloody eggyolk and run in a ghastly stream of living blood and ichor and maggoty pus Come home now Bill he screamed with the last of his voice and then he struck It he felt Its noisome heat baking into him he felt a terrible wet warmth and realized that his good arm had slipped into the Spiders mouth He triggered the aspirator again shooting the stuff right down Its throat this tune right down Its rotten evil stinking gullet and there was sudden flashing pain as clean as the drop of a heavy knife as Its jaws closed and ripped his arm off at the shoulder Eddie fell to the floor the ragged stump of his arm spraying blood faintly aware that Bill was getting shakily to his feet that Richie was weaving and stumbling toward him like a drunk at the end of a long hard night Far away Unimportant He could feel everything running out of him along with his lifes blood all the rage all the pain all the fear all the confusion and hurt He supposed he was dying but he felt ah God he felt so lucid so clear like a windowpane which has been washed clean and now lets in all the gloriously frightening light of some unsuspected dawning the light oh God that perfect rational light that clears the horizon somewhere in the world every second eds oh my god bill ben someone hes lost his arm his He looked up at Beverly and saw she was crying the tears coursing down her dirty cheeks as she got an arm under him he became aware that she had taken off her blouse and was trying to staunch the flow of blood and that she was screaming for help Then he looked at Richie and licked his lips Fading fading back Becoming clearer and clearer emptying out all of the impurities flowing out of him so he could become clear so that the light could flow through and if he had had time enough he could have preached on this he could have sermonized Not bad he would begin This is not bad at all But there was something else he had to say first What Richie was down on his hands and knees staring at him desperately Dont call me Eds he said and smiled He raised his left hand slowly and touched Richies cheek Richie was crying You know I I Eddie closed his eyes thinking how to finish and while he was still thinking it over he died By AM the windspeed in Derry had picked up to about thirtyseven miles an hour with gusts up to fortyfive Harry Brooks a National Weather Service forecaster based at Bangor International Airport made an alarmed call to NWS headquarters in Augusta The winds he said were coming out of the west and blowing in a queer semicircular pattern he had never seen before but it looked to him more and more like some weird species of pocket hurricane one that was limited almost exclusively to Derry Township At  the major Bangor radio stations broadcast the first severeweather warnings The explosion of the powertransformer at Tracker Brothers had killed the power all over Derry on the Kansas Street side of the Barrens At  a hoary old maple on the Old Cape side of the Barrens fell with a terrific rending crash flattening a NiteOwl store on the corner of Merit Street and Cape Avenue An elderly patron named Raymond Fogarty was killed by a toppling beer cooler This was the same Raymond Fogarty who as the minister of the First Methodist Church of Derry had presided over the burial rites of George Denbrough in October of  The maple also pulled down enough power lines to knock out the power in both the Old Cape and the somewhat more fashionable Sherburn Woods development beyond it The clock in the steeple of the Grace Baptist Church had chimed neither six nor seven At  three minutes after the maple fell in the Old Cape and about an hour and fifteen minutes after every toilet and domestic drain over there had suddenly reversed itself the clock in the tower chimed thirteen times A minute later a bluewhite stroke of lightning struck the steeple Heather Libby the ministers wife happened to be looking out the window of the parsonages kitchen at the time and she said that the steeple exploded like someone loaded it up with dynamite Whitewashed boards chunks of beams and clockwork from Switzerland showered down on the street The ragged remains of the steeple burned briefly and then guttered out in the rain which was now a tropical downpour The streets leading downhill into the downtown shopping area foamed and ran The progress of the Canal under Main Street had become a steady shaking thunder that made people look at each other uneasily At  with the titanic crash of the Grace Baptist steeple still reverberating all over Derry the janitor who came into Wallys Spa every morning except Sunday to swamp the place out saw something which sent him screaming into the street This fellow who had been an alcoholic ever since his first semester at the University of Maine to these eleven years ago was paid a pittance for his serviceshis real pay it was understood was his absolute freedom to finish up anything left in the beer kegs under the bar from the night before Richie Tozier might or might not have remembered him he was Vincent Caruso Taliendo better known to his fifthgrade contemporaries as Boogers Taliendo As he was mopping up on that apocalyptic morning in Derry working his way gradually closer and closer to the serving area he saw all seven of the beer tapsthree Bud two Narragansett one Schlitz known more familiarly to the bleary patrons of Wallys as Slits and one Miller Litenod forward as if pulled by seven invisible hands Beer ran from them in streams of goldwhite foam Vince started forward thinking not of ghosts or phantoms but of his mornings dividend going down the drain Then he skidded to a stop eyes widening and a wailing horrified scream rose in the empty beersmelling cave that was Wallys Spa Beer had given way to arterial streams of blood It swirled in the chromium drains overflowed and ran down the side of the bar in little streamlets Now hair and chunks of flesh began to splurt out of the beertaps Boogers Taliendo watched this transfixed not even able to summon enough strength to scream again Then there was a thudding toneless blast as one of the beer kegs under the counter exploded All of the cupboard doors under the bar swung wide Greenish smoke like the aftermath of a magicians trick began to drift out of them Boogers had seen enough Screaming he fled into the street which was now a shallow canal He fell on his butt got up and threw a terrified glance back over his shoulder One of the bar windows blew out with a loud shootinggallery sound Whickers of broken glass whistled all around Vinces head A moment later the other window exploded Once again he was miraculously untouched but he decided on the spur of the moment that the time had come to see his sister up Eastport He started off at once and his journey to the Derry town limits and beyond would make a saga in itself but suffice it to say that he did eventually get out of town Others were not so lucky Aloysius Nell who had turned seventyseven not long since was sitting with his wife in the parlor of their home on Strapham Street watching the storm pound Derry At  he suffered a fatal stroke His wife told her brother a week later that Aloysius dropped his coffee cup on the rug sat boltupright his eyes wide and staring and screamed Here here me foine girl Just what in the hell do ye think yere doin Belay that guff before I snatch yer pettiskimr Then he fell out of his chair smashing his coffee cup under him Maureen Nell who knew well how bad his ticker had been for the last three years understood immediately that all was over with him and after loosening his collar she had run for the telephone to call Father McDowell But the phone was out of order A funny noise like a police siren was all it would make And so although she knew it was probably a blasphemy she would have to answer for to Saint Peter she had attempted to give him the last rites herself She felt confident she told her brother that God would understand even if Saint Peter didnt Aloysius had been a good husband and a good man and if he drank too much that was only the Irish in him coming out At  a series of explosions shook the Derry Mall which stood on the site of the defunct Kitchener Ironworks No one was killed the mall didnt open until  and the fiveman janitorial squad hadnt been due to arrive until  and on such a morning as this very few of them would have shown up anyway A team of investigators later dismissed the idea of sabotage They suggestedrather vaguelythat the explosions had probably been caused by water which had seeped into the malls electrical system Whatever the reason no one was going to go shopping at the Derry Mall for a long time One explosion totally wiped out Zales Jewelry Store Diamond rings ID bracelets strings of pearls trays of wedding rings and Seiko digital watches flew everywhere in a hail of bright sparkly trinkets A musicbox flew the length of the east corridor and landed in the fountain outside of the J C Penneys where it briefly played a bubbly rendition of the theme from Love Story before shutting down The same blast tore a hole through the BaskinRobbins next door turning the thirtyone flavors into icecream soup that ran away along the floor in cloudy runnels The blast which tore through Sears lifted off a chunk of the roof and the rising wind sailed it away like a kite it came down a thousand yards away slicing cleanly through the silo of a farmer named Brent Kilgallon Kilgallons sixteenyearold son rushed out with his mothers Kodak and took a picture The National Enquirer bought it for sixty dollars which the boy used to buy two new tires for his Yamaha motorcycle A third explosion ripped through Hit or Miss sending flaming skirts jeans and underwear out into the flooded parkinglot And a final explosion tore open the mall branch of the Derry Farmers Trust like a rotted box of crackers A chunk of the banks roof was also torn off Burglar alarms went off with a bray that would not be silenced until the security systems independent wiring hookup was shorted out four hours later Loan contracts banking instruments deposit slips cashdrawer chits and MoneyManager forms were lifted into the sky and blown away by the rising wind And money tens and twenties mostly with a generous helping of fives and a soupcon of fifties and hundreds Better than  blew away according to the banks officers Later after a mass shakeup in the banks executive structure and an FSLIC bailout some would admitstrictly off the record of coursethat it had been more like  A woman in Haven Village named Rebecca Paulson found a fiftydollar bill fluttering from her backdoor welcome mat two twenties in her birdhouse and a hundred plastered against an oak tree in her back yard She and her husband used the money to make an extra two payments on their Bombardier Skidoo Dr Hale a retired doctor who had lived on West Broadway for nearly fifty years was killed at  AM Dr Hale liked to boast that he had taken the same twomile walk from his West Broadway home and around Derry Park and the Elementary School for the last twentyfive of those fifty years Nothing stopped him not rain sleet hail howling noreasters or subzero cold He set out on the morning of May st in spite of his housekeepers worried fussings His exitline from the world spoken back over his shoulder as he went through the front door pulling his hat firmly down to his ears was dont be so goddamned silly Hilda This is nothing but a capful of rain You should have seen it in  That was a storm As Dr Hale turned back onto West Broadway a manhole cover in front of the Mueller place suddenly lifted off like the pay load of a Redstone rocket It decapitated the good doctor so quickly and neatly that he walked on another three steps before collapsing dead on the sidewalk And the wind continued to rise Eddie led them through the darkened tunnels for an hour perhaps an hour and a half before admitting in a tone that was more bewildered than frightened that for the first time in his life he was lost They could still hear the dim thunder of water in the drains but the acoustics of all of these tunnels was so crazed that it was impossible to tell if the watersounds were coming from ahead or behind left or right above or below Their matches were gone They were lost in the dark Bill was scared plenty scared The conversation hed had with his father in his fathers shop kept coming back to him Theres nine pounds of blueprints that just disappeared somewhere along the line My point is that nobody knows where all the damned sewers and drains go or why When they work nobody cares When they dont theres three or four sad sacks from Derry Water who have to try and find out which pump went flooey or where the plugup is Its dark and smelly and there are rats Those are all good reasons to stay out but the best reason is that you could get lost Its happened before Sure it had There was that bundle of bones and polished cotton they had passed on the way to Its lair for instance Bill felt panic trying to rise and pushed it back It went but not easily He could feel it back there a live thing struggling and twisting trying to get out Adding to it was the nagging unanswerable question of whether they had killed It or not Richie said yes Mike said yes so did Eddie But he hadnt liked the frightened doubtful look on Bevs face or on Stans as the light died and they crawled back through the small door away from the susurating collapsing web So what do we do now Stan asked Bill heard the frightened littleboy tremble in Stans voice and knew the question was aimed directly at him Yeah Ben said What Damn I wish we had a flashlight or even a can candle Bill thought he heard a stifled sob in the second ellipsis It frightened him more than anything else Ben would have been astounded to know it but Bill thought the fat boy tough and resourceful steadier than Richie and less apt to cave in suddenly than Stan If Ben was getting ready to crack they were on the edge of very bad trouble It was not the skeleton of the Water Department guy to which Bills own mind kept returning but to Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher lost in McDougals Cave He would push the thought away and then it would come stealing back Something else was troubling him but the concept was too large and too vague for his tired boys mind to grasp Perhaps it was the very simplicity of the idea that made it elusive they were falling away from each other The bond that had held them all this long summer was dissolving It had been faced and vanquished It might be dead as Richie and Eddie thought or It might be wounded so badly It would sleep for a hundred years or a thousand or ten thousand They had faced It seen It with Its final mask laid aside and It had been horrible enoughoh for surebut once seen Its physical form was not so bad and Its most potent weapon was taken away from It They all had after all seen spiders before They were alien and somehow crawlingly dreadful and he supposed that none of them would ever be able to see another one without feeling a shudder of revulsion But a spider was after all only a spider Perhaps at the end when the masks of horror were laid aside there was nothing with which the human mind could not cope That was a heartening thought Anything except whatever had been out there but perhaps even that unspeakable living light which crouched at the doorway to the macroverse was dead or dying The deadlights and the trip into the black to the place where they had been was already growing hazy and hard to recall in his mind And that wasnt really the point The point felt but not grasped was simply that the fellowship was ending it was ending and they were still in the dark That Other had through their friendship perhaps been able to make them something more than children But they were becoming children again Bill felt it as much as the others I dddont nuhnuhknow Bill said His stutter was back alive and well He heard it they heard it and he stood in the dark smelling the sodden aroma of their growing panic wondering how long it would be before somebodyStan most likely it would be Stantore things wide open by saying Well why dont you know You got us into this And what about Henry Mike asked uneasily Is he still out there or what Oh Jeez Eddie said almost moaned I forgot about him Sure he is sure he is hes probably as lost as we are and we could run into him any time Jeez Bill dont you have any ideas Your dad works down here Dont you have any ideas at all Bill listened to the distant mocking thunder of the water and tried to have the idea that Eddieall of themhad a right to demand Because yes correct he had gotten them into this and it was his responsibility to get them back out again Nothing came Nothing In the dark Bill heard a sound he could not immediately place A whispery little sound but not scary Then there was a more easily placed sound a zipper What he thought and then he realized what She was undressing For some reason Beverly was undressing What are you doing Richie asked and his shocked voice cracked on the last word I know something Beverly said in the dark and to Bill her voice sounded older I know because my father told me I know how to bring us back together And if were not together well never get out What Ben asked sounding bewildered and terrified What are you talking about Something that will bring us together forever Something that will show that will show that I love you all Beverly said that youre all my friends Calmly Beverly cut across his words Whos first she asked I think hes dying Beverly wept His arm It ate his armShe reached for Bill clung to him and Bill shook her off Its getting away again he roared at her Blood caked his lips and chin CuhCuhCome on Richie BBBen This tuhtime were gggoing to fuhhinish her Richie turned Bill toward him looked at him as you would look at a man who is hopelessly raving Bill we have to take care of Eddie We have to get a tourniquet on him get him out of here But Beverly was now sitting with Eddies head in her lap cradling him She had closed his eyes Go with Bill she said If you let him die for nothing if It comes back in another twentyfive years or fifty or even two thousand I swear Ill Ill haunt your ghosts Go Richie looked at her for a moment indecisive Then he became aware that her face was losing definition becoming not a face but a pale shape in the growing shadows The light was fading It decided him All right he said to Bill This time we chase Ben was standing in back of the spiderweb which had begun to decay again He had also seen the shape swaying high up in it and he prayed that Bill would not look up But as the web began to fall in drifts and strands and skeins Bill did He saw Audra sagging as if in a very old and creaky elevator She dropped ten feet stopped swaying from side to side and then abruptly dropped another fifteen Her face never changed Her eyes chinablue were wide open Her bare feet swung back and forth like pendulums Her hair hung lankly over her shoulders Her mouth was ajar The web was falling all around them now thudding to the floor and beginning to run Richie suddenly grabbed Bill around the waist and propelled him forward shooting for a tenfoothigh gap between the floor and the bottommost crossstrand of the sagging web Go Bill Go Go I dont give a shit if its the Pope Richie said grimly Eddies dead and were going to kill It if Its still alive Were going to finish the job this time Big Bill Either shes alive or shes not Now come on Bill hung back a moment longer and then snapshots of the children all the dead children seemed to flutter through his mind like lost photographs from Georges album SCHOOL FRIENDS He and Richie ran under the strand of crosswebbing seconds before it collapsed and joined Ben on the other side They ran after It as Audra swung and dangled fifty feet above the stone floor wrapped in a numbing cocoon that was attached to the decaying web They followed the trail of Its black bloodoily pools of ichor that ran and dripped into the cracks between the flagstones But as the floor began to rise toward a semicircular black opening at the far side of the chamber Ben saw something new a trail of eggs Each was black and roughshelled perhaps as big as an ostrichegg A waxy light shone from within them Ben realized they were semitransparent he could see black shapes moving inside Its children he thought and felt his gorge rise Its miscarried children God God Richie and Bill had stopped and were staring at the eggs with stupid dazed wonder Go on Go on Ben shouted Ill take care of them Get It Here Richie shouted and threw Ben a pack of Derry Town House matches Ben caught them Bill and Richie ran on Ben watched them in the rapidly dimming light for a moment They ran into the darkness of Its escapepassage and were lost from sight Then he looked down at the first of the thinshelled eggs at the black mantalike shadow inside and felt his determination waver This hey guys this was too much This was simply too awful And surely they would die without his help they had not been so much laid as dropped But Its time was close and if one of them is capable of surviving even one Summoning all of his courage summoning up Eddies pale dying face Ben brought one Desert Driver boot down on the first egg It broke with a sodden squelch as some stinking placenta ran out around his boot Then a spider the size of a rat was scrabbling weakly across the floor trying to get away and Ben could hear it in his head its high mewling cries like the sound of a handsaw being bent rapidly back and forth so that it makes ghostmusic Ben lurched after it on legs that felt like stilts and brought his foot down again He felt the spiders body crunch and splatter under the heel of his boot His gorge clenched and this time there was no way he could hold back He vomited then twisted his heel grinding the thing into the stones listening to the cries in his head fade to nothing How many How many eggs Didnt I read somewhere that spiders can lay thousands or millions I cant keep doing this Ill go mad You have to You have to Come on Ben get it together He went to the next egg and repeated the process in the last of the dying lieht Everything was repeated the brittle snap the squelch of liquid the final coup de grace The next The next The next Making his way slowly toward the black arch into which his friends had gone The darkness was complete now Beverly and the decaying web somewhere behind him He could still hear the whisper of its collapse The eggs were pallid stones in the dark As he reached each one he struck a light from the matchbook and broke it open In each case he was able to follow the course of the dazed spiderling and crush it before the light flickered out He had no idea how he was going to proceed if his matches gave out before he had crushed the last of the eggs and killed each ones unspeakable cargo It sensed them still coming gaining and Its fear grew Perhaps It was not eternal after allthe unthinkable must finally be thought Worse It sensed the death of Its young A third of these hated hateful menboys was walking steadily up Its trail of birth almost insane with revulsion but continuing nonetheless methodically stamping the life from each of Its eggs No It wailed lurching from side to side feeling Its lifeforce running from a hundred wounds none of them mortal in itself but each a song of pain each slowing It One of Its legs hung by a single living twist of meat One of Its eyes was blind It sensed a terrible rupture inside the result of whatever poison one of the hated menboys had managed to shoot down Its throat And still they came on closing the distance and how could this happen It whined and mewled and when It sensed them almost directly behind It did the only thing It could do now It turned to fight Before the last of the light faded and utter dark closed down she saw Bills wife plunge another twenty feet and then fetch up again She had begun to spin her long red hair fanning out His wife she thought But I was his first love and if he thought some other woman was his first it was only because he forgot forgot Derry Then she was in darkness alone with the sound of the falling web and Eddies simple moveless weight She didnt want to let him go didnt want to let his face lie on the foul floor of this place So she held his head in the crook of an arm that had gone mostly numb and brushed his hair away from his damp forehead She thought of the birds that was something she supposed she had gotten from Stan Poor Stan who hadnt been able to face this She tried to remember itit was something good to think about in all this darkness where you couldnt place the sounds It made her feel less alone At first it wouldnt come the image of the birds intervenedcrows and grackles and starlings spring birds that came back from somewhere while the streets were still running with meltwater and the last patches of crusted dirty snow clung grimly to their shady places It seemed to her that it was always on a cloudy day that you first heard and saw those spring birds and wondered where they came from Suddenly they were just back in Derry filling the white air with their raucous chatter They lined the telephone wires and roofpeaks of the Victorian houses on West Broadway they jostled for places on the aluminum branches of the elaborate TV antenna on top of Wallys Spa they loaded the wet black branches of the elms on Lower Main Street They settled they talked to each other in the screamy babbling voices of old countrywomen at the weekly Grange Bingo games and then at some signal which humans could not discern they all took wing at once turning the sky black with their numbers and came down somewhere else Yes the birds I was thinking of them because I was ashamed It was my father who made me ashamed I guess and maybe that was Its doing too Maybe The memory camethe memory behind the birdsbut it was vague and disconnected Perhaps this one always would be She had comes to her first because he is the most frightened He comes to her not as her friend of that summer or as her brief lover now but the way he would have come to his mother only three or four years ago to be comforted he doesnt draw back from her smooth nakedness and at first she doubts if he even feels it He is trembling and although she holds him the darkness is so perfect that even this close she cannot see him except for the rough cast he might as well be a phantom He tries to pull back but she holds him and he subsides against her She has heard someoneBen she thinksdraw in his breath I think its easy But youll have to get undressed She thinks about the intricacies of managing cast and shirt first somehow separating and then rejoining them and amends Your pants anyway No I cant But she thinks part of him can and wants to because his trembling has stopped and she feels something small and hard which presses against the right side of her belly You can she says and pulls him down The surface beneath her bare back and legs is firm clayey dry The distant thunder of the water is drowsy soothing She reaches for him Theres a moment when her fathers face intervenes harsh and forbidding and then she closes her arms around Eddies neck her smooth cheek against his smooth cheek and as he tentatively touches her small breasts she sighs and thinks for the first time This is Eddie and she remembers a day in Julycould it only have been last monthwhen no one else turned up in the Barrens but Eddie and he had a whole bunch of Little Lulu comic books and they read together for most of the afternoon Little Lulu looking for beebleberries and getting in all sorts of crazy situations Witch Hazel all of those guys It had been fun She thinks of birds in particular of the grackles and starlings and crows that come back in the spring and her hands go to his belt and loosen it and he says again that he cant do that she tells him that he can she knows he can and what she feels is not shame or fear now but a kind of triumph Where he says and that hard thing pushes urgently against her inner thigh Bevvie Ill fall on you he says and she hears his breath start to whistle painfully I think thats sort of the idea she tells him and holds him gently and guides him He pushes forward too fast and there is pain Ssssssshe draws her breath in her teeth biting at her lower lip and thinks of the birds again the spring birds lining the roofpeaks of houses taking wing all at once under low March clouds Go slower she says Itll be easier for you to breathe He does move more slowly and after awhile his breathing speeds up but she understands this is not because there is anything wrong with him The pain fades Suddenly he moves more quickly then stops stiffens and makes a soundsome sound She senses that this is something for him something extraordinarily special something like like flying She feels powerful she feels a sense of triumph rise up strongly within her Is this what her father was afraid of Well he might be There was power in this act all right a chainbreaking power that was blooddeep She feels no physical pleasure but there is a kind of mental ecstasy in it for her She senses the closeness He puts his face against her neck and she holds him Hes crying She holds him And feels the part of him that made a connection between them begin to fade It is not leaving her exactly it is simply fading becoming less When his weight shifts away she sits up and touches his face in the darkness He shakes his headshe feels it with her hand against his cheek I dont think it was exactly like you know like the big boys say But it was it was really something He speaks low so the others cant hear I love you Bevvie Her consciousness breaks down a little there Shes quite sure theres more talk some whispered some loud and cant remember what is said It doesnt matter Does she have to talk each of them into it all over again Yes probably But it doesnt matter They have to be talked into it this essential human link between the world and the infinite the only place where the bloodstream touches eternity It doesnt matter What matters is love and desire Here in this dark is as good a place as any Better than some maybe Mike comes to her then Richie and the act is repeated Now she feels some pleasure dim heat in her childish unmatured sex and she closes her eyes as Stan comes to her and she thinks of the birds spring and the birds and she sees them again and again all lighting at once filling up the winternaked trees shockwave riders on the moving edge of natures most violent season she sees them take wing again and again the flutter of their wings like the snap of many sheets on the line and she thinks A month from now every kid in Derry Park will have a kite theyll run to keep the strings from getting tangled with each other She thinks again This is what flying is like With Stan as with the others there is that rueful sense of fading of leaving with whatever they truly need from this actsome ultimateclose but as yet unfound Did you she asks again and although she doesnt know exactly what it is she knows that he hasnt There is a long wait and then Ben comes to her He is trembling all over but it is not the fearful trembling she felt in Stan Beverly I cant he says in a tone which purports to be reasonable and is anything but She sure can Theres more of this hardness more of him She can feel it below the gentle push of his belly Its size raises a certain curiosity and she touches the bulge lightly He groans against her neck and the blow of his breath causes her bare body to dimple with goosebumps She feels the first twist of real heat race through hersuddenly the feeling in her is very large she recognizes that it is too big and is he too big can she take that into herself and too old for her something some feeling that walks in boots This is like Henrys Ms something not meant for kids something that could explode and blow you up But this was not the place or time for worry here there was love desire and the dark If they didnt try for the first two they would surely be left with the last Show me how to fly she says with a calmness she doesnt feel aware by the fresh wet warmth on her cheek and neck that he has begun to cry show me Ben If you wrote the poem show me Feel my hair if you want to Ben Its all right Hes not just trembling now hes shaking all over But she senses again that this ague is not all fearpart of it is the precursor of the throe this act is all about She thinks of his face his dear sweet earnest face and knows it is not fear it is wanting he feels a deep passionate wanting now barely held in check and she feels that sense of power again something like flying something like looking down from above and seeing all the birds on the roofpeaks on the TV antenna atop Wallys seeing streets spread out maplike oh desire right this was something it was love and desire that taught you to fly She feels pain again and for a moment there is the frightening sensation of being crushed Then he props himself up on the palms of his hands and that feeling is gone Hes big oh yesthe pain is back and its much deeper than when Eddie first entered her She has to bite her lip again and think of the birds until the burning is gone But it does go and she is able to reach up and touch his lips with one finger and he moans The heat is back and she feels her power suddenly shift to him she gives it gladly and goes with it There is a sensation first of being rocked of a delicious spiralling sweetness which makes her begin to turn her head helplessly from side to side and a tuneless humming comes from between her closed lips this is flying this oh love oh desire oh this is something impossible to deny binding giving making a strong circle binding giving flying Oh Ben oh my dear yes she whispers feeling the sweat stand out on her face feeling their connection something firmly in place something like eternity the number rocked over on its side I love you so much dear And she feels the thing begin to happensomething of which the girls who whisper and giggle about sex in the girls room have no idea at least as far as she knows they only marvel at how gooshy sex must be and now she realizes that for many of them sex must be some unrealized undefined monster they refer to the act as It Would you do It do your sister and her boyfriend do It do your mom and dad still do It and how they never intend to do It oh yes you would think that the whole girls side of the fifthgrade class was made up of spinsterstobe and it is obvious to Beverly that none of them can suspect this this conclusion and she is only kept from screaming by her knowledge that the others will hear and think her badly hurt She puts the side of her hand in her mouth and bites down hard She understands the screamy laughter of Greta Bowie and Sally Mueller and all the others better now hadnt they the seven of them spent most of this the longest scariest summer of their lives laughing like loons You laugh because whats fearful and unknown is also whats funny you laugh the way a small child will sometimes laugh and cry at the same time when a capering circus clown approaches knowing it is supposed to be funny but it is also unknown full of the unknowns eternal power Biting her hand will not stay the cry and she can only reassure themand Benby crying out her affirmative in the darkness Yes Yes Yes Glorious images of flight fill her head mixing with the harsh calling of the grackles and starlings these sounds become the worlds sweetest music So she flies she flies up and now the power is not with her or with him but somewhere between them and he cries out and she can feel his arms trembling and she arches up and into him feeling his spasm his touch his total fleeting intimacy with her in the dark They break through into the lifelight together Then it is over and they are in each others arms and when he tries to say somethingperhaps some stupid apology that would hurt what she remembers some stupid apology like a handcuff she stops his words with a kiss and sends him away He tries to say something but his stutter is almost total now You be quiet she says secure in her new knowledge but aware that she is tired now Tired and damned sore The insides and backs of her thighs feel sticky and she thinks its maybe because Ben actually finished or maybe because she is bleeding Everything is going to be totally okay Yes she says and links her hands behind his neck feeling the sweaty mat of his hair You just bet It is not as it was with Ben there is passion but not the same kind Being with Bill now is the best conclusion to this that there could be He is kind tender just short of calm She senses his eagerness but it is tempered and held back by his anxiety for her perhaps because only Bill and she herself realize what an enormous act this is and how it must never be spoken of not to anyone else not even to each other At the end she is surprised by that sudden upsurge and she has time to think Oh Its going to happen again I dont know if I can stand it But her thoughts are swept away by the utter sweetness of it and she barely hears him whispering I love you Bev I love you Ill always love you saying it over and over and not stuttering at all She hugs him to her and for a moment they stay that way his smooth cheek against hers He withdraws from her without saying anything and for a little while shes alone putting her clothes back together slowly putting them on aware of a dull throbbing pain of which they being male will never know aware also of a certain exhausted pleasure and the relief of having it over There is an emptiness down there now and although she is glad that her sex is her own again the emptiness imparts a strange melancholy which she could never express except to think of bare trees under a white winter sky empty trees trees waiting for blackbirds to come like ministers at the end of March to preside over the death of snow For a moment no one speaks and when someone does it does not surprise her much that its Eddie I think when we went right two turns back we shoulda gone left Jeez I knew that but I was so sweaty and frigged up Been frigged up your whole life Eds Richie says His voice is pleasant The raw edge of panic is completely gone We went wrong some other places too Eddie says ignoring him but thats the worst one If we can find our way back there we just might be okay They form up in a clumsy line Eddie first Beverly second now her hand on Eddies shoulder as Mikes is on hers They begin to move again faster this time Eddie displays none of his former nervous care Were going home she thinks and shivers with relief and joy Home yes And that will be good Weve done our job what we came for now we can go back to just being kids again And that will be good too As they move through the dark she realizes the sound of running water is closer By ten past nine Derry windspeeds were being clocked at an average of fiftyfive miles an hour with gusts up to seventy The anemometer in the courthouse registered one gust of eightyone and then the needle dropped all the way back to zero The wind had ripped the whirling cuplike device on the courthouse roof off its moorings and it flew away into the rainswept dimness of the day Like George Denbroughs boat it was never seen again By ninethirty the thing the Derry Water Department had sworn was now impossible seemed not only possible but imminent that downtown Derry might be flooded for the first time since August of when many of the old drains had clogged up or caved in during a freak rainstorm By quarter often men with grim faces were arriving in cars and pickup trucks along both sides of the Canal their foulweather gear rippling crazily in the freighttrain wind For the first time since October of  sandbags began to go up along the Canals cement sides The arch where the Canal went under the threeway intersection at the heart of Derrys downtown area was full almost to the top Main Street Canal Street and the foot of UpMile Hill were impassable except by foot and those who splashed and hurried their way toward the sandbagging operation felt the very streets beneath their feet trembling with the frenzied flow of the water the way a turnpike overpass will tremble when big trucks pass each other But this was a steady vibration and the men were glad to be on the north side of downtown away from that steady rumbling that was felt rather than heard Harold Gardener shouted at Alfred Zitner who ran Zitners Realty on the west side of town asked him if the streets were going to collapse Zitner said hell would freeze over before something like that happened Harold had a brief image of Adolf Hitler and Judas Iscariot handing out iceskates and went on heaving sandbags The water was now less than three inches below the top of the Canals cement walls In the Barrens the Kenduskeag was already out of its banks and by noon the luxuriant undergrowth and scrub trees would be poking out of a vast shallow stinking lake The men continued to work pausing only when the supply of sandbags ran out and then at ten of ten they were frozen by a great rending ripping sound Harold Gardener later told his wife he thought maybe the end of the world had come It wasnt downtown falling into the earthnot thenit was the Standpipe Only Andrew Keene Norbert Keenes grandson actually saw it happen and he had smoked so much Colombian Red that morning that at first he thought it had to be a hallucination He had been wandering Derrys stormswept streets since about eight oclock roughly the same time that Dr Hale was ascending to that great family medical practice in the sky He was drenched to the skin except for the twoounce baggie of pot tucked up into his armpit that was but totally unaware of it His eyes widened in disbelief He had reached Memorial Park which stood on the flank of Standpipe Hill And unless he was wrong the Standpipe now had a pronounced lean like that fuckedup tower in Pisa that was on all the macaroni boxes Oh wow Andrew Keene cried his eyes widening even morethey looked as if they might be on small tough springs nowas the splintering sounds began The Standpipes lean was becoming more and more acute as he stood there with his jeans plastered to his skinny shanks and his drenched paisley headband dripping water into his eyes White shingles were popping off the downtown side of the great round watertower no not exactly popping off it was more like they were squirting off And a definite crinkle had appeared about twenty feet above the Standpipes stone foundation Water suddenly began to spray out through this crinkle and now the shingles werent squirting off the Standpipes downtown side they were spewing into the windstream A rending sound began to come from the Standpipe and Andrew could see it moving like the hand of a great clock inclining from noon to one to two The baggie of pot fell out of his armpit and fetched up inside his shirt somewhere near his belt He didnt notice He was utterly fetched Large twanging sounds came from inside the Standpipe as if the strings of the worlds biggest guitar were being broken one by one These were the cables inside the cylinder which had provided the proper balance of stress against the waterpressure The Standpipe began to heel over faster and faster boards and beams ripping apart splinters jumping and whirling into the air FAAAR FUCKING OWWWWT Andrew Keene shrieked but it was lost in the Standpipes final crashing fall and by the rising sound of one and threequarter million gallons of water seven thousand tons of water pouring out of the buildings ruptured spouting side It went in a gray tidal wave and of course if Andrew Keene had been on the downhill side of the Standpipe he would have exited the world in no time But God favors drunks small children and the cataclysmically stoned Andrew was standing in a place where he could see it all and not be touched by a single drop GREAT FUCKING SPECIAL EFFECTS Andrew screamed as the water rolled over Memorial Park like a solid thing sweeping away the sundial beside which a small boy named Stan Uris had often stood watching birds with his fathers field glasses sTEVEN SPIELBERG EAT YOUR HEART OUT The stone birdbath also went Andrew saw it for a moment turning over and over pedestal for dish and dish for pedestal and then it was gone A line of maples and birches separating Memorial Park from Kansas Street were knocked down like so many pins in a bowling alley They took wild spiky snarls of power lines with them The water rolled across the street beginning to spread now beginning to look more like water than that mindboggling solid wall that had taken sundial birdbath and trees but it still had power enough to sweep almost a dozen houses on the far side of Kansas Street off their foundations and into the Barrens They went with sickening ease most of them still whole Andrew Keene recognized one of them as belonging to the Karl Massensik family Mr Massensik had been his sixthgrade teacher a real pooch As the house went over the edge and down the slope Andrew realized he could still see a candle burning brightly in one window and he wondered briefly if he might be mentally highsiding it if you could dig the concept There was an explosion from the Barrens and a brief gout of yellow flame as someones Coleman gas lantern ignited oil pouring out of a ruptured fueltank Andrew stared at the far side of Kansas Street where until just forty seconds ago there had been a neat line of middleclass houses They were Gone City now and you better believe it sweet thing In their places were ten cellarholes that looked like swimmingpools Andrew wanted to advance the opinion that this was far fucking out but he couldnt yell anymore Seemed like his yeller was busted His diaphragm felt weak and useless He heard a series of crunching thuds the sound of a giant with his shoes full of Ritz crackers marching down a flight of stairs It was the Standpipe rolling down the hill a huge white cylinder still spouting the last of its water supply the thick cables that had helped to hold it together flying into the air and then cracking down again like steel bullwhips digging runnels in the soft earth that immediately filled up with rushing rainwater As Andrew watched with his chin resting somewhere between his collarbones the Standpipe horizontal now better than a hundred and twentyfive feet long flew out into the air For a moment it seemed frozen there a surreal image straight out of rubberwalled straitjacketed toodleoo land rainwater sparkling on its shattered sides its windows broken casements hanging the flashing light on top meant as a warning for lowflying light planes still flashing and then it fell into the street with a final rending crash Kansas Street had channelled a lot of the water and now it began to rush toward downtown by way of UpMile Hill There used to be houses over there Andrew Keene thought and suddenly all the strength ran out of his legs He sat down heavilykersplash He stared at the broken stone foundation on which the Standpipe had stood for his whole life He wondered if anyone would ever believe him He wondered if he believed it himself Bill and Richie saw It turn toward them Its mandibles opening and closing Its one good eye glaring down at them and Bill realized It gave off Its own source of illumination like some grisly lightningbug But the light was flickering and uncertain It was badly hurt Its thoughts buzzed and racketed let me go let me go and you can have everything youve ever wantedmoney fame fortune powerI can give you these things Bill moved forward emptyhanded his eyes fixed on Its single red one He felt the power growing inside him investing him knotting his arms into cords filling each clenched fist with its own force Richie walked beside him his lips pulled back over his teeth I can give you your wife backI can do it only Ishell remember nothing as the seven of you remembered nothing They were close very close now Bill could smell Its stinking aroma and realized with sudden horror that it was the smell of the Barrens the smell they had taken for the smell of sewers and polluted streams and the burning dump but had they ever really believed those were all it had been It was the smell of It and perhaps it had been strongest in the Barrens but it had hung over all Derry like a cloud and people just didnt smell it the way zookeepers dont smell their charges after awhile or even wonder why the visitors wrinkle their noses when they come in Us two he muttered to Richie and Richie nodded without taking his eyes off the Spider which now shrank back from them Its abominable spiny legs Glittering brought to bay at last I cant give you eternal life but I can touch you and you will live long long livestwo hundred years three hundred perhaps five hundredI can make you gods of the Earthif you let me go if you let me go if you let me With a scream building in him building up and up and up Bill charged Richie ran with him stride for stride They struck together with their right fists but Bill understood it was not really their fists they were striking with at all it was their combined force augmented by the force of that Other it was the force of memory and desire above all else it was the force of love and unforgotten childhood like one big wheel The Spiders shriek filled Bills head seeming to splinter his brains He felt his fist plunge deep into writhing wetness His arm followed it in up to the shoulder He pulled it back dripping with the Spiders black blood Ichor poured from the hole he had made He saw Richie standing almost beneath Its bloated body covered with Its darkly sparkling blood standing in the classic boxers stance his dripping fists pumping The Spider lashed at them with Its legs Bill felt one of them rip down his side parting his shirt parting skin Its stinger pumped uselessly against the floor Its screams were clarionbells in his head It lunged clumsily forward trying to bite him and instead of retreating Bill drove forward using not just his fist now but his whole body making himself into a torpedo He ran into Its gut like a sprinting fullback who lowers his shoulders and simply drives straight ahead For a moment he felt Its stinking flesh simply give as if it would rebound and send him flying With an inarticulate scream he drove harder pushing forward and upward with his legs digging at It with his hands And he broke through was inundated with Its hot fluids They ran across his face in his ears He snuffled them up his nose in thin squirming streams He was in the black again up to his shoulders inside Its convulsing body And in his clogged ears he could hear a sound like the steady whackWHACKwhackWHACK of a big bass drum the one that leads the parade when the circus comes to town with its complement of freaks and strutting capering clowns He heard Richie scream in sudden pain a sound that rose into a quick gasping moan and was cut off Bill suddenly thrust both fisted hands forward He was choking strangling in Its pulsing bag of guts and waters He plunged his hands into It ripping tearing parting seeking the source of the sound rupturing organs his slimed fingers opening and closing his locked chest seeming to swell from lack of air And suddenly it was in his hands a great living thing that pumped and pulsed against his palms pushing them back and forth Yes Bill cried choking drowning Yes Try this you bitch TRY THIS ONE OUT DO YOU LIKE IT DO YOU LOVE IT DO YOU He laced his fingers together over the pulsing narthex of Its heart palms spread apart in an inverted Vand brought them together with all the force he could muster There was one final shriek of pain and fear as Its heart exploded between his hands running out between his fingers in jittering strings The scream fading dwindling Bill felt Its body clench around him suddenly like a fist in a slick glove Then everything loosened He became aware that Its body was tilting slipping slowly off to one side At the same time he began pulling back his consciousness leaving him The Spider collapsed on Its side a huge bundle of steaming alien meat Its legs still quivering and jerking caressing the sides of the tunnel and scraping across the floor in random scrawls Bill staggered away breathing in whooping gasps spitting in an effort to clear his mouth of Its horrible taste He tripped over his own feet and fell to his knees And clearly he heard the Voice of the Other the Turtle might be dead but whatever had invested it was not Then it was gone The power went with it He felt weak revulsed halfinsane He looked over his shoulder and saw the dying black nightmare of the Spider still jerking and quivering Richie He cried out in a hoarse breaking voice Richie where are you The light was gone now It had died with the Spider He fumbled in the pocket of his matted shirt for the last book of matches They were there but they wouldnt light the heads were soaked with blood Richie he screamed again beginning to weep now He began to crawl forward first one hand and then the other groping in the dark At last one of them struck something which yielded limply to his touch His hands flew over it and stopped as they touched Richies face Still no answer Struggling in the dark Bill got one arm under Richies back and the other under his knees He wobbled to his feet and began to stumble back the way they had come with Richie in his arms At the steady vibration which had been running through Derrys downtown streets increased to a rumbling roar The Derry News would later write that the supports of the Canals underground portion weakened by the savage assault of what amounted to a flash flood simply collapsed There were however people who disagreed with that view I was there I know Harold Gardener later told his wife It wasnt just that the Canals supports collapsed It was an earthquake thats what it was It was a fucking earthquake Either way the results were the same As the rumbling built steadily up and up windows began to shatter plaster ceilings began to fall and the inhuman cry of twisting beams and foundations swelled into a frightening chorus Cracks raced up the bulletpocked brick facade of Machens like grasping hands The cables holding the marquee of the Aladdin Theater out over the street snapped and the marquee came crashing down Richards Alley which ran behind the Center Street Drug suddenly filled up with an avalanche of yellow brick as the Brian X Dowd Professional Building erected in came crashing down A huge screen of jaundicecolored dust rose in the air and was snatched away like a veil At the same time the statue of Paul Bunyan in front of the City Center exploded It was as if that longago art teachers threat to blow it up had finally proved to be dead serious after all The bearded grinning head rose straight up in the air One leg kicked forward the other back as if Paul had attempted some sort of a split so enthusiastic it had resulted in dismemberment The statues midsection blew out in a cloud of shrapnel and the head of the plastic axe rose into the rainy sky disappeared and then came down again twirling end over end It sheared through the roof of the Kissing Bridge and then its floor Most of the water from the ruptured Standpipe had crossed Kansas Street and ended up in the Barrens but tons of it rushed down into the business district by way of UpMile Hill Perhaps that was the straw that broke the camels back or perhaps as Harold Gardener told his wife there really was an earthquake Cracks raced across the surface of Main Street They were narrow at first and then they began to gape like hungry mouths and the sound of the Canal floated up not muffled now but frighteningly loud Everything began to shake The neon sign proclaiming OUTLET MOCCASINS in front of Shorty Squiress souvenir shop hit the street and shorted out in three feet of water A moment or two later Shortys building which stood next to Mr Paperback began to descend Buddy Angstrom was the first to see this phenomenon He elbowed Alfred Zitner who looked gaped and then elbowed Harold Gardener Within a space of seconds the sandbagging operation stopped The men lining both sides of the Canal only stood and stared toward downtown in the pouring rain their faces stamped with identical expressions of horrified wonder Squiress Souvenirs and Sundries appeared to have been built on some huge elevator which was now on the way down It sank into the apparently solid concrete with ponderous stately dignity When it came to a stop you could have dropped to your hands and knees on the flooded sidewalk and entered through one of the thirdfloor windows Water sprayed up all around the building and a moment later Shorty himself appeared on the roof waving his arms madly for rescue Then he was obliterated as the officebuilding next door the one which housed Mr Paperback at ground level also sank into the ground Unfortunately this one did not go straight down as Shortys building had done the Mr Paperback building developed a marked lean for a moment in fact it bore a strong resemblance to that fuckedup tower in Pisa the one on the macaroni boxes As it tilted bricks began to shower from its top and sides Shorty was struck by several Harold Gardener saw him reel backward hands to his head and then the top three floors of the Mr Paperback building slid off as neatly as pancakes from the top of a stack Shorty disappeared Someone on the sandbag line screamed and then everything was lost in the grinding roar of destruction Men were knocked off their feet or sent wobbling and staggering back from the Canal Harold Gardener saw the buildings which faced each other across Main Street lean forward like ladies kibbitzing over a cardgame their heads almost touching The street itself was sinking cracking breaking up Water splashed and sprayed And then one after another buildings on both sides of the street simply swayed past their centers of gravity and crashed into the streetthe Northeast Bank The Shoeboat Alveys Smokes n Jokes Bailleys Lunch Bandlers Record and Music Barn Except that by then there was really no street for them to crash into The street had fallen into the Canal stretching like taffy at first and then breaking up into bobbing chunks of asphalt Harold saw the trafficisland at the threestreet intersection suddenly drop out of sight and as water geysered up he suddenly understood what was going to happen Gotta get out of here he screamed at Al Zitner Its gonna backwater Al Its gonna backwater Al Zitner gave no sign that he had heard His was the face of a sleepwalker or perhaps of a man who has been deeply hypnotized He stood in his soaked redandbluechecked sportcoat in his opencollared Lacoste shirt with the little alligator on the left boob in his blue socks with the crossed white golfclubs knitted into their sides in his brown L L Beans boat shoes with the rubber soles He was watching perhaps a million dollars of his own personal investments sinking into the street three or four millions of his friends investmentsthe guys he played poker with the guys he golfed with the guys he skied with at his timesharing condo in Rangely Suddenly his home town Derry Maine for Christs sake looked bizarrely like that fuckedup city where the wogs pushed people around in those long skinny canoes Water roiled and boiled between the buildings that were still standing Canal Street ended in a jagged black diving board over the edge of a churning lake It was really no wonder Zitner hadnt heard Harold Others however had come to the same conclusion Gardener had come toyou couldnt drop that much shit into a raging body of water without causing a lot of trouble Some dropped the sandbags they had been holding and took to their heels Harold Gardener was one of these and so he lived Others were not so lucky and were still somewhere in the general area as the Canal its throat now choked with tons of asphalt concrete brick plaster glass and about four million dollars worth of assorted merchandise backsurged and poured over its concrete sleeve carrying away men and sandbags impartially Harold kept thinking it meant to have him no matter how fast he ran the water kept gaming He finally escaped by clawing his way up a steep embankment covered with shrubbery He looked back once and saw a man he believed to be Roger Lernerd the head loan officer at Harolds credit union trying to start his car in the parkinglot of the Canal MiniMall Even over the roar of the water and the bellowing wind Harold could hear the Kcars little sewingmachine engine cranking and cranking and cranking as smooth black water ran rockerpanel high on both sides of it Then with a deep thundering cry the Kenduskeag poured out of its banks and swept both the Canal MiniMall and Roger Lernerds bright red Kcar away Harold began climbing again grabbing onto branches roots anything that looked solid enough to take his weight Higher ground that was the ticket As Andrew Keene might have said Harold Gardener was really into the concept of higher ground that morning Behind him he could hear downtown Derry continuing to collapse The sound was like artillery fire Beverly he shouted His back and arms were one solid throbbing ache Richie now seemed to weigh at least five hundred pounds Put him down then his mind whispered Hes dead you know damn well he is so why dont you just put him down He thought This is where It threw meand Richieexcept It threw us fartherso much farther What was that like Im losing it forgetting Bill It was Bens voice shaky and exhausted somewhere fairly close Where are you We killed It Bill said walking toward where Bens voice had come from We killed the bitch And if Richies dead Dead Ben called alarmed He was very close now and then his hand groped out of the dark and pawed lightly at Bills nose What do you mean dead I he They were supporting Richie together now I cant see him Bill said Thats the thing I cuhcuhhant suhsuhsee him Richie Ben shouted and shook him Richie come on Come on goddammit Bens voice was blurring now becoming shaky RICHIE WILL YOU WAKE THE FUCK UP And in the dark Richie said in a sleepy irritable justcomingoutofit voice All rye Haystack All rye We doan need no stinkin batches Bitch threw me Richie muttered in that same tired justcomingoutofsleep voice I hit something hard Thats all all I remember Wheres Bevvie Back this way Ben said Quickly he told them about the eggs I stamped over a hundred I think I got all of them I pray to God you did Richie said He was starting to sound better Put me down Big Bill I can walk Is the water louder Yes Bill said The three of them were holding hands in the dark Hows your head Bill told them as much as he could bring himself to tell Thank God Richie said Hold onto me Bill I gotta barf Bill did and when Richie was done they walked on Every now and then his foot struck something brittle that rolled off into the darkness Parts of the Spiders eggs that Ben had tromped to pieces he supposed and shivered It was good to know they were going in the right direction but he was still glad he couldnt see the remains Her cry was faint almost lost in the steady rumble of the water They moved forward in the dark calling to her steadily zeroing in When they finally reached her Bill asked if she had any matches left She put half a pack in his hand He lit one and saw their faces spring into ghostly beingBen with his arm around Richie who was standing slumped blood running from his right temple Beverly with Eddies head in her lap Then he turned the other way Audra was lying crumpled on the flagstones her legs asprawl her head turned away The webbing had mostly melted off her The match burned his fingers and he let it drop In the darkness he misjudged the distance tripped over her and nearly went sprawling He got an arm under her back and sat her up He slipped a hand under the sheaf of her hair and pressed his fingers against the side of her neck Her pulse was there a slow steady beat He lit another match and as it flared he saw her pupils contract But that was an involuntary function the fix of her gaze did not change even when he brought the match close enough to her face to redden her skin She was alive but unresponsive Hell it was worse than that and he knew it She was catatonic Bill I dont like the sound of that water Ben said I think we ought to get out of here We can do it Bev said Bill Bens right We have to get out Youll know Beverly said softly You killed It Youll know Bill He picked Audra up as he had picked Richie up and went back to the others The feel of her in his arms was disquieting creepy she was like a breathing waxwork Well ccome on Bill said Lets see if we cant find out Beverly gruhgruhhab these He handed her the matches What about Eddie she asked We have to take him out How ccan wwe Bill asked Its BBeverly the pluhhace is ffalling apart We gotta get him out of here man Richie said Come on Ben Between them they managed to hoist up Eddies body Beverly lit them back to the fairytale door Bill took Audra through it holding her up from the floor as best he could Richie and Ben carried Eddie through Its too dark Richie sobbed You know its too dark Eds he No its okay Ben said Maybe this is where hes supposed to be I think maybe it is They put him down and Richie kissed Eddies cheek Then he looked blindly up at Ben You sure Richie got up and turned toward the door Fuck you Bitch he cried suddenly and kicked the door shut with his foot It made a solid chukking sound as it closed and latched I dont know Richie said but he knew well enough He looked back over his shoulder just as the match Beverly was holding went out The glass corridor connecting the adult library to the Childrens Library suddenly exploded in a single brilliant flare of light Glass flew out in an umbrella shape whickering through the straining whipping trees which dotted the library grounds Someone could have been severely hurt or even killed by such a deadly fusillade but there was no one there either inside or out The library had not been opened that day at all The tunnel which had so fascinated Ben Hanscom as a boy would never be replaced there had been so much costly destruction in Derry that it seemed simpler to leave the two libraries as separate unconnected buildings In time no one on the Derry City Council could even remember what that glass umbilicus had been for Perhaps only Ben himself could really have told them how it was to stand outside In the still cold of a January night your nose running the tips of your fingers numb inside your mittens watching the people pass back and forth inside walking through winter with their coats off and surrounded by light He could have told them but maybe it wasnt the sort of thing you could have gotten up and testified about at a City Council meetinghow you stood out in the cold dark and learned to love the light All of thats as may be the facts were just these the glass corridor blew up for no apparent reason no one was hurt which was a blessing since the final toll taken by that mornings stormin human terms at leastwas sixtyseven killed and better than three hundred and twenty injured and it was never rebuilt After May st of if you wanted to get from the Childrens Library to the adult library you had to walk outside to do it And if it was cold or raining or snowing you had to put on your coat Let me help you with her Richie said again They had left Eddie back in the Spiders lair and that was something none of them wanted to talk about But Eddie was dead and Audra was still aliveat least technically Bullshit Youll give yourself a fucking heart attack Let me help you Big Bill Reluctantly Bill let Richie take her It could have been worse Audra was a tall girl whose normal weight was one hundred and forty pounds But the part shed been scheduled to play in Attic Room was that of a young woman being held hostage by a borderline psychotic who fancied himself a political terrorist Because Freddie Firestone had wanted to shoot all of the attic sequences first Audra had gone on a strict poultrycottagecheesetunafish diet and lost twenty pounds Still after stumblestaggering along with her in the dark for a quarter of a mile or a half or threequarters of a mile or who knew that one hundred and twenty felt more like two hundred Beepbeep Richie Ben said and Bill grinned in spite of himself It was a tired grin and it didnt last long but a little was better than none Which way Bill Beverly asked That water sounds louder than ever I dont really fancy drowning down here Straight ahead then left Bill said Maybe we better try to go a little faster They went on for half an hour Bill calling the lefts and rights The sound of the water continued to swell until it seemed to surround them a scary Dolby stereo effect in the dark Bill felt his way around a corner one hand trailing over damp brick and suddenly water was running over his shoes The current was shallow and fast Give me Audra he said to Ben who was panting loudly Upstream now Ben passed her carefully back to Bill who managed to sling her over his shoulder ma firemans carry If shed only protest move do something Hows matches Bev Not many Half a dozen maybe Bill do you know where youre going They followed him around the corner The water foamed about Bills ankles then it was up to his shins and then it was thighdeep The thunder of the water had deepened to a steady bass roar The tunnel they were in was shaking steadily For awhile Bill thought the current was going to become too strong to walk against but then they passed a feederpipe that was pouring a huge jet of water into their tunnelhe marvelled at the whitewater force of itand the current slacked off somewhat although the water continued to deepen It I saw the water coming out of that feederpipe Saw it Its been getting lighter for the last fifteen minutes or so Beverly shouted back Where are we Bill Do you know He had believed they must be approaching the concretechannelled section of the Kenduskeag that was called the Canal the part that went under downtown and came out in Bassey Park But there was light down here light and surely there could be no light in the Canal under the city But it brightened steadily just the same Bill was beginning to have serious problems with Audra It wasnt the currentthat had slackenedit was the depth Pretty soon Ill be floating her he thought He could see Ben on his left and Beverly on his right by turning his head slightly he could see Richie behind Ben The footing was getting decidedly odd The bottom of the tunnel was now heaped and mounded with detritusbricks it felt like And up ahead something was sticking out of the water like the prow of a ship that is in the process of sinking Ben floundered toward it shivering in the cold water A soggy cigar box floated into his face He pushed it aside and grabbed at the thing sticking out of the water His eyes widened It appeared to be a large sign He was able to read the letters AL and below that FUT And suddenly he knew Grabbing it with both hands Ben rocked it back There was a grating sound as one side of the sign scraped along the wall of the tunnel Now they could read ALADDI and below that BACK TO THE FUTURE The street caved in Bill whispered His eyes were widening He stared up the tunnel The light was brighter still up ahead All these drains Bill said wildly All these old drains Theres been another flood And I think this time He began to flounder ahead again holding Audra up Ben Bev and Richie fell in behind him Five minutes later Bill looked up and saw blue sky He was looking through a crack in the ceiling of the tunnel a crack that widened to better than seventy feet across as it ran away from where he stood The water was broken by many islands and archipelagos up aheadpiles of bricks the back deck of a Plymouth sedan with its trunk sprung open and pouring water a parkingmeter leaning against the tunnel wall at a drunken slant its red VIOLATION flag up The footing had become almost impossible nowminimountains that rose and fell with no rhyme or reason inviting a broken ankle The water ran mildly around their armpits Mild now Bill thought But if wed been here two hours ago even one I think we might have gotten the ride of our lives What the fuck is this Big Bill Richie asked He was standing at Bills left elbow his face soft with wonder as he looked up at the rip in the roof of the tunnelexcept its not the roof of any tunnel Bill thought Its Main Street At least it used to be I think most of downtown Derry is now in the Canal and being carried down the Kenduskeag River Pretty soon itll be in the Penobscot and then it will be in the Atlantic Ocean and good fucking riddance Can you help me with Audra Richie I dont think I can He took Audra from Bill In this light Bill could see her better than he perhaps wanted toher pallor masked but not hidden by the dirt and ordure that smeared her forehead and caked her cheeks Her eyes were still wide open wide open and innocent of all sense Her hair hung lank and wet She might as well have been one of those inflatable doilies they sold at the Pleasure Chest in New York or along the Reeperbahn in Hamburg The only difference was her slow steady respiration and that might have been a clockwork trick no more than that How are we going to get up from here he asked Richie Get Ben to give you ten fingers Richie said You can yank Bev up and the two of you can get your wife Ben can boost me and well get Ben And after that Ill show you how to set up a volleyball tournament for a thousand sorority girls The tiredness was going through him in steady waves He caught Beverlys level gaze and held it for a moment She nodded to him slightly and he made a smile for her Ben who also looked unutterably weary nodded A deep scratch ran down one cheek I think I can handle that He stooped slightly and laced his hands together Bill hiked one foot stepped into Bens hand and jumped up It wasnt quite enough Ben lifted the step he had made with his hands and Bill grabbed the edge of the brokenin tunnel roof He yanked himself up The first thing he saw was a whiteandorange crash barrier The second thing was a crowd of milling men and women beyond the barrier The third was Freeses Department Storeonly it had an oddly bulgedout foreshortened look It took him a moment to realize that almost half of Freeses had sunk into the street and the Canal beneath The top half had slued out over the street and seemed in danger of toppling over like a pile of badly stacked books A woman was pointing toward the place where Bills head had poked out of the crevasse in the shattered pavement She started forward an elderly woman with a kerchief tied over her head peasantstyle A cop held her back Not safe out there Mrs Nelson You know it Rest of the street might go any time Mrs Nelson Bill thought I remember you Your sister used to sit George and me sometimes He raised his hand to show her he was all right and when she raised her own hand in return he felt a sudden surge of good feelingsand hope He turned around and lay flat on the sagging pavement trying to distribute his weight as evenly as possible the way you were supposed to do on thin ice He reached down for Bev She grasped his wrists and with what seemed to be the last of his strength he pulled her up The sun which had disappeared again now ran out from behind a brace of mackerelscale clouds and gave them their shadows back Beverly looked up startled caught Bills eyes and smiled I love you Bill she said And I pray shell be all right Thuhhank you Bevvie he said and his kind smile made her start to cry a little He hugged her and the small crowd gathered behind the crash barrier applauded A photographer from the Derry News snapped a picture It appeared in the June st edition of the paper which was printed in Bangor because of water damage to the Newss presses The caption was simple enough and true enough for Bill to cut the picture out and keep it tucked away in his wallet for years to come SURVIVORS the caption read That was all but that was enough The glass corridor between the Childrens Library and the adult library had exploded at AM At  the rain stopped It didnt taper off it stopped all at once as if Someone Up There had flicked a toggle switch The wind had already begun to fall and it fell so rapidly that people stared at each other with uneasy superstitious faces The sound was like the winddown of a s engines after it has been safely parked at the gate The sun peeked out for the first time at  By midafternoon the clouds had burned away entirely and the day had come off fair and hot By  PM the mercury in the Orange Crush thermometer outside the door of Secondhand Rose Secondhand Clothes read eightythreethe highest reading of the young season People walked through the streets like zombies not talking much Their expressions were remarkably similar a kind of stupid wonder that would have been funny if it was not also so frankly pitiable By evening reporters from ABC CBS NBC and CNN had arrived in Derry and the network news reporters would bring some version of the truth home to most people they would make it real although there were those who might have suggested that reality is a highly untrustworthy concept something perhaps no more solid than a piece of canvas stretched over an interlacing of cables like the strands of a spiderweb The following morning Bryant Gumble and Willard Scott of the Today show would be in Derry During the course of the program Gumble would interview Andrew Keene Whole Standpipe just crashed over and rolled down the hill Andrew said It was like wow You know what I mean Like Steven Spielberg eat your heart out you know Hey I always got the idea looking at you on TV that you were you know a lot bigger Seeing themselves and their neighbors on TVthat would make it real It would give them a place from which to grasp this terrible ungraspable thing It had been a FREAK STORM In the days following THE DEATHCOUNT would rise in THE WAKE OF THE KILLER STORM It was in fact THE WORST SPRING STORM IN MAINE HISTORY All of these headlines as terrible as they were were usefulthey helped to blunt the essential strangeness of what had happened or perhaps strangeness was too mild a word Insanity might have been better Seeing themselves on TV would help make it concrete less insane But in the hours before the news crews arrived there were only the people from Derry walking through their rubblestrewn mudslicked streets with expressions of stunned unbelief on their faces Only the people from Derry not talking much looking at things occasionally picking things up and then tossing them down again trying to figure out what had happened during the last seven or eight hours Men stood on Kansas Street smoking looking at houses lying upside down in the Barrens Other men and women stood beyond the whiteandorange crash barriers looking into the black hole that had been downtown until ten that morning The headline of that Sundays paper read WE WILL REBUILD vows DERRY MAYOR and perhaps they would But in the weeks that followed while the City Council wrangled over how the rebuilding should begin the huge crater that had been downtown continued to grow in an unspectacular but steady way Four days after the storm the office building of the Bangor Hydroelectric Company collapsed into the hole Three days after that the Flying Doghouse which sold the best kraut and chilidogs in eastern Maine fell in Drains backed up periodically in houses apartment buildings and businesses It got so bad in the Old Cape that people began to leave June th was the first evening of horseracing at Bassey Park the first race was scheduled for  PM and that seemed to cheer everyone up But a section of bleachers collapsed as the trotters in the first race turned into the home stretch and half a dozen people were hurt One of them was Foxy Foxworth who had managed the Aladdin Theater until  Foxy spent two weeks in the hospital suffering from a broken leg and a punctured testicle When he was released he decided to go to his sisters in Somersworth New Hampshire They watched the orderly slam the back doors of the ambulance and go around to the passenger seat The ambulance started up the hill toward the Derry Home Hospital Richie had flagged it down at severe risk of life and limb and had argued the irate driver to a draw when the driver insisted he just didnt have any more room He had ended up stretching Audra out on the floor Now what Ben asked There were huge brown circles under his eyes and a grimy ring of dirt around his neck Im ggoing back to the Town House Bill said GGonna sleep for about suhhixteen hours I second that Richie said He looked hopefully at Bev Got any cigarettes purty lady They began to walk slowly up the hill the four of them side by side We all did it Beverly said I wish we could have brought Eddie up I wish that more than anything They reached the corner of Upper Main and Point Street A kid in a red rainslicker and green rubber boots was sailing a paper boat along the brisk run of water in the gutter He looked up saw them looking at him and waved tentatively Bill thought it was the boy with the skateboardthe one whose friend had seen Jaws in the Canal He smiled and stepped toward the boy The boy studied him gravely and then grinned The smile was sunny and hopeful Yeah he said I think it is Not really the kid said and this time Bill laughed He restrained an urge to ruffle the kids hairthat probably would have been resentedand returned to the others A friend Bill said He stuffed his hands in his pockets do you remember it When we came out before Beverly nodded Eddie got us back to the Barrens Only we ended up on the other side of the Kenduskeag somehow The Old Cape side You and Haystack pushed the lid off one of those pumpingstations Richie said to Bill because you had the most weight Yeah Ben said We did The sun was out but it was almost down But nothing lasts forever Richie said He looked back down the hill they had just climbed and sighed Look at this for instance He held his hands out The tiny scars in the palms were gone Beverly put her hands out Ben did the same Bill added his All were dirty but unmarked Nothing lasts forever Richie repeated He looked up at Bill and Bill saw tears cut slowly through the dirt on Richies cheeks How about friends Bill asked and smiled What do you think Trashmouth Well Richie said smiling and rubbing his eyes Ah got to thank about it boy Ah say Ah say Ah got to thank about it Bill put his hands out and they joined theirs with his and stood there for a moment seven who had been reduced to four but who could still make a circle They looked at each other Ben was crying now too the tears spilling from his eyes But he was smiling I love you guys so much he said He squeezed Bevs and Richies hands tighttighttight for a moment and then dropped them Now could we see if theyve got such a thing as breakfast in this place And we ought to call Mike Tell him were okay Good thinnin senhorr Richie said Every now an then I theenk you might turn out okay Watchoo theenk Beeg Beel They walked into the Town House on a wave of laughter and as Bill pushed through the glass door Beverly caught sight of something which she never spoke of but never forgot For just a moment she saw their reflections in the glassonly there were six not four because Eddie was behind Richie and Stan was behind Bill that little halfsmile on his face The sun sits neatly on the horizon a slightly oblate red ball that throws a flat feverish light over the Barrens The iron cover on top of one of the pumpingstations rises a little settles rises again and begins to slide The cover slides farther tilts and falls into the shrubbery that has grown up around the concrete cylinder Seven children come out one by one and look around blinking owlishly in silent wonder They are like children who have never seen daylight before The only sounds are the loud rush of water and the somnolent hum of insects The storm is over but the Kenduskeag is still very high Closer to town not far from the place where the river is corseted in concrete and called a canal it has overflowed its banks although the flooding is by no means seriousa few wet cellars is the worst of it This time Stan moves away from them his face blank and thoughtful Bill looks around and at first he thinks Stan has seen a small fire on the riverbankfire is his first impression a red glow almost too bright to look at But when Stan picks the fire up in his right hand the angle of the light changes and Bill sees its nothing but a Coke bottle one of the new clear ones which someone has dropped by the river He watches as Stan reverses it holds it by the neck and brings it down on a shelf of rock jutting out of the bank The bottle breaks and Bill is aware they are all watching Stan now as he pokes through the shattered remains of the bottle his face sober and studious and absorbed At last he picks up a narrow wedge of glass The westering sun throws red glints from it and Bill thinks again Like a fire Stan looks up at him and Bill suddenly understands it is perfectly clear to him and perfectly right He steps forward toward Stan with his hands held out palms up Stan backs away into the water Small black bugs stitch along just above the surface and Bill can see an iridescent dragonfly go bussing off into the reeds along the far bank like a small flying rainbow A frog begins a steady bass thud and as Stan takes his left hand and draws the edge of glass down his palm peeling skin and bringing thin blood Bill thinks in a kind of ecstasy Theres so much life down here Stan cuts his other hand There is pain but not much A whippoorwill has begun to call somewhere a cool sound peaceful Bill thinks That whippoorwill is raising the moon He looks at his hands both of them bleeding now and then around him The others are thereEddie with his aspirator clutched tightly in one hand Ben with his big belly pushing palely out through the tattered remains of his shirt Richie his face oddly naked without his glasses Mike silent and solemn his normally full lips compressed to a thin line And Beverly her head up her eyes wide and clear her hair still somehow lovely in spite of the dirt that mats it And he sees them really sees them for the last time because in some way he understands that they will never all be together again the seven of themnot this way No one talks Beverly holds out her hands and after a moment Richie and Ben hold out theirs Mike and Eddie do the same Stan cuts them one by one as the sun begins to slip behind the horizon cooling that red furnaceglow to a dusky rosepink The whippoorwill cries again Bill can see the first faint swirls of mist on the water and he feels as if he has become a part of everythingthis is a brief ecstasy which he will no more talk about than Beverly will later talk about the brief reflection she sees of two dead men who were as boys her friends A breeze touches the trees and bushes making them sigh and he thinks This is a lovely place and Ill never forget it Its lovely and they are lovely each one of them is gorgeous The whippoorwill cries again sweet and liquid and for a moment Bill feels at one with it as if he could sing and then be gone into the duskas if he could fly away brave in the air He looks at Beverly and she is smiling at him She closes her eyes and holds her hands out to either side Bill takes her left Ben her right Bill can feel the warmth of her blood mixing with his own The others join in and they stand in a circle all of their hands now sealed in that peculiarly intimate way Stan is looking at Bill with a kind of urgency a kind of fear SwuhSwear to muhme that youll ccccome buhback Bill says swear to me that if lhIhIt isnt dddead youll cuhhome back I swear too Stan whispers but his voice falters and he looks down as he speaks That was it that was all But they stand there for awhile longer feeling the power that is in their circle the closed body that they make The light paints their faces in pale fading colors the sun is now gone and sunset is dying They stand together in a circle as the darkness creeps down into the Barrens filling up the paths they have walked this summer the clearings where they have played tag and guns the secret places along the riverbanks where they have sat and discussed childhoods long questions or smoked Beverlys cigarettes or where they have merely been silent watching the passage of the clouds reflected in the water The eye of the day is closing At last Ben drops his hands He starts to say something shakes his head and walks away Richie follows him then Beverly and Mike walking together No one talks they climb the embankment to Kansas Street and simply take leave of one another And when Bill thinks it over twentyseven years later he realizes that they really never did all get together again Four of them quite often sometimes five and maybe six once or twice But never all seven Hes the last to go He stands for a long time with his hands on the rickety white fence looking down into the Barrens as overhead the first stars seed the summer sky He stands under the blue and over the black and watches the Barrens fill up with darkness I never want to play down there again he thinks suddenly and is amazed to find the thought is not terrible or distressing but tremendously liberating He stands there a moment longer and then turns away from the Barrens and starts home walking along the dark sidewalk with his hands in his pockets glancing from time to time at the houses of Derry warmly lit against the night After a block or two he begins to walk faster thinking of supper and a block or two after that he begins to whistle The ocean in these times is a perfect fleet of ships and we can hardly fail to encounter many in running over It is merely crossing said Mr Micawber trifling with his eyeglass merely crossing The distance is quite imaginary Bill came in about twenty minutes ago and brought me this bookCarole found it on one of the tables in the library and gave it to him when he asked for it I thought Chief Rademacher might have taken it but apparently he didnt want anything to do with it Bills stutter is disappearing again but the poor man has aged four years in the last four days He told me he expects Audra to be discharged from Derry Home Hospital where I myself yet tarry tomorrow only to take a private ambulance north to the Bangor Mental Health Institute Physically shes fineminor cuts and bruises that are already healing Mentally You raise her hand and it stays up Bill said He was sitting by the window twiddling a can of diet soda between his hands It just floats there until someone puts it down again Her reflexes are there but very slow The EEG they did shows a severely repressed alpha wave Shes cccatatonic Mike I said Ive got an idea Maybe not such a good one If you dont like it just say so Im going to be in here another week I said Instead of sending Audra up to Bangor why dont you take her to my place Bill Spend the week with her Talk to her even if she doesnt talk back Is she is she continent Would I change her He smiled and it was such a painful smile that I had to look away for a moment It was the way my father smiled the time he told me about Butch Bowers and the chickens Yes I think I could do that much I wont tell you to take it easy on yourself when youre obviously not prepared to do that I said but please remember that you yourself agreed that much or all of whats happened was almost certainly ordained That may include Audras part in this I shshould have kept my mouth shut about where I was ggoing All right he said at last If you really mean it I mean it Theyve got my housekeys down at the Patient Services Desk Theres a couple of Delmonico steaks in the freezer Maybe that was ordained too Well I said holding onto my smile maybe therell be cause for a celebration Theres a pretty good bottle of wine on the top shelf in the pantry too Mondavi Domestic but good He let go of my hand Richie flew back to California this morning MMaybe he said For awhile anyway But He looked at me levelly Its going to happen again I think Yes In fact I think its already started Just little things so far Details But I think its going to spread Maybe He looked out the window still twiddling his can of diet soda almost surely thinking about his wife so wideeyed and silent and beautiful and plastic Catatonic The sound of a door slamming shut and locked He sighed Maybe it is He looked back at me and smiled a little Bens invited her to come back to Nebraska with him and shes agreed to go at least for awhile You know about her friend in Chicago I nodded Beverly told Ben and Ben told me yesterday If I may understate the case grotesquely understate the case Beverlys later description of her wonderful fantastic husband Tom was much truer than her original one Wonderful fantastic Tom kept Bev in emotional spiritual and sometimes physical bondage for the last four years or so Wonderful fantastic Tom got here by beating the information out of Bevs only close woman friend She told me shes going to fly back to Chicago the week after next and file a missingpersons report on him Tom I mean Smart enough I said No ones ever going to find him down there Or Eddie either I thought but did not say No I suppose not Bill said And when she goes back Im betting Ben will go with her And you know something else Something really crazy Shes forgotten or forgetting Bill said And I cant remember what the doorway looked like anymore The ddoorway into Its place I try to think of it and the craziest thing happensI get this ihimage of gggoats walking over a bridge From that story The Three Billy Goats Gruff Crazy huh Theyll trace Tom Rogan to Derry eventually I said Hell have left a paper trail a mile wide Rentacar plane tickets Im not so sure of that Bill said lighting a cigarette I think he might have paid cash for his plane ticket and given a phony name Maybe bought a cheap car here or stole one Oh come on Bill said do you think he came all this way to give her a spanking Our eyes met for a long moment and then he stood up Listen Mike He laughed at that laughed hard and when he had sobered he said Thanks for the use of your place Mikey Im not going to swear to you itll make any difference It has no therapeutic qualities that Im aware of Well Ill see you He did an odd thing then odd but rather lovely He kissed my cheek God bless Mike Ill be around Things may be okay Bill I said dont give up hope They may be okay He smiled and nodded but I think the same word was in both of our minds Catatonic Ben and Beverly came in today to say goodbye Theyre not flyingBens rented a great big Cadillac from the Hertz people and theyre going to drive not hurrying Theres something in their eyes when they look at each other and Id bet my pensionplan that if theyre not making it now they will be by the time they get to Nebraska Beverly hugged me told me to get well quickly and then cried Ben also hugged me and asked for the third or fourth time if I would write I told him I would indeed write and so I will for awhile at least Because this tune its happening to me as well As Bill said right now its only small things details But it feels like the sort of thing thats going to spread It could be that in a month or a year this notebook will be all Ill have to remind me of what happened here in Derry I suppose the words themselves might begin to fade eventually leaving this book as blank as when I first picked it up in the schoolsupplies department at Freeses Thats an awful thought and in the daytime it seems wildly paranoid but do you know in the watches of the night it seems perfectly logical This forgetting the prospect fills me with panic but it also offers a sneaking sort of relief It suggests to me more than anything else that this time they really did kill It that there is no need of a watchman to stand and wait for the cycle to begin again Dull panic sneaking relief Its the relief Ill embrace I think sneaking or not Bill called to say he and Audra had moved in There is no change in her Ill always remember you Thats what Beverly told me just before she and Ben left Interesting piece in the Derry News today on page one The story was headed STORM CAUSES HENLEY TO GIVE UP AUDITORIUM EXPANSION PLANS The Henley in question is Tim Henley a multimillionaire developer who came into Derry like a whirlwind in the late sixtiesit was Henley and Zitner who organized the consortium responsible for building the Derry Mall which according to another piece on page one is probably going to be declared a total loss Tim Henley was determined to see Derry grow There was a profitmotive yes indeed but there was more to it than that Henley genuinely wanted to see it happen His sudden abandonment of the auditorium expansion suggests several things to me That Henley may have soured on Derry is only the most obvious I think its also possible that hes in the process of losing his shirt because of the destruction of the mall But the article also suggests that Henley is not alone that other investors and potential investors in Derrys future may be rethinking their options Of course Al Zitner wont have to bother God retired him when downtown collapsed Of the others those who thought like Henley are now facing a rather difficult problemhow do you rebuild an urban area which is now at least fifty percent underwater I think that after a long and ghoulishly vital existence Derry may be dying like a nightshade whose time to bloom has come and gone An hour ago I put through another call this one to Richie Tozier in California His answering machine fielded the call with Creedence Clearwater Revival music playing in the background Those machines always fuck up my timing somehow I left my name and number hesitated and added that I hoped he was able to wear his contact lenses again I was about to hang up when Richie himself picked up the phone and said Mikey How you be His voice was pleased and warm but there was an obvious bewilderment there as well He was wearing the verbal expression of a man who has been caught utterly flatfooted Some Its going away The itch is worse Ill be damn glad when they finally decide to unstrap my ribs By the way I liked the Creedence Richie laughed shit that aint Creedence thats Rock and Roll Girls from Fogartys new album Centerfield its called You havent heard any of it You got to get it its great Its just like He trailed off for a moment and then said Its just like the old days Ill pick it up I said and I probably will I always liked John Fogarty Green River was my alltune Creedence favorite I guess Get back home he says Just before the fade he says it He and Audra are keeping house for me while Im in here Good Thats good He paused for a moment You want to hear something fucking bizarre ole Mikey Sure I said I had a pretty good idea what he was going to say Well I was sitting here in my study listening to some of the new Cashbox hot prospects going over some ad copy reading memos theres about two mountains of stuff backed up and Im looking at roughly a month of twentyfivehour days So I had the answering machine turned on but with the volume turned up so I could intercept the calls I wanted and just let the dimwits talk to the tape And the reason I let you talk to the tape as long as I did was because at first you didnt have the slightest idea who I was There was silence on the other end of the linea long silence In it faintly I could hear a woman talking in Omaha or maybe she was in Ruthven Arizona or Flint Michigan I heard her as faint as a spacetraveller leaving the solar system in the nosecone of a burnedout rocket thank someone for the cookies Then Richie said uncertainly I think it was Underwood but that isnt Jewish it it Uris Richie cried sounding both relieved and shaken Jesus I hate it when I get something right on the tip of my tongue and cant quite pick it off Someone brings out a Trivial Pursuit game I say Excuse me but I think the diarrheas coming back so maybe Ill just go home okay But you remember anyhow Mikey Like before Then this tune its really over he said and the relief in his voice was unmistakable That longdistance silence fell againall the miles between Maine and California I believe we were both thinking the same thing it was over yes and in six weeks or six months we will have forgotten all about each other Its over and all its cost us is our friendship and Stan and Eddies lives Ive almost forgotten them you know it Horrible as it may sound I have almost forgotten Stan and Eddie Was it asthma Eddie had or chronic migraine Ill be damned if I can remember for sure although I think it was migraine Ill ask Bill Hell know Well you say hi to Bill and that pretty wife of his Richie said with a cheeriness that sounded canned I will Richie I said closing my eyes and rubbing my forehead He remembered Bills wife was in Derry but not her name or what had happened to her And if youre ever in LA you got the number Well get together and mouth some chow Sure I felt hot tears behind my eyes And if you get back this way the He laughed Yeah yeah yeah Stick it in your ear Mike Ah say in yo ear boy He hung up and so did I Then I lay back on my pillows with my eyes shut and didnt open them for a long time Police Chief Andrew Rademacher who took over from Chief Borton in the late sixties is dead It was a bizarre accident one I cant help associating with what has been happening in Derry what has just ended in Derry The combination policestationcourthouse stands on the edge of the area that fell into the Canal and while it didnt go the upheavalor the floodmust have caused structural damage of which no one was aware Rademacher was working late in his office last night the story in the paper says as he has every night since the storm and the flood The Police Chiefs office has moved from the third to the fifth floor since the old days to just below an attic where all sorts of records and useless city artifacts are stored One of those artifacts was the trampchair I have described earlier in these pages It was made of iron and weighed better than four hundred pounds The building shipped a quantity of water during the downpour of May st and that must have weakened the attic floor or so the paper says Whatever the reason the trampchair fell from the attic directly onto Chief Rademacher as he sat at his desk reading accident reports He was killed instantly Officer Bruce Andeen rushed in and found him lying on the ruins of his shattered desk his pen still in one hand Talked to Bill on the phone again Audra is taking some solid food he says but otherwise there is no change I asked him if Eddies big problem had been asthma or migraine Sure I said and did But only when Bill mentioned it I looked at my address book lying on the nighttable but didnt pick it up I dont quite remember It was like Kerkorian Bill said sounding distressed but that wasnt quite it Youve got everything written down though Right One he said but its so crazy I dont want to talk about it Raytheon which had been scheduled to break ground on its Derry plant in July has decided at the last minute to build in Waterville instead The editorial on page one of the News expresses dismay and if I read correctly between the lines a little fright I think I know what Bills idea is Hell have to act quickly before the last of the magic departs this place If it hasnt already I guess what I thought before wasnt so paranoid after all The names and addresses of the others in my little book are fading The color and quality of the ink combine to make those entries look as if they were written fifty or seventyfive years before the others Ive jotted in there This has happened in the last four or five days Im convinced that by September their names will be utterly gone I suppose I could preserve them I could just keep copying them But Im also convinced that each would fade in its turn and that very soon it would become an exercise in futilitylike writing I will not throw spitballs in class five hundred times I would be writing names that meant nothing for a reason I didnt remember Woke up in the middle of the night from a terrible nightmare I couldnt remember got panicky couldnt breathe Reached for the callbutton and then couldnt use it Had a terrible vision of Mark Lamonica answering the bell with a hypo or Henry Bowers with his switchblade I grabbed my address book and called Ben Hanscom in Nebraska the address and number have faded still more but they are still legible No go Joe Got a recorded phonecompany voice telling me service to that number has been cancelled Was Ben fat or did he have something like a club foot I called Bill and told him thatI suppose I wanted to warn him that his time is getting shorter all the time Bill is the only one I remember clearly and Im convinced that Im the only one he remembers clearly Because we are both still here in Derry I suppose All right he said By tomorrow well be out of your hair He laughed and said something I both do and dont understand You cant be cccareful on a skuhhateboard man My hearts with you Bill no matter how it turns out My heart is with all of them and I think that even if we forget each other well remember in our dreams Im almost done with this diary nowand I suppose a diary is all that it will ever be and that the story of Derrys old scandals and eccentricities has no place outside these pages Thats fine with me I think that when they let me out of here tomorrow it might finally be time to start thinking about some sort of new life although just what that might be is unclear to me I knew the bride when she used to do the Pony I knew the bride when she used to do the Stroll I knew the bride when she used to rock and roll Bill stood naked in Mike Hanlons bedroom looking at his lean body in the mirror on the door His bald head gleamed in the light which fell through the window and cast his shadow along the floor and up the wall His chest was hairless his thighs and shanks skinny but overlaid with ropes of muscle Still he thought its an adults body we got here no question about that Theres the pot belly that comes with a few too many good steaks a few too many bottles of Kirin beer a few too many poolside lunches where you had the Reuben or the French dip instead of the diet plate Your seats dropped too Bill old buddy You can still serve an ace if youre not too hung over and if your eyes in but you cant hustle after the old Dunlop the way you could when you were seventeen You got love handles and your balls are starting to get that middleaged dangly look Theres lines on your face that werent there when you were seventeen Hell they werent there on your first author photo the one where you tried so hard to look as if you knew something anything Youre too old for what youve got in mind Billyboy Youll kill both of you If wed believed that we never could have have done whatever it was we did Because he didnt really remember what it was they had done or what had happened to turn Audra into a catatonic wreck He only knew what he was supposed to do now and he knew that if he didnt do it now he would forget that too Audra was sitting downstairs in Mikes easy chair her hair hanging lankly to her shoulders staring with rapt attention at the TV which was currently showing Dialing for Dollars She didnt speak and would only move if you led her He put on athletic socks the one pair of jeans he had brought the tank top hed bought at the Shirt Shack in Bangor the day before The tank was bright orange Across the front it said WHERE THE HELL IS DERRY MAINE He sat down on Mikes bedthe one he had shared for the last week of nights with his warm but corpselike wifeand put on his sneakers a pair of Keds which he had also bought yesterday in Bangor He stood up and looked at himself in the mirror again He saw a man pressing middle age dressed up in a kids clothes Fuck lets rock and roll a little Bill said softly and left the room In the dreams he will have in later years he is always leaving Derry alone at sunset The town is deserted everyone has left The Theological Seminary and the Victorian houses on West Broadway brood black against a lurid sky every summer sunset you ever saw rolled up into one He can hear his footfalls echoing back as they rap along the concrete The only other sound is water rushing hollowly through the stormdrains He rolled Silver out into the driveway put him on the kickstand and checked the tires again The front one was okay but the back one felt a little mushy He got the bike pump that Mike had bought and firmed it up When he put the pump back he checked the playing cards and the clothespins The bikes wheels still made those exciting machinegun sounds Bill remembered from his boyhood Good deal He went back into Mikes garage again got the inl and oiled the chain and sprocket Then he stood up looked at Silver and gave the bulb of the oogahhorn a light experimental squeeze It sounded good He nodded and went into the house and he sees all those places again intact as they were then the hulking brick fort of Derry Elementary the Kissing Bridge with its complex intaglio of initials highschool sweethearts ready to crack the world open with their passion who had grown up to become insurance agents and car salesmen and waitresses and beauticians he sees the statue of Paul Bunyan against that bleeding sunset sky and the leaning white fence which ran along the Kansas Street sidewalk at the edge of the Barrens He sees them as they were as they always will be in some part of his mind and his heart breaks with love and honor Leaving leaving Derry he thinks We are leaving Derry and if this was a story it would be the last halfdozen pages or so get ready to put this one up on the shelf and forget it The suns going down and theres no sound but my footfalls and the water in the drains This is the time of Dialing for Dollars had given way to Wheel of Fortune Audra sat passively in front of it her eyes never leaving the set Her demeanor did not change Audra he said going to her and taking her hand Come on She didnt move Her hand lay in his warm wax Bill took her other hand from the arm of Mikes chair and pulled her to her feet He had dressed her that morning much as he had dressed himselfshe was wearing Levis and a blue shell top She would have looked quite lovely if not for her wideeyed vacant stare Cuhcome on he said again and led her through the door into Mikes kitchen and eventually outside She came willingly enough although she would have plunged off the back porch stoop and gone sprawling in the dirt if Bill had not put an arm around her waist and guided her down the steps He led her over to where Silver stood heeled over on his kickstand in the bright summer noonlight Audra stood beside the bike looking serenely at the side of Mikes garage She didnt move Patiently Bill worked at getting her to swing one of her long legs over the carrier mounted on Silvers back fender At last she stood there with the package carrier between her legs not quite touching her crotch Bill pressed his hand lightly to the top of her head and Audra sat down He swung onto Silvers saddle and put up the kickstand with his heel He prepared to reach behind him for Audras hands and draw them around his middle but before he could do it they crept around him of their own accord like small dazed mice He looked down at them his heart beating faster seeming to pump in his throat as much as in his chest It was the first independent action Audra had taken all week so far as he knew the first independent action she had taken since It happened whatever It had been There was no answer He tried to crane his neck around and see her but couldnt quite make it There were only her hands around his waist the nails showing the last chips of a red polish that had been put on by a bright lively talented young woman in a small English town Were going for a ride Bill said and he began to roll Silver forward toward Palmer Lane listening to the gravel crunch under the tires I want you to hold on Audra I think I think I may go sort of fffast He thought of the kid he had met earlier during his stay in Derry when It had still been happening You cant be careful on a skateboard the kid had said No answer Had her hands tightened the tiniest bit across his middle Probably just wishful thinking He reached the end of the driveway and looked right Palmer Lane ran straight to Upper Main Street where a left turn would take him onto the hill running downtown Downhill Picking up speed He felt a tremor of fear at the image and a disquieting thought ran through his mind almost too quickly to read and was gone But But it wasnt all disquiet was it No It was desire as well the feeling hed had when he saw the kid walking along with the skateboard under his arm The desire to go fast to feel the wind race past you without knowing if you were racing toward or running away from to just go To fly Disquiet and desire All the difference between world and wantthe difference between being an adult who counted the cost and a child who just got on it and went for instance All the world between Yet not that much difference at all Bedfellows really The way you felt when the rollercoaster car approached the top of the first steep grade where the ride really begins Disquiet and desire What you want and what youre scared to try for Where youve been and where you want to go Something in a rockandroll song about wanting the girl the car the place to stand and be Oh please God can you dig it Bill closed his eyes for a moment feeling the soft dead weight of his wife behind him feeling the hill somewhere ahead of him feeling his own heart inside him He began to push Silver forward again You want to rock and roll a little Audra He began to pedal It was hard going at first Silver wobbled alarmingly back and forth Audras weight adding to the imbalance yet she must be doing some balancing even unconsciously or they would have crashed right away Bill stood on the pedals hands squeezing the handlegrips with maniacal tightness his head turned skyward his eyes slits the cords on his neck standing out Gonna fall splat right here in the street split her skull and mine no you aint go for it Bill go for it go for the son of a bitch He stood on the pedals revolving them feeling every cigarette hed smoked over the last twenty years in his elevated bloodpressure and the race of his heart Fuck that too he thought and the rush of crazy exhilaration made him grin The playing cards which had been firing isolated shots now began to clickclock faster They were new nice new Bikes and they made a good loud sound Bill felt the first touch of breeze on his bald pate and his grin widened I made that breeze he thought I made it by pumping these damn pedals The STOP sign at the end of the lane was coming up Bill began to brake and then his grin still widening showing more and more of his teeth he began to pump again Ignoring the STOP sign Bill Denbrough swept to the left onto Upper Main Street above Bassey Park Again Audras weight fooled him and they almost overbalanced and crashed The bike wavered wobbled then righted itself That breeze was stronger now cooling the sweat on his forehead evaporating it rushing past his ears with a low intoxicating sound that was a little like the sound of the ocean in a conch shell but was really like nothing else on earth Bill supposed it was a sound the kid with the skateboard was familiar with But its a sound youll fall out of touch with kid he thought Things have a way of changing Its a dirty trick so be prepared for it Pedaling faster now finding a surer balance in speed The ruins of Paul Bunyan on the left like a fallen colossus Bill shouted Hiyo Silver AWAYYYYY Audras hands tightened around his middle he felt her stir against his back But there was no urge to turn and try to see her now no urge no need He pedaled faster laughing out loud a tall skinny bald man on a bike crouched over the handlebars to lessen the windresistance People turned to look as he raced alongside Bassey Park Now Upper Main Street began to incline toward the cavedin center of town at a steeper angle and a voice inside whispered to him that if he didnt brake soon he would find himself unable he would simply go sweeping into the sunken remains of the threeway intersection like a bat out of hell and kill both of them Instead of braking he began to pedal again urging the bike to go even faster Now he was flying down Main Street Hill and he could see the whiteandorange crash barriers the smudgepots with their smoky Halloween flames marking the edge of the cavein he could see the tops of buildings which jutted out of the streets like the figments of a madmans imagination Hiyo Silver AWAYYYYYYY Bill Denbrough cried deliriously and rushed down the hill toward whatever there would be aware for one last time of Derry as his place aware most of all that he was alive under a real sky and that all was desire desire desire He raced down the hill on Silver he raced to beat the devil So you leave and there is an urge to look back to look back just once as the sunset fades to see that severe New England skyline one final timethe spires the Standpipe Paul with his axe slung over his shoulder But it is perhaps not such a good idea to look backall the stories say so Look what happened to Lots wife Best not to look back Best to believe there will be happily ever afters all the way aroundand so there may be who is to say there will not be such endings Not all boats which sail away into darkness never find the sun again or the hand of another child if life teaches anything at all it teaches that there are so many happy endings that the man who believes there is no God needs his rationality called into serious question You leave and you leave quick when the sun starts to go down he thinks in this dream Thats what you do And if you spare a last thought maybe its ghosts you wonder about the ghosts of children standing in the water at sunset standing in a circle standing with their hands joined together their faces young sure but tough tough enough anyway to give birth to the people they will become tough enough to understand maybe that the people they will become must necessarily birth the people they were before they can get on with trying to understand simple mortality The circle closes the wheel rolls and thats all there is You dont have to look back to see those children part of your mind will see them forever live with them forever love with them forever They are not necessarily the best part of you but they were once the repository of all you could become So drive away quick drive away while the last of the light slips away drive away from Derry from memory but not from desire That stays the bright cameo of all we were and all we believed as children all that shone in our eyes even when we were lost and the wind blew in the night Drive away and try to keep smiling Get a little rock and roll on the radio and go toward all the life there is with all the courage you can find and all the belief you can muster Be true be brave stand Words whipped by in the slipstream as meaningless as pennants in a breeze or untethered balloons Here came the crash barriers he could smell the sooty aroma of kerosene from the smudgepots He saw the yawning darkness where the street had been heard sullen water rushing down there in the tangled darkness and laughed at the sound He dragged Silver hard left so close to the crash barriers now that the leg of his jeans actually whispered along one of them Silvers wheels were less than three inches from the place where the tar ended in empty space and he was running out of maneuvering room Up ahead the water had eroded all of the street and half the sidewalk in front of Cashs Jewelry Store Barriers closed off what was left of the sidewalk it had been severely undercut Bill It was Audras voice dazed and a little thick She sounded as if she had just awakened from a deep sleep Bill where are we What are we doing Hi yo Silver Bill shouted pointing the rushing gantry that was Silver directly at the crash barrier jutting out at right angles to the empty Cash show window HI YO SILVER AWAYYYYY Silver struck the barrier at better than forty miles an hour and it went flying the centerboard in one direction the Ashaped supports in two others Audra cried out and squeezed Bill so tightly that he lost his breath Up and down Main Street Canal Street and Kansas Street people stood in doorways and on sidewalks watching Silver shot out onto the bridge of undercut sidewalk Bill felt his left hip and knee chip the side of the jewelry store He felt Silvers rear wheel sag suddenly and understood that the sidewalk was falling in behind them and then Silvers forward motion carried them back onto solid roadway Bill swerved to avoid an overturned trashcan and barrelled out into the street again Brakes squealed He saw the grille of a big truck approaching and still couldnt seem to stop laughing He ran through the space the heavy truck wound up occupying a full second before it got there Shit time to spare Yelling tears squirting from his eyes Bill blew Silvers oogahhorn listening to each hoarse bray embed itself in the days bright light Bill youre going to kill us both Audra cried out and although there was terror in her voice she was also laughing Bill heeled Silver over and this time he felt Audra leaning with him making die bike easier to control helping to make the two of them exist with it at least for this small compact moment of time as three living things I know so she cried and then grabbed his crotch where there was a huge and cheerful erection But dont stop He had nothing to say about it however Silvers speed was bleeding away on UpMile Hill the heavy roar of the playing cards becoming single gunshots again Bill stopped and turned to her She was pale wideeyed obviously scared and confused but awake aware and laughing Audra he said laughing with her He helped her off Silver leaned the bike against a handy brick wall and embraced her He kissed her forehead her eyes her cheeks her mouth her neck her breasts Bill whats been happening I remember getting off the plane at Bangor and I cant remember a thing after that Are you all right She pushed him away so she could look at him Bill are you still stuttering Yes he said I think this time its gone for good He nodded and smiled When he smiled he looked very young bald head or not I love you too he said And what else counts He awakens from this dream unable to remember exactly what it was or much at all beyond the simple fact that he has dreamed about being a child again He touches his wifes smooth back as she sleeps her warm sleep and dreams her own dreams he thinks that it is good to be a child but it is also good to be grownup and able to consider the mystery of childhood its beliefs and desires I will write about all of this one day he thinks and knows its just a dawn thought an afterdreaming thought But its nice to think so for awhile in the mornings clean silence to think that childhood has its own sweet secrets and confirms mortality and that mortality defines all courage and love To think that what has looked forward must also look back and that each life makes its own imitation of immortality a wheel Or so Bill Denbrough sometimes thinks on those early mornings after dreaming when he almost remembers his childhood and the friends with whom he shared it
