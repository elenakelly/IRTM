On a day in Full Earth so hot that it seemed to suck the breath from his chest before his body could use it Roland of Gilead came to the gates of a village in the Desatoya Mountains He was travelling alone by then and would soon be travelling afoot as well This whole last week he had been hoping for a horsedoctor but guessed such a fellow would do him no good now even if this town had one His mount a twoyearold roan was pretty well done for The town gates still decorated with flowers from some festival or other stood open and welcoming but the silence beyond them was all wrong The gunslinger heard no clipclop of horses no rumble of wagonwheels no merchants huckstering cries from the marketplace The only sounds were the low hum of crickets some sort of bug at any rate they were a bit more tuneful than crickets at that a queer wooden knocking sound and the faint dreamy tinkle of small bells Also the flowers twined through the wroughtiron staves of the ornamental gate were long dead Between his knees Topsy gave two great hollow sneezesKchow Kchowand staggered sideways Roland dismounted partly out of respect for the horse partly out of respect for himselfhe didnt want to break a leg under Topsy if Topsy chose this moment to give up and canter into the clearing at the end of his path The gunslinger stood in his dusty boots and faded jeans under the beating sun stroking the roans matted neck pausing every now and then to yank his fingers through the tangles of Topsys mane and stopping once to shoo off the tiny flies clustering at the corners of Topsys eyes Let them lay their eggs and hatch their maggots there after Topsy was dead but not before Roland thus honoured his horse as best he could listening to those distant dreamy bells and the strange wooden tocking sound as he did After a while he ceased his absent grooming and looked thoughtfully at the open gate The cross above its centre was a bit unusual but otherwise the gate was a typical example of its type a western commonplace which was not useful but traditionalall the little towns he had come to in the last tenmonth seemed to have one such where you came in grand and one more such where you went out not so grand None had been built to exclude visitors certainly not this one It stood between two walls of pink adobe that ran into the scree for a distance of about twenty feet on either side of the road and then simply stopped Close the gate lock it with many locks and all that meant was a short walk around one bit of adobe wall or the other Beyond the gate Roland could see what looked in most respects like a perfectly ordinary High Streetan inn two saloons one of which was called The Bustling Pig the sign over the other was too faded to read a mercantile a smithy a Gathering Hall There was also a small but rather lovely wooden building with a modest belltower on top a sturdy fieldstone foundation on bottom and a goldpainted cross on its double doors The cross like the one over the gate marked this as a worshipping place for those who held to the Jesusman This wasnt a common religion in MidWorld but far from unknown that same thing could have been said about most forms of worship in those days including the worship of Baal Asmodeus and a hundred others Faith like everything else in the world these days had moved on As far as Roland was concerned God o the Cross was just another religion which taught that love and murder were inextricably bound togetherthat in the end God always drank blood Meanwhile there was the singing hum of insects which sounded almost like crickets The dreamlike tinkle of the bells And that queer wooden thumping like a fist on a door Or on a coffin top Something heres a long way from right the gunslinger thought Ware Roland this place has a reddish odour He led Topsy through the gate with its adornments of dead flowers and down the High Street On the porch of the mercantile where the old men should have congregated to discuss crops politics and the follies of the younger generation there stood only a line of empty rockers Lying beneath one as if dropped from a careless and longdeparted hand was a charred corncob pipe The hitchingrack in front of The Bustling Pig stood empty the windows of the saloon itself were dark One of the batwing doors had been yanked off and stood propped against the side of the building the other hung ajar its faded green slats splattered with maroon stuff that might have been paint but probably wasnt The shopfront of the livery stable stood intact like the face of a ruined woman who has access to good cosmetics but the double barn behind it was a charred skeleton That fire must have happened on a rainy day the gunslinger thought or the whole damned town would have gone up in flames a jolly spin and raree for anyone around to see it To his right now halfway up to where the street opened into the town square was the church There were grassy borders on both sides one separating the church from the towns Gathering Hall the other from the little house set aside for the preacher and his family if this was one of the Jesussects which allowed its shamans to have wives and families that was some of them clearly administered by lunatics demanded at least the appearance of celibacy There were flowers in these grassy strips and while they looked parched most were still alive So whatever had happened here to empty the place out had not happened long ago A week perhaps Two at the outside given the heat Topsy sneezed againKchowand lowered his head wearily The gunslinger saw the source of the tinkling Above the cross on the church doors a cord had been strung in a long shallow arc Hung from it were perhaps two dozen tiny silver bells There was hardly any breeze today but enough so these small bells were never quite still and if a real wind should rise Roland thought the sound made by the tintinnabulation of the bells would probably be a good deal less pleasant more like the strident parley of gossips tongues Hello Roland called looking across the street at what a large falsefronted sign proclaimed to be the Good Beds Hotel Hello the town No answer but the bells the tunesome insects and that odd wooden clunking No answer no movement but there were folk here Folk or something He was being watched The tiny hairs on the nape of his neck had stiffened Roland stepped onward leading Topsy towards the centre of town puffing up the unlaid High Street dust with each step Forty paces further along he stopped in front of a low building marked with a single curt word LAW The Sheriffs office if they had such this far from the Inners looked remarkably similar to the churchwooden boards stained a rather forbidding shade of dark brown above a stone foundation The bells behind him rustled and whispered He left the roan standing in the middle of the street and mounted the steps to the LAW office He was very aware of the bells the sun beating against his neck and of the sweat trickling down his sides The door was shut but unlocked He opened it then winced back halfraising a hand as the heat trapped inside rushed out in a soundless gasp If all the closed buildings were this hot inside he mused the livery barns would soon not be the only burnedout hulks And with no rain to stop the flames and certainly no volunteer fire department not any more the town would not be long for the face of the earth He stepped inside trying to sip at the stifling air rather than taking deep breaths He immediately heard the low drone of flies There was a single cell commodious and empty its barred door standing open Filthy skinshoes one of the pair coming unsewn lay beneath a bunk sodden with the same dried maroon stuff which had marked The Bustling Pig Here was where the flies were crawling over the stain feeding from it On the desk was a ledger Roland turned it towards him and read what was embossed upon its red cover REGISTRY OF MISDEEDS amp REDRESS IN THE YEARS OF OUR LORD ELURIA So now he knew the name of the town at leastEluria Pretty yet somehow ominous as well But any name would have seemed ominous Roland supposed given these circumstances He turned to leave and saw a closed door secured by a wooden bolt He went to it stood before it for a moment then drew one of the big revolvers he carried low on his hips He stood a moment longer head down thinking Cuthbert his old friend liked to say that the wheels inside Rolands head ground slow but exceedingly fine and then retracted the bolt He opened the door and immediately stood back levelling his gun expecting a body Elurias Sheriff mayhap to come tumbling into the room with his throat cut and his eyes gouged out victim of a MISDEED in need of REDRESS Nothing Well half a dozen stained jumpers which longerterm prisoners probably required to wear two bows a quiver of arrows an old dusty motor a rifle that had probably last been fired a hundred years agog and a mop but in the gunslingers mind all that came down to nothing Just a storage closet He went back to the desk opened the register and leafed through it Even the pages were warm as if the book had been baked In a way he supposed it had been If the High Street layout had been different he might have expected a large number of religious offences to be recorded but he wasnt surprised to find none hereif the Jesusman church had coexisted with a couple of saloons the churchfolk must have been fairly reasonable What Roland found were the usual petty offences and a few not so pettya murder a horsethieving the Distressal of a Lady which probably meant rape The murderer had been removed to a place called Lexingworth to be hanged Roland had never heard of it One note towards the end read Green folk sent hence It meant nothing to Roland The most recent entry was this Fe Chas Freeborn cattletheef to be tryed Roland wasnt familiar with the notation Fe but as this was a long stretch from February he supposed Fe might stand for Full Earth In any case the ink looked about as fresh as the blood on the bunk in the cell and the gunslinger had a good idea that Chas Freeborn cattletheef had reached the clearing at the end of his path He went out into the heat and the lacy sound of bells Topsy looked at Roland dully then lowered his head again as if there were something in the dust of the High Street which could be cropped As if he would ever want to crop again for that matter The gunslinger gathered up the reins slapped the dust off them against the faded nocolour of his jeans and continued on up the street The wooden knocking sound grew steadily louder as he walked he had not holstered his gun when leaving LAW nor cared to holster it now and as he neared the town square which must have housed the Eluria market in more normal times Roland at last saw movement On the far side of the square was a long watering trough made of ironwood from the look what some called seequoiah out here apparently fed in happier times from a rusty steel pipe which now jutted waterless above the troughs south end Lolling over one side of this municipal oasis about halfway down its length was a leg clad in faded grey pants and terminating in a wellchewed cowboy boot The chewer was a large dog perhaps two shades greyer than the corduroy pants Under other circumstances Roland supposed the mutt would have had the boot off long since but perhaps the foot and lower calf inside it had swelled In any case the dog was well on its way to simply chewing the obstacle away It would seize the boot and shake it back and forth Every now and then the boots heel would collide with the wooden side of the trough producing another hollow knock The gunslinger hadnt been so wrong to think of coffin tops after all it seemed Why doesnt it just back off a few steps jump into the trough and have at him Roland wondered No water coming out of the pipe so it cant be afraid of drowning Topsy uttered another of his hollow tired sneezes and when the dog lurched around in response Roland understood why it was doing things the hard way One of its front legs had been badly broken and crookedly mended Walking would be a chore for it jumping out of the question On its chest was a patch of dirty white fur Growing out of this patch was black fur in a roughly cruciform shape A Jesusdog mayhap hoping for a spot of afternoon communion There was nothing very religious about the snarl which began to wind out of its chest however or the roll of its rheumy eyes It lifted its upper lip in a trembling sneer revealing a goodish set of teeth Light out Roland said While you can The dog backed up until its hindquarters were pressed against the chewed boot It regarded the oncoming man fearfully but clearly meant to stand its ground The revolver in Rolands hand held no significance for it The gunslinger wasnt surprisedhe guessed the dog had never seen one had no idea it was anything other than a club of some kind which could only be thrown once Hie on with you now Roland said but still the dog wouldnt move He should have shot itit was no good to itself and a dog that had acquired a taste for human flesh could be no good to anyone elsebut he somehow didnt like to Killing the only thing still living in this town other than the singing bugs that was seemed like an invitation to bad luck He fired into the dust near the dogs good forepaw the sound crashing into the hot day and temporarily silencing the insects The dog could run it seemed although at a lurching trot that hurt Rolands eyes and his heart a little too It stopped at the far side of the square by an overturned flatbed wagon there looked to be more dried blood splashed on the freighters side and glanced back It uttered a forlorn howl that raised the hairs on the nape of Rolands neck even further Then it turned skirted the wrecked wagon and limped down a lane which opened between two of the stalls This way towards Elurias back gate Roland guessed Still leading his dying horse the gunslinger crossed the square to the ironwood trough and looked in The owner of the chewed boot wasnt a man but a boy who had just been beginning to get his mans growthand that would have been quite a large growth indeed Roland judged even setting aside the bloating effects which had resulted from being immersed for some unknown length of time in nine inches of water simmering under a summer sun The boys eyes now just milky balls stared blindly up at the gunslinger like the eyes of a statue His hair appeared to be the white of old age although that was the effect of the water he had likely been a towhead His clothes were those of a cowboy although he couldnt have been much more than fourteen or sixteen Around his neck gleaming blearily in water that was slowly turning into a skin stew under the summer sun was a gold medallion Roland reached into the water not liking to but feeling a certain obligation He wrapped his fingers around the medallion and pulled The chain parted and he lifted the thing dripping into the air He rather expected a Jesusman sigilwhat was called the crucifix or the rood but a small rectangle hung from the chain instead The object looked like pure gold Engraved into it was this legend James Loved of Family Loved of GOD Roland who had been almost too revolted to reach into the polluted water as a younger man he could never have brought himself to that was now glad hed done it He might never run into any of those who had loved this boy but he knew enough of ka to think it might be so In any case it was the right thing So was giving the kid a decent burial assuming that was he could get the body out of the trough without having it break apart inside the clothes Roland was considering this trying to balance what might be his duty in this circumstance against his growing desire to get out of this town when Topsy finally fell dead The roan went over with a creak of gear and a last whuffling groan as it hit the ground Roland turned and saw eight people in the street walking towards him in a line like beaters who hope to flush out birds or drive small game Their skin was waxy green Folk wearing such skin would likely glow in the dark like ghosts It was hard to tell their sex and what could it matterto them or anyone else They were slow mutants walking with the hunched deliberation of corpses reanimated by some arcane magic The dust had muffled their feet like carpet With the dog banished they might well have gotten within attacking distance if Topsy hadnt done Roland the favour of dying at such an opportune moment No guns that Roland could see they were armed with clubs These were chairlegs and tablelegs for the most part but Roland saw one that looked made rather than seizedit had a bristle of rusty nails sticking out of it and he suspected it had oncebeen the property of a saloon bouncer possibly the one who kept school in The Bustling Pig Roland raised his pistol aiming at the fellow in the centre of the line Now he could hear the shuffle of their feet and the wet snuffle of their breathing As if they all had bad chestcolds Came out of the mines most likely Roland thought There are radium mines somewhere about That would account for the skin I wonder that the sun doesnt kill them Then as he watched the one on the enda creature with a face like melted candlewaxdid die or collapsed at any rate He Roland was quite sure it was a male went to his knees with a low gobbling cry groping for the hand of the thing walking next to himsomething with a lumpy bald head and red sores sizzling on its neck This creature took no notice of its fallen companion but kept its dim eyes on Roland lurching along in rough step with its remaining companions Stop where you are Roland said Ware me if youd live to see days end Ware me very well He spoke mostly to the one in the centre who wore ancient red suspenders over rags of shirt and a filthy bowler hat This gent had only one good eye and it peered at the gunslinger with a greed as horrible as it was unmistakable The one beside Bowler Hat Roland believed this one might be a woman with the dangling vestiges of breasts beneath the vest it wore threw the chairleg it held The arc was true but the missile fell ten yards short Roland thumbed back the trigger of his revolver and fired again This time the dirt displaced by the slug kicked up on the tattered remains of Bowler Hats shoe instead of on a lame dogs paw The green folk didnt run as the dog had but they stopped staring at him with their dull greed Had the missing folk of Eluria finished up in these creatures stomachs Roland couldnt believe it although he knew perfectly well that such as these held no scruple against cannibalism And perhaps it wasnt cannibalism not really how could such things as these be considered human whatever they might once have been They were too slow too stupid If they had dared come back into town after the Sheriff had run them out they would have been burned or stoned to death Without thinking about what he was doing wanting only to free his other hand to draw his second gun if the apparitions didnt see reason Roland stuffed the medallion which he had taken from the dead boy into the pocket of his jeans pushing the broken finelink chain in after They stood staring at him their strangely twisted shadows drawn out behind them What next Tell them to go back where theyd come from Roland didnt know if theyd do it and in any case had decided he liked them best where he could see them And at least there was no question now about staying to bury the boy named James that conundrum had been solved Stand steady he said in the low speech beginning to retreat First fellow that moves Before he could finish one of thema thickchested troll with a pouty toads mouth and what looked like gills on the sides of his wattled necklunged forward gibbering in a highpitched and peculiarly flabby voice It might have been a species of laughter He was waving what looked like a pianoleg Roland fired Mr Toads chest caved in like a bad piece of roofing He ran backwards several steps trying to catch his balance and clawing at his chest with the hand not holding the pianoleg His feet clad in dirty red velvet slippers with curledup toes tangled in each other and he fell over making a queer and somehow lonely gargling sound He let go of his club rolled over on one side tried to rise and then fell back into the dust The brutal sun glared into his open eyes and as Roland watched white tendrils of steam began to rise from his skin which was rapidly losing its green undertint There was also a hissing sound like a gob of spit on top of a hot stove Saves explaining at least Roland thought and swept his eyes over the others All right he was the first one to move Who wants to be the second None did it seemed They only stood there watching him not coming at him but not retreating either He thought as he had about the crucifixdog that he should kill them as they stood there just draw his other gun and mow them down It would be the work of seconds only and childs play to his gifted hands even if some ran But he couldnt Not just cold like that He wasnt that kind of killer at least not yet Very slowly he began to step backwards first bending his course around the watering trough then putting it between him and them When Bowler Hat took a step forward Roland didnt give the others in the line a chance to copy him he put a bullet into the dust of High Street an inch in advance of Bowler Hats foot Thats your last warning he said still using the low speech He had no idea if they understood it didnt really care He guessed they caught this tunes music well enough Next bullet I fire eats up someones heart The way it works is you stay and I go You get this one chance Follow me and you all die Its too hot to play games and Ive lost my Booh cried a rough liquidy voice from behind him There was unmistakable glee in it Roland saw a shadow grow from the shadow of the overturned freight wagon which he had now almost reached and had just time to understand that another of the green folk had been hiding beneath it As he began to turn a club crashed down on Rolands shoulder numbing his right arm all the way to the wrist He held on to the gun and fired once but the bullet went into one of the wagonwheels smashing a wooden spoke and turning the wheel on its hub with a high screeching sound Behind him he heard the green folk in the street uttering hoarse yapping cries as they charged forward The thing which had been hiding beneath the overturned wagon was a monster with two heads growing out of his neck one with the vestigial slack face of a corpse The other although just as green was more lively Broad lips spread in a cheerful grin as he raised his club to strike again Roland drew with his left handthe one that wasnt numbed and distant He had time to put one bullet through the bushwhackers grin flinging him backwards in a spray of blood and teeth the bludgeon flying out of his relaxing fingers Then the others were on him clubbing and drubbing The gunslinger was able to slip the first couple of blows and there was one moment when he thought he might be able to spin around to the rear of the overturned wagon spin and turn and go to work with his guns Surely he would be able to do that Surely his quest for the Dark Tower wasnt supposed to end on the sunblasted street of a little farwestern town called Eluria at the hands of half a dozen greenskinned slow mutants Surely ka could not be so cruel But Bowler Hat caught him with a vicious sidehand blow and Roland crashed into the wagons slowly spinning rear wheel instead of skirting around it As he went to his hands and knees still scrambling and trying to turn trying to evade the blows which rained down on him he saw there were now many more than half a dozen Coming up the street towards the town square were at least thirty green men and women This wasnt a clan but a damned tribe of them And in broad hot daylight Slow mutants were in his experience creatures that loved the dark almost like toadstools with brains and he had never seen any such as these before They The one in the red vest was female Her bare breasts swinging beneath the dirty red vest were the last things he saw clearly as they gathered around and above him bashing away with their clubs The one with the nails studded in it came down on his lower right calf sinking its stupid rusty fangs in deep He tried again to raise one of the big guns his vision was fading now but that wouldnt help them if he got to shooting he had always been the most hellishly talented of them Jamie DeCurry had once proclaimed that Roland could shoot blindfolded because he had eyes in his fingers and it was kicked out of his hand and into the dust Although he could still feel the smooth sandalwood grip of the other he thought it was nevertheless already gone He could smell themthe rich rotted smell of decaying meat Or was that only his hands as he raised them in a feeble and useless effort to protect his head His hands which had been in the polluted water where flecks and strips of the dead boys skin floated The clubs slamming down on him slamming down all over him as if the green folk wanted not just to beat him to death but to tenderize him as they did so And as he went down into the darkness of what he most certainly believed would be his death he heard the bugs singing the dog he had spared barking and the bells hung on the church door ringing These sounds merged together into strangely sweet music Then that was gone too the darkness ate it all The gunslingers return to the world wasnt like coming back to consciousness after a blow which hed done several times before and it wasnt like waking from sleep either It was like rising Im dead he thought at some point during this process when the power to think had been at least partially restored to him Dead and rising into whatever afterlife there is Thats what it must be The singing I hear is the singing of dead souls Total blackness gave way to the dark grey of rainclouds then to the lighter grey of fog This brightened to the uniform clarity of a heavy mist moments before the sun breaks through And through it all was that sense of rising as if he had been caught in some mild but powerful updraught As the sense of rising began to diminish and the brightness behind his eyelids grew Roland at last began to believe he was still alive It was the singing that convinced him Not dead souls not the heavenly host of angels sometimes described by the Jesusman preachers but only those bugs A little like crickets but sweetervoiced The ones he had heard in Eluria On this thought he opened his eyes His belief that he was still alive was severely tried for Roland found himself hanging suspended in a world of white beautyhis first bewildered thought was that he was in the sky floating within a fairweather cloud All around him was the reedy singing of the bugs Now he could hear the tinkling of bells too He tried to turn his head and swayed in some sort of harness He could hear it creaking The soft singing of the bugs like crickets in the grass at the end of day back home in Gilead hesitated and broke rhythm When it did what felt like a tree of pain grew up Rolands back He had no idea what its burning branches might be but the trunk was surely his spine A far deadlier pain sank into one of his lower legs in his confusion the gunslinger could not tell which one Thats where the club with the nails in it got me he thought And more pain in his head His skull felt like a badly cracked egg He cried out and could hardly believe that the harsh crows caw he heard came from his own throat He thought he could also hear very faintly the barking of the crossdog but surely that was his imagination Am I dying Have I awakened once more at the very end A hand stroked his brow He could feel it but not see itfingers trailing across his skin pausing here and there to massage a knot or a line Delicious like a drink of cool water on a hot day He began to close his eyes and then a horrible idea came to him suppose that hand were green its owner wearing a tattered red vest over her hanging dugs What if it is What could you do Hush man a young womans voice said or perhaps it was the voice of a girl Certainly the first person Roland thought of was Susan the girl from Mejis she who had spoken to him as thee Where where Hush stir not Tis far too soon The pain in his back was subsiding now but the image of the pain as a tree remained for his very skin seemed to be moving like leaves in a light breeze How could that be He let the question golet all questions goand concentrated on the small cool hand stroking his brow Hush pretty man Gods love be upon ye Yet its sore hurt ye are Be still Heal The dog had hushed its barking if it had ever been there in the first place and Roland became aware of that low creaking sound again It reminded him of horsetethers or somethinghangropeshe didnt like to think of Now he believed he could feel pressure beneath his thighs his buttocks and perhaps yes his shoulders Im not in a bed at all I think Im above a bed Can that be He supposed he could be in a sling He seemed to remember once as a boy that some fellow had been suspended that way in the horsedoctors room behind the Great Hall A stablehand who had been burned too badly by kerosene to be laid in a bed The man had died but not soon enough for two nights his shrieks had filled the sweet summer air of the Gathering Fields Am I burned then nothing but a cinder with legs hanging in a sling The fingers touched the centre of his brow rubbing away the frown forming there And it was as if the voice which went with the hand had read his thoughts picking them up with the tips of her clever soothing fingers Yell be fine if God wills sai the voice which went with the hand said But time belongs to God not to you No he would have said if he had been able Time belongs to the Tower Then he slipped down again descending as smoothly as he had risen going away from the hand and the dreamlike sounds of the singing insects and chiming bells There was an interval that might have been sleep or perhaps unconsciousness but he never went all the way back down At one point he thought he heard the girls voice although he couldnt be sure because this time it was raised in fury or fear or both No she cried Ye cant have it off him and ye know it Go your course and stop talking of it do When he rose back to consciousness the second time he was no stronger in body but a little more himself in mind What he saw when he opened his eyes wasnt the inside of a cloud but at first that same phrasewhite beautyrecurred to him It was in some ways the most beautiful place Roland had ever been in his life partially because he still had a life of course but mostly because it was so fey and peaceful It was a huge room high and long When Roland at last turned his headcautiously so cautiouslyto take its measure as well as he could he thought it must run at least two hundred yards from end to end It was built narrow but its height gave the place a feeling of tremendous airiness There were no walls or ceilings such as those he was familiar with although it was a little like being in a vast tent Above him the sun struck and diffused its light across billowy panels of thin white silk turning them into the bright swags which he had first mistaken for clouds Beneath this silk canopy the room was as grey as twilight The walls also silk rippled like sails in a faint breeze Hanging from each wallpanel was a curved rope bearing small bells These lay against the fabric and rang in low and charming unison like windchimes when the walls rippled An aisle ran down the centre of the long room on either side of it were scores of beds each made up with clean white sheets and headed with crisp white pillows There were perhaps forty on the far side of the aisle all empty and another forty on Rolands side There were two other occupied beds here one next to Roland on his left This fellowIts the boy The one who was in the trough The idea ran goosebumps up Rolands arms and gave him a nasty superstitious start He peered more closely at the sleeping boy Cant be Youre just dazed thats all it cant be Yet closer scrutiny refused to dispel the idea It certainly seemed to be the boy from the trough probably ill why else would he be in a place like this but far from dead Roland could see the slow rise and fall of his chest and the occasional twitch of the fingers which dangled over the side of the bed You didnt get a good enough look at him to be sure of anything and after a few days in that trough his own mother couldnt have said for sure who it was But Roland whod had a mother knew better than that He also knew that hed seen the gold medallion around the boys neck just before the attack of the green folk he had taken it from this lads corpse and put it in his pocket Now someonethe proprietors of this place most likely they who had sorcerously restored the lad named James to his interrupted lifehad taken it back from Roland and put it around the boys neck again Had the girl with the wonderfully cool hand done that Did she in consequence think Roland a ghoul who would steal from the dead He didnt like to think so In fact the notion made him more uncomfortable than the idea that the young cowboys bloated body had been somehow returned to its normal size and then reanimated Further down the aisle on this side perhaps a dozen empty beds away from the boy and Roland Deschain the gunslinger saw a third inmate of this queer infirmary This fellow looked at least four times the age of the lad twice the age of the gunslinger He had a long beard more grey than black that hung to his upper chest in two straggly forks The face above it was sundarkened heavily lined and pouched beneath the eyes Running from his left cheek and across the bridge of his nose was a thick dark mark which Roland took to be a scar The bearded man was either asleep or unconsciousRoland could hear him snoringand was suspended three feet above his bed held up by a complex series of white belts that glimmered in the dim air These crisscrossed each other making a series of figure eights all the way around the mans body He looked like a bug in some exotic spiders web He wore a gauzy white beddress One of the belts ran beneath his buttocks elevating his crotch in a way that seemed to offer the bulge of his privates to the grey and dreaming air Further down his body Roland could see the dark shadowshapes of his legs They appeared to be twisted like ancient dead trees Roland didnt like to think in how many places they must have been broken to look like that And yet they appeared to be moving How could they be if the bearded man was unconscious It was a trick of the light perhaps or of the shadows perhaps the gauzy singlet the man was wearing was stirring in a light breeze or Roland looked away up at the billowy silk panels high above trying to control the accelerating beat of his heart What he saw hadnt been caused by the wind or a shadow or anything else The mans legs were somehow moving without moving as Roland had seemed to feel his own back moving without moving He didnt know what could cause such a phenomenon and didnt want to know at least not yet Im not ready he whispered His lips felt very dry He closed his eyes again wanting to sleep wanting not to think about what the bearded mans twisted legs might indicate about his own condition But  But youd better get ready That was the voice that always seemed to come when he tried to slack off to scamp a job or take the easy way around an obstacle It was the voice of Cort his old teacher The man whose stick they had all feared as boys They hadnt feared his stick as much as his mouth however His jeers when they were weak his contempt when they complained or tried whining about their lot Are you a gunslinger Roland If you are you better get ready Roland opened his eyes again and turned his head to the left again As he did he felt something shift against his chest Moving very slowly he raised his right hand out of the sling that held it The pain in his back stirred and muttered He stopped moving until he decided the pain was going to get no worse if he was careful at least then lifted the hand the rest of the way to his chest It encountered finelywoven cloth Cotton He lowered his chin to his breastbone and saw he was wearing a beddress like the one draped on the body of the bearded man Roland reached beneath the neck of the gown and felt a fine chain A little further down his fingers encountered a rectangular metal shape He thought he knew what it was but had to be sure He pulled it out still moving with great care trying not to engage any of the muscles in his back A gold medallion He dared the pain lifting it until he could read what was engraved upon it James Loved of family Loved of GOD He tucked it into the top of the beddress again and looked back at the sleeping boy in the next bedin it not suspended over it The sheet was only pulled up to the boys ribcage and the medallion lay on the pristine white breast of his beddress The same medallion Roland now wore Except Roland thought he understood and understanding was a relief He looked back at the bearded man and saw an exceedingly strange thing the thick black line of scar across the bearded mans cheek and nose was gone Where it had been was the pinkishred mark of a healing wound a cut or perhaps a slash I imagined it No gunslinger Corts voice returned Such as you was not made to imagine As you well know The little bit of movement had tired him out again or perhaps it was the thinking which had really tired him out The singing bugs and chiming bells combined and made something too much like a lullaby to resist This time when Roland closed his eyes he slept When Roland awoke again he was at first sure that he was still sleeping Dreaming Having a nightmare Once at the time he had met and fallen in love with Susan Delgado he had known a witch named Rheathe first real witch of MidWorld he had ever met It was she who had caused Susans death although Roland had played his own part Now opening his eyes and seeing Rhea not just once but five times over he thought This is what comes of remembering those old times By conjuring Susan Ive conjured Rhea of the Coos as well Rhea and her sisters The five were dressed in billowing habits as white as the walls and the panels of the ceiling Their antique crones faces were framed in wimples just as white their skin as grey and runnelled as droughted earth by comparison Hanging like phylacteries from the bands of silk imprisoning their hair if they indeed had hair were lines of tiny bells which chimed as they moved or spoke Upon the snowy breasts of their habits was embroidered a bloodred rose the sigil of the Dark Tower Seeing this Roland thought I am not dreaming These harridans are real He wakes one of them cried in a gruesomely coquettish voice Oooo Ooooh Ah They fluttered like birds The one in the centre stepped forward and as she did their faces seemed to shimmer like the silk walls of the ward They werent old after all he sawmiddleaged perhaps but not old Yes They are old They changed The one who now took charge was taller than the others and with a broad slightly bulging brow She bent towards Roland and the bells which fringed her forehead tinkled The sound made him feel sick somehow and weaker than he had felt a moment before Her hazel eyes were intent Greedy mayhap She touched his cheek for a moment and a numbness seemed to spread there Then she glanced down and a look which could have been disquiet cramped her face She took her hand back Ye wake pretty man So ye do Tis well Who are you Where am l We are the Little Sisters of Eluria she said I am Sister Mary Here is Sister Louise and Sister Michela and Sister Coquina And Sister Tamra said the last A lovely lass of oneandtwenty She giggled Her face shimmered and for a moment she was again as old as the world Hooked of nose grey of skin Roland thought once more of Rhea They moved closer encircling the complication of harness in which he lay suspended and when Roland shrank away the pain roared up his back and injured leg again He groaned The straps holding him creaked Ooooo It hurts Hurts him Hurts so fierce They pressed even closer as if his pain fascinated them And now he could smell them a dry and earthy smell The one named Sister Michela reached out  Go away Leave him Have I not told ye before They jumped back from this voice startled Sister Mary looked particularly annoyed But she stepped back with one final glare Roland would have sworn it at the medallion lying on his chest He had tucked it back under the beddress at his last waking but it was out again now A sixth sister appeared pushing rudely in between Mary and Tamra This one perhaps was only oneandtwenty with flushed cheeks smooth skin and dark eyes Her white habit billowed like a dream The red rose over her breast stood out like a curse Go Leave him Oooo my dear cried Sister Louise in a voice both laughing and angry Heres Jenna the baby and has she fallen in love with him She has laughed Tamra Babys heart is his for the purchase Oh so it is agreed Sister Coquina Mary turned to the newcomer lips pursed into a tight line Ye have no business here saucy girl I do if I say I do Sister Jenna replied She seemed more in charge of herself now A curl of black hair had escaped her wimple and lay across her forehead in a comma Now go Hes not up to your jokes and laughter Order us not Sister Mary said for we never joke So you know Sister Jenna The girls face softened a little and Roland saw she was afraid It made him afraid for her For himself as well Go she repeated Tis not the time Are there not others to tend Sister Mary seemed to consider The others watched her At last she nodded and smiled down at Roland Again her face seemed to shimmer like something seen through a heathaze What he saw or thought he saw beneath was horrible and watchful Bide well pretty man she said to Roland Bide with us a bit and well heal ye What choice have I Roland thought The others laughed birdlike titters which rose into the dimness like ribbons Sister Michela actually blew him a kiss Come ladies Sister Mary cried Well leave Jenna with him a bit in memory of her mother who we loved well And with that she led the others away five white birds flying off down the centre aisle their skirts nodding this way and that Thank you Roland said looking up at the owner of the cool hand for he knew it was she who had soothed him She took up his fingers as if to prove this and caressed them They mean ye no harm she said yet Roland saw she believed not a word of it nor did he He was in trouble here very bad trouble What is this place Our place she said simply The home of the Little Sisters of Eluria Our convent if ee like This is no convent Roland said looking past her at the empty beds Its an infirmary Isnt it A hospital she said still stroking his fingers We serve the doctors and they serve us  He was fascinated by the black curl lying on the cream of her browwould have stroked it if he had dared reach up Just to tell its texture He found it beautiful because it was the only dark thing in all this white The white had lost its charm for him We are hospitallers or were before the world moved on Are you for the Jesusman She looked surprised for a moment almost shocked and then laughed merrily No not us If you are hospitallers nurses where are the doctors She looked at him biting at her lip as if trying to decide something Roland found her doubt utterly charming and he realized that sick or not he was looking at a woman as a woman for the first time since Susan Delgado had died and that had been long ago The whole world had changed since then and not for the better Would you really know Yes of course he said a little surprised A little disquieted too He kept waiting for her face to shimmer and change as the faces of the others had done It didnt There was none of that unpleasant deadearth smell about her either Wait he cautioned himself Believe nothing here least of all your senses Not yet I suppose you must she said with a sigh It tinkled the bells at her forehead which were darker in colour than those the others worenot black like her hair but charry somehow as if they had been hung in the smoke of a campfire Their sound however was brightest silver Promise me youll not scream and wake the pube in yonder bed Pube The boy Do ye promise Aye he said falling into the halfforgotten patois of the Outer Arc without even being aware of it Susans dialect Its been long since I screamed pretty She coloured more definitely at that roses more natural and lively than the one on her breast mounting in her cheeks Dont call pretty what ye cant properly see she said Then push back the wimple you wear Her face he could see perfectly well but he badly wanted to see her hairhungered for it almost A full flood of black in all this dreaming white Of course it might be cropped those of her order might wear it that way but he somehow didnt think so No tis not allowed By who Big Sister She who calls herself Mary Aye her  She started away then paused and looked back over her shoulder In another girl her age one as pretty as this that look back would have been flirtatious This girls was only grave Remember your promise Aye no screams She went to the bearded man skirt swinging In the dimness she cast only a blur of shadow on the empty beds she passed When she reached the man this one was unconscious Roland thought not just sleeping she looked back at Roland once more He nodded Sister Jenna stepped close to the suspended man on the far side of his bed so that Roland saw her through the twists and loops of woven white silk She placed her hands lightly on the left side of his chest bent over him and shook her head from side to side like one expressing a brisk negative The bells she wore on her forehead rang sharply and Roland once more felt that weird stirring up his back accompanied by a low ripple of pain It was as if he had shuddered without actually shuddering or shuddered in a dream What happened next almost did jerk a scream from him he had to bite his lips against it Once more the unconscious mans legs seemed to move without moving because it was what was on them that moved The mans hairy shins ankles and feet were exposed below the hem of his beddress Now a black wave of bugs moved down them They were singing fiercely like an army column that sings as it marches Roland remembered the black scar across the mans cheek and nosethe scar which had disappeared More such as these of course And they were on him as well That was how he could shiver without shivering They were all over his back Battening on him No keeping back a scream wasnt as easy as he had expected it to be The bugs ran down to the tips of the suspended mans toes then leaped off them in waves like creatures leaping off an embankment and into a swimming hole They organized themselves quickly and easily on the bright white sheet below and began to march down to the floor in a battalion about a foot wide Roland couldnt get a good look at them the distance was too far and the light too dim but he thought they were perhaps twice the size of ants and a little smaller than the fat honeybees which had swarmed the flowerbeds back home They sang as they went The bearded man didnt sing As the swarms of bugs which had coated his twisted legs began to diminish he shuddered and groaned The young woman put her hand on his brow and soothed him making Roland a little jealous even in his revulsion at what he was seeing And was what he was seeing really so awful In Gilead leeches had been used for certain ailmentsswellings of the brain the armpits and the groin primarily When it came to the brain the leeches ugly as they were were certainly preferable to the next step which was trepanning Yet there was something loathsome about them perhaps only because he couldnt see them well and something awful about trying to imagine them all over his back as he hung here helpless Not singing though Why Because they were feeding Sleeping Both at once The bearded mans groans subsided The bugs marched away across the floor towards one of the mildly rippling silken walls Roland lost sight of them in the shadows Jenna came back to him her eyes anxious Ye did well Yet I see how ye feel its on your face The doctors he said Yes Their power is very great but She dropped her voice I believe that drover is beyond their help His legs are a little better and the wounds on his face are all but healed but he has injuries where the doctors cannot reach  She traced a hand across her midsection suggesting the location of these injuries if not their nature And me Roland asked Ye were taen by the green folk she said Ye must have angered them powerfully for them not to kill ye outright They roped ye and dragged ye instead Tamra Michela and Louise were out gathering herbs They saw the green folk at play with ye and bade them stop but  Do the muties always obey you Sister Jenna She smiled perhaps pleased he remembered her name Not always but mostly This time they did or yed have now found the clearing in the trees I suppose so The skin was stripped almost clean off your backred ye were from nape to waist Yell always bear the scars but the doctors have gone far towards healing ye And their singing is passing fair is it not Yes Roland said but the thought of those black things all over his back roosting in his raw flesh still revolted him I owe you thanks and give it freely Anything I can do for you  Tell me your name then Do that Im Roland of Gilead A gunslinger I had revolvers Sister Jenna Have you seen them Ive seen no shooters she said but cast her eyes aside The roses bloomed in her cheeks again She might be a good nurse and fair but Roland thought her a poor liar He was glad Good liars were common Honesty on the other hand came dear Let the untruth pass for now he told himself She speaks it out of fear I think Jenna The cry came from the deeper shadows at the far end of the infirmarytoday it seemed longer than ever to the gunslingerand Sister Jenna jumped guiltily Come away Yeve passed words enough to entertain twenty men Let him sleep Aye she called then turned back to Roland Dont let on that I showed you the doctors Mum is the word Jenna She paused biting her lip again then suddenly swept back her wimple It fell against the nape of her neck in a soft chiming of bells Freed from its confinement her hair swept against her cheeks like shadows Am I pretty Am I Tell me the truth Roland of Gileadno flattery For flatterys kind only a candles length Pretty as a summer night What she saw in his face seemed to please her more than his words because she smiled radiantly She pulled the wimple up again tucking her hair back in with quick little fingerpokes Am I decent Decent as fair he said then cautiously lifted an arm and pointed at her brow One curls out just there Aye always that one to devil me  With a comical little grimace she tucked it back Roland thought how much he would like to kiss her rosy cheeks and perhaps her rosy mouth for good measure Alls well he said Jenna The cry was more impatient than ever Meditations Im coming just now she called and gathered her voluminous skirts to go Yet she turned back once more her face now very grave and very serious One more thing she said in a voice only a step above a whisper She snatched a quick look around The gold medallion ye wearye wear it because its yours Doee understand James Yes  He turned his head a bit to look at the sleeping boy This is my brother If they ask yes To say different would be to get Jenna in serious trouble How serious he did not ask and she was gone in any case seeming to flow along the aisle between all the empty beds her skirt caught up in one hand The roses had fled from her face leaving her cheeks and brow ashy He remembered the greedy look on the faces of the others how they had gathered around him in a tightening knot and the way their faces had shimmered Six women five old and one young Doctors that sang and then crawled away across the floor when dismissed by jingling bells And an improbable hospital ward of perhaps a hundred beds a ward with a silk roof and silk walls and all the beds empty save three Roland didnt understand why Jenna had taken the dead boys medallion from his pants pocket and put it around his neck but he had an idea that if they found out she had done so the Little Sisters of Eluria might kill her Roland closed his eyes and the soft singing of the doctorinsects once again floated him off into sleep Roland dreamed that a very large bug a doctorbug mayhap was flying around his head and banging repeatedly into his nosecollisions which were annoying rather than painful He swiped at the bug repeatedly and although his hands were eerily fast under ordinary circumstances he kept missing it And each time he missed the bug giggled Im slow because Ive been sick he thought No ambushed Dragged across the ground by slow mutants saved by the Little Sisters of Eluria Roland had a sudden vivid image of a mans shadow growing from the shadow of an overturned freightwagon heard a rough gleeful voice cry Booh He jerked awake hard enough to set his body rocking in its complication of slings and the woman who had been standing beside his head giggling as she tapped his nose lightly with a wooden spoon stepped back so quickly that the bowl in her other hand slipped from her fingers Rolands hands shot out and they were as quick as everhis frustrated failure to catch the bug had been only part of his dream He caught the bowl before more than a few drops could spill The womanSister Coquinalooked at him with round eyes There was pain all up and down his back from the sudden movement but it was nowhere near as sharp as it had been before and there was no sensation of movement on his skin Perhaps the doctors were only sleeping but he had an idea they were gone He held out his hand for the spoon Coquina had been teasing him with he found he wasnt surprised at all that one of these would tease a sick and sleeping man in such a way it only would have surprised him if it had been Jenna and she handed it to him her eyes still big How speedy ye are she said Twas like a magic trick and you still rising from sleep Remember it sai he said and tried the soup There were tiny bits of chicken floating in it He probably would have considered it bland under other circumstances but under these it seemed ambrosial He began to eat greedily What do ee mean by that she asked The light was very dim now the wallpanels across the way a pinkishorange that suggested sunset In this light Coquina looked quite young and pretty but it was a glamour Roland was sure a sorcerous kind of makeup I mean nothing in particular Roland dismissed the spoon as too slow preferring to tilt the bowl itself to his lips In this way he disposed of the soup in four large gulps You have been kind to me Aye so we have she said rather indignantly and I hope your kindness has no hidden motive If it does Sister remember that Im quick And as for myself I have not always been kind She made no reply only took the bowl when Roland handed it back She did this delicately perhaps not wanting to touch his fingers Her eyes dropped to where the medallion lay once more hidden beneath the breast of his beddress He said no more not wanting to weaken the implied threat by reminding her that the man who made it was unarmed next to naked and hung in the air because his back couldnt yet bear the weight of his body Wheres Sister Jenna he asked Oooo Sister Coquina said raising her eyebrows We like her do we She makes our heart go  She put her hand against the rose on her breast and fluttered it rapidly Not at all not at all Roland said but she was kind I doubt she would have teased me with a spoon as some would Sister Coquinas smile faded She looked both angry and worried Say nothing of that to Mary if she comes by later Ye might get me in trouble Should I care I might get back at one who caused me trouble by causing little Jenna trouble Sister Coquina said Shes in Big Sisters black books just now anyway Sister Mary doesnt care for the way Jenna spoke to her about ye nor does she like it that Jenna came back to us wearing the Dark Bells This was no sooner out of her mouth before Sister Coquina put her hand over that frequently imprudent organ as if realizing she had said too much Roland intrigued by what shed said but not liking to show it just now only replied Ill keep my mouth shut about you if you keep your mouth shut to Sister Mary about Jenna Coquina looked relieved Aye thats a bargain  She leaned forward confidingly Shes in Thoughtful House Thats the little cave in the hillside where we have to go and meditate when Big Sister decides weve been bad Shell have to stay and consider her impudence until Mary lets her out  She paused then said abruptly Whos this beside ye Do ye know Roland turned his head and saw that the young man was awake and had been listening His eyes were as dark as Jennas Know him Roland asked with what he hoped was the right touch of scorn Should I not know my own brother Is he now and him so young and you so old Another of the sisters materialized out of the darkness Sister Tamra who had called herself oneandtwenty In the moment before she reached Rolands bed her face was that of a hag who will never see eighty again or ninety Then it shimmered and was once more the plump healthy countenance of a thirtyyearold matron Except for the eyes They remained yellowish in the corneas gummy in the corners and watchful Hes the youngest I the eldest Roland said Betwixt us are seven others and twenty years of our parents lives How sweet And if hes yer brother then yell know his name wont ye Know it very well Before the gunslinger could flounder the young man said They think youve forgotten such a simple hook as John Norman What culleens they be eh Jimmy Coquina and Tamra looked at the pale boy in the bed next to Rolands clearly angry and clearly trumped For the time being at least Youve fed him your muck the boy whose medallion undoubtedly proclaimed him John Loved of Family Loved of God said Why dont you go and let us have a natter Well Sister Coquina huffed I like the gratitude around here so I do Im grateful for whats given me Norman responded looking at her steadily but not for what folk would take away Tamra snorted through her nose turned violently enough for her swirling dress to push a draught of air into Rolands face and then took her leave Coquina stayed a moment Be discreet and mayhap someone ye like better than ye like me will get out of hack in the morning instead of a week from tonight Without waiting for a reply she turned and followed Sister Tamra Roland and John Norman waited until they were both gone and then Norman turned to Roland and spoke in a low voice My brother Dead Roland nodded The medallion I took in case I should meet with any of his people It rightly belongs to you Im sorry for your loss Thankeesai  John Normans lower lip trembled then firmed I knew the green men did for him although these old biddies wouldnt tell me for sure They did for plenty and cotched the rest Perhaps the Sisters didnt know for sure They knew Dont you doubt it They dont say much but they know plenty The only one any different is Jenna Thats who the old battleaxe meant when she said your friend Aye Roland nodded And she said something about the Dark Bells Id know more of that if would were could Shes something special Jenna is More like a princesssomeone whose place is made by bloodline and cant be refusedthan like the other Sisters I lie here and look like Im asleepits safer I thinkbut Ive heard em talking Jennas just come back among em recently and those Dark Bells mean something special but Marys still the one who swings the weight I think the Dark Bells are only ceremonial like the rings the old Barons used to hand down from father to son Was it she who put Jimmys medal around your neck Yes Dont take it off whatever you do  His face was strained grim I dont know if its the gold or the God but they dont like to get too close I think thats the only reason Im still here  Now his voice dropped all the way to a whisper They aint human Well perhaps a bit fey and magical but No With what was clearly an effort the boy got up on one elbow He looked at Roland earnestly Youre thinking about hubberwomen or witches These aint hubbers nor witches either They aint human Then what are they Dont know How came you here John Speaking in a low voice John Norman told Roland what he knew of what had happened to him He his brother and four other young men who were quick and owned good horses had been hired as scouts riding drogueandforward protecting a longhaul caravan of seven freightwagons taking goodsseeds food tools mail and four ordered bridesto an unincorporated township called Tejuas some two hundred miles further west of Eluria The scouts rode fore and aft of the goodstrain in turn and turn about fashion one brother rode with each party because Norman explained when they were together they fought like well Like brothers Roland suggested John Norman managed a brief pained smile Aye he said The trio of which John was a part had been riding drogue about two miles behind the freightwagons when the green mutants had sprung an ambush in Eluria How many wagons did you see when you got there he asked Roland Only one Overturned How many bodies Only your brothers John Norman nodded grimly They wouldnt take him because of the medallion I think The muties The Sisters The muties care nothing for gold or God These bitches though  He looked into the dark which was now almost complete Roland felt lethargy creeping over him again but it wasnt until later that he realized the soup had been drugged The other wagons Roland asked The ones not overturned The muties would have taken them and the goods as well Norman said They dont care for gold or God the Sisters dont care for goods Like as not they have their own foodstuffs something Id as soon not think of Nasty stuff like those bugs He and the other drogue riders galloped into Eluria but the fight was over by the time they got there Men had been lying about some dead but many more still alive At least two of the ordered brides had still been alive as well Survivors able to walk were being herded together by the green folkJohn Norman remembered the one in the bowler hat very well and the woman in the ragged red vest Norman and the other two had tried to fight He had seen one of hi pards gutshot by an arrow and then he saw no moresomeone had cracked him over the head from behind and the lights had gone out Roland wondered if the ambusher had cried Booh before he had struck but didnt ask When I woke up again I was here Norman said I saw that some of the othersmost of themhad those cursed bugs on them Others Roland looked at the empty beds In the growing darkness they glimmered like white islands How many were brought here At least twenty They healed the bugs healed em and then one by one they disappeared Youd go to sleep and when you woke up thered be one more empty bed One by one they went until only me and that one down yonder was left He looked at Roland solemnly And now you Norman Rolands head was swimming I I reckon I know whats wrong with you Norman said He seemed to speak from far away perhaps from all the way around the curve of I the earth Its the soup But a man has to eat A woman too If shes a natural woman anyway These ones aint natural Even Sister Jennas not natural Nice dont mean natural  Further and further away And shell be like them in the end Mark me well Cant move  Saying even that required a huge effort It was like moving boulders No  Norman suddenly laughed It was a shocking sound and echoed in the growing blackness which filled Rolands head It aint just sleepmedicine they put in their soup its cantmovemedicine too Theres nothing much wrong with me brother so why do you think Im still here Norman was now speaking not from around the curve of the earth but perhaps from the moon He said I dont think either of us is ever going to see the sun shining on a flat piece of ground again Youre wrong about that Roland tried to reply and more in that vein as well but nothing came out He sailed around to the black side of the moon losing all his words in the void he found there Yet he never quite lost awareness of himself Perhaps the dose of medicine in Sister Coquinas soup had been badly calculated or perhaps it was just that they had never had a gunslinger to work their mischief on and did not know they had one now Except of course for Sister Jennashe knew At some point in the night whispering giggling voices and lightly chiming bells brought him back from the darkness where he had been biding not quite asleep or unconscious Around him so constant he now barely heard it were the singing doctors Roland opened his eyes He saw pale and chancy light dancing in the black air The giggles and whispers were closer Roland tried to turn his head and at first couldnt He rested gathered his will into a hard blue ball and tried again This time his head did turn Only a little but a little was enough It was five of the Little SistersMary Louise Tamra Coquina Michela They came up the long aisle of the black infirmary laughing together like children out on a prank carrying long tapers in silver holders the bells lining the foreheadbands of their wimples chiming little silver runs of sound They gathered about the bed of the bearded man From within their circle candleglow rose in a shimmery column that died before it got halfway to the silken ceiling Sister Mary spoke briefly Roland recognized her voice but not the wordsit was neither low speech nor the High but some other language entirely One phrase stood outcan de lach mi him en towand he had no idea what it might mean He realized that now he could hear only the tinkle of bellsthe doctorbugs had stilled Ras me On On Sister Mary cried in a harsh powerful voice The candles went out The light which had shone through the wings of their wimples as they gathered around the bearded mans bed vanished and all was darkness once more Roland waited for what might happen next his skin cold He tried to flex his hands and feet and could not He had been able to move his head perhaps fifteen degrees otherwise he was as paralysed as a fly neatly wrapped up and hung in a spiders web The low jingling of bells in the black and then sucking sounds As soon as he heard them Roland knew hed been waiting for them Some part of him had known what the Little Sisters of Eluria were all along If Roland could have raised his hands he would have put them to his ears to block those sounds out As it was he could only lie still listening and waiting for them to stop For a long timefor ever it seemedthey did not The women slurped and grunted like pigs snuffling halfliquefied feed out of a trough There was even one resounding belch followed by more whispered giggles these ended when Sister Mary uttered a single curt wordHais And once there was a low moaning cryfrom the bearded man Roland was quite sure If so it was his last on this side of the clearing In time the sound of their feeding began to taper off As it did the bugs began to sing againfirst hesitantly then with more confidence The whispering and giggling recommenced The candles were relit Roland was by now lying with his head turned in the other direction He didnt want them to know what hed seen but that wasnt all he had no urge to see more on any account He had seen and heard enough But the giggles and whispers now came his way Roland closed his eyes concentrating on the medallion which lay against his chest I dont know if its the gold or the God but they dont like to get too close John Norman had said It was good to have such a thing to remember as the Little Sister drew nigh gossiping and whispering in their strange other tongue but the medallion seemed a thin protection in the dark Faintly at a great distance Roland heard the crossdog barking As the Sisters circled him the gunslinger realized he could smell them It was a low unpleasant odour like spoiled meat And what else would they smell of such as these Such a pretty man it is  Sister Mary She spoke in a low meditative tone But such an ugly sigil it wears  Sister Tamra Well have it off him Sister Louise And then we shall have kisses Sister Coquina Kisses for all exclaimed Sister Michela with such fervent enthusiasm that they all laughed Roland discovered that not all of him was paralysed after all Part of him had in fact arisen from its sleep at the sound of their voices and now stood tall A hand reached beneath the beddress he wore touched that stiffened member encircled it caressed it He lay in silent horror feigning sleep as wet warmth almost immediately spilled from him The hand remained where it was for a moment the thumb rubbing up and down the wilting shaft Then it let him go and rose a little higher Found the wetness pooled on his lower belly Giggles soft as wind Chiming bells Roland opened his eyes the tiniest crack and looked up at the ancient faces laughing down at him in the light of their candlesglittering eyes yellow cheeks hanging teeth that jutted over lower lips Sister Michela and sister Louise appeared to have grown goatees but of course that wasnt the darkness of hair but of the bearded mans blood Mary is hand was cupped She passed it from Sister to Sister each licked from her palm in the candlelight Roland closed his eyes all the way and waited for them to be gone Eventually they were Ill never sleep again he thought and was five minutes later lost to himself and the world When Roland awoke it was full daylight the silk roof overhead a bright white and billowing in a mild breeze The doctorbugs were singing contentedly Beside him on his left Norman was heavily asleep with his head turned so far to one side that his stubbly cheek rested on his shoulder Roland and John Norman were the only ones here Further down on their side of the infirmary the bed where the bearded man had been was empty its top sheet pulled up and neatly tucked in the pillow neatly nestled in a crisp white case The complication of slings in which his body had rested was gone Roland remembered the candlesthe way their glow had combined and streamed up in a column illuminating the Sisters as they gathered around the bearded man Giggling Their damned bells jingling Now as if summoned by his thoughts came Sister Mary gliding along rapidly with Sister Louise in her wake Louise bore a tray and looked nervous Mary was frowning obviously not in good temper To be grumpy after youve fed so well Roland thought Fie Sister She reached the gunslingers bed and looked down at him I have little to thank ye for sai she said with no preamble Have I asked for your thanks he responded in a voice that sounded as dusty and littleused as the pages of an old book She took no notice Yeve made one who was only impudent and restless with her place outright rebellious Well her mother was the same way and died of it not long after returning Jenna to her proper Place Raise your hand thankless man I cant I cant move at all Oh cully Havent you heard it said fool not your mother less shes out of face I know pretty well what ye can and cant do Now raise your hand Roland raised his right hand trying to suggest more effort than it actually took He thought that this morning he might be strong enough to slip free of the slings but what then Any real walking would beyond him for hours yet even without another dose of medicine and behind Sister Mary Sister Louise was taking the cover from a fresh bowl of soup As Roland looked at it his stomach rumbled Big Sister heard and smiled a bit Even lying in bed builds an appetite in a strong man if its done long enough Wouldnt you say so Jason brother of John My name is James As you well know Sister Do I She laughed angrily Oh la And if I whipped your little sweetheart hard enough and long enoughuntil the blood jumped her back like drops of sweat let us sayshould I not whip a different name out of her Or didnt ye trust her with it during your little talk Touch her and Ill kill you She laughed again Her face shimmered her firm mouth turned into something that looked like a dying jellyfish Speak not of killing to us cully lest we speak of it to you Sister if you and Jenna dont see eye to eye why not release her from her vows and let her go her course Such as us can never be released from our vows nor be let go Her mother tried and then came back her dying and the girl sick Why it was we nursed Jenna back to health after her mother was nothing but dirt in the breeze that blows out towards EndWorld and how little she thanks us Besides she bears the Dark Bells the sigil of our sisterhood Of our katet Now eatyer belly says yere hungry Sister Louise offered the bowl but her eyes kept drifting to the shape the medallion made under the breast of his beddress Dont like it do you Roland thought and then remembered Louise by candlelight the freighters blood on her chin her ancient eyes eager as she leaned forward to lick his spend from Sister Marys hand He turned his head aside I want nothing But yere hungry Louise protested Ifee dont eat James how willee getee strength back Send Jenna Ill eat what she brings Sister Marys frown was black Yell see her no more Shes been released from Thoughtful House only on her solemn promise to double her time of meditation and to stay out of the infirmary Now eat James or whoever ye are Take whats in the soup or well cut ye with knives and rub it in with flannel poultices Either way makes no difference to us Does it Louise Nar Louise said She still held out the bowl Steam rose from it and the good smell of chicken But it might make a difference to you Sister Mary grinned humourlessly baring her unnaturally large teeth Flowing bloods risky around here The doctors dont like it It stirs them up It wasnt just the bugs that were stirred up at the sight of blood and Roland knew it He also knew he had no choice in the matter of the soup He took the bowl from Louise and ate slowly He would have given much to wipe but the look of satisfaction he saw on Sister Marys face Good she said after he had handed the bowl back and she had peered inside to make sure it was completely empty His hand thumped back into the sling which had been rigged for it already too heavy to hold up He could feel the world drawing away again Sister Mary leaned forward the billowing top of her habit touching the skin of his left shoulder He could smell her an aroma both ripe and dry and would have gagged if hed had the strength Have that foul gold thing off ye when yer strength comes back a littleput it in the pissoir under the bed Where it belongs For to be even this close to where it lies hurts my head and makes my throat close Speaking with enormous effort Roland said If you want it take it How can I stop you you bitch Once more her frown turned her face into something like a thunderhead He thought she would have slapped him if she had dared touch him so close to where the medallion lay Her ability to touch seemed to end above his waist however I think you had better consider the matter a little more fully she said I can still have Jenna whipped if I like She bears the Dark Bells but I am the Big Sister Consider that very well She left Sister Louise followed casting one looka strange combination Of fright and lustback over her shoulder Roland thought I must get out of hereI must Instead he drifted back to that dark place which wasnt quite sleep Or perhaps he did sleep at least for a while perhaps he dreamed Fingers once more caressed his fingers and lips first kissed his ear and then whispered into it Look beneath your pillow Roland but let no one know I was here At some point after this Roland opened his eyes again halfexpecting to see Sister Jennas pretty young face hovering above him and that comma of dark hair once more poking out from beneath her wimple There was no one The swags of silk overhead were at their brightest and although it was impossible to tell the hours in here with any real accuracy Roland guessed it to be around noon Perhaps three hours since his second bowl of the Sisters soup Beside him John Norman still slept his breath whistling out in faint nasal snores Roland tried to raise his hand and slide it under his pillow The hand wouldnt move He could wiggle the tips of his fingers but that was all He waited calming his mind as well as he could gathering his patience  Patience wasnt easy to come by He kept thinking about what Norman had saidthat there had been twenty survivors of the ambush at least to start with One by one they went until only me and that one down yonder was left And now you The girl wasnt here His mind spoke in the soft regretful tone of Alain one of his old friends dead these many years now She wouldnt dare not with the others watching That was only a dream you had But Roland thought perhaps it had been more than a dream Some length of time laterthe slowly shifting brightness overhead made him believe it had been about an hourRoland tried his hand again This time he was able to get it beneath his pillow This was puffy and soft tucked snugly into the wide sling which supported the gunslingers neck At first he found nothing but as his fingers worked their slow way deeper they touched what felt like a stiffish bundle of thin rods He paused gathering a little more strength every movement was like swimming in glue and then burrowed deeper It felt like a dead bouquet Wrapped around it was what felt like a ribbon Roland looked around to make sure the ward was still empty and Norman still asleep then drew out what was under the pillow It was six brittle stems of fading green with brownish reedheads at the tops They gave off a strange yeasty aroma that made Roland think of earlymorning begging expeditions to the Great House kitchens as a childforays he had usually made with Cuthbert The reeds were tied with a wide white silk ribbon and smelled like burned toast Beneath the ribbon was a fold of cloth Like everything else in this cursed place it seemed the cloth was of silk Roland was breathing hard and could feel drops of sweat on his brow Still alone thoughgood He took the scrap of cloth and unfolded it Printed painstakingly in blurred charcoal letters was this message NIBBLE HEDS Once each hour Too much CRAMPS or DETH TOMORROW NITE Cant be sooner BE CAREFUL No explanation but Roland supposed none was needed Nor did he have any option if he remained here he would die All they had to do was have the medallion off him and he felt sure Sister Mary was smart enough to figure a way to do that He nibbled at one of the dry reedheads The taste was nothing like the toast they had begged from the kitchen as boys it was bitter in his throat and hot in his stomach Less than a minute after his nibble his heartrate had doubled His muscles awakened but not in a pleasant way as after good sleep they felt first trembly and then hard as if they were gathered into knots This feeling passed rapidly and his heartbeat was back to normal before Norman stirred awake an hour or so later but he understood why Jennas note had warned him not to take more than a nibble at a timethis was very powerful stuff He slipped the bouquet of reeds back under the pillow being careful to brush away the few crumbles of vegetable matter which had dropped to the sheet Then he used the ball of his thumb to blur the painstaking charcoaled words on the bit of silk When he was finished there was nothing on the square but meaningless smudges The square he also tucked back under his pillow When Norman awoke he and the gunslinger spoke briefly of the young scouts homeDelain it was sometimes known jestingly as Dragons Lair or Liars Heaven All tall tales were said to orginate in Delain The boy asked Roland to take his medallion and that of his brother home to their parents if Roland was able and explain as well as he could what had happened to James and John sons of Jesse Youll do all that yourself Roland said No  Norman tried to raise his hand perhaps to scratch his nose and was unable to do even that The hand rose perhaps six inches then fell back to the counterpane with a small thump I think not Its a pity for us to have run up against each other this way you knowI like you And I you John Norman Would that we were better met Aye When not in the company of such fascinating ladies He dropped off to sleep again soon after Roland never spoke with him again although he certainly heard from him Yes Roland was lying above his bed shamming sleep as John Norman screamed his last Sister Michela came with his evening soup just as Roland was getting past the shivery muscles and galloping heartbeat that resulted from his second nibble of brown reed Michela looked at his flushed face with some concern but had to accept his assurances that he did not feel feverish she couldnt bring herself to touch him and judge the heat of his skin for herselfthe medallion held her away With the soup was a popkin The bread was leathery and the meat inside it tough but Roland demolished it greedily just the same Michela watched with a complacent smile hands folded in front of her nodding from time to time When he had finished the soup she took the bowl back from him carefully making sure their fingers did not touch Yere healing she said Soon youll be on yer way and well have just yer memory to keep Jim Is that true he asked quietly She only looked at him touched her tongue against her upper lip giggled and departed Roland closed his eyes and lay back against hi pillow feeling lethargy steal over him again Her speculative eyes he peeping tongue He had seen women look at roast chickens and joints of mutton that same way calculating when they might be done His body badly wanted to sleep but Roland held on to wakefulness for what he judged was an hour then worked one of the reeds out from under the pillow With a fresh infusion of their cantmovemedicine in his system this took an enormous effort and he wasnt sure he could have done it at all had he not separated this one reed from the ribbon holding the others Tomorrow night Jennas note had said If that meant escape the idea seemed preposterous The way he felt now he might be lying in this bed until the end of the age He nibbled Energy washed into his system clenching his muscles and racing his heart but the burst of vitality was gone almost as soon as it came buried beneath the Sisters stronger drug He could only hope and sleep When he woke it was full dark and he found he could move his arms and legs in their network of slings almost naturally He slipped one of the reeds out from beneath his pillow and nibbled cautiously She had left half a dozen and the first two were now almost entirely consumed The gunslinger put the stem back under the pillow then began to shiver like a wet dog in a downpour I took too much he thought Ill be lucky not to convulse  His heart racing like a runaway engine And then to make matters worse he saw candlelight at the far end of the aisle A moment later he heard the rustle of their gowns and the whisk of their slippers Gods why now Theyll see me shaking theyll know  Calling on every bit of his willpower and control Roland dosed his eyes and concentrated on stilling his jerking limbs If only he had been in bed instead of in these cursed slings which seemed to tremble as if with their own ague at every movement The Little Sisters drew closer The light of their candles bloomed red within his closed eyelids Tonight they were not giggling nor whispering amongst themselves It was not until they were almost on top of him that Roland became aware of the stranger in their midsta creature that breathed through its nose in great slobbery gasps of mixed air and snot The gunslinger lay with his eyes closed the gross twitches and jumps of his arms and legs under control but with his muscles still knotted arid crampy thrumming beneath the skin Anyone who looked at him closely would see at once that something was wrong with him His heart was larruping away like a horse under the whip surely they must see But it wasnt him they were looking atnot yet at least Have it off him Mary said She spoke in a bastardized version of the low speech Roland could barely understand Then tother un Go on Ralph Use has whiksky the slobberer asked his dialect even heavier than Marys Use has backky Yes yes plenty whisky and plenty smoke but not until you have these wretched things off Impatient Perhaps afraid as well Roland cautiously rolled his head to the left and cracked his eyelids open Five of the six Little Sisters of Eluria were clustered around the far side of the sleeping John Normans bed their candles raised to cast their light upon him It also cast light upon their own faces faces which would have given the strongest man nightmares Now in the ditch of the night their glamours were set aside and they were but ancient corpses in voluminous habits Sister Mary had one of Rolands guns in her hand Looking at her holding it Roland felt a bright flash of hate for her and promised himself she would pay for her temerity The thing standing at the foot of the bed strange as it was looked almost normal in comparison to the Sisters It was one of the green folk Roland recognized Ralph at once He would be a long time forgetting that bowler hat Now Ralph walked slowly around to the side of Normans bed closest to Roland momentarily blocking the gunslingers view of the Sisters The mutie went all the way to Normans head however clearing the hags to Rolands slitted view once more Normans medallion lay exposedthe boy had perhaps waken enough to take it out of his beddress hoping it would protect him better so Ralph picked it up in his meltedtallow hand The Sister watched eagerly in the glow of their candles as the green man stretched to the end of its chain and then put it down again Their faces droop in disappointment Dont care for such as that Ralph said in his clotted voice Want whiksky Want backky You shall have it Sister Mary said Enough for you and all you verminous clan But first you must have that horrid thing off him both of them Do you understand And you shant tease us Or what Ralph asked He laughed It was a choked and gargly sound the laughter of a man dying from some evil sickness of the throat an lungs but Roland still liked it better than the giggles of the Sisters Or what Sisser Mary youll drink my bluid My bluidd dropee dead whereee stand and glowing in the dark Mary raised the gunslingers revolver and pointed it at Ralph Take that wretched thing or you die where you stand And die after Ive done what you want likely Sister Mary said nothing to that The others peered at him with their black eyes Ralph lowered his head appearing to think Roland suspected hi friend Bowler Hat could think too Sister Mary and her cohorts might not believe that but Ralph had to be trig to have survived as long as he had But of course when he came here he hadnt considered Rolands guns Smasher was wrong to give them shooters to you he said at last Give em and not tell me Did use give him whiksky Give him backky Thats none o yours Sister Mary replied You have that goldpiece off the boys neck right now or Ill put one of yonder mans bullets in whats left of yer brain All right Ralph said Just as you wish sai Once more he reached down and took the gold medallion in his melted fist That he did slow what happened after happened fast He snatched it away breaking the chain and flinging the gold heedlessly into the dark With his other hand he reached down sank his long and ragged nails into John Normans neck and tore it open Blood flew from the hapless boys throat in a jetting heartdriven gush more black than red in the candlelight and he made a single bubbly cry The women screamedbut not in horror They screamed as women do in a frenzy of excitement The green man was forgotten Roland was forgotten all was forgotten save the lifes blood pouring out of John Normans throat They dropped their candles Mary dropped Rolands revolver in the same hapless careless fashion The last the gunslinger saw as Ralph darted away into the shadows whisky and tobacco another time wily Ralph must have thought tonight he had best concentrate on saving his own life was the sisters bending forward to catch as much of the flow as they could before it dried up Roland lay in the dark muscles shivering heart pounding listening to the harpies as they fed on the boy lying in the bed next to his own It seemed to go on for ever but at last they had done with him The Sisters relit their candles and left murmuring When the drug in the soup once more got the better of the drug in the reeds Roland was grateful yet for the first time since coming here his sleep was haunted In his dream he stood looking down at the bloated body in the town trough thinking of a line in the book marked REGISTRY OF MISDEEDS amp REDRESS Green folk sent hence it had read and perhaps the green folk had been sent hence but then a worse tribe had come The Little Sisters of Eluria they called themselves And a year hence they might be the Little Sisters of Tejuas or of Kambero or some other farwestern village They came with their bells and their bugs from where Who knew Did it matter A shadow fell beside his on the scummy water of the trough Roland tried to turn and face it He couldnt he was frozen in place Then a green hand grasped his shoulder and whirled him about It was Ralph His bowler hat was cocked back on his head John Normans medallion now red with blood hung around his neck Booh cried Ralph his lips stretching in a toothless grin He raised a big revolver with worn sandalwood grips He thumbed the hammer backand Roland jerked awake shivering all over dressed in skin both wet and icy cold He looked at the bed on his left It was empty the sheet pulled up and tucked about neatly the pillow resting above it in its snowy sleeve Of John Norman there was no sign It might have been empty for years that bed Roland was alone now Gods help him he was the last patient of the Little Sisters of Eluria those sweet and patient hospitallers The last human being still alive in this terrible place the last with warm blood flowing in his veins Roland lying suspended gripped the gold medallion in his fist and looked across the aisle at the long row of empty beds After a little while he brought one of the reeds out from beneath his pillow and nibbled at it When Mary came fifteen minutes later the gunslinger took the bowl she brought with a show of weakness he didnt really feel Porridge instead of soup this time but he had no doubt the basic ingredient was still the same How well ye look this morning sai Big Sister said She looked well herselfthere were no shimmers to give away the ancient wampir hiding inside her She had supped well and her meal had firmed her up Roland stomach rolled over at the thought Yell be on yer pins in no time I warrant Thats shit Roland said speaking in an illnatured growl Put me on my pins and youd be picking me up off the floor directly after Ive start to wonder if youre not putting something in the food She laughed merrily at that La you lads Always eager to blame weakness on a scheming woman How scared of us ye areaye way down in yer little boys hearts how scared ye are Wheres my brother I dreamed there was a commotion about him in the night and now I see his beds empty Her smile narrowed Her eyes glittered He came over fevery and pitched a fit Weve taken him to Thoughtful House which has been home to contagion more than once in its time To the grave is where youve taken him Roland thought Mayhap that is a Thoughtful House but little would you know it sai one way or another I know yere no brother to that boy Mary said watching him eat Already Roland could feel the stuff hidden in the porridge draining his strength once more Sigil or no sigil I know yere no brother to him Why do you lie Tis a sin against God What gives you such an idea sai Roland asked curious to see if she would mention the guns Big Sister knows what she knows Why not fess up Jimmy Confessions good for the soul they say Send me Jenna to pass the time and perhaps Id tell you much Roland said The narrow bone of smile on Sister Marys face disappeared like chalkwriting in a rainstorm Why would ye talk to such as her Shes passing fair Roland said Unlike some Her lips pulled back from her overlarge teeth Yell see her no more cully Yeve stirred her up so you have and I wont have that She turned to go Still trying to appear weak and hoping he would not overdo it acting was never his forte Roland held out the empty porridge bowl Do you not want to take this Put it on your head and wear it as a nightcap for all of me Or stick it ill your ass Youll talk before Im done with ye cullytalk till I bid you shut up and then beg to talk some more On this note she swept regally away hands lifting the front of her skirt off the floor Roland had heard that such as she couldnt go about in daylight and that part of the old tales was surely a lie Yet another part was almost true it seemed a fuzzy amorphous shape kept pace with her running along the row of empty beds to her right but she cast no real shadow at all That was one of the longest days of Rolands life He dozed but never deeply the reeds were doing their work and he had begun to believe that he might with Jennas help actually get out of here And there was the matter of his guns as wellperhaps she might be able to help there too He passed the slow hours thinking of old timesof Gilead and his friends of the riddling he had almost won at one Wide Earth Fair In the end another had taken the goose but hed had his chance aye He thought of his mother and father he thought of Abel Vannay who had limped his way through a life of gentle goodness and Eldred Jonas who had limped his way through a life of evil until Roland had blown him loose of his saddle one fine desert day He thought as always of Susan If you love me then love me shed said and so he had So he had In this way the time passed At rough hourly intervals he took one of the reeds from beneath his pillow and nibbled it Now his muscles didnt tremble so badly as the stuff passed into his system nor his heart pound so fiercely The medicine in the reeds no longer had to battle the Sisters medicine so fiercely Roland thought the reeds were winning The diffused brightness of the sun moved across the white silk ceiling of the ward and at last the dimness which always seemed to hover at bedlevel began to rise The long rooms western wall bloomed with the rosemeltingtoorange shades of sunset It was Sister Tamra who brought him his dinner that nightsoup and another popkin She also laid a desert lily beside his hand She smiled she did it Her cheeks were bright with colour All of them were bright with colour today like leeches which had gorged until they were almost to bursting From your admirer Jimmy she said Shes so sweet on ye The I means Do not forget my promise What has she promised ye Jimmy brother of Johnny That shed see me again and wed talk Tamra laughed so hard that the bells lining her forehead jingled She clasped her hands together in a perfect ecstasy of glee Sweet as honey Oh yes She bent her smiling gaze on Roland Its sad such a promise can never be kept Yell never see her again pretty man She took the bowl Big Sister has decided  She stood up still smiling Why not take that ugly gold sigil off I think not Yer brother took his offlook She pointed and Roland spied the gold medallion lying far down the aisle where it had landed when Ralph threw it Sister Tamra looked at him still smiling He decided it was part of what was making him sick and cast it away Yed do the same were ye wise Roland repeated I think not So she said dismissively and left him alone with the empty beds glimmering in the thickening shadows Roland hung on in spite of growing sleepiness until the hot colours bleeding across the infirmarys western wall had cooled to ashes Then he nibbled one of the reeds and felt strengthreal strength not a jittery heartthudding substitute bloom in his body He looked towards where the castaway medallion gleamed in the last light and made a silent promise to John Norman he would take it with the other one to Normans kin if ka chanced that he should encounter them in his travels Feeling completely easy in his mind for the first time that day the gunslinger dozed When he awoke it was full dark The doctorbugs were singing with extraordinary shrillness He had taken one of the reeds out from under the pillow and had begun to nibble on it when a cold voice said SoBig Sister was right Yeve been keeping secrets Rolands heart seemed to stop dead in his chest He looked around and saw Sister Coquina getting to her feet She had crept in while he was dozing and hidden under the bed on his right side to watch him Where did ye get that she asked Was it He got it from me Coquina whirled about Jenna was walking down the aisle towards them Her habit was gone She still wore her wimple with its foreheadfringe of bells but its hem rested on the shoulders of a simple checkered shirt Below this she wore jeans and scuffed desert boots She had something in her hands It was too dark for Roland to be sure but he thought YOU Sister Coquina whispered with infinite hate When I tell Big Sister  youll tell no one anything Roland said If he had planned his escape from the slings which entangled him he no doubt would have made a bad business of it but as always the gunslinger did best when he thought least His arms were free in a moment so was his left leg His right caught at the ankle however twisting hanging him up with his shoulders on the bed and his leg in the air Coquina turned on him hissing like a cat Her lips pulled back from teeth that were needlesharp She rushed at him her fingers splayed The nails at the ends of them looked sharp and ragged Roland clasped the medallion and shoved it out towards her She recoiled from it still hissing and whirled back to Sister Jenna in a flare of white skirt Ill do for ye ye interfering trull she cried in a low harsh voice Roland struggled to free his leg and couldnt It was firmly caught the shitting sling actually wrapped around the ankle somehow like a noose Jenna raised her hands and he saw he had been right it was his revolvers she had brought holstered and hanging from the two old gunbelts he had worn out of Gilead after the last burning Shoot her Jenna Shoot her Instead still holding the holstered guns up Jenna shook her head as she had on the day when Roland had persuaded her to push back her wimple so he could see her hair The bells rang with a sharpness that seemed to go into the gunslingers head like a spike The Dark Bells The sigil of their katet What  The sound of the doctorbugs rose to a shrill reedy scream that was eerily like the sound of the bells Jenna wore Nothing sweet about them now Sister Coquinas hands faltered on their way to Jennas throat Jenna herself had not so much as flinched or blinked her eyes No Coquina whispered You cant I have Jenna said and Roland saw the bugs Descending from the legs of the bearded man hed observed a battalion What he saw coming from the shadows now was an army to end all armies had they been men instead of insects there might have been more than all the men who had ever carried arms in the long and bloody history of World Yet the sight of them advancing down the boards of the aisle was what Roland would always remember nor what would haunt his dream for a year or more it was the way they coated the beds These were turning black two by two on both sides of the aisle like pairs of dim rectangular lights going out Coquina shrieked and began to shake her own head to ring her bells The sound they made was thin and pointless compared to the sharp ringing of the Dark Bells Still the bugs marched on darkening the floor blacking out the be Jenna darted past the shrieking Sister Coquina dropped Rolands beside him then yanked the twisted sling straight with one hard p Roland slid his leg free Come she said Ive started them but staying them could be a different thing Now Sister Coquinas shrieks were not of horror but of pain The bugs had found her Dont look Jenna said helping Roland to his feet He thought that never in his life had he been so glad to be upon them Come We mu be quickshell rouse the others Ive put your boots and clothes aside the path that leads away from hereI carried as much as I could How ye Are ye strong Thanks to you  How long he would stay strong Roland didnt know and right now it wasnt a question that mattered He saw Jenna snatch up two of the reedsin his struggle to escape the slings they had scattered all over the head of the bedand then they were hurrying up the aisle away from the bugs and from Sister Coquina whose cries were now failing Roland buckled on his guns and tied them down without breaking stride They passed only three beds on each side before reaching the flap of the tent and it was a tent he saw not a vast pavilion The silk walls and ceiling were fraying canvas thin enough to let in the light of a threequarters Kissing Moon And the beds werent beds at all but only a double row of shabby cots He turned and saw a black writhing hump on the floor where Sister Coquina had been At the sight of her Roland was struck by an unpleasant thought I forgot John Normans medallion A keen sense of regretalmost of mourningwent through him like wind Jenna reached into the pocket of her jeans and brought it out It glimmered in the moonlight I picked it up off the floor He didnt know which made him gladderthe sight of the medallion or the sight of it in her hand It meant she wasnt like the others Then as if to dispel that notion before it got too firm a hold on him she said Take it RolandI can hold it no more  And as he took it he saw unmistakable marks of charring on her fingers He took her hand and kissed each burn Thankeesai she said and he saw she was crying Thankee dear To be kissed so is lovely worth every pain Now Roland saw her eyes shift and followed them Here were bobbing lights descending a rocky path Beyond them he saw the building where the Little Sisters had been livingnot a convent but a ruined hacienda that looked a thousand years old There were three candles as they drew closer Roland saw that there were only three sisters Mary wasnt among them He drew his guns Oooo its a gunslingerman he is Louise A scary man Michela And hes found his ladylove as well as his shooters Tamra His slutwhore Louise Laughing angrily Not afraid at least not of his weapons Put them away Jenna told him and when she looked saw that he already had The others meanwhile had drawn closer Ooo see she cries Tamra Doffed her habit she has Michela Perhaps its her broken vows she cries for Why such tears pretty Louise Because he kissed my fingers where they were burned Jenna said Ive never been kissed before It made me cry Ooooo Luvly Next hell stick his thing in her Even luvlier Jenna bore their japes with no sign of anger When they were done she said Im going with him Stand aside They gaped at her counterfeit laughter disappearing in shock No Louise whispered Are ye mad Ye know whatll happen No and neither do you Jenna said Besides I care not  She halfturned and held her hand out to the mouth of the ancient hospital tent It was a faded olivedrab in the moonlight with an old red cross drawn on its roof Roland wondered how many towns the Sisters had been to With this tent which was so small and plain on the outside so huge and gloriously on the inside How many towns and over how many years Now cramming the mouth of it in a black shiny tongue were doctorbugs They had stopped their singing Their silence was somehow terrible Stand aside or Ill have them on ye Jenna said Ye never would Sister Michela cried in a low horrified voice Aye Ive already set them on Sister Coquina Shes a part of the medicine now Their gasp was like cold wind passing through dead trees Nor was all that dismay directed towards their own precious hides What Jenna h done was clearly far outside their reckoning Then youre damned Sister Tamra said Such ones to speak of damnation Stand aside They did Roland walked past them and they shrank away from him but they shrank from her more Damned he asked after they had skirted the haci and reached the path beyond it The Kissing Moon glimmered above a tumbled scree of rocks In its light Roland could see a small black opening low on the scarp guessed it was the cave the Sisters called Thoughtful House What did they mean damned Never mind All we have to worry about now is Sister Mary I like not that we havent seen her She tried to walk faster but he grasped her arm and turned her about He could still hear the singing of the bugs but faintly they were leaving the place of the Sisters behind Eluria too if the compass in his head was still working he thought the town was in the other direction The husk of the town he amended Tell me what they meant Perhaps nothing Ask me not Rolandwhat good is it Tis done the bridge burned I cant go back Nor would if I could  She looked down biting her lip and when she looked up again Roland saw fresh tears falling on her cheeks I have supped with them There were times when I couldnt help it no more than you could help drinking their wretched soup no matter if you knew what was in it Roland remembered John Norman saying A man has to eat a woman too He nodded Id go no further down that road If theres to be damnation let it be of my choosing not theirs My mother meant well by bringing me back to them but she was wrong  She looked at him shyly and fearfully but met his eyes Id go beside ye on yer road Roland of Gilead For as long as I may or as long as yed have me youre welcome to your share of my way he said And I am Blessed by your company he would have finished but before he could a voice spoke from the tangle of moonshadow ahead of them where the path at last climbed out of the rocky sterile valley in which the Little Sisters had practised their glamours Its a sad duty to stop such a pretty elopement but stop it I must Sister Mary came from the shadows Her fine white habit with its bright red rose had reverted to what it really was the shroud of a corpse Caught hooded in its grimy folds was a wrinkled sagging face from which two black eyes stared They looked like rotted dates Below them exposed by the things smile four great incisors gleamed Upon the stretched skin of Sister Marys forehead bells tinkled but not the Dark Bells Roland thought There was that Stand clear Jenna said Or Ill bring the can tam on ye No Sister Mary said stepping closer ye wont Theyll not stray so far from the others Shake your head and ring those damned bells until the clappers fall out and still theyll never come Jenna did as bid shaking her head furiously from side to side The Dark Bells rang piercingly but without that extra almost psychic tonequality that had gone through Rolands head like a spike And the doctorbugs what Jenna had called the can tamdid not come Smiling ever more broadly Roland had an idea Mary herself hadnt been completely sure they wouldnt come until the experiment was made the corpsewoman closed in on them seeming to float above the ground Her eyes flicked towards him And put that away she said Roland looked down and saw that one of his guns was in his hand He had no memory of drawing it Unless its been blessed or dipped in some sects holy wetblood water semenit cant harm such as I gunslinger For I am more shade than substance yet still the equal to such as yerself for all that She thought he would try shooting her anyway he saw it in her eyes Those shooters are all ye have her eyes said Without em you might as well be back in the tent we dreamed around ye caught up in our slings and awaiting our pleasure Instead of shooting he dropped the revolver back into its holster and launched himself at her with his hands out Sister Mary uttered a scream that was mostly surprise but it was not a long one Rolands fingers clamped down on her throat and choked the sound off before it was fairly started The touch of her flesh was obsceneit seemed not just alive but various beneath his hands as if it was trying to crawl away from him He could feel it running like liquid flowing and the sensation was horrible beyond description Yet he clamped down harder determined to choke the I out of her Then there came a blue flash not in the air he would think later that flash happened inside his head a single stroke of lightning as she touch off some brief but powerful brainstorm and his hands flew away from h neck For one moment his dazzled eyes saw great wet gouges in her fleshgouges in the shapes of his hands Then he was flung backwards hitting the scree on his back and sliding striking his head on a jutting rock hard enough to provoke a second lesser flash of light Nay my pretty man she said grimacing at him laughing with those terrible dull eyes of hers Ye dont choke such as I and Ill take ye slow yer impertinencecut ye shallow in a hundred places to refresh my thirst First though Ill have this vowless girl and Ill have those damned bells off her in the bargain Come and see if you can Jenna cried in a trembling voice and shook her head from side to side The Dark Bells rang mockingly provokingly Marys grimace of a smile fell away Oh I can she breathed Her mouth yawned In the moonlight her fangs gleamed in her gums like bone needles poked through a red pillow I can and I There was a growl from above them It rose then splintered into a volley of snarling barks Mary turned to her left and in the moment before the snarling thing left the rock on which it was standing Roland could clearly read the startled bewilderment on Big Sisters face It launched itself at her only a dark shape against the stars legs outstretched so it looked like some sort of weird bat but even before it crashed into the woman striking her in the chest above her halfraise arms and fastening its own teeth on her throat Roland knew exactly what it was As the shape bore her over on to her back Sister Mary uttered a gibbering shriek that went through Rolands head like the Dark Bells themselves He scrambled to his feet gasping The shadowy thing tore at her forepaws on either side of her head rear paws planted on the graveshroud above her chest where the rose had been Roland grabbed Jenna who was looking down at the fallen Sister with a kind of frozen fascination Come on he shouted Before it decides it wants a bite of you too The dog took no notice of them as Roland pulled Jenna past It had torn Sister Marys head mostly off Her flesh seemed to be changing somehowdecomposing very likelybut whatever was happening Roland did not want to see it He didnt want Jenna to see it either They halfwalked halfran to the top of the ridge and when they got there paused for breath in the moonlight heads down hands linked both of them gasping harshly The growling and snarling below them had faded but was still faintly audible when Sister Jenna raised her head and asked him What was it you knowI saw it in your face And how could it attack her We all have power over animals but she hashadthe most Not over that one  Roland found himself recalling the unfortunate boy in the next bed Norman hadnt known why the medallions kept the Sisters at arms lengthwhether it was the gold or the God Now Roland knew the answer It was a dog Just a towndog I saw it in the square before the green folk knocked me out and took me to the Sisters I suppose the other animals that could run away did run away but not that one it had nothing to fear from the Little Sisters of Eluria and somehow it knew it didnt It bears the sign of the Jesusman on its chest Black fur on white just an accident of its birth I imagine In any case its done for her now I knew it was lurking around I heard it barking two or three times Why Jenna whispered Why would it come Why would it stay And why would it take on her as it did Roland of Gilead responded as he ever had and ever would when such useless mystifying questions were raised Ka Come on Lets get as far as we can from this place before we hide up for the day As far as they could turned out to be eight miles at most and probably Roland thought as the two of them sank down in a patch of sweetsmelling sage beneath an overhang of rock a good deal less Five perhaps It was him slowing them down or rather it was the residue of the poison in the soup When it was clear to him that he could not go farther without help he asked her for one of the reeds She refused saying that the stuff in it might combine with the unaccustomed exercise to burst his heart Besides she said as they lay back against the embankment of the little nook they had found theyll not follow Those that are leftMichela Louise Tamrawill be packing up to move on They know to leave when the time comes thats why the Sisters have survived as long as they have As We have Were strong in some ways but weak in many more Sister Mary forgot that It was her arrogance that did for her as much as the crossdog I think She had cached not just his boots and clothes beyond the top of the ridge but the smaller of his two purses as well When she tried apologize for not bringing his bedroll and the larger purse shed tried she said but they were simply too heavy Roland hushed her with a finger to her lips He thought it a miracle to have as much as he did And besides this he did not say but perhaps she knew it anyway the guns were the only things which really mattered The guns of his father and his father before him all the way back to the days of Arthur Eld when dreams about dragons had still walked the earth Will you be all right he asked her as they settled down The moon had set but dawn was still at least three hours away They were surrounded the sweet smell of the sage A purple smell he thought it then and ever after Already he could feel it forming a kind of magic carpet under him which would soon float him away to sleep He thought he had never been so tired Roland I know not  But even then he thought she had known Her mother had brought her back once no mother would bring her back again And she had eaten with the others had taken the communion of the Sisters Ka was a wheel it was also a net from which none ever escaped But then he was too tired to think much of such things and what good would thinking have done in any case As she had said the bridge was burned Even if they were to return to the valley Roland guess they would find nothing but the cave the Sisters had called Thoughtful House The surviving Sisters would have packed their tent of bad dreams and moved on just a sound of bells and singing insects moving down the late night breeze He looked at her raised a hand it felt heavy and touched the curl which once more lay across her forehead Jenna laughed embarrassed That one always escapes Its wayward Like its mistress She raised her hand to poke it back in but Roland took her fingers before she could Its beautiful he said Black as night and as beautiful as forever He sat upit took an effort weariness dragged at his body like soft hands He kissed the curl She closed her eyes and sighed He felt her trembling beneath his lips The skin of her brow was very cool the dark curve of the wayward curl like silk Push back your wimple as you did before he said She did it without speaking For a moment he only looked at her Jenna looked back gravely her eyes never leaving his He ran his hands through her hair feeling its smooth weight like rain he thought rain with weight then took her shoulders and kissed each of her cheeks He drew back for a moment Would ye kiss me as a man does a woman Roland On my mouth Aye And as he had thought of doing as he lay caught in the silken infirmary tent he kissed her lips She kissed back with the clumsy sweetness of one who has never kissed before except perhaps in dreams Roland thought to make love to her thenit had been long and long and she was beautiful but he fell asleep instead still kissing her He dreamed of the crossdog barking its way across a great open landscape He followed wanting to see the source of its agitation and soon he did At the far edge of that plain stood the Dark Tower its smoky stone outlined by the dull orange ball of a setting sun its fearful windows rising in a spiral The dog stopped at the sight of it and began to howl Bellspeculiarly shrill and as terrible as doombegan to ring Dark bells he knew but their tone was as bright as silver At their sound the dark windows of the Tower glowed with a deadly red lightthe red of poisoned roses A scream of unbearable pain rose in the night The dream blew away in an instant but the scream remained now unravelling to a moan That part was realas real as the Tower brooding in its place at the very end of EndWorld Roland came back to the brightness of dawn and the soft purple smell of desert sage He had drawn both his guns and was on his feet before he had fully realized he was awake Jenna was gone Her boots lay empty beside his purse A little distance from them her jeans lay as flat as discarded snakeskins Above them was her shirt It was Roland observed with wonder still tucked into the pants Beyond them was her empty wimple with its fringe of bells lying on the powdery ground He thought for a moment that they were ringing mistaking the sound he heard at first Not bells but bugs The doctorbugs They sang in the sage sounding a bit like crickets but far sweeter Jenna No answer unless the bugs answered For their singing suddenly stopped Jenna Nothing Only the wind and the smell of the sage Without thinking about what he was doing like playacting reasoned thought was not his strong suit he bent picked up the wimple and shook it The Dark Bells rang For a moment there was nothing Then a thousand small dark creatures came scurrying out of the sage gathering on the broken earth Roland thought of the battalion marching down the side of the freighters and took a step back Then he held his position As he saw the bugs holding theirs He believed he understood Some of this understanding came from his memory of how Sister Marys flesh had felt under his hands how it had felt various not one thing but many Part of it was what she had Said I have supped with them Such as them might never die but they might change The insects trembled a dark cloud of them blotting out the white powdery earth Roland shook the bells again A shiver ran through them in a subtle wave and then they began form a shape They hesitated as if unsure of how to go on regrouped began again What they eventually made on the whiteness of the sand there between the blowing fluffs of lilaccoloured sage was one of Great Letters the letter C Except it wasnt really a letter the gunslinger saw it was a curl They began to sing and to Roland it sounded as if they were singing his name The bells fell from his unnerved hand and when they struck ground and chimed there the mass of bugs broke apart running every direction He thought of calling them backringing the bell again might do thatbut to what purpose To what end Ask me not Roland Tis done the bridge burned Yet she had come to him one last time imposing her will over thousand various parts that should have lost the ability to think when the whole lost its cohesion and yet she had thought somehow enough to make that shape How much effort might that have taken They fanned wider and wider some disappearing into the sage some trundling up the sides of rock overhang pouring into the cracks where they would mayhap wait out the heat of the day They were gone She was gone Roland sat down on the ground and put his hands over his face He thought he might weep but in time the urge passed when he raised his head again his eyes were as dry as the desert he would eventually come to still following the trail of Walter the man in black If theres to be damnation she had said let it be of my choosing not theirs He knew a little about damnation himself and he had an idea that the lessons far from being done were just beginning She had brought him the purse with his tobacco in it He rolled a cigarette and smoked it hunkered over his knees He smoked it down to a glowing roach looking at her empty clothes the while remembering the steady gaze of her dark eyes Remembering the scorchmarks on her fingers from the chain of the medallion Yet she had picked it up because she had known he would want it had dared that pain and Roland now wore both around his neck When the sun was fully up the gunslinger moved on west He would find another horse eventually or a mule but for now he was content to walk All that day he was haunted by a ringing singing sound in his ears like bells Several times he stopped and looked around sure he would see a dark following shape flowing over the ground chasing after as the shadows of our best and worst memories chase after but no shape was ever there He was alone in the low hill country west of Eluria Quite alone
