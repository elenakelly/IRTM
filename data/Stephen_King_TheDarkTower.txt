ONE Pere Don Callahan had once been the Catholic priest of a town salems Lot had been its name that no longer existed on any map He didnt much care Concepts such as reality had ceased to matter to him This onetime priest now held a heathen object in his hand a scrimshaw turtle made of ivory There was a nick in its beak and a scratch in the shape of a question mark on its back but otherwise it was a beautiful thing Beautiful and powerful He could feel the power in his hand like volts How lovely it is he whispered to the boy who stood with him Is it the Turtle Maturin It is isnt it The boy was Jake Chambers and hed come a long loop in order to return almost to his startingplace here in Manhattan I dont know he said She calls it the skoldpadda and it may help us but it cant kill the harriers that are waiting for us in there He nodded toward the Dixie Pig wondering if he meant Susannah or Mia when he used that allpurpose feminine pronoun she Once he would have said it didnt matter because the two women were so tightly wound together Now however he thought it did matter or would soon Will you Jake asked the Pere meaning Will you stand Will you fight Will you kill Oh yes Callahan said calmly He put the ivory turtle with its wise eyes and scratched back into his breast pocket with the extra shells for the gun he carried then patted the cunningly made tiling once to make sure it rode safely Ill shoot until the bullets are gone and if I run out of bullets before they kill me Ill club them with the the gunbutt The pause was so slight Jake didnt even notice it But in that pause the White spoke to Father Callahan It was a force he knew of old even in boyhood although there had been a few years of bad faith along the way years when his understanding of that elemental force had first grown dim and then become lost completely But those days were gone the White was his again and he told God thankya Jake was nodding saying something Callahan barely heard And what Jake said didnt matter What that other voice saidthe voice of something Gan perhaps too great to be called Goddid The boy must go on the voice told him Whatever happens here however it falls the boy must go on Your part in the story is almost done His is not They walked past a sign on a chrome post CLOSED FOR PRIVATE FUNCTION Jakes special friend Oy trotting between them his head up and his muzzle wreathed in its usual toothy grin At the top of the steps Jake reached into the woven sack SusannahMio had brought out of Calla Bryn Sturgis and grabbed two of the platesthe Rizas He tapped them together nodded at the dull ringing sound and then said Lets see yours Callahan lifted the Rugerjake had brought out of Calla New York and now back into it life is a wheel and we all say thankya For a moment the Pere held the Rugers barrel beside his right cheek like a duelist Then he touched his breast pocket bulging with shells and with the turde The skoldpadda Jake nodded Once were in we stay together Always together with Oy between On three And once we start we never stop Never stop Right Are you ready Yes Gods love on you boy And on you Pere One two three Jake opened the door and together they went into the dim light and the sweet tangy smell of roasting meat TWO Take went to what he was sure would be his death remembering two things Roland Deschain his true father had said Battles that last five minutes spawn legends that live a thousand years And You neednt die happy when your day comes but you must die satisfied for you have lived your life from beginning to end and ka is always served Jake Chambers surveyed the Dixie Pig with a satisfied mind THREE Also with crystal clarity His senses were so heightened that he could smell not just roasting flesh but the rosemary with which it had been rubbed could hear not only the calm rhythm of his breath but the tidal murmur of his blood climbing brainward on one side of his neck and descending heartward on the other He also remembered Rolands saying that even the shortest battle from first shot to final falling body seemed long to those taking part Time grew elastic stretched to the point of vanishment Jake had nodded as if he understood although he hadnt Now he did His first diought was that there were too many of themfar far too many He put their number at close to a hundred the majority certainly of the sort Pere Callahan had referred to as low men Some were low women but Jake had no doubt the principle was the same Scattered among them all less fleshy than the low folken and some as slender as fencing weapons their complexions ashy and their bodies surrounded in dim blue auras were what had to be vampires Oy stood at Jakes heel his small foxy face stern whining low in his throat That smell of cooking meat wafting through the air was not pork FOUR Ten feet between us any time we have ten feet to give Pereso Jake had said out on the sidewalk and even as they approached the maitre ds platform Callahan was drifting to Jakes right putting the required distance between them Jake had also told him to scream as loud as he could for as long as he could and Callahan was opening his mouth to begin doing just that when the voice of the White spoke up inside again Only one word but it was enough Skoldpadda it said Callahan was still holding the Ruger up by his right cheek Now he dipped into his breast pocket with his left hand His awareness of the scene before him wasnt as hyperalert as his young companions but he saw a great deal the orangeycrimson electric flambeaux on the walls the candles on each table immured in glass containers of a brighter Halloweenish orange the gleaming napkins To the left of the dining room was a tapestry showing knights and their ladies sitting at a long banquet table There was a sense in hereCallahan wasnt sure exactly what provoked it the various tells and stimuli were too subtleof people just resettling themselves after some bit of excitement a small kitchen fire say or an automobile accident on the street Or a lady having a baby Callahan thought as he closed his hand on the Turtle Thats always good for a little pause between the appetizer and the entree Now come Gileads kamais shouted an excited nervous voice Not a human one of that Callahan was almost positive It was too buzzy to be human Callahan saw what appeared to be some sort of monstrous birdhuman hybrid standing at the far end of the room It wore straightleg jeans and a plain white shirt but the head rising from that shirt was painted with sleek feathers of dark yellow Its eyes looked like drops of liquid tar Get them this horridly ridiculous thing shouted and brushed aside a napkin Beneath it was some sort of weapon Callahan supposed it was a gun but it looked like the sort you saw on Star Trek What did they call them Phasers Stunners It didnt matter Callahan had a far better weapon and wanted to make sure they all saw it He swept the placesettings and the glass container with the candle in it from the nearest table then snatched away the tablecloth like a magician doing a trick The last thing he wanted to do was to trip over a swatch of linen at the crucial moment Then with a nimbleness he wouldnt have believed even a week ago he stepped onto one of the chairs and from the chair to the tabletop Once on the table he lifted the skoldpaddavnth his fingers supporting the turtles flat undershell giving them all a good look at it I could croon something he thought Maybe Moonlight Becomes You or Left My Heart in San Francisco At that point they had been inside the Dixie Pig for exactly thirtyfour seconds FIVE High school teachers faced with a large group of students in study hall or a school assembly will tell you that teenagers even when freshly showered and groomed reek of the hormones which their bodies are so busy manufacturing Any group of people under stress emits a similar stink and Jake with his senses tuned to the most exquisite pitch smelled it here When they passed the maitre ds stand Blackmail Central his Dad liked to call such stations the smell of the Dixie Pigs diners had been faint the smell of people coming back to normal after some sort of dustup But when the birdcreature in the far corner shouted Jake had smelled the patrons more strongly It was a metallic aroma enough like blood to incite his temper and his emotions Yes he saw Tweety Bird knock aside the napkin on his table yes he saw the weapon beneath yes he understood that Callahan standing on the table was an easy shot That was of far less concern to Jake than the mobilizing weapon that was Tweety Birds mouth Jake was drawing back his right arm meaning to fling the first of his nineteen plates and amputate the head in which that mouth resided when Callahan raised the turtle It wont work not in here Jake thought but even before the idea had been completely articulated in his mind he understood it was working He knew by the smell of them The aggressiveness went out of it And the few who had begun to rise from their tablesthe red holes in the foreheads of the low people gaping the blue auras of the vampires seeming to pull in and intensifysat back down again and hard as if they had suddenly lost command of their muscles Get them those are the ones Sayre Then Tweety stopped talking His left handif you could call such an ugly talon a handtouched the butt of his hightech gun and then fell away The brilliance seemed to leave his eyes Theyre the ones Sayre SSSayre Another pause Then the birdthing said Oh sai what is the lovely thing that you hold You know what it is Callahan said Jake was moving and Callahan mindful of what the boy gunslinger had told him outside Make sure that every time I look on my right I see your facestepped back down from the table to move with him still holding the turtle high He could almost taste the rooms silence but But there was another room Rough laughter and hoarse carousing yellsa party from the sound of it and close by On the left From behind the tapestry showing the knights and their ladies at dinner Something going on back there Callahan thought and probably not Elks Poker Night He heard Oy breathing fast and low through his perpetual grin a perfect little engine And something else A harsh raiding sound with a low and rapid clicking beneath The combination set Callahans teeth on edge and made his skin feel cold Something was hiding under the tables Oy saw the advancing insects first and froze like a dog on point one paw raised and his snout thrust forward For a moment the only part of him to move was the dark and velvety skin of his muzzle first twitching back to reveal the clenched needles of his teeth then relaxing to hide them then twitching back again The bugs came on Whatever they were the Turtle Maturin upraised in the Peres hand meant nothing to them A fat guy wearing a tuxedo with plaid lapels spoke weakly almost questioningly to the birdthing They werent to come any further than here Meiman nor to leave We were told Oy lunged forward a growl coming through his clamped teeth It was a decidedly unOylike sound reminding Callahan of a comicstrip balloon Arrrrrr No Jake shouted alarmed No Oy At the sound of the boys shout the yells and laughter from behind the tapestry abruptly ceased as if the folken back there had suddenly become aware that something had changed in the front room Oy took no notice of Jakes cry He crunched three of the bugs in rapid succession the crackle of their breaking carapaces gruesomely clear in the new stillness He made no attempt to eat them but simply tossed the corpses each the size of a mouse into the air with a snap of the neck and a grinning release of the jaws And the others retreated back under the tables He was made for this Callahan thought Perhaps once in the longago all bumblers were Made for it the way some breeds of terrier are made to A hoarse shout from behind the tapestry interrupted these thoughts Humes one voice cried and then a second Kahumes Callahan had an absurd impulse to yell Gesundheit Before he could yell that or anything else Rolands voice suddenly filled his head Jake go SIX The boy turned toward Pere Callahan bewildered He was walking with his arms crossed ready to fling the Rizas at the first low man or woman who moved Oy had returned to his heel although he was swinging his head ceaselessly from side to side and his eyes were bright with the prospect of more prey We go together Jake said Theyre buffaloed Pere And were close They took her through here this room and then through the kitchen Callahan paid no attention Still holding the turtle high as one might hold a lantern in a deep cave he had turned toward the tapestry The silence from behind it was far more terrible than the shouts and feverish gargling laughter It was silence like a pointed weapon And the boy had stopped Go while you can Callahan said striving for calmness Catch up to her if you can This is the command of your dinh This is also the will of the White But you cant Go Jake The low men and women in the Dixie Pig whether in thrall to the skoldpadda or not murmured uneasily at the sound of that shout and well they might have for it was not Callahans voice coming from Callahans mouth You have this one chance and must take it Find her As dinh I command your Jakes eyes flew wide at the sound of Rolands voice issuing from Callahans throat His mouth dropped open He looked around dazed In the second before the tapestry to their left was torn aside Callahan saw its black joke what the careless eye would first surely overlook the roast that was the banquets main entree had a human form die knights and their ladies were eating human flesh and drinking human blood What the tapestry showed was a cannibals communion Then the ancient ones who had been at their own sup tore aside the obscene tapestry and burst out shrieking through the great fangs that propped their deformed mouths forever open Their eyes were as black as blindness the skin of their cheeks and browseven the backs of their handstumorous with wild teeth Like the vampires in the dining room they were surrounded with auras but these were of a poisoned violet so dark it was almost black Some sort of ichor dribbled from the corners of their eyes and mouths They were gibbering and several were laughing seeming not to create the sounds but rather to snatch them out of the air like something that could be rent alive And Callahan knew them Of course he did Had he not been sent hence by one of their number Here were the true vampires the Type Ones kept like a secret and now loosed on the intruders The turde he held up did not slow them in the slightest Callahan saw Jake staring pale eyes shiny with horror and bulging from their sockets all purpose forgotten at the sight of these freaks Without knowing what was going to come out of his mouth until he heard it Callahan shouted Theyll kill Oyfirst Theyll kill him in front of you and drink his blood Oy barked at the sound of his name Jakes eyes seemed to clear at the sound but Callahan had no time to follow the boys fortunes further Turtle wont stop them but at least its holding the others back Bullets wont stop them but With a sense of deja vuand why not he had lived all this before in the home of a boy named Mark PetrieCallahan dipped into the open front of his shirt and brought out the cross he wore there It clicked against the butt of the Ruger and then hung below it The cross was lit with a brilliant bluishwhite glare The two ancient things in the lead had been about to grab him and draw him into their midst Now they drew back instead shrieking with pain Callahan saw the surface of their skin sizzle and begin to liquefy The sight of it filled him with savage happiness Get back from me he shouted The power of God commands you The power of Christ commands you The ka of MidWorld commands you The power of the White commands you One of them darted forward nevertheless a deformed skeleton in an ancient mossencrusted dinner suit Around its neck it wore some sort of ancient award the Cross of Malta perhaps It swiped one of its longnailed hands at the crucifix Callahan was holding out He jerked it down at the last second and die vampires claw passed an inch above it Callahan lunged forward without drought and drove die tip of the cross into the yellow parchment of the things forehead The gold crucifix went in like a redhot skewer into butter The thing in the rusty dinner suit let out a liquid cry of pained dismay and stumbled backward Callahan pulled his cross back For one moment before the elderly monster clapped its claws to its brow Callahan saw the hole his cross had made Then a thick curdy yellow stuff began to spill through the ancient ones fingers Its knees unhinged and it tumbled to the floor between two tables Its mates shrank away from it screaming with outrage The things face was already collapsing inward beneadi its twisted hands Its aura whiffed out like a candle and then there was nothing but a puddle of yellow liquefying flesh spilling like vomit from the sleeves of its jacket and the legs of its pants Callahan strode briskly toward the others His fear was gone The shadow of shame that had hung over him ever since Barlow had taken his cross and broken it was also gone Free at last he thought Free at last great God Almighty Im free at last Then I believe this is redemption And its good isnt it Quite good indeed Hrow it aside one of them cried its hands held up to shield its face Nasty bauble of the heepGod hrow it aside if you dare Nasty bauble of the sheepGod indeed If so why do you cringe Against Barlow he had not dared answer this challenge and it had been his undoing In the Dixie Pig Callahan turned die cross toward the thing which had dared to speak I neednt stake my faith on the challenge of such a thing as you sai he said his words ringing clearly in the room He had forced the old ones back almost to the archway through which they had come Great dark tumors had appeared on the hands and faces of those in front eating into the paper of their ancient skin like acid And Id never throw away such an old friend in any case But put it away Aye if you like And he dropped it back into his shirt Several of the vampires lunged forward immediately their fangchoked mouths twisting in what might have been grins Callahan held his hands out toward them The fingers and the barrel of the Ruger glowed as if they had been dipped into blue fire The eyes of the turtle had likewise filled with light its shell shone Stand away from me Callahan cried The power of God and the White commands you SEVEN When the terrible shaman turned to face the Grandfathers Meiman of the taheen felt the Turtles awful lovely glammer lessen a bit He saw that the boy was gone and that filled him with dismay yet at least hed gone further in rather than slipping out so that might still be all right But if the boy found the door to Fedic and used it Meiman might find himself in very bad trouble indeed For Sayre answered to Walter o Dim and Walter answered only to the Crimson King himself Never mind One thing at a time Settle the shamans hash first Turn the Grandfathers loose on him Then go after the boy perhaps shouting that his friend wanted him after all that might workMeiman the Canaryman to Mia Tweety Bird to Jake crept forward grasping Andrewthe fat man in the tux with the plaid lapelswith one hand and Andrews even fatter jilly with the other He gestured at Callahans turned back Tirana shook her head vehemently Meiman opened his beak and hissed at her She shrank away from him Detta Walker had already gotten her fingers into the mask wore and it hung in shreds about her jaw and neck In the middle of her forehead a red wound opened and closed like the gill of a dying fish Meiman turned to Andrew released him long enough to point at the shaman then drew the talon that served him as a hand across his feathered throat in a grimly expressive gesture Andrew nodded and brushed away his wifes pudgy hands when they tried to restrain him The mask of humanity was good enough to show the low man in the garish tuxedo visibly gathering his courage Then he leaped forward with a strangled cry seizing Callahan around the neck not with his hands but his fat forearms At the same moment his jilly lunged and struck the ivory turtle from the Peres hand screaming as she did so The skoldpadda tumbled to the red rug bounced beneath one of the tables and there like a certain paper boat some of you may remember passes out of this tale forever The Grandfathers still held back as did die Type Three vampires who had been dining in the public room but the low men and women sensed weakness and moved in first hesitantly then with growing confidence They surrounded Callahan paused and then fell on him in all their numbers Let me go in Gods name Callahan cried but of course it did no good Unlike the vampires the things with the red wounds in their foreheads did not respond to the name of Callahans God All he could do was hope Jake wouldnt stop let alone double back that he and Oy would go like the wind to Susannah Save her if they could Die with her if they could not And kill her baby if chance allowed God help him but he had been wrong about that They should have snuffed out the babys life back in the Calla when they had the chance Something bit deeply into his neck The vampires would come now cross or no cross Theyd fall on him like the sharks they were once they got their first whiff of his lifes blood Help me God give me strength Callahan thought and felt the strength flow into him He rolled to his left as claws ripped into his shirt tearing it to ribbons For a moment his right hand was free and the Ruger was still in it He turned it toward the working sweaty hatecongested face of the fat one named Andrew and placed the barrel of the gun bought for home protection in the longdistant past by Jakes more than a litde paranoid TVexecutive fadier against the soft red wound in the center of the low mans forehead Noooo you darent Tirana cried and as she reached for the gun the front of her gown finally burst spilling her massive breasts free They were covered with coarse fur Callahan pulled the trigger The Rugers report was deafening in the dining room Andrews head exploded like a gourd filled with blood spraying the creatures who had been crowding in behind him There were screams of horror and disbelief Callahan had time to think It wasnt supposed to be this way was it And Is it enough to put me in the club Am I a gunslinger yet Perhaps not But there was the birdman standing right in front of him between two tables its beak opening and closing its throat beating visibly with excitement Smiling propping himself on one elbow as blood pumped onto the carpet from his torn throat Callahan leveled Jakes Ruger No Meiman cried raising his misshapen hands to his face in an utterly fruitless gesture of protection No you CANT Can so Callahan thought with childish glee and fired again Meiman took two stumblesteps backward then a third He struck a table and collapsed on top of it Three yellow feathers hung above him on the air seesawing lazily Callahan heard savage howls not of anger or fear but of hunger The aroma of blood had finally penetrated the old onesjaded nostrils and nothing would stop them now So if he didnt want to join them Pere Callahan once Father Callahan of salems Lot turned the Rugers muzzle on himself He wasted no time looking for eternity in the darkness of the barrel but placed it deep against the shelf of his chin Hile Roland he said and knew the wave they are lifted by the wave that he was heard Hile gunslinger His finger tightened on the trigger as the ancient monsters fell upon him He was buried in the reek of their cold and bloodless breath but not daunted by it He had never felt so strong Of all the years in his life he had been happiest when he had been a simple vagrant not a priest but only Callahan OThe Roads and felt that soon he would be let free to resume that life and wander as he would his duties fulfilled and that was well May you find your Tower Roland and breach it and may you climb to the top The teeth of his old enemies these ancient brothers and sisters of a thing which had called itself Kurt Barlow sank into him like stingers Callahan felt them not at all He was smiling as he pulled the trigger and escaped them for good ONE On their way out along the dirt camproad which had taken them to the writers house in the town of Bridgton Eddie and Roland came upon an orange pickup truck with the words CENTRAL MAINE POWER MAINTENANCE painted on the sides Nearby a man in a yellow hardhat and an orange highvisibility vest was cutting branches that threatened the lowhanging electrical lines And did Eddie feel something then some gathering force Maybe a precursor of the wave rushing down the Path of the Beam toward them He later thought so but couldnt say for sure God knew hed been in a weird enough mood already and why not How many people got to meet their creators Well Stephen King hadnt created Eddie Dean a young man whose CoOp City happened to be in Brooklyn rather than the Bronxnot yet not in that year of but Eddie felt certain that in time King would How else could he be here Eddie nipped in ahead of the powertruck got out and asked the sweating man with the brushhog in his hands for directions to Turtleback Lane in the town of Lovell The Central Maine Power guy passed on the directions willingly enough then added If youre serious about going to Lovell today youre gonna have to use Route  The Bog Road some folks call it He raised a hand to Eddie and shook his head like a man forestalling an argument although Eddie had not in fact said a word since asking his original question Its seven miles longer I know and jouncy as a bugger but you cant get through East Stoneham today Copsve got it blocked off State Bears local yokels even the Oxford County Sheriffs Department Youre kidding Eddie said It seemed a safe enough response The power guy shook his head grimly No one seems to know exactly whats up but theres been shootinautomatic weapons maybeand explosions He patted the battered and sawdusty walkietalkie clipped to his belt Ive even heard the tword once or twice this afternoon Not sprised either Eddie had no idea what the tword might be but knew Roland wanted to get going He could feel the gunslingers impatience in his head could almost see Rolands impatient fingertwirling gesture the one that meant Lets go lets go Im talking bout terrorism the power guy said then lowered his voice People dont uiink shit like that can happen in America buddy but I got news for you it can If not today then sooner or later Someones gonna blow up the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building thats what I thinkthe rightwingers the leftwingers or the goddam Arabs Too many crazy people Eddie who had a nodding acquaintance with ten more years of history than this fellow nodded Youre probably right In any case thanks for the info Just tryin to save you some time And as Eddie opened the driversside door of John Cullums Ford sedan You been in a fight mister You look kinda bunged up Also youre limping Eddie had been in a fight all right had been grooved in the arm and plugged in the right calf Neither wound was serious and in the forward rush of events he had nearly forgotten them Now they hurt all over again Why in Gods name had he turned down Aaron Deepneaus bottle of Percocet tablets Yeah he said diats why Im going to Lovell Guys dog bit me He and I are going to have a talk about it Bizarre story didnt have much going for it in the way of plot but he was no writer That was Kings job In any case it was good enough to get him back behind the wheel of Cullums Ford Galaxie before the power guy could ask him any more questions and Eddie reckoned that made it a success He drove away quickly You got directions Roland asked Yeah Good Everythings breaking at once Eddie We have to get to Susannah as fast as we can Jake and Pere Callahan too And the babys coming whatever it is May have come already Turn right when you get back out to Kansas Road the power guy had told Eddie Kansas as in Dorothy Toto and Auntie Em everything breaking at once and he did That put them rolling north The sun had gone behind the trees on their left throwing the twolane blacktop entirely into shadow Eddie had an almost palpable sense of time slipping through his fingers like some fabulously expensive cloth that was too smooth to grip He stepped on the gas and Cullums old Ford although wheezy in the valves walked out a little Eddie got it up to fiftyfive and pegged it there More speed might have been possible but Kansas Road was both twisty and badly maintained Roland had taken a sheet of notepaper from his shirt pocket unfolded it and was now studying it although Eddie doubted if the gunslinger could actually read much of the document this worlds written words would always be mostly mystery to him At the top of the paper above Aaron Deepneaus rather shaky but perfectly legible handwriting and Calvin Towers allimportant signature was a smiling cartoon beaver and the words DAM IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO A silly pun if ever there was one I dont like silly questions I wont play silly games Eddie thought and suddenly grinned It was a point of view to which Roland still held Eddie felt quite sure notwithstanding the fact that while riding Blaine the Mono their lives had been saved by a few welltimed silly questions Eddie opened his mouth to point out that what might well turn out to be the most important document in the history of the worldmore important than the Magna Carta or the Declaration of Independence or Albert Einsteins Theory of Relativitywas headed by a dumb pun and how did Roland like them apples Before he could get out a single word however the wave struck TWO His foot slipped off the gas pedal and that was good If it had stayed on both he and Roland would surely have been injured maybe killed When the wave came staying in control of John Cullums Ford Galaxie dropped all the way off Eddie Deans list of priorities It was like that moment when the roller coaster has reached the top of its first mountain hesitates a moment tilts plunges and you fall with a sudden blast of hot summer air in your face and a pressure against your chest and your stomach floating somewhere behind you In that moment Eddie saw everything in Cullums car had come untethered and was floatingpipe ashes two pens and a paperclip from the dashboard Eddies dinh and he realized his dinhs kamai good old Eddie Dean No wonder he had lost his stomach He wasnt aware that the car itself which had drifted to a stop at the side of the road was also floating tilting lazily back and forth five or six inches above the ground like a small boat on an invisible sea Then the treelined country road was gone Bridgton was gone The world was gone There was the sound of todash chimes repulsive and nauseating making him want to grit his teeth in protest except his teeth were gone too THREE Like Eddie Roland had a clear sense of being first lifted and then hung like something diat had lost its ties to Earths gravity He heard the chimes and felt himself elevated through the wall of existence but he understood this wasnt real todashat least not of the sort theyd experienced before This was very likely what Vannay called aven kal words which meant lifted on the wind or carried on the wave Only the kal form instead of the more usual kas indicated a natural force of disastrous proportions not a wind but a hurricane not a wave but a tsunami The very Beam means to speak to you Gabby Vannay said in his Gabby the old sarcastic nickname Vannay had adopted ause Steven Deschains boy was so closemouthed His limpng brilliant tutor had stopped using it probably at Corts existence the year Roland had turned eleven You would do well to listen if it does I will listen very well Roland replied and was dropped He gagged weightless and nauseated More chimes Then suddenly he was floating again this time above a room filled with empty beds One look was enough to assure him that this was where the Wolves brought the children they kidnapped from the Borderland Callas At the far end of the room A hand grasped his arm a thing Roland would have thought impossible in this state He looked to his left and saw Eddie beside him floating naked They were both naked their clothes left behind in the writers world Roland had already seen what Eddie was pointing to At the far end of the room a pair of beds had been pushed together A white woman lay on one of them Her legsthe very ones Susannah had used on their todash visit to New York Roland had no doubtwere spread wide A woman with the head of a ratone of the taheen he felt surebent between them Next to the white woman was a darkskinned one whose legs ended just below the knees Floating naked or not nauseated or not todash or not Roland had never in his life been so glad to see anyone And Eddie felt the same Roland heard him cry out joyfully in the center of his head and reached a hand to still the younger man He had to still him for Susannah was looking at them had almost certainly seen them and if she spoke to them he needed to hear every word she said Because although those words would come from her mouth it would very likely be the Beam that spoke the Voice of die Bear or that of the Turde Both women wore metal hoods over their hair A length of segmented steel hose connected them Some kind of Vulcan mindmeld Eddie said once again filling the center of his head and blotting out everything else Or maybe Hush Roland broke in Hush Eddie for your fathers sake A man wearing a white coat seized a pair of cruellooking forceps from a tray and pushed the rathead taheen nurse aside He bent peering up between Mias legs and holding the forceps above his head Standing close by wearing a teeshirt with words of Eddie and Susannahs world on it was a taheen with the head of a fierce brown bird Hell sense us Roland thought If we stay long enough hell surely sense us and raise the alarm But Susannah was looking at him the eyes below the clamp of the hood feverish Bright with understanding Seeing them aye say true She spoke a single word and in a moment of inexplicable but perfecdy reliable intuition Roland understood the word came not from Susannah but from Mia Yet it was also the Voice of the Beam a force perhaps sentient enough to understand how seriously it was threatened and to want to protect itself Chassit was the word Susannah spoke he heard it in his head because they were katet and antet he also saw it form soundlessly on her lips as she looked up toward the place where they floated onlookers at something that was happening in some other where and when at this very moment The hawkheaded taheen looked up perhaps following her gaze perhaps hearing the chimes with its preternaturally sharp ears Then the doctor lowered his forceps and thrust them beneath Mias gown She shrieked Susannah shrieked with her And as if Rolands essentially bodiless being could be pushed away by the force of those combined screams like a milkweed pod lifted and carried on a gust of October wind the gunslinger felt himself rise violendy losing touch with this place as he went but holding onto that one word It brought with it a brilliant memory of his mother leaning over him as he lay in bed In the room of many colors this had been the nursery and of course now he understood the colors hed only accepted as a young boy accepted as children barely out of their clouts accept everything with unquestioning wonder with the unspoken assumption that its all magic The windows of the nursery had been stained glass representing the Bends OThe Rainbow of course He remembered his mother leaning toward him her face pied with that lovely various light her hood thrown back so he could trace the curve of her neck with the eye of a child its all magic and the soul of a lover he remembered thinking how he would court her and win her from his father if she would have him how they would marry and have children of their own and live forever in that fairytale kingdom called the AllAGlow and how she sang to him how Gabrielle Deschain sang to her little boy with his big eyes looking solemnly up at her from his pillow and his face already stamped with the many swimming colors of his wandering life singing a lilting nonsense song that went like this Babybunting babydear Baby bring your berries here Chussit chissit chassit Bring enough to Jill your basket Enough to fill my basket he thought as he was flung weightless through darkness and the terrible sound of the todash chimes The words werent quite nonsense but old numbers shed told him once when he had asked Chussit chissit chassit seventeen eighteen nineteen Chassit is nineteen he thought Of course its all nineteen Then he and Eddie were in light again a feversick orange light and there were Jake and Callahan He even saw Oy standing at Jakes left heel his fur bushed out and his muzzle wrinkled back to show his teeth Chussit chissit chassit Roland thought as he looked at his son a boy so small and terribly outnumbered in the dining room of the Dixie Pig Chassit is nineteen Enough to fill my basket But what basket What does it mean FOUR Beside Kansas Road in Bridgton John Cullums twelveyearold Ford a hundred and six thousand on the odometer and she was just getting waamed up Cullum liked to tell people seesawed lazily back and forth above the soft shoulder front tires touching down and then rising so the back tires could briefly kiss the dirt Inside two men who appeared not only unconscious but transparent rolled lazily with the cars motion like corpses in a sunken boat And around them floated the debris which collects in any old car thats been hardused the ashes and pens and paperclips and the worlds oldest peanut and a penny from the back seat and pine needles from the floormats and even one of the floormats itself In the darkness of the glove compartment objects rattled timidly against the closed door Someone passing would undoubtedly have been thunderstruck at the sight of all this stuffand people people who might be deadfloating around in the car like jetsam in a space capsule But no one did come along Those who lived on this side of Long Lake were mostly looking across the water toward the East Stoneham side even though there was really nothing over there to see any longer Even the smoke was almost gone Lazily the car floated and inside it Roland of Gilead rose slowly to the ceiling where his neck pressed against the dirty roofliner and his legs cleared the front seat to trail out behind him Eddie was first held in place by the wheel but then some random sideways motion of the car slid him free and he also rose his face slack and dreaming A silver line of drool escaped the corner of his mouth and floated shining and full of minuscule bubbles beside one bloodcrusted cheek FIVE Roland knew that Susannah had seen him had probably seen Eddie as well That was why shed labored so hard to speak that single word Jake and Callahan however saw neither of them The boy and the Pere had entered the Dixie Pig a tiling that was either very brave or very foolish and now all of their concentration was necessarily focused on what theyd found there Foolhardy or not Roland was fiercely proud of Jake He saw the boy had established canda between himself and Callahan that distance never the same in any two situations which assures that a pair of outnumbered gunslingers cannot be killed by a single shot Both had come ready to fight Callahan was holdingjakes gun and another thing as well some sort of carving Roland was almost sure it was a cantah one of the little gods The boy had Susannahs Rizas and their totesack retrieved from only the gods knew where The gunslinger spied a fat woman whose humanity ended at the neck Above her trio of flabby chins the mask shed been wearing hung in ruins Looking at the rathead beneath Roland suddenly understood a good many things Some might have come clearly to him sooner had not his attentionlike that of the boy and the Pere at this very momentbeen focused on other matters Callahans low men for instance They might well be taheen creatures neither of the Prim nor of the natural world but misbegotten things from somewhere between the two They certainly werent the sort of beings Roland called slow mutants for those had arisen as a result of the old ones illadvised wars and disastrous experiments No they might be genuine taheen sometimes known as the third people or the cantoi and yes Roland should have known How many of the taheen now served the being known as the Crimson King Some Many All SIX If the third answer was the correct one Roland reckoned the road to the Tower would be difficult indeed But to look beyond the horizon was not much in the gunslingers nature and in this case his lack of imagination was surely a blessing He saw what he needed to see Although the cantoiCallahans low folkhad surrounded Jake and Callahan on all sides the two of them hadnt even seen the duo behind them the ones whod been guarding the doors to Sixtyfirst Street the Pere had frozen them with the carving just as Jake had been able to freeze and fascinate people with the key hed found in the vacant lot A yellow taheen with the body of a man and the head of a waseau had some sort of gun near at hand but made no effort to grab it Yet there was another problem one Rolands eye trained to see every possible snare and ambush fixed upon at once He saw the blasphemous parody of Elds Last Fellowship on the wall and understood its significance completely in the seconds before it was ripped away And the smell not just flesh but human flesh This too he would have understood earlier had he had time to think about it only life in Calla Bryn Sturgis had allowed him little time to think In die Calla as in a storybook life had been one damned thing after another Yet it was clear enough now wasnt it The low folk might only be taheen a childs ogres if it did ya Those behind the tapestry were what Callahan had called Type One vampires and what Roland himself knew as the Grandfathers perhaps the most gruesome and powerful survivors of the Prims longago recession And while such as the taheen might be content to stand as they were gawking at the sigul Callahan held up the Grandfathers wouldnt spare it a second glance Now clattering bugs came pouring out from under the table They were of a sort Roland had seen before and any doubts he might still have held about what was behind that tapestry departed at the sight of them They were parasites blooddrinkers campfollowers Grandfatherfleas Probably not dangerous while there was a bumbler present but of course when you spied the little doctors in such numbers the Grandfathers were never far behind As Oy charged at the bugs Roland of Gilead did the only thing he could think of he swam down to Callahan Into Callahan SEVEN Pere I am here Aye Roland What No time GET HIM OUT OF HERE You must Get him out while theres still time EIGHT And Callahan tried The boy of course didnt want to go Looking at him through the Peres eyes Roland thought with some bitterness  should have schooled him better in betrayal Yet all the gods know I did the best I could Go while you can Callahan told Jake striving for calmness Catch up to her ifyou can This is the command of your dinh This is also the will of the White It should have moved him but it didnt he still arguedgods he was nearly as bad as Eddieand Roland could wait no longer Pere let me Roland seized control without waiting for a reply He could already feel the wave the aven kal beginning to recede And the Grandfathers would come at any second Go Jake he cried using the Peres mouth and vocal cords like a loudspeaker If he had thought about how one might do something like this he would have been lost completely but thinking about things had also never been his way and he was grateful to see the boys eyes flash wide You have this one chance and must take it Find her As dinh I command you Then as in the hospital ward with Susannah he felt himself once more tossed upward like something without weight blown out of Callahans mind and body like a bit of cobweb or a fluff of dandelion thistle For a moment he tried to flail his way back like a swimmer trying to buck a strong currentjust long enough to reach the shore but it was impossible RolandThat was Eddies voice and filled with dismay Jesus Roland what in Gods name are those things The tapestry had been torn aside The creatures which rushed out were ancient and freakish their warlock faces warped with teeth growing wild their mouths propped open by fangs as thick as the gunslingers wrists their wrinkled and stubbled chins slick with blood and scraps of meat And stillgods oh godsthe boy remained Theyll kill Oy first Callahan shouted only Roland didnt think it was Callahan He thought it was Eddie using Callahans voice as Roland had Somehow Eddie had found either smoother currents or more strength Enough to get inside after Roland had been blown out They II kill him in front of you and drink his blood It was finally enough The boy turned and fled with Oy running beside him He cut directly in front of the waseautaheen and between two of the low folken but none made any effort to grab him They were still staring at the raised Turtle on Callahans palm mesmerized The Grandfathers paid no attention to the fleeing boy at all as Roland had felt sure they would not He knew from Pere Callahans story that one of the Grandfathers had come to the little town of Salems Lot where the Pere had for awhile preached The Pere had lived through the experiencenot common for those who faced such monsters after losing their weapons and siguls of powerbut the thing had forced Callahan to drink of its tainted blood before letting him go It had marked him for these others Callahan was holding his crosssigul out toward them but before Roland could see anything else he was exhaled back into darkness The chimes began again all but driving him mad with their awful tintinnabulation Somewhere faintly he could hear Eddie shouting Roland reached for him in the dark brushed Eddies arm lost it found his hand and seized it They rolled over and over clutching each other trying not to be separated hoping not to be lost in the doorless dark between the worlds ONE Eddie returned to John Cullums old car the way hed sometimes come out of nightmares as a teenager tangled up and panting with fright totally disoriented not sure of who he was let alone where He had a second to realize that incredible as it seemed he and Roland were floating in each others arms like unborn twins in the womb only this was no womb A pen and a paperclip were drifting in front of his eyes So was a yellow plastic case he recognized as an eighttrack tape Dont waste your time John he thought No true thread there thats a deadend gadget if there ever was one Something was scratching the back of his neck Was it the domelight of John Cullums scurgy old Galaxie By God he thought it w Then gravity reasserted itself and they fell with meaningless objects raining down all around them The floormat which had been floating around in the Fords cabin landed draped over the steering wheel Eddies midsection hit the top of the front seat and air exploded out of him in a rough whoosh Roland landed beside him and on his bad hip He gave a single barking cry and then began to pull himself back into the front seat Eddie opened his mouth to speak Before he could Callahans voice filled his head Hile Roland Hile gunslinger How much psychic effort had it cost the Pere to speak from that other world And behind it faint but there the sound of besual triumphant cries Howls that were not quite words Eddies wide and startled eyes met Rolands faded blue ones He reached out for the gunslingers left hand thinking Hes going Great God I think the Pere is going May you find your Tower Roland and breach it and may you climb to the top Eddie breathed They were back in John Cullums car and parkedaskew but otherwise peacefully enoughat the side of Kansas Road in the shady earlyevening hours of a summers day but what Eddie saw was the orange helllight of that restaurant that wasnt a restaurant at all but a den of cannibals The thought that there could be such things that people walked past their hiding place each and every day not knowing what was inside not feeling the greedy eyes that perhaps marked them and measured them Then before he could think further he cried out with pain as phantom teeth settled into his neck and cheeks and midriff as his mouth was violently kissed by nettles and his testicles were skewered He screamed clawing at the air with his free hand until Roland grabbed it and forced it down Stop Eddie Stop Theyre gone A pause The connection broke and the pain faded Roland was right of course Unlike the Pere they had escaped Eddie saw that Rolands eyes were shiny with tears Hes gone too The Pere The vampires You know the cannibals Did Did they Eddie couldnt finish the thought The idea of Pere Callahan as one of them was too awful to speak aloud No Eddie Not at all He Roland pulled the gun he still wore The scrolled steel sides gleamed in the late light He tucked the barrel deep beneath his chin for a moment looking at Eddie as he did it He escaped them Eddie said Aye and how angry they must be Eddie nodded suddenly exhausted And his wounds were aching again No sobbing Good he said Now put that thing back where it belongs before you shoot yourself witfi it And as Roland did What just happened to us Did we go todash or was it another Beamquake I think it was a bit of both Roland said Theres a thing called aven kal which is like a tidalwave that runs along the Path of the Beam We were lifted on it And allowed to see what we wanted to see Roland thought about this for a moment then shook his head with great firmness We saw what the Beam wanted us to see Where it wants us to go Roland did you study this stuff when you were a kid Did your old pal Vannay teach classes in I dont know The Anatomy of Beams and Bends OThe Rainbow Roland was smiling Yes I suppose that we were taught such things in both History and Summa Logicales Roland didnt answer He was looking out the window of Cullums car still trying to get his breath backboth the physical and the figurative It really wasnt that hard to do not here being in this part of Bridgton was like being in the neighborhood of a certain vacant lot in Manhattan Because there was a generator near here Not sai King as Roland had first believed but the potential of sai King of what sai King might be able to create given world enough and time Wasnt King also being carried on aven kal perhaps generating the very wave that lifted him A man cant pull himself up by his own bootstraps no matter how hard he tries Cort had lectured when Roland Cuthbert Alain and Jamie had been little more than toddlers Cort speaking in the tone of cheery selfassurance that had gradually hardened to harshness as his last group of lads grew toward their trials of manhood But maybe about bootstraps Cort had been wrong Maybe under certain circumstances a man could pull himself up by them Or give birth to the universe from his navel as Gan was said to have done As a writer of stories was King not a creator And at bottom wasnt creation about making something r o r a nothingseeing the world in a grain of sand or pulling ones self up by ones own bootstraps And what was he doing sitting here and thinking long Philosophical thoughts while two members of his tet were lost Get this carriage going Roland said trying to ignore the sweet humming he could hearwhether the Voice of the Beam or the Voice of Gan the Creator he didnt know Weve got to get to Turtleback Lane in this town of Lovell and see if we cant find our way through to where Susannah is And not just for Susannah either If Jake succeeded in eluding the monsters in the Dixie Pig he would also head to where she lay Of this Roland had no doubt Eddie reached for the transmission leverdespite all its gyrations Cullums old Galaxie had never quit runningand then his hand fell away from it He turned and looked at Roland with a bleak eye What ails thee Eddie Whatever it is spill it quick The babys coming nowmay have come already Soon theyll have no more use for her I know Eddie said But we cant go to Lovell He grimaced as if what he was saying was causing him physical pain Roland guessed it probably was Not yet TWO They sat quiet for a moment listening to the sweedy tuned hum of the Beam a hum that sometimes became joyous voices They sat looking into the thickening shadows in the trees where a million faces and a million stories lurked O can you say unfound door can you say lost Eddie halfexpected Roland to shout at himit wouldnt be the first timeor maybe clout him upside the head as the gunslingers old teacher Cort had been wont to do when his pupils were slow or contrary Eddie almost hoped he would A good shot to the jaw might clear his head by Shardik Only muddy thinkings not the trouble and you know it he thought Your head is clearer than his If it wasn you could let go of this luorld and go on hunting for your lost wife At last Roland spoke What is it then This He bent and picked up the folded piece of paper with Aaron Deepneaus pinched handwriting on it Roland looked at it for a moment then flicked it into Eddies lap with a little grimace of distaste You know how much I love her Eddie said in a low trained voice You know that Roland nodded but without looking at him He appeared be staring down at his own broken and dusty boots and the dirty floor of the passengerside footwell Those downcast eyes that gaze which would not turn to him whod come almost to idolize Roland of Gilead sort of broke Eddie Deans heart Yet he pressed on If there had ever been room for mistakes it was gone now This was the endgame Id go to her this minute if I thought it was the right thing to do Roland this second But we have to finish our business in this world Because this world is oneway Once we leave today July th  we can never come here again We Eddie weve been through all of this Still not looking at him Yes but do you understand it Only one bullet to shoot one Riza to throw Thats why we came to Bridgton in the first place God knows I wanted to go to Turtleback Lane as soon as John Cullum told us about it but I thought we had to see the writer and talk to him And I was right wasnt I Almost pleading now Wasnt I Roland looked at him at last and Eddie was glad This was hard enough wretched enough without having to bear the turnedaway downcast gaze of his dinh And it may not matter if we stay a little longer If we concentrate on those two women lying together on those two beds Rolandif we concentrate on Suze and Mia as we last saw themthen its possible we can cut into their history at that point Isnt it After a long considering moment during which Eddie wasn t conscious of drawing a single breath the gunslinger nodded Such could not happen if on Turtleback Lane they ound what the gunslinger had come to think of as an oldones or because such doors were dedicated and always came out e same place But were they to find a magic door somewhere aong Turtleback Lane in Lovell one that had been left behind en the Prim receded then yes they might be able to cut in where they wanted But such doors could be tricky too this they had found out for themselves in the Cave of Voices when the door there had sent Jake and Callahan to New York instead of Roland and Eddie thereby scattering all their plans into the Land of Nineteen What else must we do Roland said There was no anger in his voice but to Eddie he sounded both tired and unsure Whatever it is its gonna be hard That much I guarantee you Eddie took the bill of sale and gazed at it as grimly as any Hamlet in the history of drama had ever stared upon the skull of poor Yorick Then he looked back at Roland This gives us title to the vacant lot with the rose in it We need to get it to Moses Carver of Holmes Dental Industries And where is he We dont know For that matter Eddie we dont even know if hes still alive Eddie voiced a wild laugh You say true I say thankya Why dont I turn us around Roland Ill drive us back to Stephen Kings house We can cadge twenty or thirty bucks off himbecause brother I dont know if you noticed but we dont have a crying dime between the two of usbut more important we can get him to write us a really good hardboiled private eye someone who looks like Bogart and kicks ass like Clint Eastwood Let him track down this guy Carver for us He shook his head as if to clear it The hum of the voices sounded sweetly in his ears the perfect antidote to the ugly todash chimes I mean my wife is in bad trouble somewhere up the line for all I know shes being eaten alive by vampires or vampire bugs and here I sit beside a country road with a guy whose most basic skill is shooting people trying to work out how Im going to start a fucking corporation Slow down Roland said Now that he was resigned to staying in this world a little longer he seemed calm enough Tell me what it is you feel we need to do before we can shake the dirt of this where and when from our heels for good So Eddie did THREE Roland had heard a good deal of it before but hadnt fully understood what a difficult position they were in They owned the vacant lot on Second Avenue yes but their basis for ownership was a holographic document that would look mighty shaky in a court o legal especially if the powersthatbe from the Sombra Corporation started throwing lawyers at them Eddie wanted to get the writ of trade to Moses Carver if he could along with the information that his goddaughter Odetta Holmesmissing for thirteen years by the summer of was alive and well and wanted above all things for Carver to assume guardianship not just of the vacant lot itself but of a certain rose growing wild within its borders Moses Carverif still alivehad to be convinced enough by what he heard to fold the socalled Tet Corporation into Holmes Industries or viceversa More He had to dedicate what was left of his life and Eddie had an idea Carver might be Aaron Deepneaus age by now to building a corporate giant whose only real purpose was to thwart two other corporate giants Sombra and North Central Positronics at every turn To strangle them if possible and keep them from becoming a monster that would leave its destroyers track across all the dying expanse of MidWorld and mortally wound the Dark Tower itself Maybe we should have left the writ OTrade with sai Deepneau Roland mused when he had heard Eddie through to the end At least he could have located this Carver and sought him out and told our tale for us No we did right to keep it This was one of the few things of which Eddie was completely sure If wed left this piece of paper with Aaron Deepneau itd be ashes in the wind by now You believe Tower would have repented his bargain and talked his friend into destroying it I know it Eddie said But even if Deepneau could stand up to his old friend going yattayattayatta in his ear for on endBurn it Aaron they coerced me and now they mean to screw me you know it as well as I do burn it and well call die cops on those momsersdo you think Moses Carver would believe such a crazy story Roland smiled bleakly I dont diink his belief would be an issue Eddie Because think thee a moment how much of our crazy story has Aaron Deepneau actually heard Not enough Eddie agreed He closed his eyes and pressed the heels of his hands against them Hard I can only think of one person who could actually convince Moses Carver to do the things wed have to ask and shes otherwise occupied In the year of  And by then Carvers gonna be as dead as Deepneau and maybe Tower himself Well what can we do without her What will satisfy you Eddie was thinking that perhaps Susannah could come back to  without them since she at least hadnt visited it yet Well shed come here todash but he didnt think that exactly counted He supposed she might be barred from  solely on the grounds that she was katet with him and Roland Or some other grounds Eddie didnt know Reading the fine print had never been his strong point He turned to ask Roland what he thought but Roland spoke before he got a chance What about our dantete he asked Although Eddie understood the termit meant baby god or little saviorhe did not at first understand what Roland meant by it Then he did Had not their Waterford dantete loaned them the very car they were sitting in say thankya Cullum Is that who youre talking about Roland The guy with the case of autographed baseballs You say true Roland replied He spoke in that dry tone which indicated not amusement but mild exasperation Dont overwhelm me with your enthusiasm for the idea But you told him to go away And he agreed to go And how enthusiastic would you say he was about visiting his friend in Vermong Mont Eddie said unable to suppress a smile Yet smiling or not what he felt most strongly was dismay He thought that scraping sound he heard in his imagination was Rolands ofingered right hand prospecting around at the very bottom of the barrel Roland shrugged as if to say he didnt care if Cullum had noken of going to Vermont or Barony o Garlan Answer my question Well Cullum actually hadnt expressed much enthusiasm for the idea at all He had from the very first reacted more like one of them than one of the grasseaters among whom he lived Eddie recognized grasseaters very easily having been one himself until Roland first kidnapped him and then began his homicidal lessons Cullum had been clearly intrigued by the gunslingers and curious about their business in his little town But Roland had been very emphatic abovit what he wanted and folks had a way of following his orders Now he made a twirling motion with his right hand his old impatient gesture Hurry for your fathers sake Shit or get off the commode I guess he really didnt want to go Eddie said But that doesnt mean hes still at his house in East Stoneham He is though He didnt go Eddie managed to keep his mouth from dropping open only with some effort How can you know that Can you touch him is that it Roland shook his head Then how Ka Ka Ka Just what the fuck does iki mean Rolands face was haggard and tired the skin pale beneath his tan Who else do we know in this part of the world No one but Then its him Roland spoke flatly as if stating some obvious fact of life for a child up is over your head down is where your feet stick to the earth Eddie got ready to tell him that was stupid nothing more an rank superstition then didnt Putting aside Deepneau and the hideous Jack Andolini John Cullum was the only person tiiey knew in this part of the world or on diis level of the Tower if you preferred to diink of it that way And after the things Eddie had seen in the last few monthshell in the last weekwho was he to sneer at superstition All right Eddie said I guess we better try it How do we get in touch We can phone him from Bridgton But in a story Roland a minor character like John Cullum would never come in off die bench to save the day It wouldnt be considered realistic In life Roland said Im sure it happens all the time And Eddie laughed What the hell else could you do It was just so perfecdy Roland FOUR BRIDGTON HIGH STREET  HIGHLAND LAKE  HARRISON  WATERFORD SWEDEN  LOVELL FRYEBURG They had just passed this sign when Eddie said Root around in the glovecompartment a little Roland See if ka or the Beam or whatever left us a little spare change for the pay phone Glove Do you mean this panel here Yeah Roland first tried to turn the chrome button on the front then got with the program and pushed it The inside was a mares nest that hadnt been improved by the Galaxies brief period of weighdessness There were credit card receipts a very old tube of what Eddie identified as toothpaste Roland could make out the words HOLMES DENTAL on it quite clearly a fottergraff showing a smiling little girlCullums niece mayhapon a pony a stick of what he first took for explosive Eddie said it was a road flare for emergencies a magazine that appeared to be called YANKME and a cigarbox Roland couldnt quite make out the word on this although he thought it might be trolls He showed the box to Eddie whose eyes lit up That says TOLLS he said Maybe youre right about Cullum and ka Open it up Roland do it please ya The child who had given this box as a gift had crafted a loving and rather clumsy catch on the front to hold it closed Roland slipped the catch opened the box and showed Eddie a great many silver coins Is it enough to call sai Cullums house Yeah Eddie said Looks like enough to call Fairbanks Alaska It wont help us a bit though if Cullums on the road to Vermont FIVE The Bridgton town square was bounded by a drug store and a pizzajoint on one side a movie theater The Magic Lantern and a department store Renys on the other Between the theater and the department store was a little plaza equipped with benches and three pay phones Eddie swept through Cullums box of tollchange and gave Roland six dollars in quarters I want you to go over there he said pointing at the drug store and get me a tin of aspirin Will you know it when you see it Astin Ill know it The smallest size they have is what I want because six bucks really isnt much money Then go next door to that place that says Bridgton Pizza and Sandwiches If youve still got at least sixteen of those moneycoins left tell them you want a hoagie Roland nodded which wasnt good enough for Eddie Let me hear you say it Hoggie Hoagie HOOGgie Ho Eddie quit Roland let me hear you say poorboy Poor boy Good If you have at least sixteen quarters left ask for a poorboy Can you say lots of mayo Lots of mayo Yeah If you have less than sixteen ask for a salami and cheese sandwich Sandwich not a popkin Salommy sanditch Close enough And dont say anything else unless you absolutely have to Roland nodded Eddie was right it would be better if he did not speak People only had to look at him to know in their secret hearts that he wasnt from these parts They also had a tendency to step away from him Better he not exacerbate that The gunslinger dropped a hand to his left hip as he turned toward the street an old habit that paid no comfort this time both revolvers were in die trunk of Cullums Galaxie wrapped in their cartridge belts Before he could get going again Eddie grabbed his shoulder The gunslinger swung round eyebrows raised faded eyes on his friend We have a saying in our world Rolandwe say soandso was grasping at straws And what does it mean This Eddie said bleakly What were doing Wish me good luck fella Roland nodded Aye so I do Both of us He began to turn away and Eddie called him back again This time Roland wore an expression of faint impatience Dont get killed crossing the street Eddie said and then briefly mimicked Cullums way of speaking Summah folksre thickern ticks on a dog And theyre not ridin hosses Make your call Eddie Roland said and then crossed Bridgtons high street with slow confidence walking in the same rolling gait that had taken him across a thousand other high streets in a thousand small towns Eddie watched him then turned to the telephone and consulted the directions After that he lifted the receiver and dialed the number for Directory Assistance SIX He didnt go the gunslinger had said speaking of John Cullum with flat certainty And why Because Cullum was the end of the line there was no one else for them to call Roland of Gileads damned old ka in other words After a brief wait the Directory Assistance operator coughed up Cullums number Eddie tried to memorize ithed always been good at remembering numbers Henry had sometimes called him Little Einsteinbut this time he couldnt be confident of his ability Something seemed to have happened either to his thinking processes in general which he didnt believe or to his ability to remember certain artifacts of this world which he sort of did As he asked for the number a second timeand wrote it in the gathered dust on the phone kiosks litde ledgeEddie found himself wondering if hed still be able to read a novel or follow the plot of a movie from the succession of images on a screen He rather doubted it And what did it matter The Magic Lantern next door was showing Star Wars and Eddie thought that if he made it to the end of his lifes path and into the clearing without another look at Luke Skywalker and another listen to Darth Vaders noisy breathing hed still be pretty much okay Thanks maam he told the operator and was about to dial again when there was a series of explosions behind him Eddie whirled heartrate spiking right hand dipping expecting to see Wolves or harriers or maybe that son of a bitch Flagg What he saw was a convertible filled with laughing goofytaced high school boys with sunburned cheeks One of had just tossed out a string of firecrackers left over from the Fourth of Julywhat kids their age in Calla Bryn Sturgis would have called bangers If Id had a gun on my hip I might have shot a couple of those bucks Eddie thought You want to talk goofy start with that Yes Well And maybe he might not have Either way he had to admit the possibility that he was no longer exactly safe in the more civilized quarters Live with it Eddie murmured then added the great sage and eminent junkies favorite advice for lifes little problems Dealn He dialed John Cullums number on the oldfashioned rotary phone and when a robot voiceBlaine the Monos greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother mayhapasked him to deposit ninety cents Eddie dropped in a buck What the hell he was saving the world The phone rang once rang twice and was picked up John Eddie almost yelled Good fucking deal John this is But the voice on the other end was already speaking As a child of the late eighties Eddie knew this did not bode well have reached John Cullum of Cullum Caretakin and Camp Checkin said Cullums voice in its familiar slow Yankee drawl I gut called away kinda sudden dontcha know and cant say with any degree a certainty just when Ill be back If this inconveniences ya I beg paaadn but you cn call Gary Crowell at  or Junior Barker at  Eddies initial dismay had departeddepaaaated Cullum himself would have saidright around the time the mans wavery recorded voice was telling Eddie that he Cullum couldnt say with any degree of certainty when hed be back Because Cullum was right there in his hobbity little cottage on the western shore of Keywadin Pond either sitting on his overstuffed hobbity sofa or in one of the two similarly overstuffed hobbity chairs Sitting there and monitoring messages on his nodoubtclunky midseventies answering machine And Eddie knew this because well Because he just knew The primitive recording couldnt completely hide the sly humor that had crept into Cullums voice by the end of the message Coss if youre still set on talkin to nobody but yours truly you cn leave me a message at the beep Keep it short The final word came out shawt Eddie waited for the beep and then said Its Eddie Dean John I know youre there and I think youve been waiting for my call Dont ask me why I think that because I dont really know but There was a loud click in Eddies ear and then Cullums voicehis live voicesaid Hello there son you takin good care of my car For a moment Eddie was too bemused to reply for Cullums Downeast accent had turned the question into something quite different You takin good care ofmyka Boy Cullum asked suddenly concerned You still on the wire Yeah Eddie said and so are you I thought you were going to Vermont John Well I tell you what This place aint seen a day this excitin probly since South Stoneham Shoe burnt down in  The copsve gut all the ruds out of town blocked off Eddie was sure they were letting folks through the roadblocks if they could show proper identification but he ignored that issue in favor of something else Want to tell me you couldnt find your way out of that town without seeing a single cop if it suited your fancy There was a brief pause In it Eddie became aware of someone at his elbow He didnt turn to look it was Roland Who else in this world would smellsubtly but unquestionablyof another world Oh well Cullum said at last Maybe I do know a woods road or two that come out over in Lovell Its been a dry summer n I guess I could get mtruck up em One or two Well say three or four A pause which Eddie didnt break He was having too much fun Five or six Cullum amended and Eddie chose not to respond to this either Eight Cullum said at last and when Eddie laughed Cullum joined in Whats on your mind son Eddie glanced at Roland who was holding out a tin of aspirin between die two remaining fingers of his right hand Eddie took it gratefully I want you to come over to Lovell he said to Cullum Seems like we might have a litde more palavering to do after all Ayuh and it seems like I musta known it Cullum said although it was never right up on the top of my mind up there I kep thinkin Ill be gettin on the road to Montpelier soon and still I kep findin one more thing and one more diing to do around here If youda called five minutes ago you woulda gotten a busyI us on the phone to Charlie Beemer It was his wife n sisterinlaw that got killed in the market dont you know And then I thought What the hell Ill just give the whole place a good sweep before I put my gear in the back of the truck and go Notfiin up on top is what Im sayin but down underneath I guess I been waitin for your call ever since I got back here Wherell you be Turtleback Lane Eddie popped open the aspirin tin and looked greedily at the little lineup of tablets Once a junkie always a junkie he reckoned Even when it came to this stuff Ayuh he said with his tongue only pardy in his cheek he had become quite the mimic of regional dialects since meeting Roland on a Delta jet descending into Kennedy Airport You said that lane was nothing but a twomile loop off Route  didnt you So I did Some very nice homes along Turtleback A brief reflective pause And a lot of em for sale Theres been quite a number of walkins in that part of the world just lately As I may have also mentioned Such things make folks nervous and rich folks at least cn afford to get away from what makes it haad to sleep at night Eddie could wait no longer he took three of the aspirin and tossed them into his mouth relishing the bitter taste as they dissolved on his tongue Bad as die pain currendy was he would have borne twice as much if he could have heard from Susannah But she was quiet He had an idea that the line of communication between them chancy at best had ceased to exist with the coming of Mias damned baby You boys might want to keep your shootin irons close at hand if youre headed over to Turtleback in Lovell Cullum said As for me I think Ill just toss mshotgun in mtruck before I set sail Why not Eddie agreed You want to look for your car along the loop okay Youll find it Ayuh that old Galaxies haad to miss Cullum agreed Tell me somethin son Im not goin to Vmont bvit I gut a feelin you mean to send me somewhere if I agree to go You mind tellin me where Eddie thought that Mark Twain might elect to call the next chapter of John Cullums no doubt colorful life A Maine Yankee in the Crimson Kings Court but elected not to say so Have you ever been to New York City Gorry yes Had a fortyeighthour pass there when I was in the Army The final word came out in a ridiculously flat drawl Went to Radio City Music Hall and the Empire State Buildin that much I remember Musta made a few other tourist stops though because I lost thirty dollars out of mwallet and a couple of months later I got diagnosed with a pretty fine case of the clap This time youll be too busy to catch the clap Bring your credit cards I know you have some because I got a look at the receipts in your glovecompartment He felt an almost insane urge to draw the last word out make it compaaaaaatment Mess in there ennit Cullum asked equably Ayuh looks like what was left when the dog chewed the shoes See you in Lovell John Eddie hung up He looked at the bag Roland was carrying and lifted his eyebrows Its a poorboy sanditch Roland said With lots of mayo whatever that is Id want a sauce that didnt look quite so much like come myself but may it do ya fine Eddie rolled his eyes Gosh thats a real appetitebuilder Do you say so Eddie had to remind himself once more that Roland had almost no sense of humor I do I do Come on I can eat my comeandcheese sandwich while I drive Also we need to talk about how were going to handle this SEVEN The way to handle it both agreed was to tell John Cullum as much of their tale as they thought his credulity and sanity could stand Then if all went well they would entrust him with the vital bill of sale and send him to Aaron Deepneau With strict orders to make sure he spoke to Deepneau apart from the not entirely trustworthy Calvin Tower Cullum and Deepneau can work together to track Moses Carver down Eddie said and I think I can give Cullum enough information about Suzeprivate stuffto convince Carver that shes still alive After that though well a lot depends on how convincing those two guys can be And how eager they are to work for the Tet Corporation in their sunset years Hey they may surprise us I cant see Cullum in a suit and tie but traveling around the country and throwing monkeywrenches in Sombras business He considered head cocked then nodded with a smile Yeah I can see that pretty well A Susannahs godfather is apt to be an old codger himself Roland observed Just one of a different color Such fellows often speak their own language when theyre antet And mayhap I can give John Cullum something that will help convince Carver to throw in with us Asigul Yes Eddie was intrigued What kind But before Roland could answer they saw something that made Eddie stomp on the brakepedal They were in Lovell now and on Route  Ahead of them staggering unsteadily along the shoulder was an old man with snarled and straggly white hair He wore a clumsy wrap of dirty cloth that could by no means be called a robe His scrawny arms and legs were whipped with scratches There were sores on them as well burning a dull red His feet were bare and equipped with ugly and dangerouslooking yellow talons instead of toes Clasped under one arm was a splintery wooden object that might have been a broken lyre Eddie thought no one could have looked more out of place on this road where the only pedestrians they had seen so far were seriouslooking exercisers obviously from away looking ever so puttogether in their nylon jogging shorts baseball hats and teeshirts one joggers shirt bore the legend DONT SHOOT THE TOURISTS The thing that had been trudging along the berm of Route  turned toward them and Eddie let out an involuntary cry of horror Its eyes bled together above the bridge of its nose reminding him of a doubleyolked egg in a frypan A fang depended from one nostril like a bone booger Yet somehow worst of all was the dull green glow that baked out from the creatures face It was as if its skin had been painted with some sort of thin fluorescent gruel It saw them and immediately dashed into the woods dropping its splintered lyre behind Christ Eddie screamed If that was a walkin he hoped never to see another Stop Eddie Roland shouted then braced die heel of one hand against the dashboard as Cullums old Ford slid to a dusty halt close to where the thing had vanished Open the backhold Roland said as he opened the door Get my widowmaker Roland were in kind of a hurry here and Turtleback Lanes still three miles north I really think we ought to Shut your fools mouth and get it Roland roared then ran to the edge of the woods He drew a deep breath and when he shouted after the rogue creature his voice sent gooseflesh racmg up Eddies arms He had heard Roland speak so once or twice before but in between it was easy to forget that the blood of a King ran in his veins He spoke several phrases Eddie could not understand then one he could So come forth ye Child of Roderick ye spoiled ye lost and make your bow before me Roland son of Steven of the Line of Eld For a moment there was nothing Eddie opened the Fords trunk and brought Roland his gun Roland strapped it on without so much as a glance at Eddie let alone a word of thanks Perhaps diirty seconds went by Eddie opened his mouth to speak Before he could the dusty roadside foliage began to shake A moment or two later the misbegotten thing reappeared It staggered with its head lowered On the front of its robe was a large wet patch Eddie could smell the reek of a sick things urine wild and strong Yet it made a knee and raised one misshapen hand to its forehead a doomed gesture of fealty that made Eddie feel like weeping Hile Roland of Gilead Roland of Eld Will you show me some sigul dear In a town called River Crossing an old woman who called herself Aunt Talitha had given Roland a silver cross on a finelink silver chain Hed worn it around his neck ever since Now he reached into his shirt and showed it to the kneeling creaturea slow mutie dying of radiation sickness Eddie was quite sureand the thing gave a cracked cry of wonder Wouldee have peace at the end of your course thou Child of Roderick Wouldee have the peace of the clearing Aye my dear it said sobbing then added a great deal more in some gibberish tongue Eddie couldnt understand Eddie looked both ways along Route  expecting to see trafficthis was the height of the summer season after allbut spied nothing in either direction For the moment at least their luck still held How many of you are there in these parts Roland asked interrupting the walkin As he spoke he drew his revolver and raised that old engine of death until it lay against his shirt The Child of Roderick tossed its hand at the horizon without looking up Delah gunslinger he said for here the worlds are thin say anro con fa seysey desenefanno billet cobair can I Chevin devardan do Because I felt sat for dem Cantoi cantah canDiscordia aven la cam mah can MaymiIffin lah vainen eth How many dan devar It thought about Rolands question then spread its fingers there were ten Eddie noted five times Fifty Although fifty of what Eddie didnt know And Discordia Roland asked sharply Do you truly say so Oh aye so says me Chevin of Chayven son of Hamil minstrel of the South Plains that were once my home Say the name of the town that stands near Castle Discordia and Ill release you Ah gunslinger all there are dead I think not Say it Fedic screamed Chevin of Chayven a wandering musica who could never have suspected its life would end in such a far strange placenot the plains of MidWorld but the mountains of western Maine It suddenly raised its horrid glowing face to Roland It spread its arms wide like something which has been crucified Fedic on the far side of Thunderclap on the Path of the Beam On VShardik VMaturin the Road to the Dark T Rolands revolver spoke a single time The bullet took the kneeling thing in the center of its forehead completing the ruin of its ruined face As it was flung backward Eddie saw its flesh turn to greenish smoke as ephemeral as a hornets wing For a moment Eddie could see Chevin of Chayvens floating teeth like a ghostly ring of coral and then they were gone Roland dropped his revolver back into his holster then pronged the two remaining fingers of his right hand and drew them downward in front of his face a benedictory gesture if Eddie had ever seen one Give you peace Roland said Then he unbuckled his gunbelt and began to roll the weapon into it once more Roland was that was it a slow mutant Aye I suppose youd say so poor old thing But the Rodericks are from beyond any lands I ever knew although before the world moved on they gave their grace to Arthur Eld He turned to Eddie his blue eyes burning in his tired face Fedic is where Mia has gone to have her baby I have no doubt Where shes taken Susannah By the last casde We must backtrack to Thunderclap eventually but Fedics where we need to go first Its good to know He said he felt sad for someone Who Roland only shook his head not answering Eddies question A CocaCola truck blasted by and diunder rumbled in the far west Fedic OThe Discordia the gunslinger murmured instead Fedic OThe Red Death If we can save Susannahand Jakewell backtrack toward the Callas But well return when our business there is done And when we turn southeast again What Eddie asked uneasily What then Roland Then theres no stopping until we reach the Tower He held out his hands watched them tremble minutely Then he looked up at Eddie His face was tired but unafraid I have never been so close I hear all my lost friends and their lost fathers whispering to me They whisper on the Towers very breath Eddie looked at Roland for a minute fascinated and frightened and then broke die mood with an almost physical effort Well he said moving back toward the drivers door of the Ford if any of those voices tells you what to say to Cullumthe best way to convince him of what we wantbe sure to let me know Eddie got in the car and closed the door before Roland could reply In his minds eye he kept seeing Roland leveling his big revolver Saw him aiming it at the kneeling figure and pulling the trigger This was the man he called both dinh and friend But could he say with any certainty that Roland wouldnt do the same thing to him or Suze or Jake if his heart told him it would take him closer to his Tower He could not And yet he would go on with him Would have gone on even if hed been sure in his heartoh God forbidthat Susannah was dead Because he had to Because Roland had become a good deal more to him than his dinh or his friend My father Eddie murmured under his breath just before Roland opened the passenger door and climbed in Did you speak Eddie Roland asked Yes Eddie said Just a little farther My very words Roland nodded Eddie dropped the transmission back into Drive and got the Ford rolling toward Turtleback Lane Still in the distancebut a little closer than beforethunder rumbled again ONE As the babys time neared Susannah Dean looked around once more counting her enemies as Roland had taught her You must never draw hed said until you knoio how many are against you or youve satisfied yourself that you can never know or you ve decided its your day to die She wished she didnt also have to cope with the terrible thoughtinvading helmet on her head but whatever that thing was it didnt seem concerned with Susannahs effort to count those present at the arrival of Mias chap And that was good There was Sayre the man in charge The low man with one of those red spots pulsing in the center of his forehead There was Scowther the doctor between Mias legs getting ready to officiate at the delivery Sayre had roughed the doc up when Scowther had displayed a little too much arrogance but probably not enough to interfere with his efficiency There were five other low men in addition to Sayre but shed only picked out two names The one with the bulldogjowls and the heavy sloping gut was Haber Next to Haber was a birdthing with the brown feathered head and vicious beebee eyes of a hawk This creatures name seemed to be Jey or possibly Gee That was seven all armed with what looked like automatic pistols in dockers clutches Scowthers swung carelessly out from beneath his white coat each time he bent down Susannah had already marked that one as hers There were also three pallid watchful humanoid things standing beyond Mia These buried in dark blue auras were vampires Susannah was quite sure Probably of the sort Callahan had called Type Threes The Pere had once referred to them as pilot sharks That made ten Two of the vampires carried bahs the third some sort of electrical sword now turned down to no more than a guttering core of light If she managed to get Scowthers gun when you get it sweetie she amendedshed read The Power of Positive Thinkingand still believed every word the Rev Peale had written she would turn it on the man with the electric sword first God might know how much damage such a weapon could inflict but Susannah Dean didnt want to find out Also present was a nurse with the head of a great brown rat The pulsing red eye in the center of her forehead made Susannah believe that most of the other low folken were wearing humanizing masks probably so they wouldnt scare the game while out and about on die sidewalks of New York They might not all look like rats underneath but she was pretty sure that none of them looked like Robert Goulet The rathead nurse was the only one present who wore no weapon that Susannah could see Eleven in all Eleven in this vast and mostly deserted infirmary that wasnt she felt quite sure under die borough of Manhattan And if she was going to setde their hash it would have to be while they were occupied with Mias babyher precious chap Its coming doctor the nurse cried in nervous ecstasy It was Susannahs counting stopped as the worst pain yet rolled over her Over both of them Burying them They screamed in tandem Scowther was commanding Mia to push to push NOW Susannah closed her eyes and also bore down for it was her baby too or had been As she felt the pain flow out of her like water whirlpooling its way down a dark drain she experienced the deepest sorrow she had ever known For it was Mia the baby was flowing into die last few lines of the living message Susannahs body had somehow been made to transmit It was ending Whatever happened next this part was ending and Susannah Dean let out a cry of mingled relief and regret a cry that was itself like a song And then before the horror begansomething so terrible she would remember each detail as if in the glare of a brilliant light until the day of her entry into the clearingshe felt a small hot hand grip her wrist Susannah turned her head rolling the unpleasant weight of the helmet with it She could hear herself gasping Her eyes met Mias Mia opened her lips and spoke a single word Susannah couldnt hear it over Scowthers roaring he was bending now peering between Mias legs and holding the forceps up and against his brow Yet she did hear it and understood that Mia was trying to fulfill her promise Id free you if chance allows her kidnapper had said and the word Susannah now heard in her mind and saw on the laboring womans lips was chassit Susannah do you hear me I hear you very well Susannah said And you understand our compact Aye Ill help you get away from these with your chap if I can And Kill us if you cant the voice finished fiercely It had never been so loud That was partly the work of the connecting cable Susannah felt sure Say it Susannah daughter of Dan Ill kill you both if you She stopped there Mia seemed satisfied however and that was well because Susannah couldnt have gone on if both their lives had depended on it Her eye had happened on the ceiling of this enormous room over the aisles of beds halfway down And there she saw Eddie and Roland They were hazy floating in and out of the ceiling looking down at her like phantom fish Another pain but this one not as severe She could feel her thighs hardening pushing but that seemed far away Not important What mattered was whether or not she was really seeing what she thought she was seeing Could it be that her overstressed mind wishing for rescue had created this hallucination to comfort her She could almost believe it Would have very likely they not both been naked and surrounded by an odd collection of floating junk a matchbook a peanut ashes a penny And a floormat by God A car floormat with FORD printed on it Doctor I can see the hea A breathless squawk as Dr Scowther no gentleman he elbowed Nurse Ratty unceremoniously aside and bent even closer to the juncture of Mias thighs As if he meant to pull her chap out with his teeth perhaps The hawkthing Jey or Gee was speaking to the one called Haber in an excited buzzing dialect Theyre really there Susannah thought The floormat proves it She wasnt sure how the floormat proved it only that it did And she mouthed the word Mia had given her chassit It was a password It would open at least one door and perhaps many To wonder if Mia had told the truth never even crossed Susannahs mind They were tied togedier not just by the cable and the helmets but by the more primitive and far more powerful act of childbirth No Mia hadnt lied Push you godsdamned lazy bitch Scowther almost howled and Roland and Eddie suddenly disappeared through the ceiling for good as if blown away by the force of the mans breath For all Susannah knew they had been She turned on her side feeling her hair stuck to her head in clumps aware that her body was pouring out sweat in what could have been gallons She pulled herself a little closer to Mia a little closer to Scowther a little closer to the crosshatched butt of Scowthers dangling automatic Be still sissa hear me I beg said one of the low men and touched Susannahs arm The hand was cold and flabby covered with fat rings The caress made her skin crawl This will be over in a minute and then all the worlds change When this one joins the Breakers in Thunderclap Shut up Straw Haber snapped and pushed Susannahs wouldbe comforter backward Then he turned eagerly to the delivery again Mia arched her back groaning The rathead nurse put her hands on Mias hips and pushed them gently back down to the bed Nawthee nawthee push ith thy belly Eat shit you bitch Mia screamed and while Susannah felt a faint tug of her pain that was all The connection between them was fading Summoning her own concentration Susannah cried into the well of her own mind Hey Hey Positronics lady You still there The link is down said the pleasant female voice As before it spoke in the middle of Susannahs head but unlike before it seemed dim no more dangerous than a voice on the radio that comes from far away due to some atmospheric flaw Repeat the link is down We hope youll remember North Central Positronics for all your mental enhancement needs And Sombra Corporation A leader in mindtomind communication since the ten thousands There was a toothrattling BEEEEEEP far down in Susannahs mind and then the link was gone It wasnt just the absence of the horridly pleasant female voice it was everything She felt as if shed been let out of some painful bodycompressing trap Mia screamed again and Susannah let out a cry of her own Part of this was not wanting Sayre and his mates to know the link between her and Mia had been broken part was genuine sorrow She had lost a woman who had become in a way her true sister Susannah Suze are you there She started up on her elbows at this new voice for a moment almost forgetting the woman beside her That had been Jake Is it you honey It is isnt it Can you hear me YES he cried Finally God whove you been talking to Keep yelling so I can home in on y The voice broke off but not before she heard a ghostly rattle of distant gunfire Jake shooting at someone She thought not She thought someone was shooting at him TWO Now Scowther shouted Now Mia Push For your life Give it all you have PUSH Susannah tried to roll closer to the other womanOh Im concerned and wanting comfort see how concerned I am concern and wanting comfort is all it isbut the one called Straw pulled her back The segmented steel cable swung and stretched out between them Keep your distance bitch Straw said and for the first time Susannah faced the possibility that they werent going to let her get hold of Scowthers gun Or any gun Mia screamed again crying out to a strange god in a strange language When she tried to raise her midsection from the table the nurseAlia Susannah thought the nurses name was Aliaforced her down again and Scowther gave a short curt cry of what sounded like satisfaction He tossed aside the forceps hed been holding Why dye do that Sayre demanded The sheets beneath Mias spread legs were now damp with blood and the boss sounded flustered Wont need them Scowther returned breezily She was built for babies could have a dozen in the ricepatch and never miss a rows worth of picking Here it comes neat as you please Scowther made as if to grab the largish basin sitting on the next bed decided he didnt have quite enough time and slipped his pink gloveless hands up the inside of Mias thighs instead This time when Susannah made an effort to move closer to Mia Straw didnt stop her All of them low men and vampires alike were watching the last stage of the birth with complete fascination most of them clustered at the end of the two beds which had been pushed together to make one Only Straw was still close to Susannah The vampire with the firesword had just been demoted she decided that Straw would be the first to go Once more Scowther cried Foryour baby Like the low men and the vampires Mia had forgotten Susannah Her wounded painfilled eyes fixed on Sayre May I have him sir Please say I may have him if only for a little while Sayre took her hand The mask which covered his real face smiled Yes my darling he said The chap is yours for years and years Only push this one last time Mia dont believe his lies Susannah cried but the cry went nowhere Likely that was just as well Best she be entirely forgotten for the time being Susannah turned her thoughts in a new direction Jake Jake where are you No answer Not good Please God he was still alive Maybe hes only busy Running hidingfighting Silence doesnt necessarily mean hes Mia howled what sounded like a string of obscenities pushing as she did so The lips of her already distended vagina spread further A freshet of blood poured out widening the muddy deltashape on the sheet beneath her And then through the welter of crimson Susannah saw a crown of white and black The white was skin The black was hair The mottle of white and black began to retreat into the crimson and Susannah thought the baby would settle back still not quite ready to come into the world but Mia was done waiting She pushed with all her considerable might her hands held up before her eyes in clenched and trembling fists her eyes slitted her teeth bared A vein pulsed alarmingly in the center of her forehead another stood out on the column of her throat HEEEYAHHHH she cried COMMALA YOU PRETTY BASTARD COMMALACOMECOME Dantete murmured Jey the hawkthing and the others picked it up in a kind of reverent whisper Dantete dantete commala dantete The coming of the little god This time the babys head did not just crown but rushed forward Susannah saw his hands held against his bloodspattered chest in tiny fists that trembled with life She saw blue eyes wide open and startling in both their awareness and their similarity to Rolands She saw sooty black lashes Tiny beads of blood jeweled them barbaric natal finery Susannah sawand would never forgethow the babys lower lip momentarily caught on the inner lip of his mothers vulva The babys mouth was pulled briefly open revealing a perfect row of litde teeth in the lower jaw They were teethnot fangs but perfect little teethyet still to see them in the mouth of a newborn gave Susannah a chill So did the sight of the chaps penis disproportionately large and fully erect Susannah guessed it was longer than her little finger Howling in pain and triumph Mia surged up on her elbows her eyes bulging and streaming tears She reached out and seized Sayres hand in a grip of iron as Scowther deftly caught the baby Sayre yelped and tried to pull away but he might as well have tried to well to pull away from a Deputy Sheriff in Oxford Mississippi The litde chant had died and there was a moment of shocked silence In it Susannahs overstrained ears clearly heard the sound of bones grinding in Sayres wrist DOES HE LIVE Mia shrieked into Sayres starded face Spitde flew from her lips TELL ME YOU POXY WHORESON IE MY CHAP LIVES Scowther lifted the chap so that he and the child were face to face The doctors brown eyes met the babys blue ones And as die chap hung diere in Scowdiers grip widi its penis jutting defiantly upward Susannah clearly saw the crimson mark on the babes left heel It was as if that foot had been dipped in blood just before the baby left Mias womb Rather dian spanking die babys buttocks Scowther drew in a breath and blew it in puffs direcdy into the chaps eyes Mias chap blinked in comical and undeniably human surprise It drew in a breath of its own held it for a moment then let it out King of Kings he might be or the destroyer of worlds but he embarked upon life as had so many before him squalling with outrage Mia burst into glad tears at the sound of that cry The devilish creatures gathered around the new modier were bondservants of the Crimson King but that didnt make them immune to what they had just witnessed They broke into applause and laughter Susannah was not a little disgusted to find herself joining them The baby looked around at the sound his expression one of clear amazement Weeping with tears running down her cheeks and clear snot dripping from her nose Mia held out her arms Give him to me wept she so wept Mia daughter of none and mother of one Let me hold him I beg let me hold my son Let me hold my chap Let me hold my precious And the baby turned its head to the sound of his mothers voice Susannah would have said such a thing was impossible but of course she would have said a baby born wide awake with a mouthful of teeth and a boner was impossible as well Yet in every other way the babe seemed completely normal to her chubby and wellformed human and thus dear There was the red mark on his heel yes but how many children normal in every other regard were born with some sort of birthmark Hadnt her own father been born redhanded according to family legend This mark wouldnt even show unless the kid was at the beach Still holding die newborn up to his face Scowther looked at Sayre There was a momentary pause during which Susannah could easily have seized Scowthers automatic She didnt even think of doing it Shed forgotten Jakes telepathic cry had likewise forgotten her weird visit from Roland and her husband She was as enrapt as Jey and Straw and Haber and all the rest enrapt at this moment of a childs arrival in a wornout world Sayre nodded almost imperceptibly and Scowther lowered baby Mordred still wailing and still looking over his shoulder apparently for his mother into Mias waiting arms Mia turned him around at once so she could look at him and Susannahs heart froze with dismay and horror For Mia had run mad It was brilliant in her eyes it was in the way her mouth managed to sneer and smile at the same time while drool pinked and thickened with blood from her bitten tongue trickled down the sides of her chin most of all it was in ner triumphant laughter She might come back to sanity in the days ahead but Bitch aint nevah comin back Detta said not without sympathy Gittin this far n den gittin shed of it done broke her She busted n you know it as wells Ah do O such beauty Mia crooned O see thy blue eyes thy skin as white as the sky before Wide Earths first snow See thy nipples such perfect berries they are see thy prick and thy balls as smooth as new peaches She looked around first at Susannahher eyes skating over Susannahs face with absolutely no recognitionand then at the others See my chap ye unfortunates ye gonicks my precious my baby my boy She shouted to them demanded of them laughing with her mad eyes and crying with her crooked mouth See what I gave up eternity for See my Mordred see him very well for never will you see another his like Panting harshly she covered the babys bloody staring face with kisses smearing her mouth until she looked like a drunk who has tried to put on lipstick She laughed and kissed the chubby flap of his infants double chin his nipples his navel the jutting tip of his penis andholding him up higher and higher in her trembling arms the child she meant to call Mordred goggling down at her with that comic look of astonishmentshe kissed his knees and then each tiny foot Susannah heard that rooms first suckle not the baby at his mothers breast but Mias mouth on each perfectly shaped toe THREE Yon childs my dinhs doom Susannah thought coldly If I do nothing else I could seize Scowthers gun and shoot it Twould be the work of two seconds With her speedher uncanny gunslingers speedthis was likely true But she found herself unable to move She had foreseen many outcomes to this act of the play but not Mias madness never that and it had caught her entirely by surprise It crossed Susannahs mind that she was lucky indeed that the Positronics link had gone down when it had If it hadnt she might be as mad as Mia And that link could kick back in sisterdont you think you better make your move while you still can But she couldnt be shure that was the thing She was frozen in wonder held in thrall Stop that Sayre snapped at her Your job isnt to slurp at him but to feed him If youd keep him hurry up Give him suck Or should I summon a wetnurse There are many whod give their eyes for the opportunity Never in your UFEF Mia cried laughing but she lowered the child to her chest and impatiently brushed aside the bodice of the plain white gown she wore baring her right breast Susannah could see why men would be taken by her even now that breast was a perfect coraltipped globe that seemed more fit for a mans hand and a mans lust than a babys nourishment Mia lowered the chap to it For a moment he rooted as comically as hed goggled at her his face striking the nipple and then seeming to bounce off When it came down again however the pink rose of his mouth closed on the erect pink bud of her breast and began to suck Mia stroked the chaps tangled and bloodsoaked black curls still laughing To Susannah her laughter sounded like screams There was a clumping on the floor as a robot approached It looked quite a bit like Andy the Messenger Robotsame skinny seven or eightfoot height same electricblue eyes same manyjointed gleaming body In its arms it bore a large glass box filled with green light Whats that fucking thing for Sayre snapped He sounded both pissed off and incredulous An incubator Scowther said I felt it would be better to be safe than sorry When he turned to look his shoulderholstered gun swung toward Susannah It was an even better chance the best shed ever have and she knew it but before she could take it Mias chap changed FOUR Susannah saw red light run down the childs smooth skin from the crown of its head to the stained heel of its right foot It was not a flush but a flash lighting the child from without Susannah would have sworn it And then as it lay upon Mias deflated stomach with its lips clamped around her nipple the red flash was followed by a blackness that rose up and spread turning the child into a lightless gnome a negative of the rosy baby that had escaped Mias womb At the same time its body began to shrivel its legs pulling up and melting into its belly its head sliding downand pulling Mias breast with itinto its neck which puffed up like the throat of a toad Its blue eyes turned to tar then back to blue again Susannah tried to scream and could not Tumors swelled along the black things sides then burst and extruded legs The red mark which had ridden the heel was still visible but now had become a blob like the crimson brand on a black widow spiders belly For that was what this thing was a spider Yet the baby was not entirely gone A white excrescence rose from the spiders back In it Susannah could see a tiny deformed face and blue sparks that were eyes What Mia asked and started up on her elbows once again Blood had begun to pour from her breast The baby drank it like milk losing not a drop Beside Mia Sayre was standing as still as a graven image his mouth open and his eyes bulging from their sockets Whatever hed expected from this birthwhatever hed been told to expectit wasnt this The Detta part of Susannah took a childs vicious pleasure in the mans shocked expression he looked like the comedian Jack Benny milking a laugh For a moment only Mia seemed to realize what had happened for her face began to lengthen with a kind of informed horrorand perhaps pain Then her smile returned that angelic madonnas smile She reached out and stroked the stillchanging freak at her breast the black spider with the tiny human head and the red mark on its bristly gut Is he not beautiful she cried Is my son not beautiful as fair as the summer sun These were her last words FIVE Her face didnt freeze exactly but stilled Her cheeks and brow and throat flushed dark with the exertions of childbirth only a moment before faded to the waxy whiteness of orchid petals Her shining eyes grew still and fixed in their sockets And suddenly it was as if Susannah were looking not at a woman lying on a bed but the rfratwng of a woman An extraordinarily good one but still something that had been created on paper with strokes of charcoal and a few pale colors Susannah remembered how she had returned to the PlazaPark Hyatt Hotel after her first visit to the allure of Castle Discordia and how shed come here to Fedic after her last palaver with Mia in the shelter of the merlon How the sky and the castle and the very stone of the merlon had torn open And then as if her thought had caused it Mias face was ripped apart from hairline to chin Her fixed and dulling eyes fell crookedly away to either side Her lips split into a crazy double twingrin And it wasnt blood that poured out of that widening fissure in her face but a stalemelling white powder Susannah had a fragmented memory of T S Eliot hollow men stuffed men headpiece filled with straw and Lewis Carroll why you re nothing but a pack of cards before Mias dantete raised its unspeakable head from its first meal Its bloodsmeared mouth opened and it hoisted itself lower legs scrabbling for purchase on its mothers deflating belly upper ones almost seeming to shadowbox at Susannah It squealed with triumph and if it had at that moment chosen to attack the other woman who had given it nurture Susannah Dean would surely have died next to Mia Instead it returned to the deflated sac of breast from which it had taken its first suck and tore it off The sound of its chewing was wet and loose A moment later it burrowed into the hole it had made the white human face disappearing while Mias was obliterated by the dust boiling out of her deflating head There was a harsh almost industrial sucking sound and Susannah thought Its taking all the moisture out of her all the moisture thats left And look at it Look at it swell Like a leech on a horses neck Just then a ridiculously English voiceit was the plummy intonation of the lifelong gentlemans gentlemansaid Pardon me sirs but will you be wanting this incubator after all For the situation seems to have altered somewhat if you dont mind my saying It broke Susannahs paralysis She pushed herself upward with one hand and seized Scowthers automatic pistol with the other She yanked but the gun was strapped across the butt and wouldnt come free Her questing index finger found the little sliding knob that was the safety and pushed it She turned the gun holster and all toward Scowthers ribcage What the dev he began and then she pulled the trigger with her middle finger at the same time yanking back on the shoulderrig with all her force The straps binding the holster to Scowthers body held but the thinner one holding the automatic in place snapped and as Scowther fell sideways trying to look down at the smoking black hole in his white labcoat Susannah took full possession of his gun She shot Straw and the vampire beside him the one with the electric sword For a moment the vampire was there still staring at the spidergod that had looked so much like a baby to begin with and then its aura whiffed out The things flesh went with it For a moment there was nothing where it had been but an empty shirt tucked into an empty pair of bluejeans Then the clothes collapsed Kill her Sayre screamed reaching for his own gun Kill that bitch Susannah rolled away from the spider crouched on the body of its rapidly deflating mother raking at the helmet she was wearing even as she tumbled off the side of the bed There was a moment of excruciating pain when she thought it wasnt going to come away and then she hit the floor free of it It hung over the side of the bed fringed with her hair The spiderthing momentarily pulled off its roost when its mothers body jerked chittered angrily Susannah rolled beneath the bed as a series of gunshots went off above her She heard a loud SPROINK as one of the slugs hit a spring She saw the rathead nurses feet and hairy lower legs and put a bullet into one of her knees The nurse gave a scream turned and began to limp away squalling Sayre leaned forward pointing the gun at the makeshift double bed just beyond Mias deflating body There were already three smoking smoldering holes in the groundsheet Before he could add a fourth one of the spiders legs caressed his cheek tearing open the mask he wore and revealing the hairy cheek beneath Sayre recoiled crying out The spider turned to him and made a mewling noise The white thing high on its backa node with a human faceglared as if to warn Sayre away from its meal Then it turned back to the woman who was really not recognizable as a woman any longer she looked like the ruins of some incredibly ancient mummy which had now turned to rags and powder I say this is a bit confusing the robot with the incubator remarked Shall I retire Perhaps I might return when matters have clarified somewhat Susannah reversed direction rolling out from beneath the bed She saw that two of the low men had taken to their heels Jey the hawkman didnt seem to be able to make up his mind Stay or go Susannah made it up for him putting a single shot into the sleek brown head Blood and feathers flew Susannah got up as well as she could gripping the side of the bed for balance holding Scowthers gun out in front of her khe had gotten four The rathead nurse and one other had run Sayre had dropped his gun and was trying to hide behind the robot with the incubator Susannah shot the two remaining vampires and the low man with the bulldog face That oneHaberhadnt forgotten Susannah hed been holding his ground and waiting for a clear shot She got hers first and watched him fall backward with deep satisfaction Haber she thought had been the most dangerous Madam I wonder if you could tell me began the robot and Susannah put two quick shots into its steel face darkening the blue electric eyes This trick she had learned from Eddie A gigantic siren immediately went off Susannah felt that if she listened to it long she would be deafened I HAVE BEEN BLINDED BY GUNFIRE the robot bellowed still in its absurd wouldyoulikeanothercupofteamadam accent VISION ZERO I NEED HELP CODE SAY HELP Sayre stepped away from it hands held high Susannah couldnt hear him over the siren and the robots blatting but she could read the words as they came off the bastards lips surrender will you accept my parole She smiled at this amusing idea unaware that she smiled It was without humor and without mercy and meant only one thing she wished she could get him to lick her stumps as he had forced Mia to lick his boots But there wasnt time enough He saw his doom in her grin and turned to run and Susannah shot him twice in the back of the headonce for Mia once for Pere Callahan Sayres skull shattered in a fury of blood and brains He grabbed the wall scrabbled at a shelf loaded with equipment and supplies and then went down dead Susannah now took aim at the spidergod The tiny white human head on its black and bristly back turned to look at her The blue eyes so uncannily like Rolands blazed No you cannot You must not For I am the Kings only son I cant she sent back leveling the automatic Oh sugar you are just so WRONG But before she could pull the trigger there was a gunshot from behind her A slug burned across the side of her neck Susannah reacted instantly turning and throwing herself sideways into the aisle One of the low men whod run had had a change of heart and come back Susannah put two bullets into his chest and made him mortally sorry She turned eager for moreyes this was what she wanted what she had been made for and shed always revere Roland for showing herbut the others were either dead or fled The spider raced down the side of its birthbed on its many legs leaving the papiermache corpse of its mother behind It turned its white infants head briefly toward her Youd do ivell to let me pass Blackie or She fired at it but stumbled over the hawkmans outstretched hand as she did The bullet that would have killed the abomination went a little awry clipping off one of its eight hairy legs instead A yellowishred fluid more like pus than blood poured from the place where the leg had joined the body The thing screamed at her in pain and surprise The audible portion of that scream was hard to hear over the endless cycling blat of the robots siren but she heard it in her head loud and clear Ill pay you back for that My father and I well pay you back Make you cry for death so we will You aint gonna have a chance sugar Susannah sent back trying to project all the confidence she possibly could not wanting the thing to know what she believed that Scowthers automatic might have been shot dry She aimed with a deliberation that was unnecessary and the spider scuttled rapidly away from her darting first behind the endlessly sirening robot and then through a dark doorway All right Not great not the best solution by any means but she was still alive and that much was grand And the fact that all of sai Sayres crew were dead or run off That wasnt bad either Susannah tossed Scowthers gun aside and selected another this one a Walther PPK She took it from the dockers clutch ktraw had been wearing then rummaged in his pockets where she found half a dozen extra clips She briefly considered adding the vampires electric sword to her armory and decided to leave it where it was Better the tools you knew than those you didnt She tried to get in touch with Jake couldnt hear herself think and turned to the robot Hey big boy Shut off that damn sireen what do you say She had no idea if it would work but it did The silence was immediate and wonderful with the sensuous texture of moire silk Silence might be useful If there was a counterattack shed hear them coming And the dirty truth She hoped for a counterattack wanted them to come and never mind whether that made sense or not She had a gun and her blood was up That was all that mattered Jake Jake do you hear me kiddo If you hear answer your big sis Nothing Not even that rattle of distant gunfire He was out of Then a single wordwas it a word wimeweh More important was it Jake She didnt know for sure but she thought yes And the word seemed familiar to her somehow Susannah gathered her concentration meaning to call louder this time and then a queer idea came to her one too strong to be called intuition Jake was trying to be quiet He was hiding Maybe getting ready to spring an ambush The idea sounded crazy but maybe his blood was up too She didnt know but thought hed either sent her that one odd word wimeweh on purpose or it had slipped out Either way it might be better to let him roll his own oats for awhile I say I have been blinded by gunfire the robot insisted Its voice was still loud but had dropped to a range at least approaching normal I cant see a bloody thing and I have this incubator Drop it Susannah said But Drop it Chumley I beg pawdon madam but my name is Nigel the Butler and I really cant Susannah had been hauling herself closer during this little exchangeyou didnt forget the old means of locomotion just because youd been granted a brief vacation with legs she was discoveringand read both the name and the serial number stamped on the robots chromesteel midsection Nigel DNK  drop that fucking glass box say thankya The robot DOMESTIC was stamped just below its serial number dropped the incubator and then whimpered when it shattered at its steel feet Susannah worked her way over to Nigel and found she had to conquer a moments fear before reaching up and taking one threefingered steel hand She needed to remind herself that this wasnt Andy from Calla Bryn Sturgis nor could Nigel know about Andy The butlerrobot might or might not be sophisticated enough to crave revengecertainly Andy had beenbut you couldnt crave what you didnt know about She hoped Nigel pick me up There was a whine of servomotors as the robot bent No hon you have to come forward a litde bit Theres broken glass where you are Pawdon madam but Im blind I believe it was you who shot my eyes out Oh That Well she said hoping her tone of irritation would disguise the fear beneath I cant very well get you new ones if you dont pick me up can I Now get a wiggle on may it do ya Times wasting Nigel stepped forward crushing broken glass beneath its teet and came to the sound of her voice Susannah controlled the urge to cringe back but once the Domestic Robot had set its grip on her its touch was quite gentle It lifted her into its arms Now take me to the door Madam beg pawdon but there are many doors in Sixteen More still beneath the castle Susannah couldnt help being curious How many A brief pause I should say five hundred and ninetyfive are currently operational She immediately noticed that fiveninetyfive added up to nineteen Added up to chassit Do you mind giving me a carry to the one I came through before the shooting started Susannah pointed toward the far end of the room No madam I dont mind at all but Im sorry to tell you that it will do you no good Nigel said in his plummy voice That door NEW YORK FEDIC is oneway A pause Relays clicking in the steel dome of its head Also it burned out after its last use It has as you might say gone to the clearing at the end of the path Oh thats just wonderfull Susannah cried but realized she wasnt exactly surprised by Nigels news She remembered the ragged humming sound shed heard it makingjust before Sayre had pushed her rudely through it remembered thinking even in her distress that it was a dying thing And yes it had died Just wonderful I sense you are distressed madam Youre goddamned right Im distressed Bad enough the damned thing only opened oneway Now its shut down completely Except for the default Nigel agreed Default What do you mean default That would be NEW YORK FEDIC Nigel told her At one time there were over thirty oneway New YorktoFedic ports but I believe  is the only one that remains All commands pertaining to NEW YORK FEDIC will now have defaulted to  Chassit she thought almost prayed Hes talking about chassit I think Oh God I hope he is Do you mean passwords and such Nigel Why yes madam Take me to Door  As you wish Nigel began to move rapidly up the aisle between the hundreds of empty beds their taut white sheets gleaming under the brilliant overhead lamps Susannahs imagination momentarily populated this room with screaming frightened children freshly arrived from Calla Bryn Sturgis maybe from the neighboring Callas as well She saw not just a single rathead nurse but battalions of them eager to clamp the helmets over the heads of the kidnapped children and start the process that that did what Ruined them in some way Sucked the intelligence out of their heads and knocked their growthhormones out of whack and ruined them forever Susannah supposed that at first they would be cheered up to hear such a pleasant voice in their heads a voice welcoming them to the wonderful world of North Central Positronics and the Sombra Group Their crying would stop their eyes fill with hope Perhaps they would think the nurses in their white uniforms were good in spite of their hairy scary faces and yellow fangs As good as the voice of the nice lady Then the hum would begin quickly building in volume as it moved toward the middle of their heads and this room would again fill with their frightened screams Madam Are you all right Yes Why do you ask Nigel I believe you shivered Never mind Just get me to the door to New York the one that still works SIX Once they left the infirmary Nigel bore her rapidly down first one corridor and then another They came to escalators that looked as if they had been frozen in place for centuries Halfway down one of them a steel ball on legs flashed its amber eyes at Nigel and cried Hmop Hmvp Nigel responded Howp hmvp in return and then said to Susannah in the confidential tone certain gossipy people adopt when discussing Those Who Are Unfortunate Hes a Mech Foreman and has been stuck there tor over eight hundred yearsfried boards I imagine Poor soul But he still tries to do his best Twice Nigel asked her if she believed his eyes could be replaced The first time Susannah told him she didnt know The second timefeeling a little sorry for him definitely him now not itshe asked what he thought I think my days of service are nearly over he said and then added something that made her arms tingle with gooseflesh O Discordia The Diem Brothers are dead she thought rememberinghad it been a dream a vision a glimpse of her Towersomething from her time with Mia Or had it been her time in Oxford Mississippi Or both Papa Doc Duvalier is dead Christa McAuliffe is dead Stephen King is dead popular writer killed while taking afternoon walk O Discordia O lost But who was Stephen King Who was Christa McAuliffe for that matter Once they passed a low man who had been present at the birth of Mias monster He lay curled on a dusty corridor floor like a human shrimp with his gun in one hand and a hole in his head Susannah thought hed committed suicide In a way she supposed that made sense Because things had gone wrong hadnt they And unless Mias baby found its way to where it belonged on its own Big Red Daddy was going to be mad Might be mad even if Mordred somehow found his way home His other father For this was a world of twins and mirror images and Susannah now understood more about what shed seen than she really wanted to Mordred too was a twin a JekyllandHyde creature with two selves and heor ithad the faces of two fathers to remember They came upon a number of other corpses all looked like suicides to Susannah She asked Nigel if he could tellby their smells or somethingbut he claimed he could not How many are still here do you think she asked Her blood had had time to cool a litde and now she felt nervous Not many madam I believe that most have moved on Very likely to the Derva Whats the Derva Nigel said he was dreadfully sorry but that information was restricted and could be accessed only with the proper password Susannah tried chassit but it was no good Neither was nineteen or her final try ninetynine She supposed shed have to be content with just knowing most of them were gone Nigel turned left into a new corridor with doors on both sides She got him to stop long enough to try one of them but there was nothing of particular note inside It was an office and longabandoned judging by the thick fall of dust She was interested to see a poster of madly jitterbugging teenagers on one wall Beneath it in large blue letters was this SflY VOU COOL CRTS fillD BOPPIIV KITTIES I ROCKED fiTTHE HOP WITH fllflll FREED ClEUElflllD OHIO OCTOBER  Susannah was pretty sure that the performer on stage was Richard Penniman Clubcrawling folkies such as herself affected disdain for anyone who rocked harder than Phil Ochs but Suze had always had a soft spot in her heart for Little Richard good golly Miss Molly you sure like to ball She guessed it was a Detta thing Did these people once upon a time use their doors to vacation in various tuheres and whens of their choice Did they use the power of the Beams to turn certain levels of the Tower into tourist attractions She asked Nigel who told her he was sure he did not know Nigel still sounded sad about the loss of his eyes Finally they came into an echoing rotunda with doors marching all around its mighty circumference The marble tiles on the floor were laid in a blackandwhite checkerboard pattern Susannah remembered from certain troubled dreams m which Mia had fed her chap Above high and high constellations of electric stars winked in a blue firmament that was now showing plenty of cracks This place reminded her of the Cradle of Lud and even more strongly of Grand Central Station Somewhere in the walls airconditioners or exchangers ran rustily The smell in the air was weirdly familiar and after a short struggle Susannah identified it Comet Cleanser They sponsored The Price Is Right which she sometimes watched on TV if she happened to be home in the morning Im Don Pardo now please welcome your host Mr Bill Cullen Susannah felt a moment of vertigo and closed her eyes Bill Cullen is dead Don Pardo is dead Martin Luther King is dead shot down in Memphis Rule Discordia O Christ those voices would they never stop She opened her eyes and saw doors marked SHANGHAIFEDIC and BOMBAYFEDIC and one marked DALLAS NOVEMBER FEDIC Others were written in runes that meant nothing to her At last Nigel stopped in front of one she recognized NORTH CENTRAL TOITRMCS LTD  New librkFedic Maximum Security All of this Susannah recognized from the other side but below VERBAL ENTRY CODE REQUIRED was this message flashing ominous red  W FINAL DEFAULT SEVEN What would you like to do next madam Nigel asked Set me down sugarpie She had time to wonder what her response would be if I Nigel declined to do so but he didnt even hesitate She walkhoppedscuttled to the door in her old way and put her hands on it Beneath them she felt a texture that was neither wood nor metal She thought she could hear a very faint hum She considered trying chassither version of Ali Babas Open sesameI and didnt bother There wasnt even a doorknob Oneway meant oneway she reckoned no kidding around JAKE She sent it with all her might No answer Not even that faint wimeweh nonsense word She waited a moment longer then turned around and sat with her back propped against the door She dropped the extra ammo clips between her spread knees and then held the Walther PPK up in her right hand A good weapon to have with your back to a locked door she reckoned she liked the weight of it Once upon a time she and others had been trained in a protest technique called passive resistance Lie down on the lunchroom floor cover your soft middle and softer privates Do not respond to those who strike you and revile you and curse your parents Sing in your chains like the sea What would her old friends make of what she had become Susannah said You know what I dont give shit one Passive resistance is also dead Madam Nothing Nigel Madam may I ask What Im doing Exactly madam Waiting on a friend Chumley Just waiting on a friend She thought that DNK  would remind her that his name was Nigel but he didnt Instead he asked how long she would wait for her friend Susannah told him until hell froze over This elicited a long silence Finally Nigel asked May I go then madam How will you see I have switched to infrared It is less satisfying than threeX macrovision but it will suffice to get me to the repair bays Is there anyone in the repair bays who can fix you Susannah asked with mild curiosity She pushed the button that dropped the clip out of the Walthers butt then rammed it back In taking a certain elemental pleasure in the oily metallic sound it made I m sure I cant say madam Nigel replied although the probability of such a thing is very low certainly less than one Pe r cent If no one comes then I like you will wait She nodded suddenly tired and very sure that this was where the grand quest endedhere leaning against this door But you didnt give up did you Giving up was for cowards not gunslingers May ya do fine Nigelthanks for the piggyback Long days and pleasant nights Hope you get your eyes back Sorry I shot em out but I was in a bit of a tight and didnt know whose side you were on And good wishes to you madam Susannah nodded Nigel clumped off and then she was alone leaning against the door to New York Waiting for Jake Listening for Jake All she heard was the rusty dying wheeze of the machinery in the walls ONE The threat that the low men and the vampires might kill Oy was the only thing that kept Jake from dying with the Pere There was no agonizing over the decision Jake yelled OY TOME with all the mental force he could muster and Oy ran swiftly at his heel Jake passed low men who stood mesmerized by the turtle and straightarmed a door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY From the dim orangered glow of the restaurant he and Oy entered a zone of brilliant white light and charred pungent cookery Steam billowed against his face hot and wet the jungle perhaps setting the stage for what followed the mighty jungle perhaps not His vision cleared as his pupils shrank and he saw he was in the Dixie Pigs kitchen Not for the first time either Once not too long before the coming of the Wolves to Calla Bryn Sturgis Jake had followed Susannah only then shed have been Mia into a dream where shed been searching some vast and deserted kitchen for food This kitchen only now the place was bustling with life A huge pig sizzled on an iron spit over an open fire the flames leaping up through a foodcaked iron grate at every drop of grease To either side were gigantic copperhooded stoves upon which pots nearly as tall as Jake himself fumed Stirring one of these was a grayskinned creature So hideous that Jakes eyes hardly knew how to look at it Tusks rose from eitfier side of its gray heavylipped mouth Dewlapped cheeks hung in great warty swags of flesh The fact that the creature was wearing foodstained cooks whites and a puffy popcorn chefs toque somehow finished the nightmare sealed it beneath a coat of varnish Beyond this apparition nearly lost in the steam two other creatures dressed in whites were washing dishes side by side at a double sink Both wore neckerchiefs One was human a boy of perhaps seventeen The other appeared to be some sort of monster housecat on legs Vai vai los mostros pubes tre cannits en fauns the tusked chef screeched at the washerboys It hadnt noticed Jake One of themthe catdid It laid back its ears and hissed Without thinking Jake threw the Oriza hed been holding in his right hand It sang across the steamy air and sliced through the catthings neck as smoothly as a knife through a cake of lard The head toppled into the sink with a sudsy splash the green eyes still blazing San fai can dit los cried the chef He seemed either unaware of what had happened or was unable to grasp it He turned to Jake The eyes beneath his sloping crenellated forehead were a bleary bluegray the eyes of a sentient being Seen headon Jake realized what it was some kind of freakish intelligent warthog Which meant it was cooking its own kind That seemed perfectly fitting in the Dixie Pig Can foh pube aintet can fah Sheso pan Vai This was addressed to Jake And then just to make the lunacy complete And eef you wond scrub dond even stard The other washboy the human one was screaming some sort of warning but the chef paid no attention The chef seemed to believe that Jake having killed one of his helpers was now duty and honorbound to take the dead cats place Jake flung the other plate and it sheared through the warthogs neck putting an end to its blabber Perhaps a gallon of blood flew onto the stovetop to the things right sizzling and sending up a horrible charred smell The warthogs head slewed to the left on its neck and then tilted backward but didnt come off The beingit was easily seven feet talltook two staggersteps to its left and embraced the sizzling pig turning on its spit The head tore loose a little further now lying on Chef Warthogs right shoulder one eye glaring up at the steamwreathed fluorescent lights The heat sealed the cooks hands to the roast and they began to melt Then the thing fell forward into the open flames and its tunic caught fire Jake whirled from this in time to see the other potboy advancing on him with a butcher knife in one hand and a cleaver in the other Jake grabbed another Riza from the bag but held his throw in spite of the voice in his head that was yammering for him to go on go on and do it give the bastard what hed once heard Margaret Eisenhart refer to as a deep haircut This term had made the other Sisters of the Plate laugh hard Yet as much as he wanted to throw he held his hand What he saw was a young man whose skin was a pallid yellowishgray under the brilliant kitchen lights He looked both terrified and malnourished Jake raised the plate in warning and the young man stopped It wasnt the Riza he was looking at however but Oy who stood between Jakes feet The bumblers fur was bushed out around his body seeming to double his size and his teeth were bared Do youJake began and then the door to the restaurant burst open One of the low men rushed in Jake threw the plate without hesitation It moaned through the steamy brilliant air and took off the intruders head with gory precision just above the Adams apple The headless body bucked first to the left and then to the right like a stage comic accepting a round of applause with a whimsical move and then collapsed Jake had another plate in each hand almost immediately his arms once more crossed over his chest in the position sai Eisenhart called the load He looked at the washerboy who was still holding the knife and the cleaver Without much threat however Jake thought He tried again and this time got the whole question out Do you speak English Yar the boy said He dropped the cleaver so he could hold ne waterreddened thumb and its matching forefinger about a qviarter of an inch apart Bout just a liddle I learn since I come over here He opened his other hand and the knife joined the cleaver on the kitchen floor Do you come from MidWorld Jake asked You do dont you He didnt think the washerboy was terribly bright No quizkid Elmer Chambers would no doubt have sneered but he was at least smart enough to be homesick in spite of his terror Jake saw an unmistakable flash of that look in the boys eyes Yar he said Come from Ludweg me Near the city of Lud North of there if you do like it or if you dont said the washerboy Willee kill me lad I dont want to die sad as I am I wont be the one to kill you if you tell me the truth Did a woman come through here The washerboy hesitated then said Aye Sayre and his closies had er She us out on her feet that un head all lollin He demonstrated rolling his head on his neck and looking more like the village idiot than ever Jake thought of Sheemie in Rolands tale of his Mejis days But not dead Nar I hurt her breevin me Jake looked toward the door but no one came through Yet He should go but Whats your name cully Jochabim that be I son of Hossa Well listen Jochabim theres a world outside this kitchen called New York City and pubes like you are free I suggest you get out while you have an opportunity Theyd just bring me back and stripe me No you dont understand how big it is Like Lud when Lud was He looked at Jochabims dulleyed face and thought No Im the one who doesnt understand And if I hang around here trying to convince him to desert Ill no doubt get just what I The door leading to the restaurant popped open again This time two low men tried to come through at once and momentarily jammed together shoulder to shoulder Jake threw both of his plates and watched them crisscross in the steamy air beheading both newcomers just as they burst through They fell backward and once more the door swung shut At Piper School Take had learned about the Battle of Thermopylae where the Greeks had held off a Persian army that had outnumbered them ten to one The Greeks had drawn the Persians into a narrow mountain pass he had this kitchen door As long as they kept coming through by ones and twosas they must unless they could flank him somehowhe could pick them off At least until he ran out of Orizas Guns he asked Jochabim Are there guns here Jochabim shook his head but given the young mans irritating look of density it was hard to tell if this meant No guns in the kitchen or dont ken you All right Im going he said And if you dont go yourself while youve got a chance Jochabim youre an even bigger fool than you look Which would be saying a lot There are video games out there kidthink about it Jochabim continued giving Jake the dnh look however and Jake gave up He was about to speak to Oy when someone spoke to him through the door Hey kid Rough Confidential Knowing The voice of a man who could hit you for five or sleep with your girlfriend any time he liked Jake thought Your friend the faddahs dead In fact the faddahs dinnah You come out now with no more nonsense maybe you can avoid being dessert Turn it sideways and stick it up your ass Jake called This got through even Jochabims wall of stupidity he looked shocked Last chance said the rough and knowing voice Come on out Come on in Jake countered Ive got plenty of plates Indeed he felt a lunatic urge to rush forward bang through the door and take the battle to the low men and women in the restaurant dining room on the other side Nor was the idea all that crazy as Roland himself would have known it was the last thing theyd expect and there was at least an even chance he could panic them with half a dozen quickly thrown plates and start a rout The problem was the monsters that had been feeding behind the tapestry The vampires Theyd not panic and Jake knew it He had an idea that if the Grandfathers had been able to come into the kitchen or perhaps it was just lack of interest that kept them in the dining roomthat and the last scraps of the Peres corpse he would be dead already Jochabim as well quite likely He dropped to one knee murmured Oy find Susannah and reinforced the command with a quick mental picture The bumbler gave Jochabim a final distrustful look then began to nose about on the floor The tiles were damp from a recent mopping and Jake was afraid the bumbler wouldnt be able to find the scent Then Oy gave a single sharp crymore dogs bark than humans wordand began to hurry down the center of the kitchen between the stoves and the steam tables nose low to the ground only going out of his way long enough to skirt Chef Warthogs smoldering body Listen to me you little bastard cried the low man outside the door Im losing patience with you Good Jake cried Come on in Lets see if you go back out again He put his finger to his lips in a shushing gesture while looking at Jochabim He was about to turn and runhe had no idea how long it would be before the washerboy yelled through the door that the kid and his billybumbler were no longer holding Thermopylae Passwhen Jochabim spoke to him in a low voice that was little more than a whisper What Jake asked looking at him uncertainly It sounded as if the kid had said mind the mindtrap but that made no sense Did it Mind the mindtrap Jochabim said this time much more clearly and turned away to his pots and sudsy water What mindtrap Jake asked but Jochabim affected not to hear and Jake couldnt stay long enough to crossexamine him He ran to catch up with Oy throwing glances back over his shoulder If a couple more of the low men burst into the kitchen Jake wanted to be the first to know But none did at least not before he had followed Oy through another door and into the restaurants pantry a dim room stacked high with boxes and smelling of coffee and spices It was like the storeroom behind the East Stoneham General Store only cleaner TWO There was a closed door in the corner of the Dixie Pigs pantry Beyond it was a tiled stairway leading down God only knew how far It was lit by lowwattage bulbs behind bleary flyspotted glass shades Oy started down without hesitation descending with a kind of bobbing frontendbackend regularity that was pretty comical He kept his nose pressed to the stairs and Jake knew he was onto Susannah he could pick it up from his litde friends mind Jake tried counting the stairs made it as far as a hundred and twenty then lost his grip on the numbers He wondered if they were still in New York or under it Once he thought he heard a faint familiar rumbling and decided that if that was a subway train they were Finally they reached the bottom of the stairs Here was a wide vaulted area that looked like a gigantic hotel lobby only without the hotel Oy made his way across it snout still low to the ground his squiggle of a tail wagging back and forth Jake had to j og in order to keep up Now that they no longer filled the bag the Rizas jangled back and forth There was a kiosk on the far side of the lobbyvault with a sign in one dusty window reading LAST CHANCE FOR NEW YORK SOUVENIRS and another reading VISIT SEPTEMBER  OO TIX STILL AVAILABLE FOR THIS WONDERFUL EVENT ASTHMATICS PROHIBITED WO DRs CERTIFICATE Jake wondered what was so fabulous about September  th of  and then decided that maybe he didnt want to know Suddenly as loud in his head as a voice spoken directly into his ear Hey Hey Positronics lady You still there Jake had no idea who the Positronics lady might be but he recognized the voice asking the question Susannah he shouted coming to a stop near the tourist kiosk A surprised joyful grin creased his strained face and made it a kids again Suze are you there And heard her cry out in happy surprise Oy realizing that Jake was no longer following close behind turned and gave an impatient AkeAke cry For the moment at least Jake disregarded him I hear you he shouted Finally God whove you been talking to Keep yelling so I can home in on y From behind himperhaps at the top of the long staircase perhaps already on itsomeone yelled Thats him There were gunshots but Jake barely heard them To his intense horror something had crawled inside his head Something like a mental hand He thought it was probably the low man who had spoken to him through the door The low mans hand had found dials in some kind of Jake Chambers Dogan and was fiddling with them Trying to freeze me freeze me in place freeze my feet right to the floor to stop him And that voice had gotten in because while he was sending and receiving he was open Jake fake where are you There was no time to answer her Once while trying to open the unfound door in the Cave of Voices Jake had summoned a vision of a million doors opening wide Now he summoned one of them slamming shut creating a sound like Gods own sonic boom Just in time too For a moment longer his feet remained stuck to the dusty floor and then something screamed in agony and pulled back from him Let him go Jake got moving jerkily at first then picking up steam God that had been close Very faintly he heard Susannah call his name again but didnt dare throw himself open enough to reply Hed just have to hope that Oy would hold onto her scent and that she would keep sending THREE He decided later that he must have started singing the song from Mrs Shaws radio shortly after Susannahs final faint cry but there was no way of telling for sure One might as well try to pinpoint the genesis of a headache or the exact moment one consciously realizes he is coming down with a cold What Jake was sure of was that there were more gunshots and once the buzzing whine of a ricochet but all that was a good distance behind and finally he didnt bother ducking anymore or even looking back Besides Oy was moving fast now really shucking those furry little buns of his Buried machinery thumped and wheezed Steel rails surfaced in the passageway floor leading Jake to assume that once a tram or some other kind of shuttle had run here At regular intervals official communiques PATRICIA AHEAD FEDIC DO YOU HAVE YOUR BLUE PASS were printed on the walls In some places the tiles had fallen off in others the tramrails were gone and in several spots puddles of ancient verminous water filled what looked for all the world like potholes Jake and Oy passed two or three stalled vehicles that resembled a cross between golfcarts and flatcars They also passed a turnipheaded robot that flashed the dim red bulbs of its eyes and made a single croaking sound that might have been halt Jake raised one of the Orizas having no idea if it could do any good against such a thing if it came after him but the robot never moved That single dim flash seemed to have drained the last few ergs in its batteries or energy cells or atomic slug or whatever it ran on Here and there he saw graffiti Two were familiar The first was ALL HAIL THE CRIMSON KING with the red eye above each of the Is in the message The other read BANGO SKANK  Man Jake thought distractedly that guy Bango gets around And then heard himself clearly for the first time singing under his breath Not words exactly but just an old barely remembered refrain from one of the songs on Mrs Shaws kitchen radio Awimeweh awimeweh aweeeummmimmmoweh He quit it creeped out by the muttery talismanic quality of the chant and called for Oy to stop Need to take a leak boy Oy Cocked ears and bright eyes providing the rest of the message Dont take too long Jake sprayed urine onto one of the tile walls Greenish dreck was seeping between the squares He also listened for the sound of pursuit and was not disappointed How many back there What sort of posse Roland probably would have known but Jake had no idea The echoes made it sound like a regiment As he was shaking off it came to Jake Chambers that the Pere would never do this again or grin at him and point his finger or cross himself before eating They had killed him Taken his life Stopped his breath and pulse Save perhaps for dreams die Pere was now gone from the story Jake began to cry Like his smile the tears made him once again look like a child Oy had turned around eager to be off on the scent but now looked back over one shoulder with an expression of unmistakable concern sall right Jake said buttoning his fly and then wiping his cheeks with the heel of his hand Only it wasnt all right He was more than sad more than angry more than scared about the low men running relendessly up his backtrail Now that the adrenaline in his system had receded he realized he was hungry as well as sad Tired too TiredVerging on exhaustion He couldnt remember when hed last slept Being sucked through the door into New York he could remember that and Oy almost being hit by a taxi and the Godbomb minister with the name that reminded him of Jimmy Cagney playing George M Cohan in that old blackandwhite movie hed watched on the TV in his room when he was small Because he realized now there had been a song in that movie about a guy named Harrigan HAdouble RI Harrigan thats me He could remember those things but not when hed last eaten a square Ake Oy barked relentless as fate If bumblers had a breaking point Jake thought wearily Oy was still a long way from his AkeAke Yeahyeah he agreed pushing away from the wall Ake Ake will now runrun Go on Find Susannah He wanted to plod but plodding would quite likely not be good enough Mere walking either He flogged his legs into a jog and once more began to sing under his breath this time the words to the song In the jungle the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight In the jungle the quiet jungle the lion sleeps tonight ohhh And then he was off again wimeweh wimeweh luimeweh nonsense words from the kitchen radio that was always tuned to the oldies on WCBS only werent memories of some movie wound around and into his memory of this particular song Not a song from Yankee Doodle Dandy but from some other movie One with scary monsters Something hed seen when he was just a little kid maybe not even out of his clouts diapers Near the village the quiet village the lion sleeps tonight Near the village the peaceful village the lion sleeps tonight HUHoh awimeweh awimeweh He stopped breathing hard rubbing his side He had a stitch there but it wasnt bad at least not yet hadnt sunk deep enough to stop him But that goo that greenish goo dribbling between the tiles it was oozing through the ancient grout and busted ceramic because this was the jungle deep below the city deep like catacombs wimeweh or like Oy he said speaking through chapped lips Christ he was so thirsty Oy this isnt goo this is grass Or weeds or Oy barked his friends name but Jake hardly noticed The echoing sound of the pursuers continued had drawn a bit closer in fact but for the time being he ignored them as well Grass growing out of the tiled wall Overwhelming the wall He looked down and saw more grass a brilliant green that was almost purple beneath the fluorescent lights growing out of the floor And bits of broken tile crumbling into shards and fragments like remains of the old people the ancestors who had lived and built before the Beams began to break and the world began to move on He bent down Reached into the grass Brought up sharp shards of tile yes but also earth the earth of the jungle some deep catacomb or tomb or perhaps There was a beetle crawling through the dirt hed scooped up a beetle with a red mark on its back like a bloody smile and Jake cast it away with a cry of disgust Mark of the King Say true He came back to himself and realized that he was down on one knee practicing at archaeology like the hero in some old movie while the hounds drew closer on his trail And Oy was looking at him eyes shining with anxiety Ake AkeAke Yeah he said heaving himself to his feet Im coming But Oy what is this place Oy had no idea why he heard anxiety in his kadinhs voice what he saw was the same as before and what he smelled was the same as before her smell the scent the boy had asked him to find and follow And it was fresher now He ran on along its bright brand FOUR Jake stopped again five minutes later shouting Oy Wait up a minute The stitch in his side was back and it was deeper but it still wasnt the stitch that had stopped him Everythinghad changed Or was changing And God help him he thought he knew what it was changing into Above him the fluorescent lights still shone down but the tile walls were shaggy with greenery The air had become damp and humid soaking his shirt and sticking it against his body A beautiful orange butterfly of startling size flew past his wide eyes Jake snatched at it but the butterfly eluded him easily Almost merrily he thought The tiled corridor had become a jungle path Ahead of them it sloped up to a ragged hole in die overgrowth probably some sort of forest clearing Beyond it Jake could see great old trees growing in a mist their trunks thick with moss their branches looped with vines He could see giant spreading ferns and through the green lace of the leaves a burning jungle sky He knew he was under New York must be under New York but What sounded like a monkey chittered so close by that Jake flinched and looked up sure he would see it directly overhead grinning down from behind a bank of lights And then freezing his blood came the heavy roar of a lion One that was most definitely not asleep He was on the verge of retreating and at full speed when he realized he could not the low men probably led by the one whod told him the faddah was dinnah were back that way And Oy was looking at him with brighteyed impatience clearly wanting to go on Oy was no dummy but he showed no signs of alarm at least not concerning what was ahead For his own part Oy still couldnt understand the boys problem He knew the boy was tiredhe could smell thatbut he also knew Ake was afraid Why There were unpleasant smells in this place the smell of many men chief among them but they did not strike Oy as immediately dangerous And besides her smell was here Very fresh now Almost new Ake he yapped again Jake had his breath now All right he said looking around Okay But slow Lo Oy said but even Jake could detect the stunning lack of approval in the bumblers response Jake moved only because he had no other options He walked up the slope of the overgrown trail in Oys perception the way was perfecdy straight and had been ever since leaving the stairs toward the vine and fernfringed opening toward lunatic chitter of the monkey and the testiclefreezing roar of the hunting lion The song circled through his mind again and again in the village in the jungle hush my darling dont stir my darling and now he knew the name of it even the name of the group thats the Tokens with The Lion Sleeps Tonight gone from the charts but not from our hearts that had sung it but what was the movie What was the name of the goddam mo Jake reached the top of the slope and the edge of the clearing He looked through an interlacing of broad green leaves and brilliant purple flowers a tiny green worm was journeying into the heart of one and as he looked the name of the movie came to him and his skin broke out in gooseflesh from the nape of his neck all the way down to his feet A moment later the first dinosaur came out of the jungle the mighty jungle and walked into the clearing FIVE Once upon a time long ago far and wee when he was just a little lad theres some for you and some for me once upon a time when mother went to Montreal with her art club and father went to Vegas for the annual unveiling of the fall shows blackberryjam and blackberry tea once upon a time when Bama was four SIX Bamas what the only good one Mrs Shaw Mrs Greta Shaw calls him She cuts the crusts off his sandwiches she puts his nursieschool drawings on the fridge with magnets that look like little plastic fruits she calls him Bama and thats a special name to him to them because his father taught him one drunk Saturday afternoon to chant Go wide go wide roll you Tide we dont run and we dont hide were the Bama Crimson Tide and so she calls him Bama its a secret name and how they know what it means and no one else does is like having a house you can go into a safe house in the scary woods where outside the shadows all look like monsters and ogres and tigers Tyger tyger burning bright his mother sings to him for this is her idea of a lullabye along with I heard a fly buzz when I died which gives Bama Chambers a terrible case of the creeps although he never tells her he lies in bed sometimes at night and sometimes during afternoon naptime thinking will hear a fly and it will be my deathfly my heart will stop and my tongue will fall down my throat like a stone down a well and these are the memories he denies It is good to have a secret name and ivhen he finds out mother is going to Montreal for the sake of art and father is going to Vegas to help present the Networks new shows at the Upfronts he begs his mother to ask Mrs Greta Shaw to stay with him and finally his mother gives in Little Jakie knoivs Mrs Shaw is not mother and on more than one occasion Mrs Greta Shaw herself has told him she is not mother I hope you know Im not your mother Bama she says giving him a plate and on the plate is a peanut butter bacon and banana sandwich with the crusts cut off as only Greta Shaw knoivs how to cut them off because that is not in my job description And Jakieonly hes Bama here hes Bama between themdoesnt know exactly how to tell her he knows that knows that knows that but he II make do with her until the real thing comes along or until he grows old enough to get over his fear of the Deathfly And Jakie says Dont worry Im okay but he is still glad Mrs Shaw agrees to stay instead of the latest au pair who wears short skirts and is ahoays playing with her hair and her lipstick and doesnt care jackshit about him and doesnt know that in his secret heart he is Bama and boy that little Daisy Mae which is what his father calls all the au pairs is stupid stupid stupid Mrs Shaw isnt stupid Mrs Shaw gives him a snack she sometimes calls Afternoon Tea or even High Tea and no matter what it iscottage cheese and fruit a sandwich with the crusts cut off custard and cake leftover canapes from a cocktail party the night beforeshe sings the same little song when she lays it out A little snack thats far and wee theres some for you and some for me blackberry jam and blackberry tea There is a TV is his room and every day while his folks are gone he takes his afterschool snack in there and ivatches watches watches and he hears her radio in the kitchen always the oldies always WCBS and sometimes he hears her hears Mrs Greta Shaw singing along with the Four Seasons Wanda Jackson Lee YahYah Dorsey and sometimes he pretends his folks die in a plane crash and she somehow does become his mother and she calls him poor little lad and poor little lost tyke and then by virtue of some magical transformation she loves him instead of just taking care of him loves him loves him loves him the way he loves her shes his mother or maybe his wife he is unclear about the difference between the two but she calls him Bama instead ofsugarlove his real mother or hotshot his father and although he knows the idea is stupid thinking about it in bed is fun thinking about it beats the penispiss out of thinking about the Deathfly that would come and buzz over his corpse when he died with his tongue down his throat like a stone down a well In the afternoon when he gets home from nursieschool by the time hes old enough to know its actually nursery school he will be out of it he watches Million Dollar Movie in his room On Million Dollar Movie they show exactly the same movie at exactly the same timefour oclockevery day for a week The week before his parents went away and Mrs Greta Shaw stayed the night instead of going home O what bliss for Mrs Greta Shaw negates Discordia can you say amen there was music from two directions every day there were the oldies in the kitchen WCBS can you say Godbomb and on the TV James Cagney is strutting in a derby and singing about HarriganHAdouble RI Harrigan thats me Also the one about being a real live nephew of my Uncle Sam Then its a new week the week his folks are gone and a new movie and the first time he sees it it scares the living breathing shit out of him This movie is called The Lost Continent and it stars Mr Cesar Romero and when Jake sees it again at the advanced age often he will wonder how he could ever have been afraid of such a stupid movie as that one Because its about explorers who get lost in the jungle see and there are dinosaurs in the jungle and at four years of age he didnt realize the dinosaurs were nothing but fucking CARTOONS no different from Tweety and Sylvester and Popeye the Sailor Man uckuckuck cany a say Wimpy can you give me Olive Oyl The first dinosaur he sees is a triceratops that comes blundering out of the jungle and the girl explorer Bodacious tatas his father would undoubtedly have said its what his father always says about what Jakes mother calls A Certain Type Of Girl screams her lungs out and Jake luould scream too if he could but his chest is locked down with terror o here is Discordia incarnate In the monsters eyes he sees the utter nothing that means the end of everything for pleading wont work with such a monster and screaming wont work with such a monster its too dumb all screaming does is attract the monsters attention and does it turns toward the Daisy Mae with the bodacious tatas and then it charges the Daisy Mae with the bodacious tatas and in the kitchen the mighty kitchen he hears the Tokens gone from the charts but not from our hearts they are singing about the jungle the peaceful jungle and here in front of the little boys huge horrified eyes is a jungle which is anything but peaceful and its not a lion but a lumbering thing that looks sort of like a rhinoceros only bigger and it has a kind of bone collar around its neck and later Jake will find out you call this kind of monster a triceratops but for now it is nameless which makes it even worse nameless is worse Wimeioeh sing the Tokens Weeeummmaweh and of course Cesar Romero shoots the monster just before it can tear the girl with the bodacious tatas limb from limb which is good at the time but that night the monster comes back the triceratops comes back its in his closet because even at four he understands that sometimes his closet isnt his closet that its door can open on different places where there are worse things waiting He begins to scream at night he can scream and Mrs Greta Shaw comes into the room She sits on the edge of his bed her face ghostly with bluegray beautymud and she asks him whats wrong Bama and he is actually able to tell her He could never have told his father or mother had one of them been there to begin with which they of course aren  but he can tell Mrs Shaw because while she isnt a lot different from the other helpthe au pairs babysitters child minders schoolwalkersshe is a little different enough to put his drawings on the fridge with the little magnets enough to make all the difference to hold up the tower of a silly little boys sanity say hallelujah say found not lost say amen She listens to everything he has to say nodding and makes him say triCERaTOPS until finally he gets it right Getting it right is better And then she says Those things were real once but they died out a hundred million years ago Bama Maybe even more Now dont bother me any more because I need my sleep Jake watches The Lost Continent on Million Dollar Movie every day that week Every time he watches it it scares him a little less Once Mrs Greta Shaw comes in and watches part of it with him She brings him his snack a big bowl of Hawaiian Fluff also one for herself and sings him her wonderful little song A little snack thats far and wee theres some for you and some for me blackberry jam and blackberry tea There are no blackberries in Hawaiian Fluff of course and they have the last of the Welchs Grape Juice to go with it instead of tea but Mrs Greta Shaw says it is the thought that counts She has taught him to say Rootytootysalutie before they drink and to clink glasses Jake thinks thats the absolute coolest the cats ass Pretty soon the dinosaurs come Bama and Mrs Greta Shaw sit side by side eating Hawaiian Fluff and watching as a big one Mrs Greta Shaw says you call that kind a Tyrannasorbet Wrecks eats the bad explorer Cartoon dinosaurs Mrs Greta Shaw sniffs Wouldnt you think they could do better than thatAs far as Jake is concerned this is the most brilliant piece of film criticism he has ever heard in his life Brilliant and useful Eventually his parents come back Top Hat enjoys a weeks run on Million Dollar Movie and littleJakies night terrors are never mentioned Eventually he forgets his fear of the triceratops and the Tyrannasorbet SEVEN Now lying in the high green grass and peering into the misty clearing from between the leaves of a fern Jake discovered that some things you neveriorgot Mind the mindtrap Jochabim had said and looking down at the lumbering dinosaura cartoon triceratops in a real jungle like an imaginary toad in a real gardenJake realized that this was it This was the mindtrap The triceratops wasnt real no matter how fearsomely it might roar no matter that Jake could actually smell itthe rank vegetation rotting in the soft folds where its stubby legs met its stomach the shit caked to its vast armorplated rear end the endless cud drooling between its tuskedged jawsand hear its panting breath It couldntbe real it was a cartoon for Gods sake And yet he knew it was real enough to kill him If he went down there the cartoon triceratops would tear him apart just as it would have torn apart the Daisy Mae with die bodacious tatas if Cesar Romero hadnt appeared in time to put a bullet into the things One Vulnerable Spot with his biggame hunters rifle Jake had gotten rid of the hand that had tried to monkey with his motor controlshad slammed all those doors so hard hed chopped off the hands intruding fingers for all he knewbut this was different He could not close his eyes and just walk by that was a real monster his traitor mind had created and it could really tear him apart There was no Cesar Romero here to keep it from happening No Roland either There were only the low men running his backtrail and getting closer all the time As if to emphasize this point Oy looked back the way theyd come and barked once piercingly loud The triceratops heard and roared in response Jake expected Oy to shrink against him at that mighty sound but Oy continued to look back over Jakes shoulder It was the low men Oy was worried about not the triceratops below them or the Tyrannasorbet Wrecks that might come next or Because Oy doesnt see it he thought He monkeyed with this idea and couldnt pull it apart Oy hadnt smelled it or heard it either The conclusion was inescapable to Oy the terrible triceratops in the mighty jungle below did not exist Which doesnt change the fact that it does to me Its a trap that was set for me or for anyone else equipped with an imagination who might happen along Some gadget of the old people no doubt Too bad its not broken like most of their other stuff but its not I see what I see and theres nothing I can do about i No wait Wait just a second Jake had no idea how good his mental connection tp Oy actually was but thought he would soon find out Oy The calling voices of the low men were now horribly close Soon they would see the boy and the bumbler stopped here and break into a charge Oy could smell them coming but looked at Jake calmly enough anyway At his beloved Jake for whom he would die if called upon to do so Oy can you change places with me It turned out that he could EIGHT Oy tottered erect with Ake in his arms swaying back and forth horrified to discover how narrow the boys range of balance was The idea of walking even a short distance on but two legs was terribly daunting yet it would have to be done and done at once Ake said so For his part Jake knew he would have to shut the borrowed eyes he was looking through He was in Oys head but he could still see the triceratops now he could also see a pterodactyl cruising the hot air above the clearing its leathery wings stretched to catch the thermals blowing from the airexchangers Oy You have to do it on your own And if we re going to stay ahead of them you have to do it now Ake Oy responded and took a tentative step forward The boys body wavered from side to side out to the very edge of balance and then beyond Akes stupid twolegs body tumbled sideways Oy tried to save it and only made the tumble worse going down on the boys right side and bumping Akes furry head Oy tried to bark his frustration What came out of Akes mouth was a stupid thing that was more word than sound Bark Ark SAifbarkl I hear him someone shouted Run Come on doubletime you useless cunts Before the little bastard gets to the door Akes ears werent keen but with the way the tile walls magnified sounds that was no problem Oy could hear their running footfalls You have to get up and goI Jake tried to yell and what came out was a garbled barking sentence AkeAke affal Up n go Under other circumstances it might have been funny but not under these Oy got up by putting Akes back against the wall and pushing with Akes legs At last he was getting the hang of the motor controls they were in a place Ake called Dogan and were fairly simple Off to the left however an arched corridor led into a huge room filled with mirrorbright machinery Oy knew that if he went into that placethe chamber where Ake kept all his marvelous thoughts and his store of wordshe would be lost forever Luckily he didnt need to Everything he needed was in the Dogan Left foot forward And pause Right foot forward Andpause Hold die thing that looks like a billybumbler but is really your friend and use the other arm for balance Resist the urge to drop to all fours and crawl The pursuers will catch up if he does that he can no longer smell them not Akes amazingly stupid little bulb of a snout but he is sure of it all the same For his part Jake could smell them clearly at least a dozen and maybe as many as sixteen Their bodies were perfect engines of stink and they pushed the aroma ahead of them in a dirty cloud He could smell the asparagus one had had for dinner could smell the meaty wrong aroma of the cancer which was growing in another probably in his head but perhaps in his throat Then he heard the triceratops roar again It was answered by the birdthing riding the air overhead Jake closed hiswell Oyseyes In the dark the bumblers sidetoside motion was even worse Jake was concerned that if he had to put up with much of it especially with his eyes shut he would ralph his guts out Just call him Bama the Seasick Sailor Go Oy he thought Fast as you can Dont fall down again but fast as you can NINE Had Eddie been there he might have been reminded of Mrs Mislaburski from up the block Mrs Mislaburski in February after a sleet storm when the sidewalk was glazed with ice and not yet salted down But ice or no ice she would not be kept from her daily chop or bit offish at the Castle Avenue Market or from mass on Sunday for Mrs Mislaburski was perhaps the most devout Catholic in CoOp City So here she came thick legs spread candypink in their support hose one arm clutching her purse to her immense bosom the other held out for balance head down eyes searching for the islands of ashes where some responsible building super had already been out Jesus and Mother Mary bless those good men also for the treacherous patches that would defeat her that would send her whoopsy with her large pink knees flying apart and down shed come on her situpon or maybe on her back a woman could break her spine a woman could be paralyzed like poor Mrs Bernsteins daughter that was in the car accident in Mamaroneck such things happened And so she ignored the catcalls of the children Henry Dean and his little brother Eddie often among them and went on her way head down arm outstretched for balance sturdy black old ladys purse curled to her midsection determined that if she did go whoopsymydaisy she would protect her purse and its contents at all costs would fall on it like Joe Namath falling on the football after a sack So did Oy of MidWorld walk the body of Jake along a stretch of underground corridor that looked to him at least pretty much like all the rest The only difference he could see was the three holes on either side with big glass eyes looking out of them eyes that made a low and constant humming sound In his arms was something that looked like a bumbler with its eyes squeezed tightly shut Had they been open Jake might have recognized these things as projecting devices More likely he would not have seen them at all Walking slowly Oy knew they were gaining but he also knew that walking slowly was better than falling down legs spread wide and shuffling along holding Ake curled to his chest just as Mrs Mislaburski had held her purse on those icy days he made his way past the glass eyes The hum faded Was it far enough He hoped so Walking like a human was simply too hard too nervewracking So was being close to all of Akes thinking machinery He felt an urge to turn and look at itall those bright mirror surfacesbut didnt To look might well bring on hypnosis Or something worse He stopped Jake Look See Jake tried to reply Okay and barked instead Pretty funny He cautiously opened his eyes and saw tiled wall on both sides There was grass and tiny sprays of fern still growing out of it true enough but it was tile It was corridor He looked behind him and saw the clearing The triceratops had forgotten them It was locked in a battle to the death with the Tyrannasorbet a scene he recalled with complete clarity from The Lost Continent The girl with the bodacious tatas had watched the battle from the safety of Cesar Romeros arms and when the cartoon Tyrannasorbet had clamped its huge mouth over the triceratopss face in a deathbite the girl had buried her own face against Cesar Romeros manly chest OyJake barked but barking was lame and he switched to thinking instead Change back with me Oy was eager to complynever had he wanted anything so muchbut before they could effect the swap the pursuers caught sight of them Theah shouted the one with the Boston accenthe who had proclaimed that the Faddahwas dinnah Theah they aah Get em Shoot em And as Jake and Oy switched their minds back into their proper bodies the first bullets began to flick the air around them like snapping fingers TEN The fellow leading the pursuers was a man named Flaherty Of the seventeen of them he was the only hume The rest save one were low men and vampires The last was a taheen with the head of an intelligent stoat and a pair of huge hairy legs protruding from Bermuda shorts Below the legs were narrow feet that ended in brutally sharp thorns A single kick from one of Lamias feet could cut a fullgrown man in half Flahertyraised in Boston for the last twenty years one of the Kings men in a score of latetwentiethcentury New Yorkshad put together his posse as fast as he could in a nerveroasting agony of fear and fury Nothing gets into the Pig That was what Sayre had told Meiman And anything that did get in was not under any circumstances to be allowed out That went double for the gunslinger or any of his katet Their meddling had long since passed the merely annoying stage and you didnt have to be one of the elite to know it But now Meiman who had been called the Canary by his few friends was dead and the kid had somehow gotten past them A kidfor Gods love A fucking kid But how were they to know that the two of them would have such a powerful totem as that turtle If the damn thing hadnt happened to bounce beneath one of the tables it might be holding them in place still Flaherty knew it was true but also knew that Sayre would never accept it as a valid argument Would not even give him Flaherty a chance to put it forward No he would be dead long before that and the others as well Sprawled on the floor with the doctorbugs gorging on their blood It was easy to say that the kid would be stopped at the door that he wouldntcouldntknow any of the authorization phrases that opened it but Flaherty no longer trusted such ideas tempting as they might be All bets were off and Flaherty felt a soaring sense of relief when he saw the kid and his furry little pal stopped up ahead Several of the posse fired but missed Flaherty wasnt surprised There was some sort of green area between them and the kid a fucking swatch of jungle under the city was what it looked like and a mist was rising making it hard to aim Plus some kind of ridiculous cartoon dinosaurs One of them raised its bloodsmeared head and roared at them holding its tiny forepaws against its scaly chest Looks like a dragon Flaherty thought and before his eyes the cartoon dinosaur becameA dragon It roared and spewed a jet of fire that set several dangling vines and a mat of hanging moss to burning The kid meanwhile was on the move again Lamia the stoatheaded taheen pushed his way to the forefront and raised one furred fist to his forehead Flaherty returned the salute impatiently Whats down theah Lam Do you know Flaherty himself had never been below the Pig When he traveled on business it was always between New Yorks which meant using either the door on Fortyseventh Street between First and Second the one in the eternally empty warehouse on Bleecker Street only in some worlds that one was an eternally halfcompleted building or the one way uptown on Ninetyfourth Street The last was now on the blink much of the time and of course nobody knew how to fix it There were doors in the cityNew York was lousy with portals to other wheres and whensbut those were the only ones that still worked And the one to Fedic of course The one up ahead Tis a miragemaker the stoatthing said Its voice was wet and rumbling and very far from human Yon machine trolls for what ye fear and makes it real Sayre wouldve turned it on when he and his tet passed with the blackskin jilly To keep is backtrail safe ye do ken Flaherty nodded A mindtrap Very clever Yet how good was it really Somehow the cursed shitting boy had passed hadnt he Whatever the boy saw will turn into what we fear the taheen said It works on imagination Imagination Flaherty seized on the word Fine Whatevah they see down theah tell em to just ignore it He raised an arm to motion his men onward greatly relieved by what Lam had told him Because they had to press the chase didnt they Sayre or Walter o Dim who was even worse would very likely kill die lot of diem if they failed to stop yon snotbabby And Flaherty really didear die idea of dragons that was die odier uiing had ever since his fadier had read him a story about such when he was a boy The taheen stopped him before he could complete the letsgo gesture What now Lam Flaherty snarled You dont understand Whats down there is real enough to kill you To kill all of us What do you see then This was no time to be curious but that had always been Conor Flahertys curse Lamia lowered his head I dont like to say Tis bad enough The point is sai well die down there if were not careful What happened to you might look like a stroke or a heart attack to a cutemup man but twould be whatever you see down there Anyone who doesnt diink die imagination can kill is a fool  The rest had gathered behind the taheen now They were alternating glances into the hazy clearing with looks at Lamia Flaherty didnt like what he saw on their faces not a bit Rilling one or two of those least willing to veil their sullen eyes might restore the enthusiasm of the rest but what good would that do if Lamia was right Cursed old people always leaving their toys behind Dangerous toys How they complicated a mans life A pox on every last one Then how do we get past Flaherty cried For that mattah how did the brat get past Dunno about the brat Lamia said but all we need to do is shoot the projectors What shitting projectors Lamia pointed below or along the course of the corridor if what the ugly bastard said was true There Lam said I know you cant see em but take my word for it theyre there Either side Flaherty was watching with a certain fascination as Jakes mistyjungle clearing continued to change before his eyes into the deep dark forest as in Once upon a time when everyone lived in the deep dark forest and nobody lived anywhere else a dragon came to rampage Flaherty didnt know what Lamia and the rest of them were seeing but before his eyes the dragon which had been a Tyrannasorbet Wrecks not so long ago obediently rampaged setting trees on fire and looking for little Catholic boys to eat I see NOTHING he shouted at Lamia I think youah out of your shitting MIND Ive seen em turned off Lamia said quietly and can recall near about where they lie If youll let me bring up four men and set em shooting on either side I dont believe it will take long to shut em down And what will Sayre say when I tell him we shot the hell out of his precious mindtrapFlaherty could have said What will Walter o Dim say for that mattah For whats roont can never be fixed not by such as us who know hmu to rub two sticks together and make afire but not much more Could have said but didnt Because getting the boy was more important than any antique gadget of the old people even one as amazing as yon mindtrap And Sayre was the one who turned it on wasnt he Say aye If there was explaining to be done let Sayre do it Let him make his knee to the big boys and talk till they shut him up Meanwhile the godsdamned snotbabby continued to rebuild the lead that Flaherty whod had visions of being honored for stepping so promptly into the breach and his men had so radically reduced If only one of them had been lucky enough to hit the kid when he and his little furbag friend had been in view Ah but wish in one hand shit in the other See which one fills up first Bring youah best shots Flaherty said in his Back BayJohn F Kennedy accent Have at it Lamia ordered three low men and one of the vamps forward put two on each side and talked to them rapidly in another language Flaherty gathered that a couple of them had already been down here and like Lam remembered about where the projectors lay hidden in the walls Meanwhile Flahertys dragonor more properly speaking his das dragoncontinued to rampage in the deep dark forest the jungle was completely gone now and set things on fire At lastalthough it seemed a very long time to Flaherty it was probably less than thirty secondsthe sharpshooters began to fire Almost immediately both forest and dragon paled before Flahertys eyes turned into something that looked like overexposed movie footage Thats one of em cullies Lamia yelled in a voice that became unfortunately ovine when it was raised Pour it on Pour it on for the love of your fathers Half this crew probably never had such a thing Flaherty thought morosely Then came the clearly audible shattersound of breaking glass and the dragon froze in place with billows of flame issuing from its mouth and nostrils as well as from the gills on the sides of its armored throat Encouraged the sharpshooters began firing faster and a few moments later the clearing and the frozen dragon both disappeared Where they had been was only more tiled hallway with the tracks of those who had recently passed diis way marking the dust On either side were the shattered projector portals All right Flaherty yelled after giving Lamia an approving nod Now were going after the kid and were going to doubletime it and were going to catch him and were going to bring him back with his head on a stick Are you with me They roared savage agreement none louder than Lamia whose eyes glowed the same baleful yelloworange as the dragons breath Good then Flaherty set off roaring a tune any Marine drillcorps would have recognized We dont care how far you run WE DONT CARE HOW FAR YOU RUN they bawled back as they trotted four abreast through the place where Jakes jungle had been Their feet crunched in the shattered glass Well bring you back before were done WEll BRING YOU BACK BEFORE WRE DONE You can run to Cain or Lud YOU CAN RUN TO CAIN OR LUD Well eat your balls and drink your blood They called it in return and Flaherty picked lip tile pace yet a little more ELEVEN Jake heard them coming again comecomecommala Heard them promising to eat his balls and drink his blood Brag brag brag he thought but tried to r un faster anyway He was alarmed to find he couldnt Doing the mindswap with Oy had tired him out quite a little b No Roland had taught him that selfdeception was nothing but pride in disguise an indulgence to be denied Jake had done his best to heed this advice and as a result admitted that being tired no longer described his situation The stitch in his side had grown fangs that had sunk deep into his armpit He knew he had gained on his pursuers he also knew from the shouted cadencechant that they were making up the distance theyd lost Soon they would be shooting at him and Oy again and while men didnt shoot for shit while they were running someone could always get lucky Now he saw something up ahead blocking the corridor A door As he approached it Jake allowed himself to wonder what hed do if Susannah wasnt on the other side Or if she was there but didnt know how to help him Well he and Oy would make a stand that was all No cover no way to reenact Thermopylae Pass this time but hed throw plates and take heads until they brought him down If he needed to that was Maybe he would not Jake pounded toward the door his breath now hot in his throatclose to burningand thought Its just as well I couldnt have run much further anyway Oy got there first He put his front paws on the ghostwood and looked up as if reading the words stamped into the door and the message flashing below them Then he looked back at Jake who came panting up with one hand pressed against his armpit and the remaining Orizas clanging loudly back and forth in their bag NORTH CENTRAL PQITRONICS HDL New YorkFedic Maximum Security VERBAL ENTRY CODE REQUIRED S FINAL DEFAULT He tried the doorknob but that was only a formality When the chilly metal refused to turn in his grip he didnt bother trying again but hammered the heels of both hands against the wood instead Susannah he shouted If youre there let me in Not by the hair of my chinnychinchin he heard his father say and his mother much more gravely as if she knew storytelling was serious business I heard a fly buzz when I died From behind the door there was nothing From behind Jake the chanting voices of the Crimson Kings posse swept closer Susannah he bawled and when there was no answer this time he turned pvit his back to the door hadnt he always known it would end just this way with his back to a locked door and seized an Oriza in each hand Oy stood between his feet and now his fur was bushed out now the velvetysoft skin of his muzzle wrinkled back to show his teeth Jake crossed his arms assuming the load Come on then you bastards he said For Gilead and the Eld For Roland son of Steven For me and Oy At first he was too fiercely concentrated on dying well of taking at least one of them with him the fellow whod told him the Faddahwas dinnahwould be his personal preference and more if he could to realize the voice he was hearing had come from the other side of the door rather than from his own mind Jake Is it really you sugarpie His eyes widened Oh please let it not be a trick If it was Jake reckoned that he would never be played another Susannah theyre coming Do you know how Yes Should still be chassit do you hear me If Nigels right the word should still be cha Jake didnt give her a chance to finish saying it again Now he could see them sweeping toward him running fullout Some waving guns and already shooting into the air Chassit he yelled Chassit for the Tower Open Open you son of a bitch Behind his pressing back the door between New York and Fedic clicked open At the head of the charging posse Flaherty saw it happen uttered the bitterest curse in his lexicon and fired a single bullet He was a good shot and all the force of his not inconsiderable will went with diat particular slug guiding it No doubt it would have punched through Jakes forehead above the left eye entering his brain and ending his life not a strong brownfingered hand seized Jake by the collar at that very moment and yanked him backward through the shrill elevatorshaft whistle that sounds endlessly between the levels of the Dark Tower The bullet buzzed by his head instead of entering it Oy came with him barking his friends name shrilly AkeAke AkeAkeand the door slammed shut behind them Flaherty reached it twenty seconds later and hammered on it until his fists bled when Lamia tried to restrain him Flaherty thrust him back with such ferocity that the taheen went asprawl but there was nothing he could do Hammering did not work cursing did not work nothing worked At the very last minute the boy and the bumbler had eluded them For yet a little while longer the core of Rolands katet remained unbroken ONE See this I do beg ya and see it very well for its one of the most beautiful places that still remain in America Id show you a homely dirt lane running along a heavily wooded switchback ridge in western Maine its north and south ends spilling onto Route about two miles apart Just west of this ridge like a jewelers setting is a deep green dimple in the landscape At the bottom of itthe stone in the settingis Kezar Lake Like all mountain lakes it may change its aspect half a dozen times in the course of a single day for here the weather is beyond prankish you could call it halfmad and be perfectly accurate The locals will be happy to tell you about icecream snow flurries that came to this part of the world once in late August that would be  and once spang on the Glorious Fourth  Theyll be even more delighted to tell you about the tornado that came blasting across the lakes frozen surface in January of  sucking up snow and creating a whirling miniblizzard that crackled with thunder in its middle Hard to believe such crazyjane weather but you could go and see Gary Barker if you dont believe me hes got the pictures to prove it Today the lake at the bottom of the dimple is blacker than homemade sin not just reflecting the thunderheads massing overhead but amplifying their mood Every now and then a splinter of silver streaks across that obsidian lookingglass as lightning stabs out of the clouds overhead The sound of thunder rolls through the congested sky west to east like the wheels of some great stone bucka rolling down an alley in the sky The pines and oaks and birches are still and all the world holds its breath All shadows have disappeared The birds have fallen silent Overhead another of those great waggons rolls its solemn course and in its wakeharkwe hear an engine Soon enough John Cullums dusty Ford Galaxie appears with Eddie Deans anxious face rising behind the wheel and the headlights shining in the premature gathering dark TWO Eddie opened his mouth to ask Roland how far they were going but of course he knew Turtleback Lanes south end was marked by a sign bearing a large black  and each of the driveways splitting off lakeward to their left bore another higher number They caught glimpses of the water through the trees but the houses themselves were below them on the slope and tucked out of sight Eddie seemed to taste ozone and electric grease with every breath he drew and twice patted the hair on the nape of his neck sure it would be standing on end It wasnt but knowing it didnt change the nervous witchy feeling of exhilaration that kept sweeping through him lighting up his solar plexus like an overloaded circuitbreaker and spreading out from there It was the storm of course he just happened to be one of those people who feel them coming along the ends of their nerves But never ones approach as strongly as this Its not all the storm and you know it No of course not Although he thought all those wild volts might somehow have facilitated his contact with Susannah It came and went like the reception you sometimes got from distant radio stations at night but since their meeting with Ye Child of Roderick ye spoiled ye lost Chevin of Chayven it had become much stronger Because this whole part of Maine was thin he suspected and close to many worlds Just as their katet was close to whole again For Jake was with Susannah and the two of them seemed to be safe enough for the time being with a solid door between them and their pursuers Yet there was something ahead of those two as wellsomething Susannah either didnt want to talk about or couldnt make clear Even so Eddie had sensed both her horror of it and her terror that it might come back and he thought he knew what it was Mias baby Which had been Susannahs as well in some way he still didnt fully understand Why an armed woman should be afraid of an infant Eddie didnt know but he was sure that if she was there must be a good reason for it They passed a sign that said FENN I  and another that said ISRAEL  Then they came around a curve and Eddie stamped on the Galaxies brakes bringing the car to a hard and dusty stop Parked at the side of the road beside a sign reading BECKHARDT  was a familiar Ford pickup truck and an even more familiar man leaning nonchalantly against the trucks rustspotted longbed dressed in cuffed bluejeans and an ironed blue chambray shirt buttoned all the way to the closeshaved watded neck He also wore a Boston Red Sox cap tilted just a little to one side as if to say  got the drop on you partner He was smoking a pipe the blue smoke rising and seeming to hang suspended around his seamed and goodhumored face on the breathless prestorm air All this Eddie saw with the clarity of his ampedup nerves aware that he was smiling as you do when you come across an old friend in a strange placethe Pyramids of Egypt the marketplace in old Tangiers maybe an island off the coast of Formosa or Turtleback Lane in Lovell on a thunderstruck afternoon in the summer of  And Roland was also smiling Old long tall and uglysmiling Wonders never ceased it seemed They got out of the car and approached John Cullum Roland raised a fist to his forehead and bent his knee a little Hile John I see you very well Ayuh see you too John Cullum said Clear as day He skimmed a salute outward from beneath the brim of his cap and above the tangle of his eyebrows Then he dipped his chin in Eddies direction Young fella Long days and pleasant nights Eddie said and touched his knuckles to his brow He was not from this world not anymore and it was a relief to give up the pretense Thats a pretty thing to say John remarked Then I beat you here Kinda thought I might Roland looked around at the woods on both sides of the road and at the lane of gathering darkness in the sky above it I dont think this is quite the place In his voice was the barest touch of a question Nope it aint quite the place you want to finish up John agreed puffing his pipe I passed where you want to finish up on mway in and I tell you this if you mean to palaver we better do it here rather than there You go up there you wont be able tdo nawthin but gape I tell you I aint never seen the beat of it For a moment his face shone like the face of a child whos caught his first firefly in ajar and Eddie saw that he meant every word Why he asked Whats up there Is it walkins Or is it a door The idea occurred to him and then seized him It is a door isnt it And its open John began to shake his head then appeared to reconsider Might be a door he said stretching the noun out until it became something luxurious like a sigh at the end of a long hard day doeahh Doesnt exactly look like a door but ayuh Could be Somewhere in that light He appeared to calculate Ayuh But I think you boys want to palaver and if we go up there to Cara Laughs there wont be no palaver just you standin there with your jaws dropped Cullum threw back his head and laughed Me too Whats Cara Laughs Eddie asked John shrugged A lot of folks with lakefront properties name their houses I think its because they pay smuch for em they want a little more back Anyway Caras empty right now Family named McCray from Washington DC owns it but they gut it up for sale Theyve run onto some hard luck Fella had a stroke and she He made a bottletipping motion Eddie nodded There was a great deal about this Towerchasing business he didnt understand but there were also things he knew without asking One was that the core of the walkin activity in this part of the world was the house on Turtleback Lane John Cullum had identified as Cara Laughs And when they got there theyd find the identifying number at the head of the driveway was  He looked up and saw the stormclouds moving steadily west above Kezar Lake West toward the White Mountains toowhat was almost surely called the Discordia in a world not far from hereand along the Path of the Beam Always along the Path of the Beam What do you suggest John Roland asked Cullum nodded at the sign reading BECKHARDT Ive caretook for Dick Beckhardt since the late fifties he said Helluva nice man Hes in Wasinton now doin something with the Carter administration Caaatah I got a key I think maybe we ought to go on down there Its warm n dry and I dont think its gonna be either one out here before long You boys cn tell your tale and I cn listenwhich is a thing I do tolably welland then we can all take a run up to Cara I well I just never He shook his head took his pipe out of his mouth and looked at them with naked wonder I never seen the beat of it I tell you It was like I didnt even know how to look at it Come on Roland said Well all ride down in your cartomobile if it does ya Does me just fine John said and got into the back THREE Dick Beckhardts cottage was half a mile down pinewalled cozy There was a potbellied stove in the living room and a braided rug on the floor The westfacing wall was glass from end to end and Eddie had to stand there for a moment looking out in spite of the urgency of their errand The lake had gone a shade of dead ebony that was somehow frighteninglike the eye of a zombie he thought and had no idea why he thought it He had an idea that if the wind picked up as it would surely do when the rain came the whitecaps would ruffle the surface and make it easier to look at Would take away that look of something looking back at you John Cullum sat at Dick Beckhardts table of polished pine took off his hat and held it in the bunched fingers of his right hand He looked at Roland and Eddie gravely We know each other pretty damn well for folks who havent known each other very damn long he said Wouldnt you say thats so They nodded Eddie kept expecting the wind to begin outside but the world went on holding its breath He was willing to bet it was going to be one hellacious storm when it came Folks gut tknow each other that way in the Army John said In the war Aaamy And war too Yankee for representation Way it always is when the chipsre down I shd judge Aye Roland agreed Gunfire makes close relations we say Do ya Now I know you gut things to tell me but before you start theres one thing I gut to tell you And I shd smile n kiss a pig if it dont please you good n hard What Eddie asked County Sheriff Eldon Royster took four fellas into custody over in Auburn couple of hours ago Seems as though they was tryin to sneak past a police roadblock on a woods road and gut stuck for their trouble John put his pipe in his mouth took a wooden match from his breast pocket and set his thumb against the tip For the moment however he didnt flick it only held it there Reason they us tryin to sneak around is they seemed to have quite a fair amount of firepower Fiahpowah Machineguns grenades and some of that stuff they call C One of em was a fella I blieve you mentionedJack Andolini And with that he popped the Diamond Bluetip alight Eddie collapsed back in one of sai Beckhardts prim Shaker chairs turned his head up to the ceiling and bellowed laughter at the rafters When he was tickled Roland reflected no one could laugh like Eddie Dean At least not since Cuthbert Allgood had passed into the clearing Handsome Jack Andolini sitting in a county hoosegow in the State of Maine he said Roll me in sugar and call me a fuckin jellydoughnut If only my brother Henry was alive to see it Then Eddie realized that Henry probably was alive right nowsome version of him anyway Assuming the Dean brothers existed in this world Ayuh thought thatd please ya John said drawing the flame of the rapidly blackening match down into the bowl of his pipe It clearly pleased him too He was grinning almost too hard to kindle his tobacco Oh dearydear Eddie said wiping his eyes That makes my day Almost makes my year I gut somethin else for ya John said but well let her be for now The pipe was at last going to his satisfaction and he settled back eyes shifting between the two strange wandering men he had met earlier that day Men whose ka was now entwined with his own for better or worse and richer or poorer Right now Id like thear your story And just what it is youd have me do How old are you John Roland asked him Not s old I dont still have a little get up n go John replied a trifle coldly What about yself chummy How many times you ducked under the pole Roland gave him a smilethe kind that said point taken now lets change the subject Eddie will speak for both of us he said They had decided on this during their ride from Bridgton My own tales too long Do you say so John remarked I do Roland said Let Eddie tell you his story as much as he has time for and well both tell what wed have you do and then if you agree hell give you one thing to take to a man named Moses Carver and Ill give you another John Cullum considered this then nodded He turned to Eddie Eddie took a deep breath The first thing you ought to know is that I met this guy here in a middle of an airplane flight from Nassau the Bahamas to Kennedy Airport in New York I was hooked on heroin at the time and so was my brouier I was muling a load of cocaine And when might this have been son John Cullum asked The summer of  They saw wonder on Cullums face but no shade of disbelief So you do come from the future Gorry He leaned forward through the fragrant pipesmoke Son he said tell your tale And dontcha skip a goddam word FOUR It took Eddie almost an hour and a halfand in the cause of brevity he did skip some of the things that had happened to them By the time hed finished a premature night had settled on the lake below them And still the threatening storm neither broke nor moved on Above Dick Beckhardts cottage thunder sometimes rumbled and sometimes cracked so sharply they all jumped A stroke of lightning jabbed directly into the center of the narrow lake below them briefly illuminating the entire surface a delicate nacreous purple Once the wind arose making voices move through the trees and Eddie thought Itll come now surely it will come now but it did not Nor did the impending storm leave and this queer suspension like a sword hanging by the thinnest of threads made him think of Susannahs long strange pregnancy now terminated At around seven oclock the power went out and John looked through the kitchen cabinets for a supply of candles while Eddie talked onthe old people of River Crossing the mad people in the city of Lud the terrified people of Calla Bryn Sturgis where theyd met a former priest who seemed to have stepped directly out of a book John put the candles on the table along with crackers and cheese and a bottle of Red Zinger iced tea Eddie finished with their visit to Stephen King telling how the gunslinger had hypnotized the writer to forget their visit how they had briefly seen their friend Susannah and how they had called John Cullum because as Roland said there was no one else in this part of the world they could call When Eddie fell silent Roland told of meeting Chevin of Chayven on their way to Turtleback Lane The gunslinger laid the silver cross hed shown Chevin on the table by the plate of cheese and John poked the fine links of the chain with one thick thumbnail Then for a long time there was silence When he could bear it no longer Eddie asked the old caretaker how much of the tale he believed All of it John said without hesitation You gut to take care of that rose in New York dont you Yes Roland said Because thats whats kep one of those Beams safe while most of the others has been broken down by these whatdoyoucallem telepathies the Breakers Eddie was amazed at how quickly and easily Cullum had grasped that but perhaps there was no reason to be Fresh eyes see clear Susannah liked to say And Cullum was very much what the grays of Lud would have called a trig cove Yes Roland said You say true The rose is takin care of one Beam Stephen Kings in charge of the other un Least thats what you think Eddie said Hed bear watching Johnall else aside hes got some lousy habitsbut once we leave this worlds  we can never come back and check on him King doesnt exist in any of these other worlds John asked Almost surely not Roland said Even if he does Eddie put in what he does in them doesnt matter This is the key world This and the one Roland came from This world and that one are twins He looked at Roland for confirmation Roland nodded and lit the last of the cigarettes John had given him earlier I might be able to keep an eye on Stephen King John said He dont need to know Im doin it either That is if I get back from doin your cussed business in New York I gut me a pretty good idear what it is but maybe youd better spell it out From his back pocket he took a battered notepad with the words Mead Memo written on the green cover He paged most of the way through it found a blank sheet produced a pencil from his breast pocket licked the tip Eddie restrained a shudder and then looked at them as expectandy as any freshman on the first day of high school Now dearies he said why dont you tell your Uncle John the rest FIVE This time Roland did most of the talking and although he had less to say than Eddie it still took him half an hour for he spoke with great caution every now and then turning to Eddie for help with a word or phrase Eddie had already seen the killer and the diplomat who lived inside Roland of Gilead but this was his first clear look at the envoy a messenger who meant to get every word right Outside the storm still refused to break or to go away At last the gunslinger sat back In the yellow glow of the candles his face appeared both ancient and strangely lovely Looking at him Eddie for the first time suspected there might be more wrong with him than what Rosalita Munoz had called the dry twist Roland had lost weight and the dark circles beneath his eyes whispered of illness He drank off a whole glass of the red tea at a single draught and asked Do you understand the things Ive told you Ayuh No more than that Ken it very well do ya Roland pressed No questions Dont think so Tell it back to us then John had filled two pages with notes in his looping scrawl Now he paged back and forth between them nodding to himself a couple of times Then he grunted and returned the pad to his hip pocket He may be a country cousin but hes a long way from stupid Eddie thought And meeting him was a long way from just luck that was ka having a very good day Go to New York John said Find this fella Aaron Deepneau Keep his buddy out of it Convince Deepneau that takin care of the rose in that vacant lot is just about the most important job in the world You can cut the justabout Eddie said John nodded as if that went without saying He picked up the piece of notepaper with the cartoon beaver on top and tucked it into his voluminous wallet Passing the bill of sale to him had been one of the harder things Eddie Dean had had to do since being sucked through the unfound door and into East Stoneham and he came close to snatching it back before it could disappear into the caretakers battered old Lord Buxton He thought he understood much better now about how Calvin Tower had felt Because you boys now own the lot you own the rose John said The Tet Corporation now owns the rose Eddie said A corporation of which youre about to become executive vicepresident John Cullum looked unimpressed with his putative new title He said Deepneaus supposed to draw up articles of incorporation and make sure Tets legal Then we go to see this fella Moses Carver and make sure he gets on board Thats apt to be the hard part Haaaad paaaat but well give it our best go Put Aunties cross around your neck Roland said and when you meet with sai Carver show it to him It may go a long way toward convincing him youre on the straight But first you must blow on it like this On their ride from Bridgton Roland had asked Eddie if he could think of any secretno matter how trivial or greatwhich Susannah and her godfather might have shared in common As a matter of fact Eddie did know such a secret and he was now astounded to hear Susannah speak it from the cross which lay on Dick Beckhardts pine table We buried Pimsy under the apple tree where he could watch the blossoms fall in the spring her voice said And Daddy Mose told me not to cry anymore because God thinks to mourn a pet too long Here the words faded away first to a mutter and then to nothing at all But Eddie remembered the rest and repeated it now  to mourn a pet too longs a sin She said Daddy Mose told her she could go to Pimsys grave once in awhile and whisper Be happy in heaven but never to tell anyone else because preachers dont hold much with the idea of animals going to heaven And she kept the secret I was the only one she ever told Eddie perhaps remembering that postcoital confidence in the dark of night was smiling painfully John Cullum looked at the cross then up at Roland wideeyed What is it Some kind of tape recorder It aint is it Its a sigul Roland said patiently One that may help you with this fellow Carver if he turns out to be what Eddie calls a hardass The gunslinger smiled a litde Hardass was a term he liked One he understood Put it on But Cullum didnt at least not at once For the first time since the old fellow had come into their acquaintanceincluding that period when theyd been under fire in the General Storehe looked genuinely discomposed Is it magic he asked Roland shrugged impatiently as if to tell John that the word had no useful meaning in this context and merely repeated Put it on Gingerly as if he thought Aunt Talithas cross might glow redhot at any moment and give him a serious burn John Cullum did as bid He bent his head to look down at it momentarily giving his long Yankee face an amusing burghers double chin then tucked it into his shirt Gorry he said again very softly SIX Aware that he was speaking now as once hed been spoken to Eddie Dean said Tell the rest of your lesson John of East Stoneham and be true Cullum had gotten out of bed that morning no more than a country caretaker one of the worlds unknown and unseen Hed go to bed tonight with the potential of becoming one of the worlds most important people a true prince of the Earth If he was afraid of the idea it didnt show Perhaps he hadnt grasped it yet But Eddie didnt believe that This was the man ka had put in their road and he was both trig and brave If Eddie had been Walter at this moment or Flagg as Walter sometimes called himself he believed he would have trembled Well John said it dont mind a mite to ya who runs the company but you want Tet to swallow up Holmes because from now on the job doesnt have anything to do with makin toothpaste and cappin teeth although it may go on lookin that way yet awhile And whats Eddie got no further John raised a gnarled hand to stop him Eddie tried to imagine a Texas Instruments calculator in that hand and discovered he could and quite easily Weird Gimme a chance youngster and Ill tell you Eddie sat back making a zipping motion across his lips Keep the rose safe thats first Keep the writah safe thats second But beyond that me and this guy Deepneau and this other guy Carver are sposed to build up one of the worlds most powerful corporations We trade in real estate we work with uh He pulled out the battered green pad consulted it quickly and put it away We work with software developers whatever they are because theyre gonna be the next wave of technology Were supposed to remember three words He ticked them off Microsoft Microchips Intel And nmatter how big we growor how fastour three real jobs are the same protect the rose protect Stephen King and try to screw over two other companies every chance we get Ones called Sombra Others There was the slightest of hesitations The others North Central Positronics Sombras mostly interested in proppity accordin to you fellas Positronics well science and gadgets thats obvious even to me If Sombra wants a piece of land Tet tries tget it first If North Central wants a patent we try to get it first or at least to frig it up for them Throw it to a third party if it comes to that Eddie was nodding approval He hadnt told John that last the old guy had come up with it on his own Were the Three Toothless Musketeers the Old Farts of Apocalypse and were supposed to keep those two outfits from gettin what they want by fair means or foul Dirty tricks most definitely allowed John grinned I never been to Harvard Business SchoolHaavid Biness Schoolbut I guess I can kick a fella in the crotch as wells anyone Good Roland said He started to get up I think its time we Eddie raised a hand to stop him Yes he wanted to get to Susannah and Jake couldnt wait to sweep his darling into his arms and cover her face with kisses It seemed years since he had last seen her on the East Road in Calla Bryn Sturgis Yet he couldnt leave it at this as easily as Roland who had spent his life being obeyed and had come to take the deathallegiance of complete strangers as a matter of course What Eddie saw on the other side of Dick Beckhardts table wasnt another tool but an independent Yankee who was toughminded and smart as a whip but really too old for what they were asking And speaking of too old what about Aaron Deepneau the Chemotherapy Kid My friend wants to get moving and so do I Eddie said Weve got miles to go yet I know that Its on your face son Like a scar Eddie was fascinated by the idea of duty and ka as something that left a mark something that might look like decoration to one eye and disfigurement to another Outside thunder cracked and lightning flashed But why would you do this Eddie asked I have to know that Why would you take all this on for two men you just met John thought it over He touched the cross he wore now and would wear until his death in the year of the cross given to Roland by an old woman in a forgotten town He would touch it just that way in the years ahead when contemplating some big decision the biggest might have been the one to sever Tets connection with IBM a company that had shown an everincreasing willingness to do business with North Central Positronics or preparing for some covert action the firebombing of Sombra Enterprises in New Delhi for instance in the year before he died The cross spoke to Moses Carver and never spoke again in Cullums presence no matter how much he blew on it but sometimes drifting to sleep with his hand clasped around it he would think Tis a sigul Tis a sigul dearsomething that came from another world If he had regrets toward the end other than about some of the tricks which were filthy indeed and cost more than one man his life it was that he never got a chance to visit the world on the other side which he glimpsed one stormy evening on Turtleback Lane in the town of Lovell From time to time Rolands sigul sent him dreams of a field filled with roses and a sootyblack tower Sometimes he was visited by terrible visions of two crimson eyes floating unattached to any body and relentlessly scanning the horizon Sometimes there were dreams in which he heard the sound of a man relentlessly winding his horn From these latter dreams he would awake with tears on his cheeks those of longing and loss and love He would awake with his hand closed around the cross thinking I denied Discordia and regret nothing I have spat into the bodiless eyes of the Crimson King and rejoice I threw my lot with the gunslingers katet and the White and never once questioned the choice Yet for all that he wished he could have walked out just once into that other land the one beyond the door Now he said You boys want all the right things I cant put it any clearer than that I believe you He hesitated I believe in you What I see in your eyes is true Eddie thought he was done and then Cullum grinned like a boy Also it pears to me youre offerin the keys to one humongous great engine Engyne Who wouldnt want to turn it on and see what it does Are you scared Roland asked John Cullum considered the question then nodded Ayuh he said Roland nodded Good he said SEVEN They drove back up to Turtleback Lane in Cullums car beneath a black boiling sky Although diis was the height of the summer season and most of the cottages on Kezar were probably occupied diey saw not a single car moving in either direction All the boats on the lake had long since run for cover Said I had somethin else for ya John said and went to the back of his truck where there was a steel lockbox snugged up against the cab Now the wind had begun to blow It swirled his scanty fluff of white hair around his head He ran a combination popped a padlock and swung back the lockboxs lid From inside he brought out two dusty bags the wanderers knew well One looked almost new compared to the other which was the scuffed nocolor of desert dust and laced its long length with rawhide Our gunna Eddie cried so delightedand so amazedtfiat the words almost came out in a scream How in the name of hell John offered them a smile that augured well for his future as a dirty trickster bemused on the surface sly beneath Nice surprise aint it Thought so mself I went back to get a look at Chips storewhat us left of itwhile there was still a lot of confusion People runnin hither thither and yon is what I mean to say coverin bodies stringin that yella tape takin pitchers Somebodyd put those bags off to one side and they looked just a dight lonely so I He shrugged one bony shoulder I scooped em up This would have been while we were visiting with Calvin Tower and Aaron Deepneau in their rented cabin Eddie said After you went back home supposedly to pack for Vermont Is that right He was stroking the side of his bag He knew that smooth surface very well hadnt he shot the deer it had come from and scraped off the hair with Rolands knife and stitched the hide himself with Susannah to help him Not long after the great robot bear Shardik had almost unzipped Eddies guts that had been Sometime in the last century it seemed Yuh Cullum said and when the old fellows smile sweetened Eddies last doubts about him departed They had found the right man for this world Say true and thank Gan bigbig Strap on your gun Eddie Roland said holding out the revolver with the worn sandalwood grips Mine Norv he calls it mine Eddie felt a small chill I thought we were going to Susannah and Jake But he took the revolver and belted it on willingly enough Roland nodded But I believe we have a little work to do first against those who killed Callahan and then tried to kill Jake His face didnt change as he spoke but both Eddie Dean and John Cullum felt a chill For a moment it was almost impossible to look at the gunslinger So camealthough they did not know it which was likely more mercy than such as they deservedthe death sentence of Flaherty the taheen Lamia and their katet EIGHT Oh my God Eddie tried to say but no sound came out He had seen brightness growing ahead of them as they drove north along Turtleback Lane following the one working taillight of Cullums truck At first he thought it might be the carriagelamps guarding some rich mans driveway then perhaps floodlights But the glow kept strengthening a bluegolden brilliance to their left where the ridge sloped down to the lake As they approached the source of the light Cullums pickup now barely crawling Eddie gasped and pointed as a circle of radiance broke free of the main body and flew toward them changing colors as it came blue to gold to red red to green to gold and back to blue In the center of it was something that looked like an insect with four wings Then as it soared above the bed of Cullums truck and into the dark woods on die east side of the road it looked toward them and Eddie saw the insect had a human face What dear God Roland what Taheen Roland said and said no more In the growing brilliance his face was calm and tired More circles of light broke free of the main body and streamed across the road in cometary splendor Eddie saw flies and tiny jeweled hummingbirds and what appeared to be winged frogs Beyond them The taillight of Cullums truck flashed bright but Eddie was so busy goggling that he would have rearended the man had Roland not spoken to him sharply Eddie threw the Galaxie into Park without bothering to either set the emergency brake or turn off the engine Then he got out and walked toward the blacktop driveway that descended the steep wooded slope His eyes were huge in the delicate light his mouth hung open Cullum joined him and stood looking down The driveway was flanked by two signs CARA LAUGHS on the left and  on the right Somethin aint it Cullum asked quiedy You got that right Eddie tried to reply and still no words would come out of his mouth only a breathless wheeze Most of the light was coming from the woods to the east of the road and to the left of the Cara Laughs driveway Here the treesmosdy pines spruces and birches bent from a latewinter ice stormwere spread far apart and hundreds of figures walked solemnly among them as though in a rustic ballroom their bare feet scuffing through the leaves Some were pretty clearly Children of Roderick and as roont as Chevin of Chayven Their skins were covered with the sores of radiation sickness and very few had more than a straggle of hair but the light in which they walked gave them a beauty that was almost too great to look upon Eddie saw a oneeyed woman carrying what appeared to be a dead child She looked at him with an expression of sorrow and her mouth moved but Eddie could hear nothing He raised his fist to his forehead and bent his leg Then he touched the corner of one eye and pointed to her I see you the gesture said or so he hoped I see you very well The woman bearing the dead or sleeping child returned the gesture and then passed from sight Overhead thunder cracked sharply and lightning flashed down into the center of the glow An ancient fir tree its lusty trunk girdled with moss took the bolt and split apart down its center falling half one way and half the other The inside was on fire And a great gust of sparksnot fire not this but something with the ethereal quality of swamplightwent twisting up toward the hanging swags of the clouds In those sparks Eddie saw tiny dancing bodies and for a moment he couldnt breathe It was like watching a squadron of Tinker Bells there and then gone Look at em John said reverently Walkins Gorry theres hundreds  wish my friend Donnie was here to see Eddie thought he was probably right hundreds of men women and children were walking through the woods below them walking through the light appearing and disappearing and then appearing again As he watched he felt a cold drop of water splash his neck followed by a second and a third The wind swooped down through the trees provoking another upward gush of those fairylike creatures and turning the tree that had been halved by lightning into a pair of vast crackling torches Come on Roland said grabbing Eddies arm Its going to come a downpour and thisll go out like a candle If were still on this side when it does well be stuck here Where Eddie began and then he saw Near the foot of the driveway where the forest cover gave way to a tumble of rocks falling down to the lake was the core of the glow for the time being too bright to look at Roland dragged him in that direction John Cullum remained hypnotized for a moment longer by the walkins then tried to follow them No Roland called over his shoulder The rain was falling harder now the drops cold on his skin and the size of coins You have your work John Fare you well And you boys John called back He stopped and raised his hand in a wave A bolt of electricity cut across the sky momentarily lighting his face in brilliant blue and deepest black And you Eddie were going to run into the core of the light Roland said Its not a door of the old people but of the Primthat is magic do ye ken Itll take us to the place we want if we concentrate hard enough Where Theres no time Jakes told me where by touch Only hold my hand and keep your mind blank I can take us Eddie wanted to ask him if he was absolutely sure of that but there was no time Roland broke into a run Eddie joined him They sprinted down the slope and into the light Eddie felt it breathing over his skin like a million small mouths Their boots crackled in the deep leaf cover To his right was the burning tree He could smell the sap and the sizzle of its cooking bark Now they closed in on the core of the light At first Eddie could see Kezar Lake through it and then he felt an enormous force grip him and pull him forward through the cold rain and into that brilliant murmuring glare For just a moment he glimpsed the shape of a doorway Then he redoubled his grip on Rolands hand and closed his eyes The leaflittered ground ran out beneath his feet and they were flying ONE Flaherty stood at the New YorkFedic door which had been scarred by several gunshots but otherwise stood whole against them an impassable barrier which the shitting kid had somehow passed Lamia stood silent beside him waiting for Flahertys rage to exhaust itself The others also waited maintaining the same prudent silence Finally the blows Flaherty had been raining on the door began to slow He administered one final overhand smash and Lamia winced as blood flew from the humes knuckles What Flaherty asked catching his grimace What Do you have something to say Lamia cared not at all for the white circles around Flahertys eyes and the hard red roses in Flahertys cheeks Least of all for the way Flahertys hand had risen to the butt of the Glock automatic hanging beneath his armpit No he said No sai Go on say whats on your mind do it please ya Flaherty persisted He tried to smile and produced a gruesome grin insteadthe leer of a madman Quietly with barely a rustle the rest pulled back Others will have plenty to say why shouldnt you start my cully I lost him Be the first to carp you ugly motherfucker Im dead Lamia thought After a life of service to the King one unguarded expression in the presence of a man who needs a scapegoat and Im dead He looked around verifying that none of the others would step in for him and then said Flaherty if Ive offended you in some way Im sor Oh youve offended me sure enough Flaherty shrieked his Boston accent growing thicker as his rage escalated Im sure Ill pay for tonights work aye but I think youll pay fir There was a kind of gasp in the air around them as if the corridor itself had inhaled sharply Flahertys hair and Lamias fur rippled Flahertys posse of low men and vampires began to turn Suddenly one of them a vamp named Albrecht shrieked and bolted forward allowing Flaherty a view of two newcomers men with raindrops still fresh and dark on their jeans and boots and shirts There was traildusty gunnagar at their feet and revolvers hung at their hips Flaherty saw the sandalwood grips in the instant before the younger one drew faster than blue blazes and understood at once why Albrecht had run Only one sort of man carried guns that looked like that The young one fired a single shot Albrechts blond hair jumped as if flicked by an invisible hand and then he collapsed forward fading within his clothes as he did so Hile you bondsmen of the Ring the older one said He spoke in a purely conversational tone Flahertyhis hands still bleeding from his extravagant drumming on the door through which the snotbabby had disappearedcould not seem to get the sense of him It was the one of whom they had been warned surely it was Roland of Gilead but how had he gotten here and on their blindside Howl Rolands cold blue eyes surveyed them Which of this sorry herd calls himself dinh Will that one honor us by stepping forward or not Not His eyes surveyed them his left hand departed the vicinity of his gun and journeyed to the corner of his mouth where a small sarcastic smile had bloomed Not Too bad Thart cowards after all Im sorry to see Theed kill a priest and chase a lad but not stand and claim thy days work Thart cowards and the sons of cow Flaherty stepped forward with his bleeding right hand clasped loosely around the butt of the gun that hung below his left armpit in a dockers clutch That would be me Rolandof Steven You know my name do you Aye I know your name by your face and your face by your mouth Tis the same as the mouth of your mother who did suck John Farson with such glee until he spewed is Flaherty drew as he spoke a bushwhackers trick hed no doubt practiced and used before to advantage And although he was fast and the forefinger of Rolands left hand still touched the side of his mouth when Flahertys draw began the gunslinger beat him easily His first bullet passed between the lips of Jakes chief harrier exploding the teeth at the front of his upper jaw to bone fragments which Flaherty drew down his throat with his dying breath His second pierced Flahertys forehead between the eyebrows and he was flung back against the New YorkFedic door with the unfired Glock spilling from his hand to discharge a final time on the hallway floor TWO Most of the others drew a splitsecond later Eddie killed the six in front having taken time to reload the chamber hed fired at Albrecht When the revolver was empty he rolled behind his dinh to reload as he had been taught Roland picked off the next five then rolled smoothly behind Eddie who took out the rest save one Lamia had been too cunning to try and so was the last standing He raised his empty hands the fingers furry and the palms smooth Will ye grant me parole gunslinger if I promise ye peace Not a bit Roland said and cocked his revolver Be damned to you then charyka said the taheen and Roland of Gilead shot him where he stood and Lamia of Galee fell down dead Flahertys posse lay stacked in front of the door like cordwood Lamia facedown in front Not a single one had had a chance to fire The tilethroated corridor stank of the gunsmoke which hung in a blue layer Then the purifiers kicked in chugging wearily in the wall and the gunslingers felt the air first stirred into motion and then sucked across their faces Eddie reloaded the gunhis now so he had been toldand dropped it back into its holster Then he went to the dead and yanked four of them absently aside so he could get to the door Susannah Suze are you there Do any of us except in our dreams truly expect to be reunited with our hearts deepest loves even when they leave us only for minutes and on the most mundane of errands No not at all Each time they go from our sight we in our secret hearts count them as dead Having been given so much we reason how could we expect not to be brought as low as Lucifer for the staggering presumption of our love So Eddie didnt expect her to answer until she didfrom another world and through a single diickness of wood Eddie Sugar is it you Eddies head which had seemed perfectly normal only seconds before was suddenly too heavy to hold up He leaned it against the door His eyes were similarly too heavy to hold open and so he closed them The weight must have been tears for suddenly he was swimming in them He could feel them rolling down his cheeks warm as blood And Rolands hand touching his back Susannah Eddie said His eyes were still closed His fingers were splayed on the door Can you open it Jake answered No but you can What word Roland asked He had been alternating glances at the door with looks behind him almost hoping for reinforcements for his blood was up but the tiled corridor was empty What word Jake There was a pausebrief but it seemed very long to Eddieand then both spoke together Chassit they said Eddie didnt trust himself to say it his throat was too full of tears Roland had no such problem He hauled several more bodies away from the door including Flahertys his face still fixed in its final snarl and then spoke the word Once again the door between the worlds clicked open It was Eddie who opened it wide and then the four of them were facetoface again Susannah and Jake in one world Roland and Eddie in another and between them a shimmering transparent membrane like living mica Susannah held out her hands and they plunged through the membrane like hands emerging from a body of water that had been somehow magically turned on its side Eddie took them He let her fingers close over his and draw him into Fedic THREE By the time Roland stepped through Eddie had already lifted Susannah and was holding her in his arms The boy looked up at the gunslinger Neither of them smiled Oy sat at Jakes feet and smiled for both of them Hile Jake Roland said Hile Father Will you call me so Jake nodded Yes if I may Such would please me ever Roland said Then slowlyas one performs an action with which hes unfamiliarhe held out his arms Looking up at him solemnly never taking his eyes from Rolands face the boy Jake moved between those killers hands and waited until they locked at his back He had had dreams of this that he would never have dared to tell Susannah meanwhile was covering Eddies face with kisses They almost got Jake she was saying I sat down on my side of the door and I was so tired I nodded off He musta called me three four times before I Later he would hear her tale every word and to the end Later there would be time for palaver For now he cupped her breastthe left one so he could feel the strong steady beat of her heartand then stopped her speech with his mouth Jake meanwhile said nothing He stood with his head turned so his cheek rested against Rolands midsection His eyes were closed He could smell rain and dust and blood on the gunslingers shirt He thought of his parents who were lost his friend Benny who was dead the Pere who had been overrun by all those from whom he had so long fled The man he held had betrayed him once for the Tower had let him fall and Jake couldnt say the same might not happen again Certainly there were miles ahead and they would be hard ones Still for now he was content His mind was quiet and his sore heart was at peace It was enough to hold and be held Enough to stand here with his eyes shut and to think My father has come for me ONE The four reunited travelers five counting Oy of MidWorld stood at the foot of Mias bed looking at what remained of Susannahs tioim which was to say her twin Without the deflated clothes to give the corpse some definition probably none of them could have said for certain what it had once been Even the snarl of hair above the split gourd of Mias head looked like nothing human it could have been an exceptionally large dustbunny Roland looked down at the disappearing features wondering that so little remained of the woman whose obsessionthe chap the chap always the chaphad come so near to wrecking their enterprise for good And without them who would remain to stand against the Crimson King and his infernally clever chancellor John Cullum Aaron Deepneau and Moses Carver Three old men one of them with blackmouth disease which Eddie called cant sir So much you did he thought gazing raptly at the dusty dissolving face So much you did and so much more you would have done aye and all without a check or qualm and so will the world end I think a victim of love rather than hate For loves ever been the more destructive weapon sure He leaned forward smelling what could have been old flowers or ancient spices and exhaled The thing that looked vaguely like a head even now blew away like milkweed fluff or a dandyo ball She meant no harm to the universe Susannah said her voice not quite steady She only wanted any womans privilege to have a baby Someone to love and raise Aye Roland agreed you say true Which is what makes her end so black Eddie said Sometimes I think wed all be better off if the people who mean well would just creep away and die Thatd be the end of us Big Ed Jake pointed out They all considered this and Eddie found himself wondering how many theyd already killed with their wellintentioned meddling The bad ones he didnt care about but there had been others tooRolands lost love Susan was only one Then Roland left the powdery remains of Mias corpse and came to Susannah who was sitting on one of the nearby beds with her hands clasped between her thighs Tell me everything that befell since you left us on the East Road after the battle he said We need to Roland I never meant to leave you It was Mia She took over If I hadnt had a place to goa Doganshe mightve taken over completely Roland nodded to show he understood that Nevertheless tell me how you came to this devartete And Jake Id hear the same from you Devartete Eddie said The phrase held some faint familiarity Did it have something to do with Chevin of Chayven the slow mutie Roland had put out of its misery in Lovell He thought so Whats that Roland swept a hand at the room with all its beds each with its helmetlike machine and segmented steel hose beds where the gods only knew how many children from the Callas had lain and been ruined It means little prison or torturechamber Doesnt look so little to me Jake said He couldnt tell how many beds there were but he guessed the number at three hundred Three hundred at least Mayhap well come upon a larger one before were finished Tell your tale Susannah and you too Jake Where do we go from here Eddie asked Perhaps the tale will tell Roland answered TWO Roland and Eddie listened in silent fascination as Susannah and Jake recounted their adventures turn and turn about Roland first halted Susannah while she was telling them of Mathiessen van Wyck who had given her his money and rented her a hotel room The gunslinger asked Eddie about the turtle in the lining of the bag I didnt know it was a turtle I thought it might be a stone If youd tell this part again Id hear Roland said So thinking carefully trying to remember completely for it all seemed a very long time ago Eddie related how he and Pere Callahan had gone up to the Doorway Cave and opened the ghostwood box with Black Thirteen inside Theyd expected Black Thirteen to open the door and so it had but first We put the box in the bag Eddie said The one that said NOTHING BUT STRIKES AT MIDTOWN LANES in New York and NOTHING BUT STRIKES AT MIDWORLD LANES on the Calla Bryn Sturgis side Remember They all did And I felt something in the lining of the bag I told Callahan and he said Eddie mulled it over He said This isnt the time to investigate it Or something like that I agreed I remember thinking we had enough mysteries on our hands already wed save this one for another day Roland who in Gods name put that thing in the bag do you think For that matter who left the bag in the vacant lot Susannah asked Or the key Jake chimed in I found the key to the house in Dutch Hill in that same lot Was it the rose Did the rose somehow I dunno make them Roland thought about it Were I to guess he said Id say that sai King left those signs and siguls The writer Eddie said He weighed the idea then nodded slowly He vaguely remembered a concept from high schoolthe god from the machine it was called There was a fancy Latin term for it as well but that one he couldnt remember Had probably been writing Mary Lou Kenopenskys name on his desk while the other kids had been obediently taking notes The basic concept was that if a playwright got himself into a corner he could send down the god who arrived in a flowerdecked bucka wagon from overhead and rescued the characters who were in trouble This no doubt pleased the more religious playgoers who believed that Godnot the specialeffects version who came down from some overhead platform the audience couldnt see but the One who wert in heavenreally did save people who deserved it Such ideas had undoubtedly gone out of fashion in the modern age but Eddie thought that popular novelistsof the sort sai King seemed on his way to becomingprobably still used the technique only disguising it better Litde escape hatches Cards that read GET OUT OF JAIL FREE or ESCAPE THE PIRATES Or FREAK STORM CUTS ELECTRICAL POWER EXECUTION POSTPONED The god from die machine who was actually the writer patiently working to keep the characters safe so his tale wouldnt end with an unsatisfying line like And so the katet was wiped out on Jericho Hill and the bad guys won rule Discordia so sorry better luck next time what next time haha THE END Little safety nets like a key Not to mention a scrimshaw turde If he wrote those things into his story Eddie said it was long after we saw him in Aye Roland agreed And I dont think he thought them up Eddie said Not really Hes just I dunno just a A bumhug Susannah asked smiling No Jake said sounding a litde shocked Not diat Hes a sender A telecaster He was thinking about his father and his fathers job at the Network Bingo Eddie said and leveled a finger at die boy This idea led him to another that if Stephen King did not remain alive long enough to write those things into his tale the key and the turde would not be there when they were needed Jake would have been eaten by the Doorkeeper in the house on Dutch Hill always assuming he got that far which he probably wouldnt have done And if he escaped the Dutch Hill monster he wouldve been eaten by the GrandfathersCallahans Type One vampiresin the Dixie Pig Susannah thought to tell them about the vision shed had as Mia was beginning her final journey from the PlazaPark Hotel to the Dixie Pig In this vision shed been jugged in ajail cell in Oxford Mississippi and there had been voices coming from a TV somewhere Chet Huntley Walter Cronkite Frank McGee newscasters chanting the names of the dead Some of those names like President Kennedy and the Diem brothers shed known Others like Christa McAuliffe she had not But one of the names had been Stephen Kings she was quite sure of it Chet Huntleys partner good night Chet good night David saying that Stephen King had been struck and killed by a Dodge minivan while walking near his house King had been fiftytwo according to Brinkley Had Susannah told them that a great many things might have happened differently or not at all She was opening her mouth to add it into the conversationa falling chip on a hillside strikes a stone which strikes a larger stone which then strikes two others and starts a landslidewhen there was the clunk of an opening door and the clack of approaching footsteps They all turned Jake reaching for a Riza the others for their guns Relax fellas Susannah murmured Its all right I know this guy And then to DNK  DOMESTIC she said I didnt expect to see you again so soon In fact I didnt expect to see you at all Whats up Nigel old buddy So this time something which might have been spoken was not and the deus ex machina which might have descended to rescue a writer who had a date with a Dodge minivan on a latespring day in the year of  remained where it was high above the mortals who acted their parts below THREE The nice thing about robots in Susannahs opinion was that most of them didnt hold grudges Nigel told her that no one had been available to fix his visual equipment although he might be able to do it himself he said given access to the right components discs and repair tutorials so he had come back here relying on the infrared to pick up the remains of the shattered and completely unneeded incubator He thanked her for her interest and introduced himself to her friends Nice to meet you Nige Eddie said but youll want to get started on those repairs I kennit so we wont keep you Eddies voice was pleasant and hed reholstered his gun but he kept his hand on the butt In truth he was a little bit freaked by the resemblance Nigel bore to a certain messenger robot in the town of Calla Bryn Sturgis That one hadheld a grudge No stay Roland said We may have chores for you but for the time being Id as soon you were quiet Turned off if it please you And if it doesnt his tone implied Certainly sai Nigel replied in his plummy British accent You may reactivate me with the words Nigel I need you Very good Roland said Nigel folded his scrawny but undoubtedly powerful stainlesssteel arms across his chest and went still Came back to pick up the broken glass Eddie marveled Maybe the Tet Corporation could sell em Every housewife in America would want twoone for the house and one for the yard The less were involved with science the better Susannah said darkly In spite of her brief nap while leaning against the door between Fedic and New York she looked haggard done almost to death Look where its gotten this world Roland nodded to Jake who told of his and Pere Callahans adventures in the New York of  beginning with the taxi that had almost hit Oy and ending with their twoman attack on the low men and the vampires in the dining room of the Dixie pig He did not neglect to tell how they had disposed of Black Thirteen by putting it in a storage locker at the World Trade Center where it would be safe until early June of  and how they had found the turtle which Susannah had dropped like a message in a bottle in the gutter outside the Dixie Pig So brave Susannah said and ruffled Jakes hair Then she bent to stroke Oys head The bumbler stretched his long neck to maximize the caress his eyes halfclosed and a grin on his foxy little face So damned brave Thankeesai Jake Thank Ake Oy agreed If it hadnt been for the turtle they would have gotten us both Jakes voice was steady but he had gone pale As it was the Pere heJake wiped away a tear with the heel of his hand and gazed at Roland You used his voice to send me on I heard you Aye I had to the gunslinger agreed Twas no more than what he wanted Jake said The vampires didnt get him He used my Ruger before they could take his blood and change him into one of them I dont think they wouldve done that anyway They would have torn him apart and eaten him They were mad Roland was nodding The last thing he sentI think he said it out loud although Im not sureit wasJake considered it He was weeping freely now He said May you find your Tower Roland and breach it and may you climb to the top ThenJake made a little puffing sound between his pursed lips Gone like a candleflame To whatever worlds there are He fell silent For several moments they all did and the quiet had the feel of a deliberate thing Then Eddie said All right were back together again What the hell do we do next FOUR Roland sat down with a grimace then gave Eddie Dean a look which saidclearer than any words ever could have done Why do you try my patience All right Eddie said its just a habit Quit giving me the look Whats a habit Eddie Eddie thought of his final bruising addictive year with Henry less frequently these days but he thought of it now Only he didnt like to say so not because he was ashamed Eddie really thought he might be past thatbut because he sensed the gunslingers growing impatience with Eddies explaining things in terms of his big brother And maybe that was fair Henry had been the defining shaping force in Eddies life okay Just as Cort had been the defining shaping force in Rolands but the gunslinger didnt talk about his old teacher all the time Asking questions when I already know the answer Eddie said And whats the answer this time Were going to backtrack to Thunderclap before we go on to the Tower Were either going to kill the Breakers or set them free Whatever it takes to make the Beams safe Well kill Walter or Flagg or whatever hes calling himself Because hes the field marshal isnt he He was Roland agreed but now a new player has come on the scene He looked at the robot Nigel I need you Nigel unfolded his arms and raised his head How may I serve By getting me something to write with Is there such Pens pencils and chalk in the Supervisors cubicle at the far end of the Extraction Room sai Or so there was the last time I had occasion to be there The Extraction Room Roland mused studying the serried ranks of beds Do you call it so Yes sai And then almost timidly Vocal elisions and fricatives suggest that youre angry Is that the case They brought children here by the hundreds and thousandshealthy ones for the most part from a world where too many are still born twistedand sucked away their minds Why would I be angry Sai Im sure I dont know Nigel said He was perhaps repenting his decision to come back here But I had no part in the extraction procedures I assure you I am in charge of domestic services including maintenance Bring me a pencil and a piece of chalk Sai you wont destroy me will you It was Dr Scowther who was in charge of the extractions over the last twelve or fourteen years and Dr Scowther is dead This ladysai shot him and with his own gun There was a touch of reproach in Nigels voice which was quite expressive within its narrow range Roland only repeated Bring me a pencil and a piece of chalk and do itjinjin Nigel went off on his errand When yovi say a new player you mean the baby Susannah said Certainly He has two fathers that bahbo Susannah nodded She was thinking about the tale Mia had told her during their todash visit to the abandoned town of Fedicabandoned that was except for the likes of Sayre and Scowther and the marauding Wolves Two women one white and one black one pregnant and one not sitting in chairs outside the GinPuppy Saloon There Mia had told Eddie Deans wife a great dealmore than either of them had known perhaps Thats where they changed me Mia had told her they presumably meaning Scowther and a team of other doctors Plus magicians Folk like the Manni only gone over to the other side Maybe Who could say In the Extraction Room shed been made mortal Then with Rolands sperm already in her something else had happened Mia didnt remember much about that part only a red darkness Susannah wondered now if the Crimson King had come to her in person mounting her with its huge and ancient spiders body or if its unspeakable sperm had been transported somehow to mix with Rolands In either case the baby grew into the loathsome hybrid Susannah had seen not a werewolf but a werespider And now it was out there somewhere Or perhaps it was here watching them even as they palavered and Nigel returned with various writing implements Yes she thought Its watching us And hating us but not equally Mostly its Roland the dantete hates Its first father She shivered Mordred means to kill you Roland she said Thats its job What it was made for To end you and your quest and the Tower Yes Roland said and to rule in his fathers place For the Crimson King is old and I have come more and more to believe that he is imprisoned somehow If thats so then hes no longer our real enemy Will we go to his castle on the other side of the Discordia Jake asked It was the first time hed spoken in half an hour We will wont we I think so yes Roland said Le Casse Roi Russe the old legends call it Well go there katet and slay what lives there Let it be so Eddie said By God let that be so Aye Roland agreed But our first job is the Breakers The Beamquake we felt in Calla Bryn Sturgis just before we came here suggests that their work is nearly done Yet even if it isnt Ending what theyre doing is our job Eddie said Roland nodded He looked more tired than ever Aye he said Killing them or setting them free Either way we must finish their meddling with the two Beams that remain And we must finish off the dantete The one that belongs to the Crimson King and to me FIVE Nigel ended up being quite helpful although not just to Roland and his katet as things fell To begin with he brought two pencils two pens one of them a great old thing that would have looked at home in the hand of a Dickens scrivener and three pieces of chalk one of them in a silver holder that looked like a ladys lipstick Roland chose this and gave Jake another piece I cant write words youd understand easily he said but our numbers are the same or close enough Print what I say to one side Jake and fair Jake did as he was bid The result was crude but understandable enough a map with a legend Fedic  Castle  MRaWadTroiKs  Doon o  Rwer  CcxItaS   DcvOrTo Fedic Roland said pointing to  and then drew a short chalk line to  And heres Castle Discordia with the doors beneath An almighty tangle of em from what we hear Therell be a passage thatll take us from here to there under the castle Now Susannah tell again how die Wolves go and what they do He handed her the chalk in its holder She took it noticing with some admiration that it sharpened itself as it was used A small trick but a neat one They ride through a oneway door that brings them out here she said drawing a line from  to  which Jake had dubbed Thunderclap Station We ought to know this door when we see it because itll be big unless they go through singlefile Maybe they do Eddie said Unless Im wrong theyre pretty well stuck with what the old people left them Youre not wrong Roland said Go on Susannah He wasnt hunkering but sitting with his right leg stretched stiffly out Eddie wondered how badly his hip was hurting him and if he had any of Rosalitas catoil in his newly recovered purse He doubted it She said The Wolves ride from Thunderclap along the course of the railroad tracks at least until theyre out of the shadow or the darkness or whatever it is Do you know Roland No but well see soon enough He made his impatient twirling gesture with his left hand They cross the river to the Callas and take the children When they get back to the Thunderclap Station I think they must board their horses and their prisoners on a train and go back to Fedic that way for the doors no good to them Aye I think thats the way of it Roland agreed They bypass the devartoithe prison weve marked with an for the time being Susannah said Scowther and his Nazi doctors used the hoodthings on these beds to extract something from the kids Its the stuff they give to the Breakers Feed it to em or inject em with it I guess The kids and the brainstuff go back to Thunderclap Station by the door The kiddies are sent back to Calla Bryn Sturgis maybe the other Callas as well and at what you call the devartoi Mawster dinnah is served Eddie said bleakly Nigel chipped in at this point sounding absolutely cheerful Would you care for a bite sais Jake consulted his stomach and found it was rumbling It was horrible to be this hungry so soon after the Peres deathand after the things he had seen in the Dixie Pigbut he was nevertheless Is there food Nigel Is there really Yes indeed young man Nigel said Only tinned goods Im afraid but I can offer better than two dozen choices including baked beans tunafish several kinds of soup Tooterfish for me Roland said but bring an array if you will Certainly sai I dont suppose you could rustle me up an Elvis Special Jake said longingly Thats peanut bvitter banana and bacon Jesus kid Eddie said I dont know if you can tell in this light but Im turning green I have no bacon or bananas unfortunately Nigel said pronouncing the latter baNAWnas but I do have peanut butter and three kinds of jelly Also apple butter Apple butterd be good Jake said Go on Susannah Roland said as Nigel moved off on his errand Although I suppose I neednt speed you along so after we eat well need to take some rest He sounded far from pleased with the idea I dont think theres any more to tell she said It sounds confusinglooks confusing too mosdy because our litde map doesnt have any scalebut its essentially just a loop they make every twentyfour years or so from Fedic to Calla Bryn Sturgis then back to Fedic with the kids so they can do the extraction Then they take the kids back to the Callas and the brainfood to this prison where the Breakers are The devartoi Jake said Susannah nodded The question is what we do to interrupt the cycle We go through the door to Thunderclap station Roland said and from the station to where the Breakers are kept And there He looked at each of his katet in turn then raised his finger and made a dryly expressive shooting gesture Therell be guards Eddie said Maybe a lot of them What if were outnumbered It wont be the first time Roland said ONE When Nigel returned he was bearing a tray the size of a wagonwheel On it were stacks of sandwiches two Thermoses filled with soup beef and chicken plus canned drinks There was Coke Sprite NozzALa and something called Wit Green Wit Eddie tried tfiis last and pronounced it foul beyond description All of them could see that Nigel was no longer the same pippip jollygood fellow hed been for God alone knew how many decades and centuries His lozengeshaped head kept jerking to one side or the other When it went to the left he would mutter Un deux trois To the right it was Ein zwei drei A constant low clacking had begun in his diaphragm Sugar whats wrong with you Susannah asked as the domestic robot lowered the tray to the floor amidst them Selfdiagnostic exam series suggests total systemic breakdown during the next two to six hours Nigel said sounding glum but otherwise calm Preexisting logic faults quarantined until now have leaked into the GMS He then twisted his head viciously to the right Ein zioei drei Live free or die heres Greg in your eye Whats GMS Jake asked And whos Greg Eddie added GMS stands for general mentation systems said Nigel There are two such systems rational and irrational Conscious and subconscious as you might say As for Greg that would be Greg Stillson a character in a novel Im reading Quite enjoyable Its called The Dead Zone by Stephen King As to why I bring him up in this context I have no idea TWO Nigel explained that logic faults were common in what he called Asimov Robots The smarter the robot the more the logic faults and the sooner they started showing up The old people Nigel called them the Makers compensated for this by setting up a stringent quarantine system treating mental glitches as though they were smallpox or cholera Jake thought this sounded like a really fine way of dealing with insanity although he supposed that psychiatrists wouldnt care for the idea much it would put them out of business Nigel believed that the trauma of having his eyes shot out had weakened his mental survivalsystems somehow and now all sorts of bad stuff was loose in his circuits eroding his deductive and inductive reasoning capabilities gobbling logicsystems left and right He told Susannah he didnt hold this against her in the slightest Susannah raised a fist to her forehead and thanked him bigbig In truth she did not completely believe good old DNK although she was damned if she knew why Maybe it was just a holdover from their time in Calla Bryn Sturgis where a robot not much different from Nigel had turned out to be a nasty grudgeholding cully indeed And there was something else I spy with my little eye Susannah thought Hold out thy hands Nigel When die robot did diey all saw the wiry hairs caught in the joints of his steel fingers There was also a drop of blood on a would you call it a knuckle Whats this she asked holding several of the hairs up Im sorry mum I cawnt Couldnt see No of course not Nigel had infrared but his actual eyesight was gone courtesy of Susannah Dean daughter of Dan gunslinger in the KaTet of Nineteen Theyre hairs I also spy some blood Ah yes Nigel said Rats in the kitchen mum Im programmed to dispose of vermin when I detect them There are a great many these days Im sorry to say the world is moving on And then snapping his head violently to the left Undeuxtrois Minnie Mouse est la mouse pour moin Um did you kill Minnie and Mickey before or after you made the sandwiches Nige old buddy Eddie asked After sai I assure you Well I might pass anyway Eddie said I had a poorboy back in Maine and its sticking to my ribs like a motherfucker You should say un deux trois Susannah told him The words were out before she knew she was going to say them Cry pardon Eddie was sitting with his arm around her Since the four of them had gotten back together he touched Susannah at every opportunity as if needing to confirm the fact that she was more than just wishful thinking Nothing Later when Nigel was either out of the room or completely broken down shed tell him her intuition She thought that robots of Nigel and Andys type like those in the Isaac Asimov stories shed read as a teenager werent supposed to lie Perhaps Andy had either been modified or had modified himself so that wasnt a problem With Nigel she thought it was a problem indeed can ya say problem bigbig She had an idea that unlike Andy Nigel was essentially goodhearted but yeshed either lied or gilded the truth about the rats in the larder Maybe about other things as well Ein zwei drei and Un deux trois was his method of letting off the pressure For awhile anyway Its Mordred she thought looking around She took a sandwich because she had to eatlike Jake she was ravenousbut her appetite was gone and she knew shed take no enjoyment from what she plugged grimly down her throat Hes been at Nigel and now hes watching us somewhere I know itI feel it And as she took her first bite of some longpreserved vacuumpacked mysterymeat A mother always knows THREE None of them wanted to sleep in the Extraction Room  although they would have had their pick of three hundred or more freshly made beds nor in the deserted town outside so Nigel took them to his quarters pausing every now and then for a vicious headclearing shake and to count off in either German or French To this he began adding numbers in some other language none of them knew Their way led them through a kitchenall stainless steel and smoothly humming machines quite different from the ancient cookhouse Susannah had visited todash beneath Castle Discordiaand although they saw the moderate clutter of the meal Nigel had prepared them there was no sign of rats living or dead None of them commented on this Susannahs sense of being observed came and went Beyond the pantry was a neat little threeroom apartment where Nigel presumably hung his hat There was no bedroom but beyond the living room and a butlers pantry full of monitoring equipment was a neat booklined study with an oak desk and an easy chair beneath a halogen reading lamp The computer on the desk had been manufactured by North Central Positronics no surprise diere Nigel brought them blankets and pillows which he assured them were fresh and clean Maybe you sleep on your feet but I guess you like to sit down to read like anyone else Eddie said Oh yes indeedy onetwothreedy Nigel said I enjoy a good book Its part of my programming Well sleep six hours then push on Roland told them Jake meanwhile was examining the books more closely Oy moved beside him always at heel as Jake checked the spines occasionally pulling one out for a closer peek Hes got all of Dickens it looks like he said Also Steinbeck Thomas Wolfe a lot of Zane Grey somebody named Max Brand a guy named Elmore Leonard and the always popular Steve King They all took time to look at the two shelves of King books better than thirty in all at least four of them very large and two the size of doorstops King had been an extremely busy writerbee since his Bridgton days it appeared The newest volume was called Hearts in Atlantis and had been published in a year with which they were very familiar  The only ones missing so far as they could tell were the ones about them Assuming King had gone ahead and written them Jake checked the copyright pages but there were few obvious holes That might mean nothing however because he had written so much Susannah inquired of Nigel who said he had never seen any books by Stephen King concerning Roland of Gilead or the Dark Tower Then having said so he twisted his head viciously to the left and counted off in French this time all the way to ten Still Eddie said after Nigel had retired clicking and clacking and clucking his way out of the room I bet theres a lot of information here we could use Roland do you think we could pack the works of Stephen King and take them with us Maybe Roland said but we wont They might confuse us Why do you say so Roland only shook his head He didnt know why he said so but he knew it was true FOUR The Arc  Experimental Stations nervecenter was four levels down from the Extraction Room the kitchen and Nigels study One entered the Control Suite through a capsuleshaped vestibule The vestibule could only be opened from the outside by using three ID slides one after the other The pipedin Muzak on this lowest level of the Fedic Dogan sounded like Beatles tunes as rendered by The Comatose String Quartet Inside the Control Suite were over a dozen rooms but the only one with which we need concern ourselves was the one filled with TV screens and security devices One of these latter devices ran a small but vicious army of hunterkiller robots equipped with sneetches and laser pistols another was supposed to release poison gas the same kind Blaine had used to slaughter the people of Lud in the event of a hostile takeover Which in the view of Mordred Deschain had happened He had tried to activate both the hunterkillers and the gas neither had responded Now Mordred had a bloody nose a blue bruise on his forehead and a swollen lower lip for hed fallen out of the chair in which he sat and rolled about on the floor bellowing reedy childish cries which in no way reflected the true depth of his fury To be able to see them on at least five different screens and not be able to kill or even hurt them No wonder he was in a fury He had felt the living darkness closing in on him the darkness which signaled his change and had forced himself to be calm so the change wouldnt happen He had already discovered that the transformation from his human self to his spider self and back again consumed shocking amounts of energy Later on that might not matter but for the time being he had to be careful lest he starve like a bee in a burnedover tract of forest What Id show you is much more bizarre than anything we have looked at so far and I warn you in advance that your first impulse will be to laugh Thats all right Laugh if you must Just dont take your eye off what you see for even in your imagination here is a creature which can do you damage Remember that it came of two fathers both of them killers FIVE Now only a few hours after his birth Mias chap already weighed twenty pounds and had the look of a healthy sixmonths baby Mordred wore a single garment a makeshift towel diaper which Nigel had put on when he had brought the baby his first meal of Dogan wildlife The child needed a diaper for he could not as yet hold his waste He understood that control over these functions would be his soonperhaps before the day was out if he continued to grow at his current ratebut it couldnt happen soon enough to suit him He was for the nonce imprisoned in this idiotic infants body To be trapped in such a fashion was hideous To fall out of the chair and be capable of nothing more than lying there waving his bruised arms and legs bleeding and squalling DNK  would have come to pick him up could no more resist the commands of the Kings son than a lead weight dropped from a high window can resist the pull of gravity but Mordred didnt dare call him Already the brown bitch suspected something wasnt right with Nigel The brown bitch was wickedly perceptive and Mordred himself was terribly vulnerable He was able to control every piece of machinery in the Arc  station mating with machinery was one of his many talents but as he lay on the floor of the room with CONTROL CENTER on the door it had been called The Head back in the longago before the world moved on Mordred was coming to realize how few machines there were to control No wonder his father wanted to push down the Tower and begin again This world was broken Hed needed to change back into the spider in order to regain the chair where hed once again resumed his human shape but by the time he made it his stomach was rumbling and his mouth was sour with hunger It wasnt just changing that sucked up the energy hed come to suspect the spider was closer to his true form and when he was in that shape his metabolism ran hot and fast His droughts changed as well and there was an attraction to that because his human thoughts were colored by emotions over which he seemed to have no control although he supposed he might in time that were mostly unpleasant As a spider his thoughts werent real thoughts at all at least not in the human sense they were dark bellowing things that seemed to rise out of some wet interior ground They were about EAT and ROAM and RAPE and KILL The many delightful ways to do these things rumbled through the dantetes rudimentary consciousness like huge headlighted machines that went speeding unheeding through the worlds darkest weather To think in such a wayto let go of his human halfwas immensely attractive but he thought that to do so now while he had almost no defenses would get him killed And almost already had He raised his right armpink and smooth and perfecdy nakedso he could look down at his right hip This was where the brown bitch had shot him and although Mordred had grown considerably since then had doubled both in length and weight the wound remained open seeping blood and some custardy stuff dark yellow and stinking He diought that this wound in his human body would never heal No more than his other body would ever be able to grow back the leg the bitch had shot off And had she not stumbledka aye he had no doubt of itthe shot would have taken his head off instead of his leg and then the game would have been over because There was a harsh croaking buzz He looked into the monitor that showed the other side of the main entry and saw the domestic robot standing there with a sack in one hand The sack was twitching and the blackhaired clumsily diapered baby sitting at the banks of monitors immediately began to salivate He reached out one endearingly pudgy hand and punched a series of buttons The security rooms curved outer door slid open and Nigel stepped into the vestibule which was built like an airlock Mordred went immediately on to the buttons that would open the inner door in response to the sequence  but his motor control was still almost nonexistent and he was rewarded by another harsh buzz and an infuriating female voice infuriating because it reminded him of the brown bitchs voice which said YOU HAVE ENTERED THE WRONG SECURITY CODE FOR THIS DOOR YOU MAY RETRY ONCE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN SECONDS TEN NINE Mordred would have said Fuck you if hed been capable of speech but he wasnt The best he could do was a babble of babytalk that undoubtedly would have caused Mia to crow with a mothers pride Now he didnt bother with the buttons he wanted what the robot had in die bag too badly The rats he assumed they were rats were alive this time Alive by God the blood still running in their veins Mordred closed his eyes and concentrated The red light Susannah had seen before his first change once more ran beneath his fair skin from the crown of his head to the stained right heel When that light passed the open wound in the babys hip the sluggish flow of blood and pussy matter grew briefly stronger and Mordred uttered a low cry of misery His hand went to the wound and spread blood over the small bowl of his belly in a thoughtless comforting gesture For a moment there was a sense of blackness rising to replace the red flush accompanied by a wavering of the infants shape This time there was no transformation however The baby slumped back in the chair breathing hard a tiny trickle of clear urine dribbling from his penis to wet the front of the towel he wore There was a muffled pop from beneath the control panel in front of the chair where the baby slumped askew panting like a dog Across the room a door marked MAIN ACCESS slid open Nigel tramped stolidly in twitching his capsule of a head almost constantly now counting off not in two or three languages but in perhaps as many as a dozen Sir I really cannot continue to Mordred made a babys cheerful googoogaga sounds and held out his hands toward the bag The thought which he sent was both clear and cold Shut up Give me what I need Nigel put the bag in his lap From within it came a cheeping sound almost like human speech and for the first time Mordred realized that the twitches were all coming from a single creature Not a rat then Something bigger Bigger and bloodier He opened the bag and peered in A pair of goldringed eyes the hoohoo bird he didnt know its name and then he saw die thing had fur not feathers It was a throcken known in many parts of MidWorld as a billybumbler this one barely old enough to be off its mothers teat There now there he thought at it his mouth filling with drool Were in the same boat my little cullywere motherless children in a hard cruel world Be still and Ill give you comfort Dealing with a creature as young and simpleheaded as this wasnt much different from dealing with the machines Mordred looked into its thoughts and located the node that controlled its simple bit of will He reached for it with a hand made of thoughtmade of his willand seized it For a moment he could hear the creatures timid hopeful thought dont hurt me please dont hurt me please let me live I want to live have fun play a little dont hurt me please dont hurt me please let me live and he responded All is well dont fear cully all is well The bumbler in the bag Nigel had found it in the motorpool separated from its mother brothers and sisters by the closing of an automatic door relaxednot believing exactly but hoping to believe SIX In Nigels study the lights had been turned down to quarterbrilliance When Oy began to whine Jake woke at once The others slept on at least for the time being Whats wrong Oy The bumbler didnt reply only went on whining deep in his throat His goldringed eyes peered into the gloomy far corner of the study as if seeing something terrible there Jake could remember peering into the corner of his bedroom the same way after waking from some nightmare in the small hours of die morning a dream of Frankenstein or Dracula or Tyrannasorbet Wrecks some other boogeyman God knew what Now thinking that perhaps bumblers also had nightmares he tried even harder to touch Oys mind There was nothing at first then a deep blurred image eyes eyes looking out of the darkness of something that might have been a billybumbler in a sack Shhhh he whispered into Oys ear putting his arms around him Dont wake em they need their sleep Leep Oy said very low You just had a bad dream Jake whispered Sometimes I have them too Theyre not real Nobodys got you in a bag Go back to sleep Leep Oy put his snout on his right forepaw Oybe kiyit Thats right Jake thought at him Oy be quiet The goldringed eyes still looking troubled remained open a bit longer Then Oy winked at Jake with one and closed both A moment later the bumbler was asleep again Somewhere close by one of his kind had died but dying was the way of the world it was a hard world and always had been Oy dreamed of being with Jake beneath the great orange orb of the Peddlers Moon Jake also sleeping picked it up by touch and they dreamed of Old Cheap Rover Mans Moon together Oy who died asked Jake beneath the Peddlers oneeyed knowing wink Oy said his friend Delah Many Beneath the Old Cheap Mans empty orange stare Oy said no more had in fact found a dream within his dream and here also Jake went with him This dream was better In it the two of them were playing together in bright sunshine To them came another bumbler a sad fellow by his look He tried to talk to them but neither Jake nor Oy could tell what he said because he was speaking in English SEVEN Mordred wasnt strong enough to lift the bumbler from the bag and Nigel either would not or could not help him The robot only stood inside the door of the Control Center twisting his head to one side or the other counting and clanking more loudly than ever A hot cooked smell had begun to rise from his innards Mordred succeeded in turning the bag over and the bumbler probably half a yearling fell into his lap Its eyes were halfopen but the yellowandblack orbs were dull and unmoving Mordred threw his head back grimacing in concentration That red flash ran down his body and his hair tried to stand on end Before it could do more than begin to rise however it and the infants body to which it had been attached were gone The spider came It hooked four of its seven legs about the bumblers body and drew it effortlessly up to the craving mouth In twenty seconds it had sucked the bumbler dry It plunged its mouth into the creatures soft underbelly tore it open lifted the body higher and ate the guts which came tumbling out delicious strengthgiving packages of dripping meat It ate deeper making muffled mewling sounds of satisfaction snapping the billybum biers spine and sucking the brief dribble of marrow Most of the energy was in the bloodaye always in the blood as the Grandfathers well knewbut there was strength in meat as well As a human baby Roland had used the old Gilead endearment bahbo he could have taken no nourishment from either the juice or the meat Would likely have choked to death on it But as a spider He finished and cast the corpse aside onto the floor just as he had the usedup desiccated corpses of the rats Nigel that dedicated busding butler had disposed of those He would not dispose of this one Nigel stood silent no matter how many times Mordred bawled Nigel I need you Around the robot the smell of charred plastic had grown strong enough to activate the overhead fans DNK  stood with his eyeless face turned to the left It gave him an oddly inquisitive look as if hed died while on the verge of asking an important question What is the meaning of life perhaps or Who put the overalls in Mrs Murphys chowder In any case his brief career as a rat and bumblercatcher was over For the time being Mordred was full of energythe meal had been fresh and wonderfulbut that wouldnt last long If he stayed in his spidershape hed use up this new reservoir of strength even faster If he went back to being a baby however he wouldnt even be able to get down from the chair in which he was sitting or once more put on the diaperwhich had of course slid off his body when he changed But he had to change back for in his spidershape he couldnt tfiink clearly at all As for deductive reasoning The idea was a bitter joke The white node on the spiders back closed its human eyes and the black body beneath flushed a congested red The legs retracted toward the body and disappeared The node which was the babys head grew and gained detail as the body beneath paled and took on human shape the childs blue eyesbombardier eyes gunslinger eyesflashed He was still full of strength from the bumblers blood and meat he could feel it as the transformation rushed toward its conclusion but a distressing amount of it something like the foam on top of a glass of beer had already dissipated And not just from switching back and forth either The fact was that he was growing at a headlong pace That sort of growth required relentless nourishment and there was damned little nourishment to be had in the Arc  Experimental Station Or in Fedic beyond for that matter There were canned goods and meals in foil packets and powdered power drinks yar plenty of those but none of what was here would feed him as he needed to be fed He needed fresh meat and even more than meat he needed blood And the blood of animals would sustain the avalanche of his growth for only so long Very soon he was going to need human blood or the pace of his growth would first slow then stop The pain of starvation would come but that pain twisting relentlessly in his vitals like an auger would be nothing to the mental and spiritual pain of watching them on the various video screens still alive reunited in their fellowship with the comfort of a cause The pain of seeing him Roland of Gilead How he wondered did he know the things he knew From his mother Some of them yes for hed felt a million of Mias thoughts and memories a good many of them swiped from Susannah rush into him as he fed on her But to know it was that way with the Grandfathers as well how did he know that That for instance a German vampire who swilled the lifes blood of a Frenchman might speak French for a week or ten days speak it like a native and then the ability like his victims memories would begin to fade How could he know a thing like that Did it matter Now he watched them sleep The boy Jake had awakened but only briefly Earlier Mordred had watched them eat four fools and a bumblerfull of blood full of energydining in a circle together Always they would sit in a circle they would make that circle even when they stopped to rest five minutes on the trail doing it without even being aware of it their circle that kept die rest of the world out Mordred had no circle Although he was new he already understood that outsidewas his ka just as it was the ka of winters wind to swing through only half die compass from north to east and then back again to bleak north once more He accepted this yet he still looked at them with the outsiders resentment knowing he would hurt them and that the satisfaction would be bitter He was of two worlds the foretold joining of Prim and Am of gadosh and godosh of Gan and Gilead He was in a way like Jesus Christ but in a way he was purer than the sheepgodman for the sheepgodman had but one true father who was in the highly hypothetical heaven and a stepfather who was on Earth Poor old Joseph who wore horns put on him by God Himself Mordred Deschain on the other hand had two fathers One of whom now slept on the screen before him Youre old Father he thought It gave him vicious pleasure to think so it also made him feel small and mean no more than well no more than a spider looking down from its web Mordred was twins and would remain twins until Roland of the Eld was dead and the last katet broken And the longing voice that told him to go to Roland and call him father To call Eddie and Jake his brothers Susannah his sister That was the gullible voice of his mother Theyd kill him before he could get a single word out of his mouth assuming he had reached a stage where he could do more than gurgle babytalk Theyd cut off his balls and feed them to the brats bumbler Theyd bury his castrated corpse and shit on the ground where he lay and then move on You re finally old Father and now you walk with a limp and at end of day I see you rub your hip with a hand thats picked up the tiniest bit of a shake Look if you would Here sits a baby with blood streaking his fair skin Here sits a baby weeping his silent eerie tears Here sits a baby that knows both too much and too little and although we must keep our fingers away from his mouth he snaps this one snaps like a baby crocodile we are allowed to pity him a litde If ka is a trainand it is a vast hurding mono maybe sane maybe notthen this nasty litde lycanthrope is its most vulnerable hostage not tied to the tracks like little Nell but strapped to the things very headlight He may tell himself he has two fathers and diere may be some truth to it but there is no father here and no mother either He ate his mother alive say true ate her bigbig she was his first meal and what choice did he have about that He is the last miracle ever to be spawned by the stillstanding Dark Tower the scarred wedding of the rational and the irrational the natural and die supernatural and yet he is alone and he is ahungry Destiny might have intended him to rule a chain of universes or destroy them all but so far he has succeeded in establishing dominion over nothing but one old domestic robot who has now gone to the clearing at the end of the path He looks at the sleeping gunslinger with love and hate loathing and longing But suppose he went to them and was not killed What if they were to welcome him in Ridiculous idea yes but allow it for the sake of argument Even then he would be expected to set Roland above him accept Roland as dinh and that he will never do never do no never do ONE You were watching them said a soft laughing voice Then it lilted a bit of cradle nonsense Roland would have remembered well from his own early childhood Penny posy Jacks anosy Do ya say so Yes I doso Hes my sneaky peeky darling bahbo Did you like what you saw before you fell asleep Did you watch them move on with the rest of the failing world Perhaps ten hours had passed since Nigel the domestic robot had performed his last duty Mordred who in fact had fallen deeply asleep turned his head toward the voice of the stranger with no residual fuzzyheadedness or surprise He saw a man in bluejeans and a hooded parka standing on the gray tiles of the Control Center His gunnanothing more than a beatup duffelbaglay at his feet His cheeks were flushed his face handsome his eyes burning hot In his hand was an automatic pistol and as he looked into the dark eye of its muzzle Mordred Deschain for the second time realized that even gods could die once their divinity had been diluted with human blood But he wasnt afraid Not of this one He did look back into the monitors that showed Nigels apartment and confirmed that the newcomer was right it was empty The smiling stranger who seemed to have sprung from the very floor raised the hand not holding the gun to the hood of his parka and turned a bit of it outward Mordred saw a flash of metal Some kind of woven wire coated the inside of the hood I call it my thinkingcap said the stranger I cant hear your thoughts which is a drawback but you cant get into my head which is a which is a definite advantage wouldnt you say which is a definite advantage wouldnt you say There were two patches on the jacket One read US ARMY and showed a birdthe eaglebird not the hoohoo bird The other patch was a name RANDALL FLAGG Mordred discovered also with no surprise that he could read easily Because if youre anything like your fatherthe redone that isthen your mental powers may exceed mere communication The man in the parka tittered He didnt want Mordred to know he was afraid Perhaps hed convinced himself he wasnt afraid that hed come here of his own free will Maybe he had It didnt matter to Mordred one way or the other Nor did the mans plans which jumbled and ran in his head like hot soup Did the man really believe the thinkingcap had closed off his thoughts Mordred looked closer pried deeper and saw the answer was yes Very convenient In any case I believe a bit of protection to be very prudent Prudence is always the wisest course how else did I survive the fall of Farson and the death of Gilead I wouldnt want you to get in my head and walk me off a high building now would I Although why would you You need me or someone now that yon bucket of bolts has gone silent and you just a bahbo who cant tie his own clout across the crack of his shitty ass The strangerwho was really no stranger at alllaughed Mordred sat in the chair and watched him On the side of the childs cheek was a pink weal for hed gone to sleep with his small hand against the side of his small face The newcomer said I think we can communicate very well if I talk and you nod for yes or shake your head for no Knock on your chair if you dont understand Simple enough Do you agree Mordred nodded The newcomer found the steady blue glare of those eyes unsettlingtres unsettlingbut tried not to show it He wondered again if coming here had been the right thing to do but he had tracked Mias course ever since she had kindled and why if not for this It was a dangerous game agreed but now there were only two creatures who could unlock the door at the foot of the Tower before the Tower fell which it would and soon because the writer had only days left to live in his world and the final Books of the Towerthree of themremained unwritten In the last one that was written in that key world Rolands katet had banished sai Randy Flagg from a dreampalace on an interstate highway a palace that had looked to Eddie Susannah and Jake like the Castle of Oz the Great and Terrible Oz the Green King may it do ya fine They had in fact almost killed that bad old bumhug Walter o Dim thereby providing what some would no doubt call a happy ending But beyond page of Wizard and Glass not a word about Roland and the Dark Tower had Stephen King written and Walter considered this the real happy ending The people of Calla Bryn Sturgis the roont children Mia and Mias baby all those things were still sleeping inchoate in the writers subconscious creatures without breath pent behind an unfound door And now Walter judged it was too late to set them free Damnably quick though King had been throughout his careera genuinely talented writer whod turned himself into a shoddy but rich quicksketch artist a rhymeless Algernon Swinburne do it please yahe couldnt get through even the first hundred pages of the remaining tale in the time he had left not if he wrote day and night Too late There had been a day of choice as Walter well knew he had been at he Casse Roi Russe and had seen it in the glass ball the Old Red Thing still possessed although by now it no doubt lay forgotten in some castle corner By the summer of  King had clearly known the story of the Wolves the twins and the flying plates called Orizas But to the writer all that had seemed like too much work He had chosen a book of loosely interlocked stories called Hearts in Atlantis instead and even now in his home on Turtleback Lane where he had never seen so much as a single walkin the writer was frittering away the last of his time writing about peace and love and Vietnam It was true that one character in what would be Kings last book had a part to play in the Dark Towers history as it might be but that fellowan old man with talented brainswould never get a chance to speak lines that really mattered Lovely In the only world that really mattered the true world where time never turns back and there are no second chances tell ya true it was June th of  The writers time had shrunk to less than two hundred hours Walter o Dim knew he didnt have quite that long to reach the Dark Tower because time like the metabolism of certain spiders ran faster and hotter on this side of things Say five days Five and a half at the outside He had that long to reach the Tower with Mordred Deschains birthmarked amputated foot in his gunna to open the door at the bottom and mount those murmuring stairs to bypass the trapped Red King If he could find a vehicle or the right door Was it too late to become the God of All Perhaps not In any case what harm in trying Walter o Dim had wandered long and under a hundred names but the Tower had always been his goal Like Roland he wanted to climb it and see what lived at the top If anything did He had belonged to none of the cliques and cults and faiths and factions that had arisen in the confused years since the Tower began to totter although he wore their siguls when it suited him His service to the Crimson King was a late thing as was his service to John Farson the Good Man whod brought down Gilead the last bastion of civilization in a tide of blood and murder Walter had done his own share of murder in those years living a long and only quasimortal life He had witnessed the end of what he had then believed to be Rolands last katet at Jericho Hill Witnessed it That was a little overmodest by all the gods and fishes Under the name of Rudin Filaro he had fought with his face painted blue had screamed and charged with the rest of the stinking barbarians and had brought down Cuthbert Allgood himself with an arrow through the eye Yet through all that hed kept his gaze on the Tower Perhaps that was why the damned gunslingeras the sun went down on that days work Roland of Gilead had been the last of themhad been able to escape having buried himself in a cart filled with the dead and then creeping out of the slaughterpile at sundown just before the whole works had been set alight He had seen Roland years earlier in Mejis and had just missed his grip on him there too although he put that mostly down to Eldred Jonas he of the quavery voice and the long gray hair and Jonas had paid The King had told him then that they werent done with Roland that the gunslinger would begin the end of matters and ultimately cause the tumble of that which he wished to save Walter hadnt begun to believe that until the Mohaine Desert where he had looked around one day and discovered a certain gunslinger on his backtrail one who had grown old over the course of falling years and hadnt completely believed it until the reappearance of Mia who fulfilled an old and grave prophecy by giving birth to the Crimson Kings son Certainly the Old Red Thing was of no more use to him but even in his imprisonment and insanity heitwas dangerous Still until hed had Roland to complete himto make him greater than his own destiny perhapsWalter o Dim had been little more than a wanderer left over from the old days a mercenary with a vague ambition to penetrate the Tower before it was brought down Was that not what had brought him to the Crimson King in the first place Yes And it wasnt his fault that the great scuttering spiderking had run mad Never mind Here was his son with the same mark on his heelWalter could see it at this very momentand everything balanced Of course hed need to be careful The thing in the chair looked helpless perhaps even thought it was helpless but it wouldnt do to underestimate it just because it looked like a baby Walter slipped the gun into his pocket for the moment only for the moment and held his hands out empty and palms up Then he closed one of them into a fist which he raised to his forehead Slowly never taking his eyes from Mordred wary lest he should change Walter had seen that change and what had happened to the little beasts mother the newcomer dropped to one knee Hile Mordred Deschain son of Roland of Gilead that was and of the Crimson King whose name was once spoken from EndWorld to OutWorld hile you son of two fathers both of them descended from Arthur Eld first king to rise after the Prim receded and Guardian of the Dark Tower For a moment nothing happened In the Control Center there was only silence and the lingering smell of Nigels fried circuits Then the baby lifted its chubby fists opened them and raised his hands Rise bondsman and come to me TWO Its best you not think strong in any case the newcomer said stepping closer They knew you were here and Roland is almighty Christing clever trigdelah is he He caught up with me once you know and I thought I was done I truly did From his gunna the man who sometimes called himself Flagg on another level of the Tower he had brought an entire world to ruin under that name had taken peanut butter and crackers Hed asked permission of his new dinh and the baby although bitterly hungry himself had nodded regally Now Walter sat crosslegged on the floor eating rapidly secure in his thinkingcap unaware there was an intruder inside and all that he knew was being ransacked He was safe until that ransacking was done but afterward Mordred raised one chubby babyhand in the air and swooped it gracefully down in the shape of a question mark How did I escape Walter asked Why I did what any true cozener would do in such circumstancestold him the truth Showed him the Tower at least several levels of it It stunned him right and proper and while he was open in such fashion I took a leaf from his own book and hypnotized him We were in one of the fistulas of time which sometimes swirl out from the Tower and the world moved on all around us as we had our palaver in that bony place aye I brought more boneshuman onesand while he slept I dressed em in what was left of my own clothes I could have killed him then but what of the Tower if I had eh What of you for that matter You never would have come to be Its fair to say Mordred that by allowing Roland to live and draw his three I saved your life before your life was even kindled so I did I stole away to the seashorefelt in need of a little vacation hee When Roland got there he went one way toward the three doors Id gone the other Mordred my dear and here I am He laughed through a mouthful of crackers and sprayed crumbs on his chin and shirt Mordred smiled but he was revolted This was what he was supposed to work with this A crackergobbling crumbspewing fool who was too full of his own past exploits to sense his present danger or to know his defenses had been breached By all the gods he deserved to die But before that could happen there were two more things he needed One was to know where Roland and his friends had gone The other was to be fed This fool would serve both purposes And what made it easy Why that Walter had also grown oldold and lethally sure of himselfand too vain to realize it You may wonder why Im here and not about your fathers business Walter said Do you Mordred didnt but he nodded just the same His stomach rumbled In truth I am about his business Walter said and gave his most charming smile spoiled somewhat by the peanut butter on his teeth He had once probably known that any statement beginning with the words In truth is almost always a lie No more Too old to know Too vain to know Too stupid to remember But he was wary all the same He could feel the childs force In his head Rummaging around in his head Surely not The thing trapped in the babys body was powerful but surely not that powerful Walter leaned forward earnestly clasping his knees Your Red Father is indisposed As a result of having lived so close to the Tower for so long and having thought upon it so deeply I have no doubt Its down to you to finish what he began Ive come to help you in that work Mordred nodded as if pleased He was pleased But ah he was also so hungry You may have wondered how I reached you in this supposedly secure chamber Walter said In truth I helped build this place in what Roland would call the longago That phrase again as obvious as a wink He had put the gun in the left pocket of his parka Now from the right he withdrew a gadget the size of a cigarettepack pulled out a silver antenna and pushed a button A section of the gray tiles withdrew silently revealing a flight of stairs Mordred nodded Walteror Randall Flagg if that was what he was currently calling himselfhad indeed come out of the floor A neat trick but of course he had once served Rolands father Steven as Gileads court magician hadnt he Under the name of Marten A man of many faces and many neat tricks was Walter o Dim but never as clever as he seemed to think Not by half For Mordred now had the final thing he had been looking for which was the way Roland and his friends had gotten out of here There was no need to pluck it from its hiding place in Walters mind after all He only needed to follow the fools backtrail First however Walters smile had faded a little Didee say something sire For I thought I heard the sound of your voice far back in my mind The baby shook his head And who is more believable than a baby Are their faces not the very definition of guilelessness and innocence Id take you with me and go after them if youd come Walter said What a team wed make Theyve gone to the devartoi in Thunderclap to release the Breakers Ive already promised to meet your fatheryour White Fatherand his katet should they dare go on and thats a promise I intend to keep For hear me well Mordred the gunslinger Roland Deschain has stood against me at every turn and Ill bear it no more No more Do you hear His voice was rising in fury Mordred nodded innocently widening his pretty babys eyes in what might have been taken for fear fascination or both Certainly Walter o Dim seemed to preen beneath his regard and really the only question now was when to take himimmediately or later Mordred was very hungry but thought he would hold off at least a bit longer There was something oddly compelling about watching this fool stitching the last few inches of his fate with such earnestness Once again Mordred drew the shape of a question mark in the air Any last vestige of a smile faded from Walters face What do I truly want Is that what youre asking for Mordred nodded yes Tisnt the Dark Tower at all if you want the truth its Roland who stays on my mind and in my heart I want him dead Walter spoke with flat and unsmiling finality For the long and dusty leagues hes chased me for all the trouble hes caused me and for the Red King as wellthe tmeKing ye do ken for his presumption in refusing to give over his quest no matter what obstacles were placed in his path most of all for the death of his mother whom I once loved And in an undertone Or at least coveted In either case it was he who killed her No matter what part I or Rhea of the Coos may have played in that matter it was the boy himself who stopped her breath with his damned guns slow head and quick hands As for the end of the universe I say let it come as it will in ice fire or darkness What did the universe ever do for me that I should mind its welfare All I know is that Roland of Gilead has lived too long and I want that son of a bitch in the ground And those hes drawn too For the third and last time Mordred drew the shape of a question in the air Theres only a single working door from here to the devartoi young master Its the one the Wolves use or used I think theyve made their last run so I do Roland and his friends have gone through it but thats all right theres plenty to occupy em right where they come outthey might find the reception a bit hot Mayhap we can take care of em while theyve got the Breakers and the remaining Children of Roderick and the true guards o die watch to worry about Would you like that The infant nodded an affirmative with no hesitation He then put his fingers to his mouth and chewed at them Yes Walter said His grin shone out Hungry of course you are But Im sure we can do better than rats and halfgrown billybumblers when it comes to dinner Dont you Mordred nodded again He was sure they could too Will I play the good da and carry you Walter asked That way you dont have to change to your spiderself Ugh Not a shape tis easy to love or even like I must say Mordred was holding up his arms Wont shit on me will you Walter asked casually halting halfway across the floor His hand slid into his pocket and Mordred realized with a touch of alarm that the sly bastard had been hiding something from him just the same he knew the socalled thinkingcap wasnt working Now he meant to use the gun after all THREE In fact Mordred gave Walter o Dim far too much credit but isnt that a trait of the young perhaps even a survival skill To a wideeyed lad the tacky tricks of the worlds most hamfisted prestidigitator look like miracles Walter did not actually realize what was happening until very late in the game but he was a wily old survivor tell ya true and when understanding came it came entire Theres a phrase the elephant in the living room which purports to describe what its like to live with a drug addict an alcoholic an abuser People outside such relationships will sometimes ask How could you let such a business go on for so many years Didnt you see the elephant in the living mam And its so hard for anyone living in a more normal situation to understand the answer that comes closest to the truth Im sorry but it was there when I moved in I didnt know it was an elephant I thought it was part of the furniture There comes an for some folksthe lucky oneswhen they suddenly recognize the difference And that moment came for Walter It came too late but not by much Ytvont shit on me will youthat was the question he asked but between the word shit and the phrase on me he suddenly realized there was an intruder in his house and it had been there all along Not a baby either this was a gangling slopeheaded adolescent with pockmarked skin and dully curious eyes It was perhaps the best truest visualization Walter could have made for Mordred Deschain as he at that moment existed a teenage housebreaker probably high on some aerosol cleaning product And he had been there all the time God how could he not have known The housebreaker hadnt even been hiding He had been right out in the open standing there against the wall gapemouthed and taking it all in His plans for bringing Mordred with himof using him to end Rolands life if the guards at the devartoi couldnt do it first that was then killing the litde bastard and taking his valuable left footcollapsed in an instant In the next one a new plan arose and it was simplicity itself Mustnt let him see that I know One shot thats all I can risk and only because I must risk it Then I run If hes dead fine If not perhaps hell starve before Then Walter realized his hand had stopped Four fingers had closed around the butt of the gun in the jacket pocket but they were now frozen One was very near the trigger but he couldnt move that either It might as well have been buried in cement And now Walter clearly saw the shining wire for the first time It emerged from the toothless pinkgummed mouth of the baby sitting in the chair crossed the room glittering beneath the lights and then encircled him at chestlevel binding his arms to his sides He understood the wire wasnt really there but at the same time it was He couldnt move FOUR Mordred didnt see the shining wire perhaps because hed never read Watership Down Hed had the chance to explore Susannahs mind however and what he saw now was remarkably like Susannahs Dogan Only instead of switches saying things sj like CHAP and EMOTIONAL TEMP he saw ones that controlled f Walters ambulation this one he quickly turned to OFF cogitation and motivation It was certainly a more complex setup than the one in the young bumblers headthere hed found nothing but a few simple nodes like granny knotsbut still not difficult to operate The only problem was that he was a baby A damned baby stuck in a chair If he really meant to change this delicatessen on legs into coldcuts hed have to move quickly FIVE Walter o Dim was not too old to be gullible he understood that nowhed underestimated the little monster relying too much on what it looked like and not enough on his own knowledge of what it wasbut he was at least beyond the young mans trap of total panic If he means to do anything besides sit in that chair and look at me hell have to change When he does his control may slip Thatll be my chance Its not much but its the only one I have left At that moment he saw a brilliant red light run down the babys skin from crown to toes In the wake of it the chubbypink bahbos body began to darken and swell the spiders legs bursting out through his sides At the same instant the shining wire coming out of the babys mouth disappeared and Walter felt the suffocating band which had been holding him in place disappear No time to risk even a single shot not now Run Run from him from it Thats all you can do You never should have come here in the first place You let your hatred of the gunslinger blind you but it still may not be too la He turned to the trapdoor even as this thought raced through his mind and was about to put his foot on the first step when the shining wire reestablished itself this time not looping around his arms and chest but around his throat like a garrote Gagging and choking and spewing spit eyes bulging from their sockets Walter turned jerkily around The loop around his throat loosened the barest bit At the same time he felt something very like an invisible hand skim up his brow and push the hood back from his head Hed always gone dressed in such fashion when he could in certain provinces to the south even of Garlan he had been known as Walter Hodji the latter word meaning both dim and hood But this particular lid borrowed from a certain deserted house in the town of French Landing Wisconsin had done him no good at all had it I think I may have come to the end of the path he thought as he saw the spider strutting toward him on its seven legs a bloated lively thing livelier than the baby aye and four thousand times as ugly with a freakish blob of human head peering over the hairy curve of its back On its belly Walter could see the red mark that had been on the babys heel Now it had an hourglass shape like the one that marks the female black widow and he understood that was the mark hed have wanted killing the baby and amputating its foot likely would have done him no good at all It seemed he had been wrong all down the line The spider reared up on its four back legs The three in front pawed at Walters jeans making a low and ghastly scratching sound The things eyes bulged up at him with that dull intruders curiosity which he had already imagined too well Oh yes Im afraid its the end of the path for you Huge in his head Booming like words from a loudspeaker But you intended the same forme didnt you No At least not immediately But you did Dont kid a kidder as Susannah would say So now I do the one you call my White Father a small favor You may not have been his greatest enemy Walter Padick as you were called when you set out all in the longago but you were his oldest I grant And now I take you out of his road Walter did not realize he had held onto some dim hope of escape even with the loathsome thing before him reared up the eyes staring at him with dull avidity while the mouth drooled until he heard for the first time in a thousand years the name a boy from a farm in Delain had once answered to Walter Padick Walter son of Sam the Miller in the Eastard Barony He who had run away at thirteen had been raped in the ass by another wanderer a year later and yet had somehow withstood the temptation to go crawling back home Instead he had moved on toward his destiny Walter Padick At die sound of that voice the man who had sometimes called himself Marten Richard Fannin Rudin Filaro and Randall Flagg among a great many odiers gave over all hope except for die hope of dying well I be ahungry Mordred be ahungry spoke the relentless voice in the middle of Walters head a voice that came to him along the shining wire of the litde kings will But Id eat proper beginning with the appetizerYour eyes I think Give them to me Walter struggled mightily but without so much as a moments success The wire was too strong He saw his hands rise and hover in front of his face He saw his fingers bend into hooks They pushed up his eyelids like windowshades then dug the orbs out from die top He could hear the sounds they made as they tore loose of die tendons which turned them and the optic nerves which relayed dieir marvelous messages The sound diat marked die end of sight was low and wet Bright red dashes of light filled his head and then darkness rushed in forever In Walters case forever wouldnt last long but if time is subjective and most of us know that it is then it was far too long Give them to me I say No more dillydallying Im ahungry Walter o Dimnow Walter o Darkturned his hands over and dropped his eyeballs They trailed filaments as they fell making them look a litde like tadpoles The spider snatched one out of the air The other plopped to the tile where die surprisingly limber claw at the end of one leg picked it up and tucked it into the spiders mouth Mordred popped it like a grape but did not swallow rather he let die delicious slime trickle down his throat Lovely Tongue next please Walter wrapped an obedient hand around it and pulled but succeeded in ripping it only partly loose In the end it was too slippery He would have wept with agony and frustration if the bleeding sockets where his eyes had been could have manufactured tears He reached for it again but die spider was too greedy to wait Bend down Poke your tongue out like you would at your honeys cunny Quick for your fathers sake Mordreds ahungry Walter still all too aware of what was happening to him struggled against this fresh horror with no more success than against the last He bent over with his hands on his thighs and his bleeding tongue stuck crookedly out between his lips wavering wearily as the hemorrhaging muscles at the back of his mouth tried to support it Once more he heard the scrabbling sounds as Mordreds front legs scratched at the legs of his denim pants The spiders hairy maw closed over Walters tongue sucked it like a lollipop for one or two blissful seconds and then tore it free with a single powerful wrench Walternow speechless as well as eyelessuttered a swollen scream of pain and fell over clutching at his distorted face rolling back and forth on the tiles Mordred bit down on the tongue in his moudi It burst into a bliss of blood that temporarily wiped away all thought Walter had rolled onto his side and was feeling blindly for the trapdoor something inside still screaming that he should not give up but keep trying to escape the monster that was eating him alive With the taste of blood in his mouth all interest in foreplay departed Mordred He was reduced to his central core which was mostly appetite He pounced upon Randall Flagg Walter o Dim Walter Padick that was There were more screams but only a few And then Rolands old enemy was no more SIX The man had been quasiimmortal a phrase at least as foolish as most unique and made a legendary meal After gorging on so much Mordreds first urgestrong but not quite insurmountablewas to vomit He controlled it as he did his second one which was even stronger to change back to his babyself and sleep If he was to find the door of which Walter had spoken the best time to do so was right now and in a shape which would make it possible to hurry along at a good speed the shape of the spider So passing the desiccated corpse without a glance Mordred scarpered nimbly through the trapdoor and down the stairs and into a corridor below This passage smelled strongly of alkali and seemed to have been cut out of the desert bedrock All of Walters knowledgeat least fifteen hundred years of itbellowed in his brain The dark mans backtrail eventually led to an elevator shaft When a brisuy claw pressed on the UP button produced nothing but a tired humming from far above and a smell like frying shoeleather from behind the control panel Mordred climbed the cars inner wall pushed up the maintenance hatch with a slender leg and squeezed through That he had to squeeze did not surprise him he was bigger now He climbed the cable itsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout until he came to the door where his senses told him Walter had entered the elevator and then sent it on its last ride Twenty minutes later and still jazzing on all that wonderful blood gallons of the stuff it had seemed he came to a place where Walters trail divided This might have posed him child that he still very much was but here the scent and the sense of the others joined Walters track and Mordred went that way now following Roland and his katet rather than the magicians backtrail Waiter must have followed them for awhile and then turned around to find Mordred To find his fate Twenty minutes later the little fellow came to a door marked with no word but a sigul he could read well enough The question was whether to open it now or to wait Childish eagerness clamored for the former growing prudence for the latter He had been wellfed and had no need of more nourishment especially if he changed back to his humeself for awhile Also Roland and his friends might still be on the far side of this door Suppose they were and drew their weapons at the sight of him They were infernally fast and he could be killed by gunfire He could wait felt no deep need beyond the eagerness of the child that wants everything and wants it now Certainly he didnt suffer the bright intensity of Walters hate His own feelings were more complex tinctured by sadness and loneliness andyes hed do better to admit itlove Mordred felt he wanted to enjoy this melancholy for awhile There would be food aplenty on the other side of this door he was sure of it so hed eat And grow And watch He would watch his father and his sistermother and his kabrothers Eddie and Jake Hed watch them camp at night and light their fires and form their circle around it Hed watch from his place that was outside Perhaps they would feel him and look uneasily into the dark wondering what was out there He approached the door reared up before it and pawed at it questioningly Too bad really there wasnt a peephole And it probably would be safe to go through now What had Walter said That Rolands katet meant to release the Breakers whatever they might be it had been in Walters mind but Mordred hadnt bothered looking for it Theres plenty to occupy em right where they come outthey might find the reception a trifle hot Had Roland and his children perhaps been killed on the other side Ambushed Mordred believed he would have known had that happened Would have felt it in his mind like a Beamquake In any case he would wait awhile before creeping through the door with the cloudandlightning sigul on it And when he was through Why hed find them And overhear their palaver And watch them both awake and asleep Most of all he would watch the one Walter had called his White Father His only real father now if Walter had been right about the Crimson Kings having gone insane And for the present Now for a little while I may sleep The spider ran up the wall of this room which was full of great hanging objects and spun a web But it was the babynaked and now looking fully a year oldthat slept in it head down and high above any predators that might come hunting ONE When the four wanderers woke from their sleep Roland first and after six hours exactly there were more popkins stacked on a clothcovered tray and and also more drinks Of the domestic robot however there was no sign All right enough Roland said after calling Nigel for the third time He told us he was on his last legs seems that while we slept he fell off em He was doing something he didnt want to do Jake said His face looked pale and puffy From sleeping too heavily was Rolands first thought and then wondered how he could be such a fool The boy had been crying for Pere Callahan Doing what Eddie asked slipping his pack over one shoulder and then hoisting Susannah onto his hip For who And why I dont know Jake said He didnt want me to know and I didnt feel right about prying I know he was just a robot but with that nice English voice and all he seemed like more Thats a scruple you may need to get over Roland said as gently as he could How heavy am I sugar Susannah asked Eddie cheerfully Or maybe what I should ask is How bad you missin that good old wheelchair Not to mention the shoulderrig Suze you hated that piggyback rig from the word go and we both know it Wasnt askin about that and you know it It always fascinated Roland when Detta crept unheard into Susannahs voice oreven more spookyher face The woman herself seemed unaware of these incursions as her husband did now Id carry you to the end of the world Eddie said sentimentally and kissed the tip of her nose Unless you put on another ten pounds or so that is Then I might have to leave you and look for a lighter lady She poked himnot gently eitherand then turned to Roland This is a damn big place once youre down underneath Howre we gonna find the door that goes through to Thunderclap Roland shook his head He didnt know How bout you Cisco Eddie asked Jake Youre the one whos strong in the touch Can you use it to find the door we want Maybe if I knew how to start Jake said but I dont And with that all three of them again looked at Roland No make it four because even the godscursed bumbler was staring Eddie would have made a joke to dispel any discomfort he felt at such a combined stare and Roland actually fumbled for one Something about how too many eyes spoiled the pie maybe No That saying which hed heard from Susannah was about cooks and broth In the end he simply said Well cast about a little the way hounds do when theyve lost the scent and see what we find Maybe another wheelchair for me to ride in Susannah said brighdy This nasty white boy has got his hands all over my purity Eddie gave her a sincere look If it was really pure hon he said it wouldnt be cracked like it is TWO It was Oy who actually took over and led them but not until they returned to the kitchen The humans were poking about with a kind of aimlessness that Jake found rather unsettling when Oy began to bark out his name Ake AkeAke Theyjoined the bumbler at a chockedopen door that read CLEVEL Oy went a little way along the corridor then looked back over his shoulder eyes brilliant When he saw they werent following he barked his disappointment What do you think Roland asked Should we follow him Yes Jake said What scent has he got Eddie asked Do you know Maybe something from the Dogan Jake said The real one on the other side of the River Whye Where Oy and I overheard Ben Slightmans Da and the you know the robot Jake Eddie asked You okay kid Yes Jake said although hed had a bit of a bad turn remembering how Bennys Da had screamed Andy the Messenger Robot apparently tired of Slightmans grumbling had pushed or pinched something in the mans elbowa nerve probablyand Slightman had hollered like an owl as Roland might say and probably with at least mild contempt Slightman the Younger was beyond such things now of course and it was that realizationa boy once full of fun and now cool as riverbank claywhich had made the son of Elmer pause You had to die yes and Jake hoped he could do it at least moderately well when the hour came Hed had some training in how to do it after all It was the thought of all that gravetime that chilled him That downtime That liestillandcontinuetobedead time Andys scentcold but oily and distinctivehad been all over the Dogan on the far side of the River Whye for he and Slightman the Elder had met there many times before the Wolf raid that had been greeted by Roland and his makeshift posse This smell wasnt exactly the same but it was interesting Certainly it was the only familiar one Oy had struck so far and he wanted to follow it Wait a minute wait a minute Eddie said I see something we need He put Susannah down crossed the kitchen and returned rolling a stainlesssteel table probably meant for transporting stacks of freshly washed dishes or larger utensils Upsydaisy dont be crazy Eddie said and lifted Susannah onto it She sat there comfortably enough gripping the sides but looked dubious And when we come to a flight of stairs What then sugarboy Sugarboy will burn that bridge when he comes to it Eddie said and pushed the rolling table into the hall Mush Oy On you huskies Oy Husk The bumbler hurried briskly along bending his head every now and again to dip into the scent but mostly not bothering much It was too fresh and too wide to need much attention It was the smell of the Wolves he had found After an hours walk they passed a hangarsized door marked TO HORSES Beyond this the trail led them to a door which read STAGING AREA and AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY That they were followed for part of their hike by Walter o Dim was a thing none of them not even Jakestrong in the touch though he wassuspected On the boy at least the hooded mans thinkingcap worked quite well When Walter was sure where the bumbler was leading them hed turned back to palaver with Mordreda mistake as it turned out but one with this consolation he would never make another Oy sat before the closed door which was the kind that swung both ways with his cartoon squiggle of tail tight against his hindquarters and barked Ake opeope Ope Ake Yeah yeah Jake said in a minute Hold your water STAGING AREA Eddie said That sounds at least moderately hopeful They were still pushing Susannah on the stainlesssteel table having negotiated the only stairway theyd come to a fairly short one without too much trouble Susannah had gone down first on her butther usual mode of descentwhile Roland and Eddie carried the table along behind her Jake went between the woman and the men with Eddies gun raised the long scrolled barrel laid into the hollow of his left shoulder a position known as the guard Roland now drew his own gun laid it in the hollow of his right shoulder and pushed the door open He went through in a slight crouch ready to dive either way or jump backward if the situation demanded it The situation did not Had Eddie been first he might have believed if only momentarily that he was being attacked by flying Wolves sort of like the flying monkeys in The Wizard ofOz Roland however was not overburdened with imagination and even though a good many of the overhead fluorescent light strips in this huge barnlike space had gone out he wasted no timeor adrenalinein mistaking the suspended objects for anything but what they actually were broken robot raiders awaiting repair Come on in he said and his words came echoing back to him Somewhere high in the shadows came a flutter of wings Swallows or perhaps barnrusties that had found their way in from outside I think alls well They came and stood looking up with silent awe Only Jakes fourfooted friend was unimpressed Oy was taking advantage of the break to groom himself first the left side and then the right At last Susannah still sitting on the rolling steel table said Tell you what Ive seen a lot but I havent ever seen anything quite like this Neither had the others The huge room was thick with Wolves that seemed suspended in flight Some wore their green Dr Doom hoods and capes others hung naked save for their steel suits Some were headless some armless and a few were missing either one leg or the other Their gray metal faces seemed to snarl or grin depending on how the light hit them Lying on the floor was a litter of green capes and discarded green gaundets And about forty yards away the room itself had to stretch at least two hundred yards from end to end was a single gray horse lying on its back with its legs sticking stiffly up into the air Its head was gone From its neck there emerged tangles of yellow green and redcoated wires They walked slowly after Oy who was trotting with brisk unconcern across the room The sound of the rolling table was loud in here the returning echo a sinister rumble Susannah kept looking up At firstand only because diere was now so little light in what must once have been a place of brillianceshe thought the Wolves were floating held up by some sort of antigravity device Then they came to a place where most of the fluorescents were still working and she saw the guywires They must have repaired em in here she said If there was anyone left to do it that is And I think over theres where they powered em up Eddie said and pointed Along the far wall which they could just now begin to see clearly was a line of bays Wolves were standing stiffly in some of them Other bays were empty and in these they could see a number of plugin points Jake abruptly burst out laughing What Susannah asked What is it Nothing he said Its just that His laughter pealed out again sounding fabulously young in that gloomy chamber Its just that they look like commuters at Penn Station lined up at the pay telephones to call home or the office Eddie and Susannah considered this for a moment and then they also burst out laughing So Roland thought Jakes seeing must have been true After all theyd been through this did not surprise him What made him glad was to hear the boys laughter It was right that Jake should cry for the Pere who had been his friend but it was good that he could still laugh Very good indeed THREE The door they wanted was to the left of the utility bays They all recognized the cloudandlightning sigul on it at once from the note RF had left them on the back of a sheet of the Oz Daily Buzz but the door itself was very different from the ones they had encountered so far except for the cloud and lightningbolt it was strictly utilitarian Although it had been painted green they could see it was steel not ironwood or the heavier ghostwood Surrounding it was a gray frame also steel with thighthick insulated powercords coming out of each side These ran into one of the walls From behind that wall came a rough rumbling sound which Eddie thought he recognized Roland he said in a low voice Do you remember the Portal of the Beam we came to way back at the start Even before Jake joined our happy band this was Roland nodded Where we shot the Little Guardians Shardiks retinue Those of it that still survived Eddie nodded I put my ear against that door and listened All is silent in the halls of the dead I thought These are the halls of the dead where the spiders spin and the great circuits fall quiet one by one He had actually spoken this aloud but Roland wasnt surprised Eddie didnt remember doing so hed been hypnotized or close to it We were on the outside then Eddie said Now were on the inside He pointed at the door into Thunderclap then with one finger traced the course of the fat cables The machinery sending power through these doesnt sound very healthy If were going to use this thing I think we ought to right away It could shut down for good anytime and then what Have to call TripleA Travel Susannah said dreamily I dont think so Wed be basted what do you call it Roland Basted in a hot oast These are the rooms of ruin You said that too Do you recall I said it Right out loud Aye Roland led them to the door He reached out touched the knob then pulled his hand back Hot Jake asked Roland shook his head Electrified Susannah asked The gunslinger shook his head again Then go on and go for it Eddie said Lets boogie They crowded close behind Roland Eddie was once more holding Susannah on his hip and Jake had picked Oy up The bumbler was panting through his usual cheery grin and inside their gold rings his eyes were as bright as polished onyx What do we do if its lockedwas how Jake meant to finish but before he could Roland turned the knob with his right hand he had his remaining gun in the left and pulled the door open Behind the wall the machinery cycled up a notch the sound of it growing almost desperate Jake thought he could smell something hot burning insulation maybe He was just telling himself to stop imagining things when a number of overhead fans started up They were as loud as taxiing fighter airplanes in a World War II movie and they all jumped Susannah actually put a hand on her head as if to shield it from falling objects Come on Roland snapped Quick He stepped through without a backward look During the brief moment when he was halfway through he seemed to be broken into two pieces Beyond the gunslinger Jake could see a vast and gloomy room much bigger than the Staging Area And silvery crisscrossing lines that looked like dashes of pure light Go on Jake Susannah said You next Jake took a deep breath and stepped through There was no riptide such as theyd experienced in the Cave of Voices and no jangling chimes No sense of going todash not even for a moment Instead there was a horrid feeling of being turned insideout and he was attacked by the most violent nausea he had ever known He stepped downward and his knee buckled A moment later he was on both knees Oy spilled out of his arms Jake barely noticed He began to retch Roland was on all fours next to him doing the same From somewhere came steady low chugging sounds the persistent dingdingdingding of a bell and an echoing amplified voice Jake turned his head meaning to tell Roland that now he understood why they sent robot raiders through their damned door and then he vomited again The remains of his last meal ran steaming across cracked concrete All at once Susannah was crying No No in a distraught voice Then Put me down Eddie put me down before I Her voice was interrupted by harsh yarking sounds Eddie managed to deposit her on the cracked concrete before turning his head andjoining the Upchuck Chorus Oy fell on his side hacked hoarsely then got back on his feet He looked dazed and disoriented or maybe Jake was only attributing to the bumbler the way he felt himself The nausea was beginning to fade a little when he heard clacking echoing footfalls Three men were hurrying toward them all dressed in jeans blue chambray shirts and odd homemadelooking footwear One of them an elderly gent with a mop of untidy white hair was ahead of the other two All three had their hands in the air Gunslingers cried the man with the white hair Are you gunslingers If you are dont shoot Were on your side Roland who looked in no condition to shoot anyone Not that Id want to test that Jake thought tried to get up almost made it then went back to one knee and made another strangled retching sound The man with the white hair seized one of his wrists and hauled him up without ceremony The sickness is bad the old man said no one knows it any better than I Fortunately it passes rapidly You have to come with us right away I know how little you feel like it but you see theres an alarm in the kidams study and He stopped His eyes almost as blue as Rolands were widening Even in the gloom Jake could see the old guys face losing its color His friends had caught up with him but he seemed not to notice It was Jake Chambers he was looking at Bobby he said in a voice that was not much more than a whisper My God is it Bobby Garfield ONE The whitehaired gents companions were a good deal younger one looked to Roland hardly out of his teens and both seemed absolutely terrified Afraid of being shot by mistake of coursethat was why theyd come hurrying out of the gloom with dieir hands raisedbut of something else as well because it must be clear to them now that they werent going to be assassinated out of hand The older man gave an almost spastic jerk pulling himself out of some private place Of course youre not Bobby he murmured Hairs the wrong color for one thing and Ted we have to get outoi here the youngest of the three said urgently And I mean inmediatamento Yes the older man said but his gaze remained on Jake He put a hand over his eyes to Eddie he looked like a carny mentalist getting ready to go into his big thoughtreading routine then lowered it again Yes of course He looked at Roland Are you the dinh Roland of Gilead Roland of the Eld Yes I Roland began then bent over and retched again Nothing came out but a long silver string of spittle hed already lost his share of Nigels soup and sandwiches Then he raised a slightly trembling fist to his forehead in greeting and said Yes You have the advantage of me sai That doesnt matter the whitehaired man replied Will you come with us You and your katet To be sure Roland said Behind him Eddie bent over and vomited again Goddamn he cried in a choked voice And I thought going Greyhound was bad That thing makes the bus look like a a Like a firstclass stateroom on the Queen Mary Susannah said in a weak voice Come on the youngest man said in an urgent voice If The Weasels on the way with his taheen posse hell be here in five minutes That cat can scrambler Yes the man with the white hair agreed We really must go Mr Deschain Lead Roland said Well follow TWO They hadnt come out in a train station but rather in some sort of colossal roofed switchingyard The silvery lines Jake had seen were crisscrossing raillines perhaps as many as seventy different sets of tracks On a couple of them stubby automated engines went back and forth on errands that had to be centuries outdated One was pushing a flatcar filled with rusty Ibeams The other began to cry in an automated voice Will a CamkaA please go to Portway CamkaA to Portway  if you please Pogosticking up and down on Eddies hip began to make Susannah feel sick to her stomach all over again but shed caught the whitehaired mans urgency like a cold Also she now knew what the taheen were monstrous creatures with the bodies of human beings and the heads of either birds or beasts They reminded her of the things in that Bosch painting The Garden of Earthly Delights I may have to puke again sugarbunch she said Dont you dare slow down if I do Eddie made a grunting sound she took for an affirmative She could see sweat pouring down his pale skin and felt sorry for him He was as sick as she was So now she knew what it was like to go through a scientific teleportation device that was clearly no longer working very well She wondered if she would ever be able to bring herself to go through another one Jake looked up and saw a roof made of a million panes of different shapes and sizes it was like looking at a tile mosaic painted a uniform dark gray Then a bird flew through one of them and he realized those werent tiles up there but panels of glass some of them broken That dark gray was apparently just how the outside world looked in Thunderclap Like a constant eclipse he thought and shivered Beside him Oy made another series of those hoarse hacking sounds and then trotted on shaking his head THREE They passed a clutter of beached machinerygenerators maybethen entered a maze of helterskelter traincars that were very different from those hauled by Blaine the Mono Some looked to Susannah like the sort of New York Central commuter cars she might have seen in Grand Central Station in her own when of  As if to underline this notion she noticed one with BAR CAR printed on the side Yet there were others that appeared much older than that made of dark riveted tin or steel instead of brushed chrome they looked like the sort of passenger cars youd see in an old Western movie or a TV show like Maverick Beside one of these stood a robot with wires sprouting crazily from its neck It was holding its headwhich wore a hat with a badge reading CLASS A CONDUCTOR on itbeneath one arm At first Susannah tried to keep count of the lefts and rights they were making in this maze then gave it up as a bad job They finally emerged about fifty yards from a clapboardsided hut with the alliterative message LADINGLOST LUGGAGE over the door The intervening distance was an apron of cracked concrete scattered with abandoned luggagecarts stacks of crates and two dead Wolves No Susannah thought make that three The third one was leaning against the wall in the deeper shadows just around the corner from LADINGLOST LUGGAGE Come on said the old man with the mop of white hair not much further now But we have to hurry because if the taheen from Heartbreak House catch us theyll kill you Theyd kill us too said the youngest of the three He brvished his hair out of his eyes All except for Ted Teds only one of us whos indispensable Hes just too modest to say so Past LADINGLOST LUGGAGE was reasonably enough Susannah thought SHIPPING OFFICE The fellow with the white hair tried the door It was locked This seemed to please rather than upset him Dinky he said Dinky it seemed was the youngest of the three He took hold of the knob and Susannah heard a snapping sound from somewhere inside Dinky stepped back This time when Ted tried the door it opened easily They stepped into a dim office bisected by a high counter On it was a sign that almost made Susannah feel nostalgic TAKE NUMBER AND WAIT it said When the door was closed Dinky once more grasped the knob There was another brisk snap You just locked it again Jake said He sounded accusing but there was a smile on his face and the color was coming back into his cheeks Didnt you Not now please said the whitehaired manTed No time Follow me please He flipped up a section of the counter and led them through Behind it was an office area containing two robots that looked long dead and three skeletons Why the hell do we keep finding bones Eddie asked Like Jake he was feeling better and only thinking out loud not really expecting an answer He got one however From Ted Do you know of the Crimson King young man You do of course you do I believe that at one time he covered this entire part of the world with poison gas Probably for a lark Killed almost everyone The darkness you see is the lingering result Hes mad of course Its a large part of the problem In here He led them through a door marked PRIVATE and into a room that had once probably belonged to a high poobah in the wonderful world of shipping and lading Susannah saw tracks on the floor suggesting that this place had been visited recently Perhaps by these same three men There was a desk beneath six inches of fluffy dust plus two chairs and a couch Behind the desk was a window Once it had been covered with Venetian blinds but these had collapsed onto the floor revealing a vista as forbidding as it was fascinating The land beyond Thunderclap Station reminded her of the flat deserty wastes on the far side of the River Whye but rockier and even more forbidding And of course it was darker Tracks eternally halted trains sat on some of them radiated out like strands of a steel spiderweb Above them a sky of darkest slategray seemed to sag almost close enough to touch Between the sky and the Earth the air was thick somehow Susannah found herself squinting to see things although there seemed to be no actual mist or smog in the air Dinky the whitehaired man said Yes Ted What have you left for our friend The Weasel to find A maintenance drone Dinky replied Itll look like it found its way in through the Fedic door set off the alarm then got fried on some of the tracks at the far end of the switching yard Quite a few are still hot You see dead birds around em all the time fried to a crisp but even a goodsized rusties too small to trip the alarm A drone though Im pretty sure hell buy it The Wease aint stupid but itll look pretty believable Good Thats very good Look yonder gunslingers Ted pointed to a sharp upthrust of rock on the horizon Susannah could make it out easily in this dark countryside all horizons seemed close She could see nothing remarkable about it though only folds of deeper shadow and sterile slopes of tumbled rock Thats Can SteekTete The Little Needle Roland said Excellent translation Its where were going Susannahs heart sank The mountainor perhaps you called something like that a buttehad to be eight or ten miles away At the very limit of vision in any case Eddie and Roland and the two younger men in Teds party couldnt carry her that far she didnt believe And how did they know they could trust these new fellows anyway On the other hand she thought what choice do we have You wont need to be carried Ted told her but Stanley can use your help Well join hands like folks at a seance Ill want you all to visualize that rock formation when we go through And hold the name in the forefront of your mind SteekTete the Little Needle Whoa whoa Eddie said They had approached yet another door this one standing open on a closet Wire hangers and one ancient red blazer hung in there Eddie grasped Teds shoulder and swung him around Go through what Go through where Because if its a door like the last one Ted looked up at Eddiehad to look up because Eddie was tallerand Susannah saw an amazing dismaying thing Teds eyes appeared to be shaking in their sockets A moment later she realized this wasnt actually the case The mans pupils were growing and then shrinking with eerie rapidity It was as if they couldnt decide if it was light or dark in here Its not a door were going through at all at least not of the kinds with which you may be familiar You have to trust me young man Listen They all fell silent and Susannah could hear the snarl of approaching motors Thats The Weasel Ted told them Hell have taheen with him at least four maybe half a dozen If they catch sight of us in here Dink and Stanley are almost certainly going to die They dont have to catch us but only catch sight of us Were risking our lives for you This isnt a game and I need you to stop asking questions and follow mel We will Roland said And well think about the Little Needle SteekTete Susannah agreed You wont get sick again Dinky said Promise Thank God Jake said Thangodd Oy agreed Stanley the third member of Teds party continued to say nothing at all FOUR It was just a closet and an office closet at thatnarrow and musty The ancient red blazer had a brass tag on the breast pocket with the words HEAD OF SHIPPING stamped on it Stanley led the way to the back which was nothing but a blank wall Coathangers jingled and jangled Jake had to watch his step to keep from treading on Oy Hed always been slightly prone to claustrophobia and now he began to feel the pudgy fingers of the PanicMan caressing his neck first one side and then the other The Rizas clanked softly together in their bag Seven people and one billybumbler crowding into an abandoned office closet It was nuts He could still hear the snarl of the approaching engines The one in charge called The Weasel Join hands Ted murmured And concentrate SteekTete Susannah repeated but to Jake she sounded dubious this time Little Nee Eddie began and then stopped The blank wall at the end of the closet was gone Where it had been was a small clearing with boulders on one side and a steep scrubcrusted hillside on another Jake was willing to bet that was SteekTete and if it was a way out of this enclosed space he was delighted to see it Stanley gave a little moan of pain or effort or both The mans eyes were closed and tears were trickling out from beneath the lids Now Ted said Lead us through Stanley To the others he added And help him if you can Help him for your fathers sakes Jake tried to hold an image of the outcrop Ted had pointed to through the office window and walked forward holding Rolands hand ahead of him and Susannahs behind him He felt a breath of cold air on his sweaty skin and then stepped through onto the slope of SteekTete in Thunderclap thinking just briefly of Mr C S Lewis and the wonderful wardrobe that took you to Narnia FIVE They did not come out in Narnia It was cold on the slope of the butte and Jake was soon shivering When he looked over his shoulder he saw no sign of the portal theyd come through The air was dim and smelled of something pungent and not particularly pleasant like kerosene There was a small cave folded into the flank of the slope it was really not much more than another closet and from it Ted brought a stack of blankets and a canteen that turned out to hold a sharp alkalitasting water Jake and Roland wrapped themselves in single blankets Eddie took two and bundled himself and Susannah together Jake trying not to let his teeth start chattering once they did thered be no stopping them envied the two of them their extra warmth Dink had also wrapped himself in a blanket but neither Ted nor Stanley seemed to feel the cold Look down there Ted invited Roland and the others He was pointing at the spiderweb of tracks Jake could see the rambling glass roof of the switchingyard and a greenroofed structure next to it that had to be half a mile long Tracks led away in every direction Thunderclap Station he marveled Where the Wolves put the kidnapped kids on the train and send them along the Path of the Beam to Fedic And where they bring them back after they ve been roont Even after all hed been through it was hard for Jake to believe that they had been down there six or eight miles away less than two minutes ago He suspected theyd all played a part in keeping the portal open but it was the one called Stanley whod created it in the first place Now he looked pale and tired nearly used up Once he staggered on his feet and Dink a very unfortunate nickname in Jakes humble opinion grabbed his arm and steadied him Stanley seemed not to notice He was looking at Roland with awe Not just awe Jake thought and not exactly fear either Something else What Approaching the station were two motorized buckas with big balloon tiresATVs Jake assumed it was The Weasel whoever he was and his taheen buddies As you may have gleaned Ted told them theres an alarm in the DevarToi Supervisors office The wardens office if you like It goes off when anyone or anything uses the door between the Fedic staging area and yon station I believe the term you used for him Roland said dryly wasnt supervisor or warden but kidam Dink laughed Thats a good pickup on your part dude What does kidam mean Jake asked although he had a fair notion There was a phrase folks used in the Calla headbox heartbox kibox Which meant in descending order ones thought processes ones emotions and ones lower functions Animal functions some might say kibox could be translated as shitbox if you were of a vulgar turn of mind Ted shrugged Kidam means shitforbrains Its Dinkys nickname for sai Prentiss the Devar Master But you already knew that didnt you I guess Jake said Kinda Ted looked at him long and when Jake identified that expression it helped him define how Stanley was looking at Roland not with fear but with fascination Jake had a pretty good idea Ted was still thinking about how much he looked like someone named Bobby and he was pretty sure Ted knew he had the touch What was the source of Stanleys fascination Or maybe he was making too much of it Maybe it was just that Stanley had never expected to see a gunslinger in the flesh Abruptly Ted turned from Jake and back to Roland Now look this way he said Whoa Eddie cried What the hell Susannah was amused as well as amazed What Ted was pointing out reminded her of Cecil B DeMilles Bible epic The Ten Commandments especially the parts where the Red Sea opened by Moses had looked suspiciously like JellO and the voice of God coming from the burning bush sounded quite a bit like Charles Laughton Still it xoas amazing In a cheesy Hollywoodspecialeffects way that was What they saw was a single fat and gorgeous bolt of sunlight slanting down from a hole in the sagging clouds It cut through the strangely dark air like a searchlight beam and lit a compound that might have been six miles from Thunderclap Station And about six miles was really all you could say because there was no more north or south in this world at least not that you could count on Now there was only the Path of the Beam Dinky theres a pair of binoculars in The lower cave right No I brought them up the last time we were here Ted replied with carefully maintained patience Theyre sitting on that pile of crates just inside Get them please Eddie barely noticed this byplay He was too charmed and amused by that single broad ray of sun shining down on a green and cheerful plot of land as unlikely in this dark and sterile desert as well he supposed as unlikely as Central Park must seem to tourists from the Midwest making their first trip to New York He could see buildings that looked like college dormitoriesnice onesand others that looked like comfy old manor houses with wide stretches of green lawn before them At the far side of the sunbeams area was what looked like a street lined with shops The perfect little Main Street America except for one thing in all directions it ended in dark and rocky desert He saw four stone towers their sides agreeably green with ivy No make that six The other two were mostly concealed in stands of graceful old elms Elms in the desert Dink returned with a pair of binoculars and offered them to Roland who shook his head Dont hold it against him Eddie said His eyes well lets just say theyre something else I wouldnt mind a peek though Me either Susannah said Eddie handed her the binoculars Ladies first No really I Stop it Ted almost snarled Our time here is brief our risk enormous Dont waste the one or increase the other if you please Susannah was stung but held back a retort Instead she took the binoculars raised them to her eyes and adjusted them What she saw merely heightened her sense of looking at a small but perfect college campus one that merged beautifully with the neighboring village No townversusgown tensions there I bet she thought  bet Elmville and Breaker U go together like peanut butter and jelly Abbott and Costello hand and glove Whenever there was a Ray Bradbury short in the Saturday Evening Post she always turned to it first she loved Bradbury and what she was looking at through the binoculars made her think of Greentown Bradburys idealized Illinois village A place where adults sat out on their porches in rocking chairs drinking lemonade and the kids played tag with flashlights in the lightningbugstitched dusk of summer evenings And the nearby college campus No drinking there at least not to excess No joysticks or goofballs or rock and roll either It would be a place where the girls kissed the boys goodnight with chaste ardor and were glad to sign back in so that the Dormitory Mom wouldnt think ill of them A place where the sun shone all day where Perry Como and the Andrews Sisters sang on the radio and nobody suspected they were actually living in the ruins of a world that had moved on No she thought coldly Some of them know Thats why these three showed up to meet us Thats the DevarToi Roland said flatly Not a question Yeah Dinky said The good old DevarToi He stood beside Roland and pointed at a large white building near the dormitories See that white one Thats Heartbreak House where the cantoi live Ted calls em the low men Theyre taheenhuman hybrids And they dont call it the DevarToi they call it Algul Siento which means Blue Heaven Roland said and Jake realized why all of the buildings except for the rock towers had blue tiled roofs Not Narnia but Blue Heaven Where a bunch of folks were busy bringing about the end of the world All the worlds SIX It looks like the pleasantest place in existence at least since InWorld fell Ted said Doesnt it Pretty nice all right Eddie agreed He had at least a thousand questions and guessed Suze and Jake probably had another thousand between them but this wasnt the time to ask them In any case he kept looking at that wonderful litde hundredacre oasis down there The one sunny green spot in all of Thunderclap The one nice place And why not Nothing but the best for Our Breaker Buddies And in spite of himself one question did slip out Ted why does the Crimson King want to bring the Tower down Do you know Ted gave him a brief glance Eddie thought it cool maybe downright cold until the man smiled When he did his whole face lit up Also his eyes had quit doing that creepy inandout thing which was a big improvement Hes mad Ted told him Nuttier than a fruitcake Riding the fabled rubber bicycle Didnt I tell you that And then before Eddie could reply Yes its quite nice Whether you call it DevarToi the Big Prison or Algul Siento it looks a treat It is a treat Very classy accommos Dinky agreed Even Stanley was looking down at the sunlit community with an expression of faint longing The food is the best Ted went on and the double feature at the Gem Theater changes twice a week If you dont want to go to the movies you can bring the movies home on DVDs What are those Eddie asked then shook his head Never mind Go on Ted shrugged as if to say What else do you need Absolutely astral sex for one thing Dinky said Its sim but its still incredibleI made it with Marilyn Monroe Madonna and Nicole Kidman all in one week He said this with a certain uneasy pride I could have had them all at the same time if Id wanted to The only way you can tell theyre not real is to breathe directly on them from close up When you do the part you blow on kinda disappears Its unsettling Booze Dope Eddie asked Booze in limited quantities Ted replied If youre into oenology for instance youll experience fresh wonders at every meal Whats oenology Jake asked The science of winesnobbery sugarbun Susannah said If you come to Blue Heaven addicted to something Dinky said they get you off it Kindly The one or two guys who proved especially tough nuts in that area His eyes met Teds briefly Ted shrugged and nodded Those dudes disappeared In truth the low men dont need any more Breakers Ted said Theyve got enough to finish the job right now How many Roland asked About three hundred Dinky said Three hundred and seven to be exact Ted said Were quartered in five dorms although that word conjures the wrong image We have our own suites and as muchor as littlecontact with our fellow Breakers as we wish And you know what youre doing Susannah asked Yes Although most dont spend a lot of time thinking about it I dont understand why they dont mutiny Whats your when maam Dinky asked her My Then she understood  He sighed and shook his head So you dont know about Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple Its easier to explain if you know about that Almost a thousand people committed suicide at this religious compound a Jesusguy from San Francisco set up in Guyana They drank poisoned KoolAid out of a tub while he watched them from the porch of his house and used a bullhorn to tell them stories about his mother Susannah was staring at him with horrified disbelief Ted with poorly disguised impatience Yet he must have thought something about this was important because he held silence Almost a thousand Dinky reiterated Because they were confused and lonely and they thought Jim Jones was their friend Becausedig itthey had nothing to go back to And its like that here If the Breakers united tfiey could make a mental hammer thatd knock Prentiss and The Weasel and the taheen and the cantoi all the way into the next galaxy Instead theres no one but me Stanley and everyones favorite superbreaker the totally eventual Mr Theodore Brautigan of Milford Connecticut Harvard Class of  Drama Society Debate Club editor of The Crimson andof coursePhi Beta Crapper Can we trust you three Roland asked The question sounded deceptively idle little more than a timepasser You have to Ted said Youve no one else Neither do we If we were on their side Dinky said dont you think wed have something better to wear on our feet than moccasins made out of rubber fuckin tires In Blue Heaven you get everything except for a few basics Stuff you wouldnt ordinarily think of as indispensable but stuff that well its harder to take a powder when youve got nothing to wear but your Algul Siento slippers lets put it that way I still cant believe itJake said All those people working to break the Beams I mean No offense but Dinky turned on him with his fists clenched and a tight furious smile on his face Oy immediately stepped in front of Jake growling low and showing his teeth Dinky either didnt notice or paid no attention Yeah Well guess what kiddo I take offense I take offense like a motherfucker What do you know about what its like to spend your whole life on the outside to be the butt of the joke every time to always be Carrie at the fuckin prom Who Eddie asked confused but Dinky was on a roll and paid no attention There are guys down there who cant walk or talk One chick with no arms Several with hydrocephalus which means they have heads out to fuckin New Jersey He held his hands two feet beyond his head on either side a gesture they all took for exaggeration Later they would discover it was not Poor old Stanley here hes one of the ones who cant talk Roland glanced at Stanley with his pallid stubbly face and his masses of curly dark hair And the gunslinger almost smiled I think he can talk he said and then Doee bear your fathers name Stanley I believe thee does Stanley lowered his head and color mounted in his cheeks yet he was smiling At the same time he began to cry again Just what in the hells going on here Eddie wondered Ted clearly wondered too Sai Deschain I wonder if I could ask No no cry pardon Roland said Your time is short just now so you said and we all feel it Do the Breakers know how theyre being fed What theyre being fed to increase their powers Ted abruptly sat on a rock and looked down at the shining steel cobweb of rails It has to do with the kiddies they bring through the Station doesnt it Yes They dont know and I dont know Ted said in that same heavy voice Not really Were fed dozens of pills a day They come morning noon and night Some are vitamins Some are no doubt intended to keep us docile Ive had some luck purging those from my system and Dinkys and Stanleys Only for such a purging to work gunslinger you must want it to work Do you understand Roland nodded Ive thought for a long time that they must also be giving us some kind of I dont know brainbooster but with so many pills its impossible to tell which one it might be Which one it is that makes us cannibals or vampires or both He paused looking down at the improbable sunray He extended his hands on both sides Dinky took one Stanley the other Watch this Dinky said This is good Ted closed his eyes So did the other two For a moment there was nothing to see but three men looking out over the dark desert toward the Cecil B DeMille sunbeam and they were looking Roland knew Even with their eyes shut The sunbeam winked out For a space of perhaps a dozen seconds the DevarToi was as dark as the desert and Thunderclap Station and the slopes of SteekTete Then that absurd golden glow came back on Dinky uttered a harsh but not dissatisfied sigh and stepped back disengaging from Ted A moment later Ted let go of Stanley and turned to Roland You did that the gunslinger asked The three of us together Ted said Mostly its Stanley Hes an extremely powerful sender One of the few things that terrify Prentiss and the low men and the taheen is when they lose their artificial sunlight It happens more and more often you know and not always because were meddling with the machinery The machinery is just He shrugged Its running down Everything is Eddie said Ted turned to him unsmiling But not fast enough Mr Dean This fiddling with the remaining two Beams must stop and very soon or it will make no difference Dinky Stanley and I will help you if we can even if it means killing the rest of them Sure Dinky said with a hollow smile If the Rev Jim Jones could do it why not us Ted gave him a disapproving glance then looked back at Rolands katet Perhaps it wont come to that But if it does He stood up suddenly and seized Rolands arm Are we cannibals he asked in a harsh almost strident voice Have we been eating the children the Greencloaks bring from the Borderlands Roland was silent Ted turned to Eddie I want to know Eddie made no reply Madamsai Ted asked looking at the woman who sat astride Eddies hip Were prepared to help you Will you not help me by telling me what I ask Would knowing change anything Susannah asked Ted looked at her for a moment longer then turned to Take You really could be my young friends twin he said Do you know that son No but it doesnt surprise me Jake said Its the way things work over here somehow Everything um fits Will you tell me what I want to know Bobby would So you can eat yourself alive Jake thought Eat yourself instead of them He shook his head Im not Bobby he said No matter how much I might look like him Ted sighed and nodded You stick together and why would that surprise me Youre katet after all We gotta go Dink told Ted Weve already been here too long It isnt just a question of getting back for roomcheck me n Stanleyve got to trig their fucking telemetery so when Prentiss and The Wease check it theyll say Teddy B was there all the time So was Dinky Earnshaw and Stanley Ruiz no problem with those hoys Yes Ted agreed I suppose youre right Five more minutes Dinky nodded reluctantly The sound of a siren made faint by distance came on the wind and the young mans teeth showed in a smile of genuine amusement They get so upset when the sun goes in he said When they have to face up to whats really around them which is some fuckedup version of nuclear winter Ted put his hands in his pockets for a moment looking down at his feet then up at Roland Its time that this this grotesque comedy came to an end We three will be back tomorrow if all goes well Meanwhile theres a bigger cave about forty yards down the slope and on the side away from Thunderclap Station and Algul Siento Theres food and sleeping bags and a stove that runs on propane gas Theres a map very crude of the Algul Ive also left you a tape recorder and a number of tapes They probably dont explain everything youd like to know but theyll fill in many of the blank spots For now just realize that Blue Heaven isnt as nice as it looks The ivy towers are watchtowers There are three runs offence around the whole place If youre trying to get out from the inside the first run you strike gives you a sting Like barbwire Dink said The second one packs enough of a wallop to knock you out Ted went on And the third I think we get the picture Susannah said What about the Children of Roderick Roland asked They have something to do with the Devar for we met one on our way here who said so Susannah looked at Eddie with her eyebrows raised Eddie gave her a tellyoulaterlook in return It was a simple and perfect bit of wordless communication the sort people who love each other take for granted Those wanks Dinky said but not without sympathy Theyre what do they call em in the old movies Trusties I guess Theyve got a little village about two miles beyond the station in that direction He pointed They do groundskeeping work at the Algul and there might be three or four skilled enough to do roofwork replacing shingles and such Whatever contaminants there are in the air here those poor shmucks are especially vulnerable to em Only on them it comes out looking like radiation sickness instead of just pimples and eczema Tell me about it Eddie said remembering poor old Chevin of Chayven his soreeaten face and urinesoaked robe Theyre wandering folhen Ted put in Bedouins I think they follow the railroad tracks for the most part There are catacombs under the station and Algul Siento The Rods know their way around them Theres tons of food down there and twice a week theyll bring it into the Devar on sledges Mostly now thats what we eat Its still good but He shrugged Things are falling down fast Dinky said in a tone of uncharacteristic gloom But like the man said the wines great If I asked you to bring one of the Children of Roderick with you tomorrow Roland said could you do that Ted and Dinky exchanged a startled glance Then both of them looked at Stanley Stanley nodded shrugged and spread his hands before him palms down Why gunslinger Roland stood for a moment lost in thought Then he turned to Ted Bring one with half a brain left in his head Roland instructed Tell him dan sur dan tur dan Roland dan Gilead Tell it back Without hesitation Ted repeated it Roland nodded If he still hesitates tell him Chevin of Chayven says he must come They speak a little plain do they not Sure Dinky said But mister you couldnt let a Rod come up here and see you and then turn him free again Their mouths are hung in the middle and run on both ends Bring one Roland said and well see what we see I have what my kamai Eddie calls a hunch Do you ken hunchthink Ted and Dinky nodded If it works out fine If not be assured that the fellow you bring will never tell what he saw here Youd kill him if your hunch doesnt pan out Ted asked  Roland nodded Ted gave a bitter laugh Of course you would It reminds me of the part in Huckleberry Finn when Huck sees a steamboat blow up He runs to Miss Watson and the Widow Douglas with the news and when one of them asks if anyone was killed Huck says with perfect aplomb No maam only a nigger In this case we can say Only a Rod Gunslingerman had a hunch but it didnt pan out Roland gave him a cold smile one that was unnaturally full of teeth Eddie had seen it before and was glad it wasnt aimed at him He said I thought you knew what the stakes were sai Ted Did I misunderstand Ted met his gaze for a moment then looked down at the ground His mouth was working During this Dinky appeared to be engaged in silent palaver with Stanley Now he said If you want a Rod well get you one Its not much of a problem The problem may be getting here at all If we dont Roland waited patiently for the young man to finish When he didnt the gunslinger asked If you dont what would you have us do Ted shrugged The gesture was such a perfect imitation of Dinkys that it was funny The best you can he said There are also weapons in the lower cave A dozen of the electric fireballs they call sneetches A number of machineguns what Ive heard some of the low men call speedshooters Theyre US Army ARs Other things were not sure of One of thems some kind of scifi raygun like in a movie Dinky said I think its supposed to disintegrate things but either Im too dumb to turn it on or the batterys dead He turned anxiously to the whitehaired man Five minutes are up and more We have to put an egg in our shoe and beat it Tedster Lets chug Yes Well well be back tomorrow Perhaps by then youll have a plan You dont Eddie asked surprised My plan was to run young man It seemed like a terribly bright idea at the time I ran all the way to the spring of  They caught me and brought me back with a little help from my young friend Bobbys mother And now we really must One more minute do it please ya Roland said and stepped toward Stanley Stanley looked down at his feet but his beardscruffy cheeks once more flooded with color And Hes shivering Susannah thought Like an animal in the woods faced with its first human being Stanley looked perhaps thirtyfive but he could have been older his face had the carefree smoothness Susannah associated with certain mental defects Ted and Dinky both had pimples but Stanley had none Roland put his hands on the fellows forearms and looked earnestly at him At first the gunslingers eyes met nothing but the masses of dark curly hair on Stanleys bowed head Dinky started to speak Ted silenced him with a gesture Willee not look me in the face Roland asked He spoke with a gentleness Susannah had rarely heard in his voice Willee not before you go Stanley son of Stanley Sheemie that was Susannah felt her mouth drop open Beside her Eddie grunted like a man who has been punched She thought But Rolands old so old Which means that if this is the tavernboy he knexu in Mejis the one with the donkey and the pink sombrera hat then he must also be The man raised his face slowly Tears were streaming from his eyes Good old Will Dearborn he said His voice was hoarse and jigged up and down through the registers as a voice will do when it has lain long unused Im so sorry sai Were you to pull your gun and shoot me Id understand So I would Why doee say so Sheemie Roland asked in that same gende voice Stanleys tears flowed faster You saved my life Arthur and Richard too but mosdy you good old Will Dearborn who was really Roland of Gilead And I let her die Her that you loved And I loved her too The mans face twisted in agony and he tried to pull away from Roland Yet Roland held him None of that was your fault Sheemie I should have died for her he cried I should have died in her place Im stupid Foolish as they said He slapped himself across the face first one way and dien the other leaving red weals Before he could do it again Roland seized the hand and forced it down to his side again Twas Rhea did the harm Roland said Stanleywho had been Sheemie an eon agolooked into Rolands face searching his eyes Aye Roland said nodding Twas the Coos and me as well I should have stayed with her If anyone was blameless m the business SheemieStanleyit was you Do you say so gunslinger Trueytrue Roland nodded Well palaver all you would about this if theres time and about those old days but not now No time now You have to go with your friends and I must stay with mine Sheemie looked at him a moment longer and yes Susannah W now see the boy who had busded about a longago tavern called the Travellers Rest picking up empty beer schooners and dropping them into die washbarrel which stood beneath die twoheaded elks head that was known as The Romp avoiding the occasional shove from Coral Thorin or the even more illnatured kicks that were apt to come from an aging whore called Pettie the Trotter She could see the boy who had almost been killed for spilling liquor on the boots of a hardcase named Roy Depape It had been Cuthbert who had saved Sheemie from death that night but it had been Roland known to the townsfolk as Will Dearborn who had saved them all Sheemie put his arms around Rolands neck and hugged him tight Roland smiled and stroked his curly hair with his disfigured right hand A loud honking sob escaped Sheemies throat Susannah could see the tears in the corners of the gunslingers eyes Aye Roland said speaking in a voice almost too low to hear I always knew you were special Bert and Alain did too And here we find each other wellmet further down the path Were wellmet Sheemie son of Stanley So we are So we are ONE Pimli Prentiss the Algul Siento Master was in the bathroom when Finli known in some quarters as The Weasel knocked at the door Prentiss was examining his complexion by the unforgiving light of the fluorescent bar over the washbasin In the magnifying mirror his skin looked like a grayish craterpocked plain not much different from the surface of the wastelands stretching in every direction around the Algul The sore on which he was currently concentrating looked like an erupting volcano Who be for me Prentiss bawled although he had a pretty good idea Finli OTego Walk in Finli Never taking his eyes from the mirror His fingers closing in on the sides of the infected pimple looked huge They applied pressure Finli crossed Prentisss office and stood in the bathroom door He had to bend slightly in order to look in He stood over seven feet very tall even for a taheen Back from the station like I was never gone said Finli Like most of the taheen his speaking voice reeled wildly back and forth between a yelp and a growl To Pimli they all sounded like the hybrids from H G Wellss The Island of Dr Moreau and he kept expecting them to break into a chorus of Are we not men Finli had picked this out of his mind once and asked about it Prentiss had replied with complete honesty knowing that in a society where lowgrade telepathy was the rule honesty was ever the best policy The only policy when dealing with the taheen Besides he liked Finli OTego Back from the station good Pimli said And what did you find A maintenance drone Looks like it went rogue on the Arc side and Wait Prentiss said If you will if you will thanks Finli waited Prentiss leaned even closer toward the mirror face frowning in concentration The Master of Blue Heaven was tall himself about sixtwo and possessed of an enormous sloping belly supported by long legs with slab diighs He was balding and had the turnip nose of a veteran drinker He looked perhaps fifty He felt like about fifty younger when he hadnt spent the previous night tossing them back with Finli and several of the cantoi He had been fifty when he came here a good many years ago at least twentyfive and that might be a big underestimation Time was goofy on this side just like direction and you were apt to lose both quickly Some folken lost their minds as well And if they ever lost the sun machine for good The top of the pimple bulged trembled burst Ah A glut of bloody pus leaped from the site of the infection splattered onto die mirror and began to drool down its slighdy concave surface Pimli Prentiss wiped it off with the tip of a finger turned to flick it into the jakes then offered it to Finli instead The taheen shook his head then made the sort of exasperated noise any veteran dieter would have recognized and guided the Masters finger into his mouth He sucked the pus off and then released the finger with an audible pop Shouldnt do it cant resist Finli said Didnt you tell me that folken on the other side decided eating rare beef was bad for them Yar Pimli said wiping the pimple which was still oozing with a Kleenex He had been here a long time and there would never be any going back for all sorts of reasons but until recently he had been up on current events until the previouscould you call it a yearhed gotten The New York Times on a fairly regular basis He bore a great affection for the Times loved doing the daily crossword puzzle It was a little touch of home But they go on eating it just the same Yar I suppose many do He opened the medicine cabinet and brought out a botde of hydrogen peroxide from Rexall Its your fault for putting it in front of me Finli said Not that such stuff is bad for us ordinarily its a natural sweet like honey or berries The problems Thunderclap And as if his boss hadnt gotten the point Finli added Too much of what comes out of it dont run the true thread no matter how sweet it might taste Poison do ya Prentiss dampened a cotton ball with the hydrogen peroxide and swabbed out the wound in his cheek He knew exactly what Finli was talking about how could he not Before coming here and assuming the Masters mantle he hadnt seen a blemish on his skin in well over thirty years Now he had pimples on his cheeks and brow acne in the hollows of his temples nasty nests of blackheads around his nose and a cyst on his neck that would soon have to be removed by Gangli the compound doctor Prentiss thought Gangli was a terrible name for a physician it reminded him both of ganglion and gangrene The taheen and the cantoi were less susceptible to dermatological problems but their flesh often broke open spontaneously they suffered from nosebleeds and even minor woundsdie scrape of a rock or a thorncould lead to infection and deadi if not promptly seen to Antibiotics had worked a treat on such infections to begin with not so well anymore Same with such pharmaceutical marvels as Accutane It was the environment of course death baking out of the very rocks and eartfi that surrounded them If you wanted to see things at their worst you only had to look at the Rods who were no better than slow mutants these days Of course they wandered far to the was it still the southeast They wandered far in the direction where a faint red glow could be seen at night in any case and everyone said things were much woise in that direction Pimli didnt know for sure if that was true but he suspected it was They didnt call the lands beyond Fedic the Discordia because they were vacation spots Want more he asked Finli Ive got a couple on my forehead thatre ripe Nay I want to make my report doublecheck the videotapes and telemetry go on over to The Study for a quick peek and then sign out After that I want a hot bath and about three hours with a good book Im reading The Collector And you like it Prentiss said fascinated Very much say thankya It reminds me of our situation here Except I like to think our goals are a little nobler and our motivations a little higher than sexual attraction Noble So you call it Finli shrugged and made no reply Close discussion of what was going on here in Blue Heaven was generally avoided by unspoken consent Prentiss led Finli into his own librarystudy which overlooked the part of Blue Heaven they called the Mall Finli ducked beneath the light fixture widi the unconscious grace of long practice Prentiss had once told him after a few shots of graf that he would have made a hell of a center in the NBA The first alltaheen team hed said Theyd call you The Freaks but so what These basketball players they get the best of everything Finli had inquired He had a sleek weasels head and large black eyes No more expressive than dolls eyes in Pimlis view He wore a lot of gold chainsthey had become fashionable among Blue Heaven personnel and a brisk trading market in such things had grown up over the last few years Also hed had his tail docked Probably a mistake hed told Prentiss one night when theyd both been drunk Painful beyond belief and bound to send him to die Hell of Darkness when his life was over unless Unless there was nothing This was an idea Pimli denied widi all his mind and heart but hed be a liar if he didnt admit if only to himself that the idea sometimes haunted him in the watches of the night For such thoughts there were sleeping pills And God of course His faith diat all tilings served the will of God even the Tower itself In any case Pimli had confirmed that yes basketball playersAmerican basketball players at leastgot the best of everything including more pussy than a fackin toilet seat This remark had caused Finli to laugh until reddish tears had seeped from the corners of his strangely inexpressive eyes And the best thing Pimli had continued is this youd be able to play near forever by NBA standards For instance do ya hear the most highly regarded player in my old country although I never saw him play he came after my time was a fellow named Michael Jordan and If he were taheen what would he be Finli had interrupted This was a game they often played especially when a few drinks over the line A weasel actually and a damned handsome one Pimli had said and in a tone of surprise that had struck Finli as comical Once more hed roared until tears came out of his eyes But Pimli had continued his career was over in hardly more than fifteen years and that includes a retirement and a comeback or two How many years could you play a game where youd have to do no more than run back and forth the length of a campa court for an hour or so Fin Finli of Tego who was then over three hundred years old had shrugged and flicked his hand at the horizon Delah Years beyond counting And how long had Blue HeavenDevarToi to the newer inmates Algul Siento to the taheen and the Rodshow long had this prison been here Also delah But if Finli was correct and Pimlis heart said that Finli almost certainly was then delah was almost over And what could he once Paul Prentiss of Rahway New Jersey and now Pimli Prentiss of the Algul Siento do about it His job that was what His fackin job TWO So Pimli said sitting down in one of the two wing chairs by the window you found a maintenance drone Where Close to where Track  leaves the switchingyard said Finli That tracks still hothas what you call a third railand so that explains that Then after wed left you call and say theres been a second alarm Yes And you found Nothing Finli said That time nothing Probably a malfunction maybe even caused by the first alarm He shrugged a gesture that conveyed what they both knew it was all going to hell And the closer to the end they moved the faster it went You and your fellows had a good look though Of course No intruders But both of them were thinking in terms of intruders who were human taheen cantoi or mechanical No one in Finlis searchparty had thought to look up and likely would not have spotted Mordred even if they had a spider now as big as a mediumsized dog crouched in the deep shadow under the main stations eave held in place by a little hammock of webbing Youre going to check the telemetry again because of the second alarm Pardy Finli said Mostly because things feel hinky to me This was a word hed picked up from one of the many otherside crime novels he readthey fascinated himand he used it at every opportunity Hinky how Finli only shook his head He couldnt say But telemetry doesnt lie Or so I was taught You question it Aware he was on thin ice againthat they both were Finli hesitated and then decided what the hell These are the endtimes boss I question damn near everything Does that include your duty Finli OTego Finli shook his head with no hesitation No it didnt include his duty It was the same with the rest of them including the former Paul Prentiss of Rahway Pimli remembered some old soldiermaybe Dugout Doug MacArthursaying When my eyes close in death gentlemen my final thought will be of the corps And the corps And the corps Pimlis own final thought would probably be of Algul Siento Because what else was there now In the words of another great AmericanMartha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellasthey had nowhere to run baby nowhere to hide Things were out of control running downhill with no brakes and there was nothing left to do but enjoy the ride Would you mind a little company as you go your rounds Pimli asked Why not The Weasel replied He smiled revealing a mouthful of needlesharp teeth And sang in his odd and wavering voice dream with me Im on my way to the moon of my faaathers Give me one minute Pimli said and got up Prayers Finli asked Pimli stopped in die doorway Yes he said Since you ask Any comments Finli OTego Just one perhaps The smiling thing with the human body and the sleek brown weasels head continued to smile If prayers so exalted why do you kneel in the same room where you sit to shit Because the Bible suggests that when one is in company one should do it in ones closet Further comments Nay nay Finli waved a negligent hand Do thy best and thy worst as the Manni say THREE In the bathroom Paul o Rahway closed the lid on the toilet knelt on the tiles and folded his hands If prayers so exalted why do you kneel in the same room where you sit to shit Maybe I should have said because it keeps me humble he thought Because it keeps me rightsized Its dirt from which we arose and its dirt to which we return and if theres a room where its hard to forget that its this one God he said grant me strength when I am weak answers when I am confused courage when I am afraid Help me to hurt no one who doesnt deserve it and even then not unless they leave me no other choice Lord And while hes on his knees before the closed toilet seat this man who will shortly be asking his God to forgive him for working to end creation and with absolutely no sense of irony we might as well look at him a bit more closely We wont take long for Pimli Prentiss isnt central to our tale of Roland and his katet Still hes a fascinating man full of folds and contradictions and dead ends Hes an alcoholic who believes deeply in a personal God a man of compassion who is now on the very verge of toppling the Tower and sending the trillions of worlds that spin on its axis flying into the darkness in a trillion different directions He would quickly put Dinky Earnshaw and Stanley Ruiz to death if he knew what theyd been up to and he spends most of every Mothers Day in tears for he loved his own Ma dearly and misses her bitterly When it comes to the Apocalypse heres the perfect guy for the job one who knows how to get kneebound and can speak to the Lord God of Hosts like an old friend And heres an irony Paul Prentiss could be right out of the ads that proclaim I got myjob through The New York TimesV In  laid off from the prison then known as Attica he and Nelson Rockefeller missed the megariot at least he spied an ad in the Times with this headline WANTED EXPERIENCED CORRECTIONS OFFICER FOR HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN PRIVATE INSTITUTION High Pay Top Benefits Must Be Willing to Travel The high pay had turned out to be what his beloved Ma i would have called a pureD highcorn lie because there was no pay at all not in the sense an Americaside corrections officer would have understood but the benefits yes the bennies were exceptional To begin with hed wallowed in sex as he now wallowed in food and booze but that wasnt the point The point in sai Prentisss view was this what did you want out of life If it was to do no more than watch the zeros increase in your bank account than clearly Algul Siento was no place for you which would be a terrible thing because once you had signed on there was no turning back it was all the corps And the corps And every now and then when an example needed to be made a corpse or two Which was a hundred per cent okeyfine with Master Prentiss who had gone through the solemn taheen namechanging ceremony some twelve years before and had never regretted it Paul Prentiss had become Pimli Prentiss It was at that point he had turned his heart as well as his mind away from what he now only called Americaside And not because hed had the best baked Alaska and the best champagne of his life here Not because hed had sim sex with hundreds of beautiful women either It was because this was his job and he intended to finish it Because hed come to believe that their work at the DevarToi was Gods as well as the Crimson Kings And behind the idea of God was something even more powerful the image of a billion universes tucked into an egg which he the former Paul Prentiss of Rahway once a fortythousanddollarayear man with a stomach ulcer and a bad medical benefits program okayed by a corrupt union now held in the palm of his hand He understood that he was also in that egg and that he would cease to exist as flesh when he broke it but surely if there was heaven and a God in it then both superseded the power of the Tower It was to that heaven he would go and before that throne he would kneel to ask forgiveness for his sins And he would be welcomed in with a hearty Well done thou good and faithful servant His Ma would be there and she would hug him and they would enter the fellowship of Jesus together That day would come Pimli was quite sure and probably before Reap Moon rolled around again Not that he considered himself a religious nut Not at all These thoughts of God and heaven he kept strictly to himself As far as the rest of the world was concerned he was just a joe doing a job one he intended to do well to the very end Certainly he saw himself as no villain but no truly dangerous man ever has Think of Ulysses S Grant that Civil War general whod said he intended to fight it out on this line if it took all summer In the Algul Siento summer was almost over FOUR The Masters home was a tidy Cape Cod at one end of the Mall It was called Shapleigh House Pimli had no idea why and so of course the Breakers called it Shit House At the other end of the Mall was a much larger dwellinga gracefully rambling Queen Anne called for equally obscure reasons Damli House It would have looked at home on Fraternity Row at Clemson or Ole Miss The Breakers called this one Heartbreak House or sometimes Heartbreak Hotel Fine It was where the taheen and a sizable contingent of cantoi lived and worked As for the Breakers let them have their little jokes and by all means let them believe that the staff didnt know Pimli Prentiss and Finli OTego strolled up the Mall in companionable silence except that was when they passed offduty Breakers either alone or in company Pimli greeted each of them with unfailing courtesy The greetings they returned varied from the completely cheerful to sullen grunts Yet each made some sort of response and Pimli counted this a victory He cared about them Whether they liked it or notmany didnthe cared about them They were certainly easier to deal with than the murderers rapists and armed robbers of Attica Some were reading old newspapers or magazines A foursome was throwing horseshoes Another foursome was on the putting green Tanya Leeds and Joey Rastosovich were playing chess under a graceful old elm the sunlight making dapples on their faces They greeted him with real pleasure and why not Tanya Leeds was now actually Tanya Rastosovich for Pimli had married them a month ago just like the captain of a ship And he supposed that in a way that was what this was the good ship Algul Siento a cruise vessel that sailed the dark seas of Thunderclap in her own sunny spotlight The sun went out from time to time say true but todays outage had been minimal only fortythree seconds Hows it going Tanya Joseph Always Joseph and never Joey at least not to his face he didnt like it They said it was going fine and gave him those dazed fuckstruck smiles of which only newlyweds are capable Finli said nothing to the Rastosoviches but near the Damli House end of the Mall he stopped before a young man sitting on a faux marble bench beneath a tree reading a book Sai Earnshaw the taheen asked Dinky looked up eyebrows raised in polite enquiry His face studded with a bad case of acne bore the same polite noexpression I see youre reading The Magus Finli said almost shyly I myself am reading The Collector Quite a coincidence If you say so Dinky replied His expression didnt change I wonder what you think of Fowles Im quite busy right now but perhaps later we could discuss him Still wearing that politely expressionless expression Dinky Earnshaw said Perhaps later you could take your copy of The Collectorhardcover I hopeand stick it up your furry ass Sideways Finlis hopeful smile disappeared He gave a small but perfectly correct bow Im sorry you feel that way sai The fuck outta here Dinky said and opened his book again He raised it pointedly before his face Pimli and Finli OTego walked on There was a period of silence during which the Master of Algul Siento tried out different approaches to Finli wanting to know how badly hed been hurt by the young mans comment The taheen was proud of his ability to read and appreciate hume literature that much Pimli knew Then Finli saved him the trouble by putting both of his longfingered handshis ass wasnt actually furry but his fingers werebetween his legs Just checking to make sure my nuts are still there he said and Pimli thought the good humor he heard in the Chief of Securitys voice was real not forced Im sorry about that Pimli said If theres anyone in Blue Heaven who has an authentic case of postadolescent angst its sai Earnshaw Youre tearing me apart Finli moaned and when the Master gave him a startled look Finli grinned showing those rows of tiny sharp teeth Its a famous line from a film called Rebel Without a Cause he said Dinky Earnshaw makes me think of James Dean He paused to consider Without the haunting good looks of course An interesting case Prentiss said He was recruited for an assassination program run by a Positronics subsidiary He killed his control and ran We caught him of course Hes never been any real troublenot for usbut hes got that painintheass attitude But you feel hes not a problem Pimli gave him a sideways glance Is there something you feel I should know about him No no Ive never seen you so jumpy as youve been over the last few weeks Hell call a spade a spadeso paranoid My grandfather had a proverb Pimli said You dont worry about dropping the eggs until youre almost home Were almost home now And it was true Seventeen days ago not long before the last batch of Wolves had come galloping through the door from the Arc  Staging Area their equipment in the basement of Damli House had picked up the first appreciable bend in the BearTurtle Beam Since then the Beam of Eagle and Lion had snapped Soon the Breakers would no longer be needed soon the disintegration of the secondtolast Beam would happen with or without their help It was like a precariously balanced object that had now picked up a sway Soon it would go too far beyond its point of perfect balance and then it would fall Or in the case of the Beam it would break Wink out of existence It was the Tower that would fall The last Beam that of Wolf and Elephant might hold for another week or another month but not much longer Thinking of that should have pleased Pimli but it didnt Mostly because his thoughts had returned to the Greencloaks Sixty or so had gone through Callabound last time the visual deployment and they should have been back in the usual seventytwo hours with the usual catch of Calla children Instead nothing He asked Finli what he thought about that Finli stopped He looked grave I think it may have been a virus he said Cry pardon A computer virus Weve seen it happen with a good deal of our computer equipment in Damli and you want to remember that no matter how fearsome the Greencloaks may look to a bunch of ricefarmers computers on legs is all they really are He paused Or the Callaofen may have found a way to kill them Would it surprise me to find that theyd gotten up on their hind legs to fight A little but not a lot Especially if someone with guts stepped forward to lead them Someone like a gunslinger mayhap Finli gave him a look that stopped just short of patronizing Ted Brautigan and Stanley Ruiz rode up the sidewalk on tenspeed bikes and when the Master and the Security Head raised hands to them both raised their hands in return Brautigan didnt smile but Ruiz did the loose happy smile of a true mental defective He was all eyeboogers stubbly cheeks and spitshiny lips but a powerful bugger just the same before God he was and such a man could do worse than chum around with Brautigan who had changed completely since being hauled back from his little vacation in Connecticut Pimli was amused by the identical tweed caps the two men were wearingtheir bikes were also identicalbut not by Finlis look Quit it Pimli said Quit what sai Finli asked Looking at me as if I were a little kid who just lost the top off his ice cream cone and doesnt have the wit to realize it But Finli didnt back down He rarely did which was one of the things Pimli liked about him If you dont want folk to look at you like a child then you mustnt act like one Thereve been rumors of gunslingers coming out of MidWorld to save the day for a thousand years and more And never a single authenticated sighting Personally Id be more apt to expect a visit from your Man Jesus The Rods say Finli winced as if this actually hurt his head Dont start with what the Rods say Surely you respect my intelligenceand your ownmore than that Their brains have rotted even faster than their skins As for the Wolves let me advance a radical concept it doesnt matter where they are or whats happened to them Weve got enough booster to finish the job and thats all I care about The Security Head stood for a moment at the steps that led up to the Damli House porch He was looking after the two men on the identical bikes and frowning thoughtfully Brautigans been a lot of trouble Hasnt he just Pimli laughed ruefully But his troublesome days are over Hes been told that his special friends from Connecticuta boy named Robert Garfield and a girl named Carol Gerberwill die if he makes any more trouble Also hes come to realize that while a number of his fellow Breakers regard him as a mentor and some such as the softheaded boy hes with revere him no one is interested in his philosophical ideas shall we say Not any longer if they ever were And I had a talk with him after he came back A hearttoheart This was news to Finli About what Certain facts of life Sai Brautigan has come to understand that his unique powers no longer matter as much as they once did Its gone too far for that The remaining two Beams are going to break with him or without him And he knows that at the end theres apt to be confusion Fear and confusion Pimli nodded slowly Brautigan wants to be here at the end if only to comfort such as Stanley Ruiz when the sky tears open Come lets have another look at the tapes and the telemetry Just to be safe They went up the wide wooden steps of Damli House side by side FIVE Two of the cantoi were waiting to escort the Master and his Security Chief downstairs Pimli reflected on how odd it was that everyoneBreakers and Algul Siento staff alikehad come to call them the low men Because it was Brautigan who coined the phrase Speak of angels hear the flutter of their wings Prentisss beloved Ma might have said and Pimli supposed that if there were true manimals in these final days of the true world then the cantoi would fill the bill much better than the taheen If you saw them without their weird living masks you would have thought they were taheen with the heads of rats But unlike the true taheen who regarded humes less a few remarkable exceptions such as Pimli himself as an inferior race the cantoi worshipped the human form as divine Did they wear the masks in worship They were closemouthed on die subject but Pimli didnt think so He thought they believed they were becoming humanwhich was why when they first put on their masks these were living flesh grown rather than made they took a hume name to go with their hume aspect Pimli knew they believed they would somehow replace human beings after the Fall although hmv they could believe such a thing was entirely beyond him There would be heaven after the Fall that was obvious to anyone whod ever read the Book of Revelation but Earth Some new Earth perhaps but Pimli wasnt even sure of that Two cantoi security guards Beeman and Trelawney stood at the end of the hall guarding the head of the stairs going down to the basement To Pimli all cantoi men even those with blond hair and skinny builds looked weirdly like that actor from the forties and fifties Clark Gable They all seemed to have the same thick sensual lips and batty ears Then when you got very close you could see the artificial wrinkles at the neck and behind the ears where their hume masks twirled into pigtails and ran into the hairy toothy flesh that was their reality whether they accepted it or not And there were the eyes Hair surrounded them and if you looked closely you could see that what you originally took for sockets were in fact holes in those peculiar masks of living flesh Sometimes you could hear the masks themselves breathing which Pimli found both weird and a litde revolting Hile said Beeman Hile said Trelawney Pimli and Finli returned the greeting they all fisted their foreheads and then Pimli led the way downstairs In the lower corridor walking past the sign which read WE MUST ALL WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A FIREFREE ENVIRONMENT and anodier reading ALL HAIL THE CANTOI Finli said very low They are so odd Pimli smiled and clapped him on the back That was why he genuinely liked Finli OTego like Ike and Mike they thought alike SIX Most of the Damli House basement was a large room jammed with equipment Not all of the stuff worked and they had no use for some of the instruments that did there was plenty they didnt even understand but they were very familiar with the surveillance equipment and the telemetry that measured darks units of expended psychic energy The Breakers were expressly forbidden from using their psychic abilities outside of The Study and not all of them could anyway Many were like men and women so severely toilettrained that they were unable to urinate without the visual stimuli that assured them that yes they were in the toilet and yes it was all right to let go Others like children who arent yet completely toilettrained were unable to prevent the occasional psychic outburst This might amount to no more than giving someone they didnt like a transient headache or knocking over a bench on the Mall but Pimlis men kept careful track and outbursts that were deemed on purpose were punished first offenses lightly repeat offenses with rapidly mounting severity And as Pimli liked to lecture to the newcomers back in the days when there had been newcomers Be sure your sin will find you out Finlis scripture was even simpler Telemetry doesnt lie Today they found nothing but transient blips on the telemetry readouts It was as meaningless as a fourhour audio recording of some groups farts and burps would have been The videotapes and the swingguards daybooks likewise produced nothing of interest Satisfied sai Finli asked and something in his voice caused Pimli to swing around and look at him sharply Are you Finli OTego sighed At times like this Pimli wished that either Finli were hume or that he himself were truly taheen The problem was Finlis inexpressive black eyes They were almost the shoebutton eyes of a Raggedy Andy doll and there was simply no way to read them Unless maybe you were another taheen I havent felt right for weeks now Finli said at last I drink too much graf to put myself asleep then drag myself through the day biting peoples heads off Part of its the loss of communications since the last Beam went You know that was inevitable Yes of course I know What Im saying is that Im trying to find rational reasons to explain irrational feelings and thats never a good sign On the far wall was a picture of Niagara Falls Some cantoi guard had turned it upside down The low men considered turning pictures upside down the absolute height of humor Pimli had no idea why But in the end who gave a shit I know how to do my Jacking job he thought rehanging Niagara Falls rightside up Iknmv how to do that and nothing else matters tell God and the Man Jesus thank ya We always knew things were going to get wacky at the end Finli said so I tell myself thats all this is This you know This feeling you have the former Paul Prentiss supplied Then he grinned and laid his right forefinger over a circle made by his left uiumb and index finger This was a taheen gesture which meant I tell you the truth This irrational feeling Yar Certainly I know that the Bleeding Lion hasnt reappeared in the north nor do I believe that the suns cooling from the inside Ive heard tales of the Red Kings madness and diat the DanTete has come to take his place and all I can say is Ill believe it when I see it Same with this wonderful news about how a gunslingermans come out of the west to save the Tower as the old tales and songs predict Bullshit every bit of it Pimli clapped him on the shoulder Does my heart good to hear you say so It did too Finli OTego had done a hell of a job during his tenure as Head His security cadre had had to kill half a dozen Breakers over the yearsall of them homesick fools trying to escapeand two others had been lobotomized but Ted Brautigan was the only one whod actually made it under the fence this phrase Pimli had picked up from a film called Stalag  and they had reeled him back in by God The cantoi took the credit and the Security Chief let them but Pimli knew the truth it was Finli whod choreographed each move from beginning to end But it might be more than just nerves this feeling of mine Finli continued I do believe that sometimes folk can have bona fide intuitions He laughed How could one not believe that in a place as lousy with precogs and postcogs as this one But no teleports Pimli said Right Teleportation was the one socalled wild talent of which all the Devar staff was afraid and with good reason There was no end to the sort of havoc a teleport could wreak Bringing in about four acres of outer space for instance and creating a vacuuminduced hurricane Fortunately there was a simple test to isolate that particular talent easy to administer although the equipment necessary was another leftover of the old people and none of them knew how long it would continue to work and a simple procedure also left behind by the old ones for shorting out such dangerous organic circuits Dr Gangli was able to take care of potential teleports in under two minutes So simple it makes a vasectomy look like brainsurgery hed said once Absafackinlutely no teleports was what Finli said now and led Prentiss to an instrument console that looked eerily like Susannah Deans visualization of her Dogan He pointed at two dials marked in the henscratch of the old people marks similar to those on the Unfound Door The needle of each dial lay flat against the O mark on the left When Finli tapped them with his furry thumbs they jumped a little and then fell back We dont know exactly what these dials were actually meant to measure he said but one thing they do measure is teleportation potential Weve had Breakers whove tried to shield the talent and it doesnt work If there was a teleport in the woodpile Pimli o New Jersey these needles would be jittering all the way up to fifty or even eighty So Halfsmiling halfserious Pimli began to count off on his fingers No teleports no Bleeding Lion stalking from the north no gunslingerman Oh and the Greencloaks succumbed to a computer virus If all thats the case whats gotten under your skin What feels hinkydidi to ya The approaching end I suppose Finli sighed heavily Im going to double the guard in the watchtowers tonight any ro and humes along the fence as well Because it feels hinkydidi Pimli smiling a little Hinkydidi yar Finli did not smile his cunning little teeth remained hidden inside his shiny brown muzzle Pimli clapped him on the shoulder Come on lets go up to The Study Perhaps seeing all those Breakers at work will soothe you Prhaps it will Finli said but he still didnt smile Pimli said gently Its all right Fin I suppose said the taheen looking doubtfully around at the equipment and then at Beeman and Trelawney the two low men who were respectfully waiting at the door for the two big bugs to finish their palaver I suppose tis Only his heart didnt believe it The only thing he was sure his heart believed was that there were no teleports left in Algul Siento Telemetry didnt lie SEVEN Beeman and Trelawney saw them all the way down the oakpaneled basement corridor to the staff elevator which was also oakpaneled There was a fireextinguisher on the wall of the car and another sign reminding Devarfolken that they had to work together to create a firefree environment This too had been turned upside down Pimlis eyes met Finlis The Master believed he saw amusement in his Security Chiefs look but of course what he saw might have been no more than his own sense of humor reflected back at him like a face in a mirror Finli untacked the sign without a word and turned it rightside up Neither of them commented on the elevator machinery which was loud and illsounding Nor on the way the car shuddered in the shaft If it froze escape through the upper hatch would be no problem not even for a slighdy overweight well quite overweight fellow like Prentiss Damli House was hardly a skyscraper and there was plenty of help near at hand They reached the third floor where the sign on the closed elevator door was rightside up It said STAFF ONLY and PLEASE USE KEY and GO DOWN IMMEDIATELY IF YOU HAVE REACHED THIS LEVEL IN ERROR YOU WILL NOT BE PENALIZED IF YOU REPORT IMMEDIATELY As Finli produced his keycard he said with a casualness that might have been feigned God damn his unreadable black eyes Have you heard from sai Sayre No Pimli said rather crossly nor do I really expect to Were isolated here for a reason deliberately forgotten in the desert just like the scientists of the Manhattan Project back in the s The last time I saw him he told me it might be well the last time I saw him Relax Finli said I was just asking He swiped the keycard down its slot and the elevator door slid open with a rather hellish screee sound EIGHT The Study was a long high room in the center of Damli also oakpaneled and rising three full stories to a glass roof that allowed the Alguls hardwon sunlight to pour in On the balcony opposite the door throvigh which Prentiss and the Tego entered was an odd trio consisting of a ravenhead taheen named Jakli a cantoi technician named Conroy and two hume guards whose names Pimli could not immediately recall Taheen cantoi and humes got on together during work hours by virtue of carefuland sometimes brittlecourtesy but one did not expect to see them socializing offduty And indeed the balcony was strictly offlimits when it came to socializing The Breakers below were neither animals in a zoo nor exotic fish in an aquarium Pimli Finli OTego as well had made this point to the staff over and over The Master of Algul Siento had only had to lobo one staff member in all his years here a perfectly idiotic hume guard named David Burke who had actually been throwing somethinghad it been peanutshellsdown on the Breakers below When Burke had realized the Master was serious about lobotomizing him he begged for a second chance promising hed never do anything so foolish and demeaning again Pimli had turned a deaf ear Hed seen a chance to make an example which would stand for years perhaps for decades and had taken it You could see the now truly idiotic Mr Burke around to this day walking on the Mall or out by Leftrds Boundry mouth slack and eyes vaguely puzzledalmost know who I am almost remember what I did to end up like this those eyes said He was a living example of what simply wasnt done when one was in the presence of working Breakers But there was no rule expressly prohibiting staff from coming up here and they all did from time to time Becavise it was refreshing For one thing being near working Breakers made talk unnecessary What they called good mind kicked in as you walked down the thirdfloor hall on either side from either elevator and when you opened the doors giving on the balcony good mind bloomed in your head opening all sorts of perceptual doorways Aldous Huxley Pimli had thought on more than one occasion would have gone absolutely bonkers up here Sometimes one found ones heels leaving the floor in a kind of halfassed float The stuff in your pockets tended to rise and hang in the air Formerly baffling situations seemed to resolve themselves the moment you turned your thoughts to them If youd forgotten something your five oclock appointment or your brotherinlaws middle name for instance this was the place where you could remember And even if you realized that what youd forgotten was important you were never distressed Folken left the balcony with smiles on their faces even if theyd come up in the foulest of moods a foul mood was an excellent reason to visit the balcony in the first place It was as if some sort of happygas invisible to the eye and unmeasurable by even the most sophisticated telemetry always rose from the Breakers below The two of them hiled the trio across the way then approached die wide fumedoak railing and looked down The room below might have been the capacious library of some richly endowed gentlemens club in London Softly glowing lamps many with genuine Tiffany shades stood on little tables or shone on the walls oakpaneled of course The rugs were the most exquisite Turkish There was a Matisse on one wall a Rembrandt on another and on a third was the Mona Lisa The real one as opposed to the fake hanging in the Louvre on Keystone Earth A man stood before it with his arms clasped behind him From up here he looked as though he were studying the paintingtrying to decipher the famously enigmatic smile maybebut Pimli knew better The men and women holding magazines looked as though they were reading too but if you were right down there youd see that they were gazing blankly over the tops of their McCalVs and their Harpers or a littie off to one side An eleven or twelveyearold girl in a gorgeous striped summer dress that might have cost sixteen hundred dollars in a Rodeo Drive kiddie boutique was sitting before a dollhouse on the hearth but Pimli knew she wasnt paying any attention to the exquisitely made replica of Damli at all Thirtythree of them down there Thirtythree in all At eight oclock an hour after the artificial sun snapped off thirtythree fresh Breakers would troop in And there was one fellowone and one onlywho came and went just as he pleased A fellow whod gone under the wire and paid no penalty for it at all except for being brought back that was and for this man that was penalty enough As if the thought had summoned him the door at the end of the room opened and Ted Brautigan slipped quietly in He was still wearing his tweed riding cap Daneeka Rostov looked up from the dollhouse and gave him a smile Brautigan dropped her a wink in return Pimli gave Finli a little nudge Finli I see him But it was more than seeing They felt him The moment Brautigan came into the room those on the balconyand much more important those on the floorfelt the powerlevel rise They still werent completely sure what theyd gotten in Brautigan and the testing equipment didnt help in that regard the old dog had blown out several pieces of it himself and on purpose the Master was quite sure If there were others like him the low men had found none on their talent hunts now suspended they had all the talent they needed to finish the job One thing that did seem clear was Brautigans talent as a facilitator a psychic who was not just powerful by himself but was able to up the abilities of others just by being near them Finlis thoughts ordinarily unreadable even to Breakers now burned in Pimlis mind like neon Finli He is extraordinary Pimli And so far as we know unique Have you seen the thing Image Eyes growing and shrinking growing and shrinking Finli Yes Do you know what causes it Pimli Not at all Nor care dear Finli nor care That old Image An elderly mongrel with burdocks in his matted fur limping along on three legs has almost finished his work almost time to Image A gun one of the hume guards Berettas against the side of the old mongrels head Three stories below them the subject of their conversation picked up a newspaper the newspapers were all old now old like Brautigan himself years out of date sat in a leatherupholstered club chair so voluminous it seemed almost to swallow him and appeared to read Pimli felt the psychic force rising past them and dirough them to the skylight and through that too rising to the Beam that ran directly above Algul working against it chipping and eroding and rubbing relentlessly against the grain Eating holes in the magic Working patiently to put out the eyes of the Bear To crack the shell of the Turtle To break the Beam which ran from Shardik to Maturin To topple the Dark Tower which stood between Pimli turned to his companion and wasnt surprised to realize he could now see the cunning litde teeth in the Tegos weasel head Smiling at last Nor was he surprised to realize he could read die black eyes Taheen under ordinary circumstances could send and receive some very simple mental communications but not be progged Here though all that changed Here CHere Finli OTego was at peace His concerns hinkydidi were gone At least for the time being Pimli sent Finli a series of bright images a champagne bottle breaking over the stern of a boat hundreds of flat black graduation caps rising in die air a flag being planted on Mount Everest a laughing couple escaping a church with their heads bent against a pelting storm of rice a planetEarthsuddenly glowing with fierce brilliance Images that all said the same thing Yes Finli said and Pimli wondered how he could ever have thought those eyes hard to read Yes indeed Success at the end of the day Neither of them looked down at that moment Had they done they would have seen Ted Brautiganan old dog yes and tired but perhaps not quite as tired as some thoughtlooking up at them With a ghost of his own smile NINE There was never rain out here at least not during Pimlis years but sometimes in the Stygian blackness of its nights there were great volleys of dry thunder Most of the DevarTois staff had trained themselves to sleep through these fusillades but Pimli often woke up heart hammering in his throat the Our Father running through his mostly unconscious mind like a circle of spinning red ribbon Earlier that day talking to Finli the Master of Algul Siento had used the phrase hinkydidivnxh a selfconscious smile and why not It was a childs phrase almost like alleealleeinfree or eeniemeen iemin iemoe Now lying in his bed at Shapleigh House known as Shit House to the Breakers a full Malls length away from Damli House Pimli remembered the feelingthe flatout certaintythat everything was going to be okay success assured only a matter of time On the balcony Finli had shared it but Pimli wondered if his Security Chief was now lying awake as Pimli himself was and thinking how easy it was to be misled when you were around working Breakers Because do ya they sent up that happygas That goodmind vibe And suppose just suppose now someone was actually channeling that feeling Sending it up to them like a lullabye Go to sleep Pimli go to sleep Finli go to sleep all of you good children Ridiculous idea totally paranoid Still when another doubleboom of thunder rolled out of what might still be the southeastfrom the direction of Fedic and the Discordia anyway Pimli Prentiss sat up and turned on the bedside lamp Finli had spoken of doubling the guard tonight both in the watchtowers and along the fences Perhaps tomorrow they might triple it Just to be on the safe side And because complacency this close to the end would be a very bad thing indeed Pimli got out of bed a tall man with a hairy slab of gut now wearing blue pajama pants and nothing else He pissed then knelt in front of the toilets lowered lid folded his hands and prayed until he felt sleepy He prayed to do his duty He prayed to see trouble before trouble saw him He prayed for his Ma just as Jim Jones had prayed for his as he watched the line move toward die tub of poisoned KoolAid He prayed until the thunder had died to little more than a senile mutter dien went back to bed calm again His last thought before drifting off was about tripling the guard first thing in the morning and that was the first thing he thought of when he woke to a room awash in artificial sunlight Because you had to take care of the eggs when you were almost home ONE A feeling both blue and strange crept among the gunslingers after Brautigan and his friends left but at first no one spoke of it Each of them thought that melancholy belonged to him or her alone Roland who might have been expected to know the feeling for what it was kashume Cort would have called it ascribed it instead to worries about the following day and even more to the debilitating atmosphere of Thunderclap where day was dim and night was as dark as blindness Certainly there was enough to keep them busy after the departure of Brautigan Earnshaw and Sheemie Ruiz that friend of Rolands childhood Both Susannah and Eddie had attempted to talk to the gunslinger about Sheemie and Roland had shaken them off Jake strong in the touch hadnt even tried Roland wasnt ready to talk about those old days again at least not yet There was a path leading down and around the flank of SteekTete and they found the cave of which the old man had told them behind a cunning camouflage of rocks and desertdusty bushes This cave was much bigger than the one above with gas lanterns hung from spikes that had been driven into the rock walls Jake and Eddie lit two of these on each side and the four of them examined the caves contents in silence The first thing Roland noticed was the sleepingbags a quartet lined up against the lefthand wall each considerately placed on an inflated air mattress The tags on the bags read PROPERTY OF US ARMY Beside the last of these a fifth air mattress had been covered with a layer of bath towels They were expecting four people and one animal the gunslinger thought Precognition or have they been watching us somehow And does it matter There was a plasticswaddled object sitting on a barrel marked DANGER MUNITIONS Eddie removed the protective plastic and revealed a machine with reels on it One of the reels was loaded Roland could make nothing of the single word on the front of the speaking machine and asked Susannah what it was Wollensak she said A German company When it comes to these things they make the best Not no mo sugarbee Eddie said In my when we like to say sony No baloney They make a tapeplayer you can clip right to your belt Its called a Walkman I bet this dinosaur weighs twenty pounds More with the batteries Susannah was examining the unmarked tape boxes that had been stacked beside the Wollensak There were three of them I cant wait to hear whats on these she said After the daylight goes maybe Roland said For now lets see what else weve got here Roland Jake asked The gunslinger turned toward him There was something about the boys face that almost always softened Rolands own Looking at Jake did not make the gunslinger handsome but seemed to give his features a quality they didnt ordinarily have Susannah thought it was the look of love And perhaps some thin hope for the future What is it Jake I know were going to fight Join us next week for Return to the OK Corral starring Van Heflin and Lee Van Cleef Eddie murmured walking toward the back of the cave There a much larger object had been covered with what looked like a quilted movers pad but when Jake continued Will it be tomorrow Perhaps Roland replied I think the day afters more likely I have a terrible feeling Jake said Its not being afraid exactly Do you think theyre going to beat us hon Susannah asked She put a hand on Jakes neck and looked into his face She had come to respect his feelings She sometimes wondered how much of what he was now had to do with the creature hed faced to get here the thing in the house on Dutch Hill No robot there no rusty old clockwork toy The doorkeeper had been a genuine leftover of the Prim You smell a whuppin in the wind That it I dont think so Jake said I dont know what it is Ive only felt something like it once and that was just before Just before what Susannah asked but before Jake had a chance to reply Eddie broke in Roland was glad Just before I fell That was how Jake had meant to finish Just before Rolandlet me fall Holy shit Come here you guys You gotta see this Eddie had pulled away the movers pad and revealed a motorized vehicle that looked like a cross between an ATV and a gigantic tricycle The tires were wide balloon jobs with deep zigzag treads The controls were all on the handlebars And there was a playing card propped on the rudimentary dashboard Roland knew what it was even before Eddie plucked it up between two fingers and turned it over The card showed a woman with a shawl over her head at a spinning wheel It was the Eady of Shadows Looks like our pal Ted left you a ride sugarbee Eddie said Susannah had hurried over at her rapid crawl Now she lifted her arms Boost me up Boost me Eddie He did and when she was in the saddle holding handlebars instead of reins the vehicle looked made for her Susannah thumbed a red button and the engine thrummed to life so low you could barely hear it Electricity not gasoline Eddie was quite sure Like a golfcart but probably a lot faster Susannah turned toward them smiling radiantly She patted the threewheelers dark brown nacelle Call me Missus Centaur I been lookin for this my whole life and never even knew None of them noticed the stricken expression on Rolands face He bent over to pick up the card Eddie had dropped so no one would Yes it was her all rightthe Lady of the Shadows Under her shawl she seemed to be smiling craftily and sobbing both at the same time On the last occasion hed seen that card it had been in the hand of the man who sometimes went by the name of Walter sometimes that of Flagg You have no idea how close you stand to the Tower now he had said Worlds turn about your head And now he recognized the feeling that had crept among them for what it almost certainly was not worry or weariness but kashume There was no real translation for that rueladen term but it meant to sense an approaching break in ones katet Walter o Dim his old nemesis was dead Roland had known it as soon as he saw the face of the Lady of Shadows Soon one of his own would die as well probably in the coming batde to break the power of the DevarToi And once again the scales which had temporarily tilted in their favor would balance It never once crossed Rolands mind that the one to die might be him TWO There were three brand names on what Eddie immediately dubbed Suzies Cruisin Trike One was Honda one was Takuro as in that wildly popular presuperflu import the Takuro Spirit the third was North Central Positronics And a fourth as well US ARMY as in PROPERTY OF Susannah was reluctant to get off it but finally she did God knew there was plenty more to see the cave was a treasure trove Its narrowing throat was filled with food supplies mosdy freezedried stuff that probably wouldnt taste as good as Nigels chow but would at least nourish them bottled water canned drinks plenty of Coke and NozzALa but nothing alcoholic and the promised propane stove There were also crates of weaponry Some of die crates were marked US ARMY but by no means all Now their most basic abilities came out the true thread Cort might have called it Those talents and intuitions that could have remained sleeping for most of their lives only stirring long enough to get them into occasional trouble if Roland had not deliberately wakened them cosseted them and then filed their teeth to deadly points Hardly a word was spoken among them as Roland produced a wide prying tool from his purse and levered away the tops of the crates Susannah had forgotten about the Cruisin Trike she had been waiting for all her life Eddie forgot to make jokes Roland forgot about his sense of foreboding They became absorbed in the weaponry that had been left for them and there was no piece of it they did not understand either at once or after a bit of study There was a crate of AR rifles the barrels packed in grease the firing mechanisms fragrant with banana oil Eddie noted the added selector switches and looked in the crate next to the s Inside covered with plastic and also packed in grease were metal drums They looked like the ones you saw on tommyguns in gangster epics like White Heat only these were bigger Eddie lifted one of the s turned it over and found exactly what he expected a conversion clip that would allow these drums to be attached to the guns turning them into rapidfire ricecutters How many shots per drum A hundred A hundred and twentyfive Enough to mow down a whole company of men that was sure There was a box of what looked like rocket shells with the letters STS stenciled on each In a rack beside them propped against the cave wall were half a dozen handheld launchers Roland pointed at the atomsymbol on them and shook his head He did not want them shooting off weapons that would release potentially lethal radiation no matter how powerful they might be He was willing to kill the Breakers if that was what it took to stop their meddling with the Beam but only as a last resort Flanking a metal tray filled with gasmasks to Jake they looked gruesome like the severed heads of strange bugs were two crates of handguns snubnosed machinepistols with the word COYOTE embossed on the butts and heavy automatics called Cobra Stars Jake was attracted to both weapons in truth his heart was attracted to all the weapons but he took one of the Stars because it looked a little bit like the gun he had lost The clip fed up the handle and held either fifteen or sixteen shots This was not a matter of counting but only of lookingand knowing Hey Susannah said Shed gone back toward the front of the cave Come look at this Sneetches Check out the cratelid Jake said when they joined her Susannah had set it aside Jake picked it up and was studying it with admiration It showed the face of a smiling boy with a lightningbolt scar on his forehead He was wearing round glasses and brandishing what appeared to be a magicians wand at a floating sneetch The words stenciled beneath the drawing read PROPERTY th SQUADRON SNEETCHES HARRY POTTER MODEL SERIAL CCNDJKR Dont Mess with the Well Kick the Slvtnerin out of You There were two dozen sneetches in the crate packed like eggs in little nests of plastic excelsior None of Rolands band had had the opportunity to study live ones closely during their battle with the Wolves but now they had a good swatch of time during which they could indulge their most natural interests and curiosities Each took up a sneetch They were about the size of tennis balls but a great deal heavier Their surfaces had been gridded making them resemble globes marked with lines of latitude and longitude Although they looked like steel the surfaces had a faint giving quality like very hard rubber There was an IDplate on each sneetch and a button beside it That wakes it up Eddie murmured and Jake nodded There was also a small depressed area in die curved surface just the right size for a finger Jake pushed it without the slightest worry that the thing would explode or maybe extrude a minibuzzsaw that would cut off his fingers You used the button at the bottom of the depression to access the programming He didnt know how he knew that but he most certainly did A curved section of the sneetchs surface slid away with a faint Auowwm sound Revealed were four tiny lights three of them dark and one flashing slow amber pulses There were seven windows now showing   Ml  Beneath each was a button so small that youd need something like the end of a straightened paperclip to push it The size of a bugs asshole as Eddie grumbled later on while trying to program one To die right of the windows were another two buttons these marked SandW Jake showed it to Roland This ones SET and the other ones WAIT Do you think so I think so Roland nodded Hed never seen such a weapon beforenot close up at any ratebut coupled with the windows he thought the use of the buttons was obvious And he thought die sneetches might be useful in a way the longshooters with their atomshells would not be SET and WAIT SET and WAIT Did Ted and his two pals leave all this stuff for us here Susannah asked Roland hardly thought it mattered whod left itit was here and that was enoughbut he nodded How And whered they get it Roland didnt know What he did know was that die cave was a masuna warchest Below them men were making war on the Tower which the line of Eld was sworn to protect He and his tet would fall upon them by surprise and with these tools they would smite and smite until their enemies lay with their boots pointed to the sky Or until theirs did Maybe he explains on one of the tapes he left us Jake said He had engaged the safety of his new Cobra automatic and tucked it away in the shoulderbag with the remaining Orizas Susannah had also helped herself to one of the Cobras after twirling it around her finger a time or two like Annie Oakley Maybe he does she said and gave Jake a smile It had been a long time since Susannah had felt so physically well So notpreg Yet her mind was troubled Or perhaps it was her spirit Eddie was holding up a piece of cloth that had been rolled into a tube and tied with three hanks of string That guy Ted said he was leaving us a map of the prisoncamp Bet this is it Anyone sides me want a look They all did Jake helped Eddie to unroll the map Brautigan had warned them it was rough and it surely was really no more than a series of circles and squares Susannah saw the name of the litde townPleasantvilleand thought again of Ray Bradbury Jake was tickled by the crude compass where the mapmaker had added a question mark beside the letter N While they were studying this hastily rendered example of cartography a long and wavering cry rose in the murk outside Eddie Susannah and Jake looked around nervously Oy raised his head from his paws gave a low brief growl then put his head back down again and appeared to go to sleep Hell witchoo bad boy Im wit my homies and I aint ascairt What is it Eddie asked A coyote A jackal Some kind of desert dog Roland agreed absently He was squatted on his hunkers which suggested his hip was better at least temporarily with his arms wrapped around his shins He never took his eyes from the crude circles and squares drawn on the cloth Cantoitete Is that like DanTete Jake asked Roland ignored him He scooped up the map and left the cave with it not looking back The others shared a glance and then followed him once more wrapping their blankets about them like shawls THREE Roland returned to where Sheemie with a litde help from his friends had brought them through This time the gunslinger used the binoculars looking down at Blue Heaven long and long Somewhere behind them die desert dog howled again a lonely sound in die gloom And Jake diought the gloom was gloomier now Your eyes adjusted as the day dialed itself down but that brilliant spodight of sun seemed brighter than ever by contrast He was pretty sure die deal widi die sunmachine was diat you got your fullon your fulloff and nodiing in between Maybe diey even let it shine all night but Jake doubted it Peoples nervous systems were set up for an orderly progression of dark and day hed learned that in science class You could make do with long periods of low lightpeople did it every year in the Arctic countriesbut it could really mess with your head Jake didnt think the guys in charge down diere would want to goof up their Breakers if they could help it Also theyd want to save their sun for as long as they could everything here was old and prone to breakdowns At last Roland gave die binoculars to Susannah Do look ya especially at die buildings on eidier end of die grassy rectangle He unrolled the map like a character about to read a scroll in a stageplay glanced at it briefly and then said Theyre numbered  and  on the map Susannah studied them carefully The one marked  the Wardens House was a small Cape Cod painted electric blue widi white trim It was what her modier might have called a fairytale house because of the bright colors and the gingerbread scalloping around the eaves Damli House was much bigger and as she looked she saw several people going in and out Some had die carefree look of civilians Odiers seemed much moreoh call it watchful And she saw two or three slumping along under loads of stuff She handed the glasses to Eddie and asked him if those were Children of Roderick I think so he said but I cant be completely Never mind the Rods Roland said not now What do you think of those two buildings Susannah Well she said proceeding carefully she did not in fact have the slightest idea what it was he wanted from her theyre both beautifully maintained especially compared to some of the fallingdown wrecks weve seen on our travels The one they call Damli House is especially handsome Its a style we call Queen Anne and Are they of wood do you think or just made to look that way Im particularly interested in the one called Damli Susannah redirected the binoculars there then handed them to Eddie He looked then handed them to Jake While Jake was looking there was an audible CLICK sound that rolled to them across the miles and the Cecil B DeMille sunbeam which had been shining down on the DevarToi like a spotlight went out leaving them in a thick purple dusk which would soon be complete and utter dark In it the desertdog began to howl again raising the skin on Jakes arms into gooseflesh The sound rose rose and suddenly cut off with one final choked syllable It sounded like some final cry of surprise and Jake had no doubt that the desertdog was dead Something had crept up behind it and when the big overhead light went out There were still lights on down there he saw a double white row that might have been streetlights in Pleasantville yellow circles that were probably arcsodiums along the various paths of what Susannah was calling Breaker U and spotlights running random patterns across the dark No Jake thought not spotlights Searchlights Like in a prison movie Lets go back he said Theres nothing to see anymore and I dont like it out here in the dark Roland agreed They followed him in single file with Eddie carrying Susannah and Jake walking behind them with Oy at his heel He kept expecting a second desertdog to take up the cry of the first but none did FOUR They were wood Jake said He was sitting crosslegged beneath one of the gas lanterns letting its welcome white glow shine down on his face Wood Eddie agreed Susannah hesitated a moment sensing it was a question of real importance and reviewing what she had seen Then she also nodded Wood Im almost positive Especially the one they call Damli House A Queen Anne built out of stone or brick and camouflaged to look like wood It makes no sense If it fools wandering folk whod burn it down Roland said it does It does make sense Susannah thought about it He was right of course but I still say wood Roland nodded So do I He had found a large green botde marked PERRIER NOW he opened it and ascertained that Perrier was water He took five cups and poured a measure into each He set them down in front of Jake Susannah Eddie Oy and himself s Do you call me dinh he asked Eddie Yes Roland you know I do Will you share khef with me and drink this water Yes if you like Eddie had been smiling but now he wasnt The feeling was back and it was strong Kashume a rueful word he did not yet know Drink bondsman Eddie didnt exactly like being called bondsman but he drank his water Roland knelt before him and put a brief dry kiss on Eddies lips I love you Eddie he said and outside in the ruin that was Thunderclap a desert wind arose carrying gritty poisoned dust Why I love you too Eddie said It was surprised out of him Whats wrong And dont tell me nothing is because I feelit Nothings wrong Roland said smiling but Jake had never heard the gunslinger sound so sad It terrified him Its only kashume and it comes to every katet that ever was but now while we are whole we share our water We share our khef Tis a jolly thing to do He looked at Susannah Do you call me dinh Yes Roland I call you dinh She looked very pale but perhaps it was only the white light from the gas lanterns Will you share khef with me and drink this water With pleasure said she and took up the plastic cup Drink bondswoman She drank her grave dark eyes never leaving his She thought of the voices shed heard in her dream of the Oxford jailcell this one dead that one dead other one dead O Discordia and the shadows grow deeper Roland kissed her mouth I love you Susannah I love you too The gunslinger turned to Jake Do you call me dinh Yes Jake said There was no question about his pallor even his lips were ashy Kashume means death doesnt it Which one of us will it be I know not Roland said and the shadow may yet lift from us for the wheels still in spin Did you not feel kashume when you and Callahan went into the place of the vampires Yes Kashume for both Yes Yet here you are Our katet is strong and has survived many dangers It may survive this one too But I feel Yes Roland said His voice was kind but that awful look was in his eyes The look that was beyond mere sadness the one that said this would be whatever it was but the Tower was beyond the Dark Tower was beyond and it was there that he dwelt heart and soul ka and khef Yes I feel it too So do we all Which is why we take water which is to say fellowship one with the other Will you share khef with me and share this water Yes Drink bondsman Jake did Then before Roland could kiss him he dropped the cup flung his arms about the gunslingers neck and whispered fiercely into his ear Roland I love you I love you too he said and released him Outside the wind gusted again Jake waited for something to howlperhaps in triumphbut nothing did Smiling Roland turned to the billybumbler Oy of MidWorld do you call me dinh DinhFOysaid Will you share khef with me and this water Khef Wat Drink bondsman Oy inserted his snout into his plastic cupan act of some delicacyand lapped until the water was gone Then he looked up expectantly There were beads of Perrier on his whiskers Oy I love you Roland said and leaned his face within range of the bumblers sharp teeth Oy licked his cheek a single time then poked his snout back into t h e glass hoping for a missed drop or two Roland put out his hands Jake took one and Susannah the other Soon they were all linked Like drunks at the end of an AA meeting Eddie thought We are katet Roland said We are one from many We have shared our water as we have shared our lives and our quest If one should fall that one will not be lost for we are one and will not forget even in death They held hands a moment longer Roland was the first to let go Whats your plan Susannah asked him She didnt call him sugar never called him that or any other endearment ever again so far as Jake was aware Will you tell us Roland nodded toward the Wollensak tape recorder still sitting on the barrel Perhaps we should listen to that first he said I do have a plan of sorts but what Brautigan has to say might help with some of the details FIVE Night in Thunderclap is the very definition of darkness no moon no stars Yet if we were to stand outside the cave where Roland and his tet have just shared khef and will now listen to the tapes Ted Brautigan has left them wed see two red coals floating in that winddriven darkness If we were to climb the path up the side of SteekTete toward those floating coals a dangerous proposition in the dark wed eventually come upon a sevenlegged spider now crouched over the queerly deflated body of a mutie coyote This cantoitete was a literally misbegotten thing in life with the stub of a fifth leg jutting from its chest and ajellylike mass of flesh hanging down between its rear legs like a deformed udder but its flesh nourishes Mordred and its bloodtaken in a series of long steaming gulpsis as sweet as a dessert wine There are in truth all sorts of things to eat over here Mordred has no friends to lift him from place to place via the sevenleague boots of teleportation but he found his journey from Thunderclap Station to SteekTete far from arduous He has overheard enough to be sure of what his father is planning a surprise attack on the facility below Theyre badly outnumbered but Rolands band of shooters is fiercely devoted to him and surprise is ever a powerful weapon And gunslingers are what Jake would call fou crazy when their blood is up and afraid of nothing Such insanity is an even more powerful weapon Mordred was born with a fair amount of inbred knowledge it seems He knows for instance that his Red Father possessed of such information as Mordred now has would have sent word of the gunslingers presence at once to the DevarTois Master or Security Chief And then sometime later tonight the katet out of MidWorld would have found themselves ambushed Balled in their sleep mayhap thus allowing the Breakers to continue the Kings work Mordred wasnt born with a knowledge of that work but hes capable of logic and his ears are sharp He now understands what the gunslingers are about they have come here to break the Breakers He could stop it true but Mordred feels no interest in his Red Fathers plans or ambitions What he most truly enjoys hes discovering is the bitter loneliness of outside Of watching with the cold interest of a child watching life and death and war and peace through the glass wall of the antfarm on his bureau Would he let yon kidam actually kill his White Father Oh probably not Mordred is reserving that pleasure for himself and he has his reasons already he has his reasons But as for the othersthe young man the shorleg woman the kidyes if kidam Prentiss gets the upper hand by all means let him kill any or all three of them As for Mordred Deschain he will let the game play out straight He will watch He will listen He will hear the screams and smell the burning and watch the blood soak into the ground And then if he judges that Roland wont win his throw he Mordred will step in On behalf of the Crimson King if it seems like a good idea but really on his own behalf and for his own reason which is really quite simple Mordreds ahungry And if Roland and his katet should win their throw Win and press on to the Tower Mordred doesnt really think it will happen for he is in his own strange way a member of their katet he shares their khef and feels what they do He feels the impending break of their fellowship Kashume Mordred thinks smiling Theres a single eye left in the desertdogs face One of the hairy black spiderlegs caresses it and then plucks it out Mordred eats it like a grape then turns back to where the white light of the gaslanterns spills around the corners of the blanket Roland has hung across the caves mouth Could he go down closer Close enough to listen Mordred thinks he could especially with the rising wind to mask the sound of his movements An exciting idea He scutters down the rocky slope toward the errant sparks of light toward the murmur of the voice from the tape recorder and the thoughts of those listening his brothers his sistermother the pet billy and of course overseeing them all Big White KaDaddy Mordred creeps as close as he dares and then crouches in the cold and windy dark miserable and enjoying his misery dreaming his outside dreams Inside beyond the blanket is light Let them have it if they like for now let there be light Eventually he Mordred will put it out And in the darkness he will have his pleasure ONE Eddie looked at the others Jake and Roland were sitting on the sleepingbags which had been left for them Oy lay curled up at Jakes feet Susannah was parked comfortably on the seat of her Cruisin Trike Eddie nodded satisfied and pushed the tape recorders PLAY button The reels spun there was silence they spun and silence then after clearing his throat Ted Brautigan began to speak They listened for over four hours Eddie replacing each empty reel with the next full one not bothering to rewind No one suggested they stop certainly not Roland who listened with silent fascination even when his hip began to throb again Roland thought he understood more now certainly he knew they had a real chance to stop what was happening in the compound below them The knowledge frightened him because their chances of success were slim The feeling of kashume made that clear And one did not really understand the stakes until one glimpsed the goddess in her white robe the bitchgoddess whose sleeve fell back to reveal her comely white arm as she beckoned Come to me run to me Yes its possible you may gain your goal you may win so run to me give me your whole heart And if I break it Ifone of you falls short falls into the pit ofcoffah the place your neiv friends call hell Too bad for you Yes if one of them fell into coffah and burned within sight of the fountains that would be too bad indeed And the bitch in the white robe Why shed only put her hands on her hips and throw back her head and laugh as the world ended So much depended on the man whose weary rational voice now filled the cave The Dark Tower itself depended on him for Brautigan was a man of staggering powers The surprising thing was that the same could be said of Sheemie TWO Test one two test one two test test test This is Ted Stevens Brautigan and this is a test A brief pause The reels turned one full the other now beginning to fill Okay good Great in fact I wasnt sure this thing would work especially here but it seems fine I prepared for this by trying to imagine you fourfive counting the boys little friendlistening to me because Ive always found visualization an excellent technique when preparing some sort of presentation Unfortunately in this case it doesnt work Sheemie can send me very good mental picturesbrilliant ones in factbut Roland is the only one of you hes actually seen and him not since the fall of Gilead when both of them were very young No disrespect fellows but I suspect the Roland now coming toward Thunderclap looks hardly anything like the young man my friend Sheemie so worshipped Where are you now Roland In Maine looking for the writer The one who also created me after a fashion In New York looking for Eddies wife Are any of you even still alive I know the chances of you reaching Thunderclap arent good ka is drawing you to the DevarToi but a very powerful antika set in motion by the one you call the Crimson King is working against you and your tet in a thousand ways All the same Was it Emily Dickinson who called hope the thing with feathers I cant remember There are a great many things I cant remember any longer but it seems I still remember how to fight Maybe thats a good thing I hope its a good thing Has it crossed your mind to wonder where Im recording this lady and gentlemen It hadnt They simply sat mesmerized by the slightly dusty sound of Brautigans voice passing a bottle of Perrier and a tin filled with graham crackers back and forth Ill tell yon Brautigan went on partly because the three of you from America will surely find it amusing but mostly because you may find it useful in formulating a plan to destroy whats going on in Algul Siento As I speak Im sitting on a chair made of slab chocolate The seat is a big blue marshmallow and I doubt if the air mattresses were planning to leave you could be any more comfortable Youd think such a seat would be sticky but its not The walls of this roomand the kitchen I can see if I look through the gumdrop arch to my leftare made of green yellow and red candy Lick the green one and you taste lime Lick the red one and you taste raspberry Although taste in any sense of that slippery word had very little to do with Sheemies choices or so I believe I think he simply has a childs love of bright primary colors Roland was nodding and smiling a little Although I must tell you the voice from the tape recorder said dryly Id be happy to have at least one room with a slightly more reserved decor Something in blue perhaps Earthtones would be even better Speaking of earth tones the stairs are also chocolate The banisters a candycane One cannot however say the stairs going up to the second floor because there is no second floor Through the window you can see cars that look suspiciously like bonbons going by and the street itself looks like licorice But if you open the door and take more than a single step toward Twizzler Avenue you find yourself back where you started In what we may as well call the real world for want of a better term Gingerbread Housewhich is what we call it because thats what you always smell in here warm gingerbread just out of the ovenis as much Dinkys creation as it is Sheemies Dink wound up in the Corbett House dorm with Sheemie and heard Sheemie crying himself to sleep one night A lot of people would have passed by on the other side in a case like that and I realize that no one in the world looks less like the Good Samaritan than Dinky Earnshaw but instead of passing by he knocked on the door of Sheemies suite and asked if he could come in Ask him about it now and Dinky will tell you it was no big deal I was new in the place I was lonely I wanted to make some friends hell say Hearing a guy bawling like that it hit me that he might want a friend too As though it were the most natural thing in the world In a lot of places that might be true but not in Algul Siento And you need to understand that above all else I think if youre going to understand us So forgive me if I seem to dwell on the point Some of the hume guards call us morks after a space alien in some television comedy And morks are the most selfish people on Earth Antisocial Not exactly Some are extremely social but only insofar as it will get them what they currently want or need Very few morks are sociopaths but most sociopaths are morks if you understand what Im saying The most famous and thank God the low men never brought him over here was a mass murderer named Ted Bundy If you have an extra cigarette or two no one can be more sympatheticor admiringthan a mork in need of a smoke Once hes got it though hes gone Most morksIm talking ninetyeight or nine out of a hundredwould have heard crying behind that closed door and never so much as slowed down on their way to wherever Dinky knocked and asked if he could come in even though he was new in the place and justifiably confused he also thought he was going to be punished for murdering his previous boss but thats a story for another day And we should look at Sheemies side of it Once again Id say ninetyeight or even ninetynine morks out of a hundred would have responded to a question like that by shouting Get lost or even Fuck off Why Because we are exquisitely aware that were different from most people and that its a difference most people dont like Any more than the Neanderthals liked the first CroMagnons in the neighborhood I would imagine Morks dont like to be caught offguard A pause The reels spun All four of them could sense Brautigan thinking hard No thats not quite right he said at last What morks dont like is to be caught in an emotionally vulnerable state Angry happy in tears or fits of hysterical laughter anything like that It would be like you fellows going into a dangerous situation without your guns For a long time I was alone here I was a mork who caied whether I liked it or not Then there was Sheemie brave enough to accept comfort if comfort was offered And Dink who was willing to reach out Most morks are selfish introverts masquerading as rugged individualiststhey want the world to see them as Danl Boone typesand the Algul staff loves it believe me No community is easier to govern than one that rejects the very concept of community Do you see why I was attracted to Sheemie and Dinky and how lucky I was to find them Susannahs hand crept into Eddies He took it and squeezed it gently Sheemie was afraid of the dark Ted continued The low menI call em all low men although there are humes and taheen at work here as well as cantoihave a dozen sophisticated tests for psychic potential but they couldnt seem to realize that they had caught a halfwit who was simply afraid of the dark Their bad luck Dinky understood the problem right away and solved it by telling Sheemie stories The first ones were fairytales and one of them was Hansel and Gretel Sheemie was fascinated by the idea of a candy house and kept asking Dinky for more details So you see it was Dinky who actually thought of the chocolate chairs with the marshmallow seats the gumdrop arch and the candycane banister For a little while there was a second floor it had the beds of the Three Bears in it But Sheemie never cared much for that story and when it slipped his mind the upstairs of Casa Gingerbread Ted Brautigan chuckled Well I suppose you could say it biodegraded In any case I believe that this place Im in is actually a fistula in time or Another pause A sigh Then Look there are a billion universes comprising a billion realities Thats something Ive come to realize since being hauled back from what the kidam insists on calling my little vacation in Connecticut Smarmy son of a bitch Real hate in Brautigans voice Roland thought and that was good Hate was good It was useful Those realities are like a hall of mirrors only no two reflections are exactly the same I may come back to that image eventually but not yet What I want you to understand for nowor simply acceptis that reality is organic reality is alive Its something like a muscle What Sheemie does is poke a hole in that muscle with a mental hypo He only has a needle like this because hes special Because hes a mork Eddie murmured Hush Susannah said using it Brautigan went on Roland considered rewinding in order to pick up the missing words and decided they didnt matter Its a place outside of time outside of reality I know you understand a little bit about the function of the Dark Tower you understand its unifying purpose Well think of Gingerbread House as a balcony on the Tower when we come here were outside the Tower but still attached to the Tower Its a real placereal enough so Ive come back from it with candystains on my hands and clothesbut its a place only Sheemie Ruiz can access And once were there its whatever he wants it to be One wonders Roland if you or your friends had any inkling of what Sheemie truly was and what he could do when you met him in Mejis At this Roland reached out and pushed the STOP button on the tape recorder We knew he was odd he told the others We knew he was special Sometimes Cuthbert would say What is it about that boy He makes my skin itch And then he showed up in Gilead he and his mule Cappi Claimed to have followed us And we knew that was impossible but so much was happening by then that a saloonboy from Mejisnot bright but cheerful and helpfulwas the least of our worries He teleported didnt he Jake asked Roland who had never even heard the word before today nodded immediately At least part of the distance he had to have For one thing how else could he have crossed the Xay River There was only the one bridge a thing made out of ropes and once we were across Alain cut it We watched it fall into the water a thousand feet below Maybe he went around Jake said Roland nodded Maybe he did but it would have taken him at least six hundred wheels out of his way Susannah whistled Eddie waited to see if Roland had more to say When it was clear he didnt Eddie leaned forward and pushed the PLAY button again Teds voice filled die cave once more Sheemies a teleport Dinky himself is a precog among other things Unfortunately a good many avenues into the future are blocked to him If youre wondering if young sai Earnshaw knows how all this is going to turn out the answer is no In any case theres this hypodermic hole in the living flesh of reality this balcony on the flank of the Dark Tower this Gingerbread House A real place as hard as that might be to believe Its here that well store the weapons and camping gear we eventually mean to leave for you in one of the caves on the far side of SteekTete and its here that Im making this tape When I left my room with this oldfashioned but fearsomely efficient machine under my arm it was AM BHSTBlue Heaven Standard Time When I return it will still be AM No matter how long I stay That is only one of the terribly convenient things about Gingerbread House You need to understandperhaps Sheemies old friend Roland already doesthat we are three rebels in a society dedicated to the idea of going along to get along even if it means the end of existence and sooner rather than later We have a number of extremely useful talents and by pooling them weve managed to stay one step ahead Bvit if Prentiss or Finli OTegohes Prentisss Security Chieffinds out what were trying to do Dinky would be wormfood by nightfall Sheemie as well quite likely Id probably be safe awhile longer for reasons Ill get to but if Pimli Prentiss found out we were trying to bring a true gunslinger into his affairsone who may already have orchestrated the deaths of over five dozen Greencloaks not far from hereeven my life might not be safe A pause Worthless thing that it is There was a longer pause The reel that had been empty was now halffull Listen then Brautigan said and Ill tell you the story of an unfortunate and unlucky man It may be a longer story than you have time to listen to if that be the case Im sure at least three of you will understand the use of the button labeled FF AS for me Im in a place where clocks are obsolete and broccoli is no doubt prohibited by law I have all the time in the world Eddie was again struck by how weary the man sounded Id just suggest that you not fastforward unless you really have to As Ive said there may be something here that can help you although I dont know what Im simply too close to it And Im tired of keeping my guard up not just when Im awake but when Im sleeping too If I wasnt able to slip away to Gingerbread House every now and again and sleep with no defenses Finlis cantoi boys would surely have bagged the three of us a long time ago Theres a sofa in the corner also made out of those wonderful nonstick marshmallows I can go there and lie down and have the nightmares I need to have in order to keep my sanity Then I can go back to the DevarToi where my job isnt just protecting myself but protecting Sheemie and Dink too Making sure that when we go about our covert business it appears to the guards and their fucking telemetry that we were right where we belonged the whole time in our suites in The Study maybe taking in a movie at the Gem or grabbing ice cream sodas at Henry Grahams Drug Store and Fountain afterward It also means continuing to Break and every day I can feel the Beam were currently working onBear and Turtlebending more and more Get here quick boys Thats my wish for you Get here just as quick as ever you can Because it isnt just a question of me slipping up you know Dinkys got a terrible temper and a habit of going off on foulmouthed tirades if someone pushes his hotbuttons He could say the wrong thing in a state like that And Sheemie does his best but if someone were to ask him the wrong question or catch him doing the wrong thing when Im not around to fix it Brautigan didnt finish that particular thought As far as his listeners were concerned he didnt need to THREE When he begins again its to tell them he was born in Milford Connecticut in the year  We have all heard similar introductory lines enough to know that they signalfor better or worsethe onset of autobiography Yet as they listen to that voice the gunslingers are visited by another familiarity this is true even ofOy At first theyre not able to put their finger on it but in time it comes to them The story of Ted Brautigan a Wandering Accountant instead of a Wandering Priest is in many ways similar to that of Pere Donald Callahan They could almost be twins And the sixth listenerthe one beyond the blanketblocked cave entrance in the windy darkhears with growing sympathy and understanding Why not Booze isnt a major player in Brautigans story as it was in the Peres but its still a story of addiction and isolation the story of an outsider FOUR At the age of eighteen Theodore Brautigan is accepted into Harvard whew his Uncle Tim went and Uncle Timchildless himselfis more than willing to pay for Teds higher education And so far as Timothy Atwood knows what happens is perfectly straightforward offer made offer accepted nephew shines in all the right areas nephew graduates and prepares to enter uncles furniture business after six months spent touring postWorld War I Europe What Uncle Tim doesnt know is that before going to Harvard Ted tries to enlist in what will soon be known as the American Expeditionary Force Son the doctor tells him you ve got one hell of a loud heart murmur and your hearing is substandard Now are you going to tell me that you came here not knowing those things would get you a red stamp Because pardon me if Im out of line here you look too smart for that And then Ted Brautigan does something hes never done before has sworn he neverwill do He asks the Army doc to pick a number not just between one and ten but between one and a thousand To humor him its rainy in Hartford and that means things are slow in the enlistment office the doctor thinks of the number  Ted gives it back to him Plus   and  When Ted invites him to think of a famous person living or dead and when Ted tells him Andrew Johnson notJackson butohnson the doc is finally amazed He calls over another doc a friend and Ted goes through the same rigmarole again with one exception He asks the second doctor to pick a number between one and a million then tells the doctor he was thinking of eightyseven thousand four hundred and sixteen The second doctor looks momentarily surprisedstunned in factthen covers with a big shitlicking smile Sorry son he says you were only off by a hundred and thirty thousand or so Ted looks at him not smiling not responding to the shitlicking smile in any way at all of which he is aware but hes eighteen and still young enough to be flabbergasted by such utter and seemingly pointless mendacity Meanwhile Doc Number Twos shitlicking smile has begun to fade on its own Doc Number Two turns to Doc Number One and says Look at his eyes Samlook at whats happening to his eyes The first doctor tries to shine an ophthalmoscope in Teds eyes and Ted brushes it impatiently aside He has access to mirrors and has seen the way his pupils sometimes expand and contract is aware when its happening even when theres no mirror handy by a kind of shuttering stuttering effect in his vision and it doesnt interest him especially not now What interests him now is that Doc Number Two is fucking with him and he doesnt know why Write the number down this time he invites Write it down so you cant cheat Doc Number Two blusters Ted reiterates his challenge Doc Sam produces a piece of paper and a pen and the second doctor takes it He is actually about to write a number when he reconsiders and tosses the pen on Sams desk and says This is some kind of cheap streetcorner trick Sam If you cant see that youre blind And stalks away Ted invites Dr Sam to think of a relative any relative and a moment later tells the doctor hes thinking of his brother Guy who died of appendicitis when Guy ivas fourteen ever since their mother has called Guy Sams guardian angel This time Dr Sam looks as though hes been slapped At last hes afraid Whether its the odd inandout movement of Teds pupils or the matteroffact demonstration of telepathy with no dramatic foreheadrubbing no Im getting a picture waitDr Sam is finally afraid He stamps REJECTED on Teds enlistment application with the big red stamp and tries to get rid of himnext case who wants to go to France and sniff the mustard gasbut Ted takes his arm in a grip which is gentle but not in the least tentative Listen to me says Ted Stevens Brautigan I am a genuine telepath Ive suspected it since I was six or seven years oldold enough to know the wordand Ive known it for sure since I was sixteen I could be of great help in Army Intelligence and my substandard hearing and heart murmur wouldnt matter in such a post As for the thing with my eyes He reaches into his breast pocket produces a pair of sunglasses and slips them on Tada He gives Dr Sam a tentative smile It does no good There is a SergeantatArms standing at the door of the temporary recruitment office in East Hartford Highs physical education department and the medic summons him This fellow is F and Im tired of arguing with him Perhaps you d be good enough to escort him off the premises Now it is Teds arm which is gripped and none too gently Wait a minute Ted says Theres something else Something even more valuable I dont know if theres a word for it but Before he can continue the SergeantatArms drags him out and hustles him rapidly down the hall past several gawking boys and girls almost exactly his own age There is a word and hell learn it years later in Blue Heaven The word is facilitator and as far as Paul Pimli Prentiss is concerned it makes Ted Stevens Brautigan just about the most valuable hume in the universe Not on that day in  though On that day in  he is dragged briskly down the hallway and deposited on the granite step outside the main doors and told by a man with afootthick accent that Yall just want tstay outta heah boa After some consideration Ted decides the SergeantatArms isnt calling him a snake boa in this context is most likely Dixie for boy For a little while Ted just stands where he has been left Hes thinking What does it take to convince you and How blind can you be He cant believe what just happened to him But he has to believe it because here he is on the outside And at the end of a sixmile walk around Hartford he thinks he understands something else as well They will never believe None of them Not ever They II refuse to see that a fellow who could read the collective mind of the German High Command might be mildly useful A fellow who could tell the Allied High Command where the next big German push was going to come A fellow who could do a thing like that a few timesmaybe even just once or twicemight be able to end the war by Christmas But he wont have the chance because they wont give it to him And why It has something to do with the second doctor changing his number when Ted landed on it and then refusing to write another one down Because somewhere down deep they want to fight and a guy like him would spoil everything Its something like that Fuck it then Hell go to Harvard on his uncles nickel And does Harvards all Dinky told them and more Drama Debate Harvard Crimson Mathematical Odd Fellows and of course the capper Phi Beta Crapper He even saves Unc a few bucks by graduating early He is in the south of France the war long over when a telegram reaches him UNCLE DEAD STOP RETURN HOME SOONEST STOP The key word here seemed to be STOP God knows it was one of those watershed moments He went home yes and he gave comfort where comfort was due yes But instead of stepping into the furniture business Ted decides to STOP his march toward financial success and START his march toward financial obscurity In the course of the mans long story Rolands katet never once hears Ted Brautigan blame his deliberate anonymity on his outre talent or on his moment of epiphany this is one valuable talent that no one in the world wants And God how he comes to understand that For one thing his wild talent as the pulp sciencefiction magazines sometimes call it is actually physically dangerous under the right circumstances Or the wrong ones In  in Ohio it makes Ted Brautigan a murderer He has no doubt that some would feel the word is too harsh but he will be the judge of that in this particular case thank you oh so very much and he thinks the word is apt Its Akron and its a blue summer dusk and kids are playing kickthecan at one end ofStossy Avenue and stickball at the other and Brautigan stands on the corner in a summerweight suit stands by the pole with the white stripe painted on it the white stripe that means the bus stops here Behind him is a deserted candystore with a blue NRA eagle in one windoio and a whitewashed message in the other that says THEIR KILLING THE IJTTLE MAN Ted is just standing there with his scuffed cordovan briefcase and a brown sacka pork chop for his supper he got it at Mr Dales Fancy Butcher Shopwhen all at once somebody runs into him from behind and hes driven into the telephone pole with the white stripe on it He connects nosefirst His nose breaks It sprays blood Then his mouth connects and he feels his teeth cut into the soft lining of his lips and all at once his mouth is filled ivith a salty taste like hot tomato juice Theres a thud in the small of his back and a ripping sound His trousers are pulled halfway down over his ass by the force of the hit hanging crooked and twisted like the pants of a clown and all at once a guy in a teeshirt and gabardine slacks with a shiny seat is running off doion Stossy Avenue toward the stickball game and that thing flapping in his right hand flapping like a brown leather tongue why that thing is Ted Brautigans wallet He has just been mugged out of his wallet by God The purple dusk of that summer night deepens suddenly to full dark then lightens up again then deepens once more Its his eyes doing the trick that so amazed the second doctor almost twenty years before but Ted hardly notices His attention is fixed on the fleeing man the son of a bitch who just mugged him out of his wallet and spoiled his face in the process Hes never been so angry in his life never and although the thought he sends at the fleeing man is innocuous almost gentle say buddy I wouldve given you a dollar if youd asked maybe even two it has the deadly weight of a thrown spear And zYwas a spear It takes him some time to fully accept that but when the time comes he realizes that hes a murderer and if theres a God Ted Brautigan will someday have to stand at His throne and answer for what hes just done The fleeing man looks like he stumbles over something but theres nothing there only HARRY LOVES BELINDA printed on the cracked sidewalk in fading chalk The sentiment is surrounded with childish doodlesstars a comet a crescent moonwhich he will later come to fear Ted feels like he just took a spear in the middle of the back himself but he at least is still standing And he didnt mean it Theres that He knoivs in his heart that he didnt mean it He was just surprised into anger He picks up his wallet and sees the stickball kids staring at him their mouths open He points his wallet at them like some kind of gun with a floppy barrel and the boy holding the sawedoff broomhandle flinches Its the flinch even more than the falling body that will haunt Teds dreams for the next year or so and then off and on for the rest of his life Because he likes kids would never scare one on purpose And he knows what they are seeing a man with his pants mostly pulled down so his boxer shorts show for all he knows his dingus could be hanging out of the fly front and wouldnt that just be the final magical touch a wallet in his hand and a loony look on his bloody kisser You didnt see anything he shouts at them You hear me now You hear me You didnt see anything Then he hitches up his pants Then he goes back to his briefcase and picks it up but not the pork chop in the brown paper sack fuck the pork chop he lost his appetite along with one of his incisors Then he takes another look at the body on the sidewalk and the frightened kids Then he runs Which turns into a career FIVE The end of the second tape pulled free of the hub and made a soft fwipfwipfwip sound as it turned Jesus Susannah said Jesus that poor man So long ago Jake said and shook his head as if to clear it To him the years between his when and Mr Brautigans seemed an unbridgeable chasm Eddie picked up the third box and displayed the tape inside raising his eyebrows at Roland The gunslinger twirled a finger in his old gesture the one that said go on go on Eddie threaded the tape through the heads Hed never done this before but you didnt have to be a rocket scientist as the saying went The tired voice began again speaking from the Gingerbread House Dinky Earnshaw had made for Sheemie a real place created from nothing more than imagination A balcony on the side of the Dark Tower Brautigan had called it Hed killed the man by accident they all would have agreed they had come to live by the gun and knew the difference between by accident and on purpose without needing to discuss the matter around seven in the evening By nine that night Brautigan was on a westbound train Three days later he was scanning the Accountants Wanted ads in the Des Moines newspaper He knew something about himself by then knew how careful he would have to be He could no longer allow himself the luxury of anger even when anger was justified Ordinarily he was just your gardenvariety telepathcould tell you what you had for lunch could tell you which card was the queen of hearts because the streetcorner sharpie running the montecon knewbut when angry he had access to this spear this terrible spear And just by the way thats not true said the voice from the tape recorder The part about being just a gardenvariety telepath I mean and I understood that even when I was a wetbehindtheears kid trying to get into the Army I just didnt know the word for what I was The word it turned out was facilitator And he later became sure that certain folkscertain talent scoutswere watching him even then sizing him up knowing he was different even in the subset of telepaths but not how different For one thing telepaths who did not come from die Keystone Earth it was their phrase were rare For another Ted had come to realize by the midnineteenthirties that what he had was actually catching If he touched a person while in a state of high emotion that person for a short time became a telepath What he hadnt known tfien was that people who were already telepaths became stronger Exponentially stronger But thats ahead of my story he said He moved from town to town a hobo who rode the rods in a passenger car and wearing a suit instead of in a boxcar wearing Oshkosh biballs never staying in one place long enough to put down roots And in retrospect he supposed he knew that even then he was being watched It was an intuitive thing or like oddities one sometimes glimpsed from the corner of ones eye He became aware of a certain kind of people for instance A few were women most were men and all had a taste for loud clothes rare steak and fast cars painted in colors as garish as their clouiing Their faces were oddly heavy and strangely inexpressive It was a look he much later came to associate with dumbbells whod gotten plastic surgery from quack doctors During that same twentyyear periodbut once again not consciously only in the corner of his minds eyehe became aware that no matter what city he was in those childishly simple symbols had a way of turning up on fences and stoops and sidewalks Stars and comets ringed planets and crescent moons Sometimes a red eye There was often a hopscotch grid in the same area but not always Later on he said it all fit together in a crazy sort of way but not back in the thirties and forties and early fifties when he was drifting No back then hed been a little bit like Docs One and Two not wanting to see what was right in front of him because it was disturbing And then right around the time Korea was winding down he saw The Ad It promised THE JOB OF A LIFETIME and said that if yon were THE MAN WITH THE RIGHT QUALIFICATIONS there would be ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTIONS ASKED A number of required skills were enumerated accountancy being one of them Brautigan was sure the ad ran in newspapers all over the country he happened to read it in the Sacramento Bee Holy crap Jake cried Thats the same paper Pere Callahan was reading when he found out his friend George Magruder Hush Roland said Listen They listened The tests are administered by humes a term Ted Brautigan wont know for another few weeksnot until he steps out of the year  and into the notime of the Algal The interviewer he eventually meets in San Francisco is also a hume Ted will learn among a great many other things that the disguises the low men wear most particularly the masks they loear are not good not when you re up close and personal Up close and personal you can see the truth they are humetaheen hybrids who take the matter of their becoming with a religious fervor The easiest way to find yourself wrapped in a lowman bearhug loith a set of murderous lowman teeth searching for your carotid artery is to aver that the only two things they are becoming is older and uglier The red marks on their foreheadsthe Eye of the Kingusually disappear when they are Americaside or dry up like temporarily dormant pimples and the masks take on a weird organic quality except for behind the ears where the hairy toothscabbed underflesh shows and inside the nostrils where one can see dozens of little moving cilia But who is so impolite as to look up a fellows snotgutters Whatever they think up close and personal theres something definitely wrong with them even when they re Americaside and no one wants to scare the new fish before the nets properly in place So its humes an abbreviation the cantoi wont even use they find it demeaning like nigger or vamp at the exams humes in the interview rooms nothing but humes until later when they go through one of the working Americaside doorways and come out in Thunderclap Ted is tested along with a hundred or so others in a gymnasium that reminds him of the one back in East Hartford This one has been filled with rows and rows of studyhall desks wrestling mats have been considerately laid down to keep the desks oldfashioned round iron bases from scratching the varnished hardwood but after the first round of testinga ninetyminute diagnostic full of math English and vocabulary questionshalf of them are empty After the second round its three quarters Round Two consists of some mighty iveird questions highly subjective questions and in several cases Ted gives an answer in which he does not believe because he thinksmaybe knowsthat the people giving the test want a different answer from the one he and most people would ordinarily give For instance theres this little honey  You come to a stop near an overturned car on a littletraveled road Trapped in the car is a Young Man crying for rescue You ask Are you hurt Young Man to which he responds I dont think so In the field nearby is a Satchel filled with Money You a Rescue the Young Man and give him back his Money b Rescue the Young Man but insist that the Money be taken to the local Police c Take the Money and go on your way knowing that although the road may be little traveled someone will be along eventually to free the Young Man d None of the above Had this been a test for the Sacramento PD Ted would have circled b in a heartbeat He may be little more than a hobo on the road but his mama didnt raise no fools thank you oh so very much That choice would be the correct one in most circumstances toothe playitsafe choice the cantgowrong choice And as a fallback position the one that says I dont have a frigging clue what this is about but at least Im honest enough to say sotheres d Ted circles c but not because that is necessarily what hed do in that situation On the whole he tends to think that hed go for a presuming he could at least ask the Young Man a few questions about where the loot came from And if outright torture wasnt involved and he would know wouldnt he no matter what the Young Man might have to say on the subject sure heres your money Vaya con Dios And why Because Ted Brautigan happens to believe that the owner of the defunct candystore had a point THEIR KILLING THE LITTLE MAN But he circles c and five days later he finds himself in the anteroom of an outofbusiness dance studio in San Francisco his trainfare from Sacramento prepaid along with three other men and a sullenlooking teenage girl the girls the former Tanya Leeds of Bryce Colorado as it turns out Better than four hundred people showed up for the test in the gym lured by the honeypot ad Goats for the most part Here however are four sheep One per cent And even this as Brautigan will discover in the full course of time is an amazing catch Eventually he is shown into an office marked PBRKTE It is mostly filled with dusty ballet stuff A broadshouldered hardfaced man in a brown suit sits in a folding chair incongruously surrounded by filmy pink tutus Ted thinks A real toad in an imaginary garden The man sits forward arms on his elephantine thighs Mr Brautigan he says I may or may not be a toad but I can offer you the job of a lifetime I can also send you out of here with a handshake and a muchobliged It depends on the answer to one question A question about a question in fact The man whose name turns out to be Frank Armitage hands Ted a sheet of paper On it blown up is Question  the one about the Young Man and the Satchel of Money You circled c Frank Armitage says So now luith absolutely no hesitation whatever please tell me why Because c was what you wanted Ted replies with absolutely no hesitation whatever And how do you know that Because Im a telepath Ted says And thats what you re really looking for He tries to keep his poker face and thinks he succeeds pretty well but inside hes filled with a great and singing relief Because hes found a job No Because theyll shortly make him an offer that would make the prizes on the new TV quiz shows look tame No Because someone finally wants what he can do Because someone finally wants him SEVEN The job offer turned out to be another honeypot but Brautigan was honest enough in his taped memoir to say he might have gone along even if hed known the truth Because talent wont be quiet doesnt know how to be quiet he said Whether its a talent for safecracking thoughtreading or dividing tendigit numbers in your head it screams to be used It never shuts up Itll wake you in the middle of your tiredest night screaming Use me use me use me Im tired of just sitting here Use me fuckhead use me Jake broke into a roar of preadolescent laughter He covered his mouth but kept laughing through his hands Oy looked up at him those black eyes with die gold wedding rings floating in them grinning fiendishly There in the room filled with the frilly pink tutus his fedora hat cocked back on his crewcut head Armitage asked if Ted had ever heard of the South American Seabees When Ted replied that he hadnt Armitage told him that a consortium of wealthy South American businessmen mostly Brazilian had hired a bunch of American engineers construction workers and roughnecks in  Over a hundred in all These were the South American Seabees The consortium hired them all for a fouryear period and at different paygrades but the pay was extremely generousalmost embarrassingly soat all grades A dozer operator might sign a contract for  a year for instance which was tall tickets in those days But there was more a bonus equal to one years pay A total of  If that was the fellow would agree to one unusual condition you go you work and you dont come back until the four years are up or the work is done You got two days off every week just like in America and you got a vacation every year just like in America but in the pampas You couldnt go back to North America or even Rio until your fouryear hitch was over If you died in South America you got planted thereno one was going to pay to have your body shipped back to WilkesBarre But you got fifty grand up front and a sixtyday grace period during which you could spend it save it invest it or ride it like a pony If you chose investment that fifty grand might be seventyfive when you came waltzing out of the jungle with a bonedeep tan a whole new set of muscles and a lifetime of stories to tell And of course once you were out you had what the limeys liked to call the other half to put on top of it This was like that Armitage told Ted earnestly Only the front half would be a cool quarter of a million and the back end half a million Which sounded incredible Ted said from the Wollensak Of course it did byjiminy I didnt find ovit until later how incredibly cheap they were buying us even at those prices Dinky is particularly eloquent on the subject of their stinginess they in this case being all the Kings bureaucrats He says the Crimson King is trying to bring about the end of all creation on the budget plan and of course hes right but I think even Dinky realizesalthough he wont admit it of coursethat if you offer a man too much he simply refuses to believe it Or depending on his imagination many telepaths and precogs have almost no imagination at all be unable to believe it In our case the period of indenture was to be six years with an option to renew and Armitage needed my decision immediately Few techniques are so successful lady and gentlemen as the one where you boggle your targets mind freeze him with greed then blitz him I was duly blitzed and agreed at once Armitage told me that my quartermil would be in the Seamans San Francisco Bank as of that afternoon and I could draw on it as soon as I got down there I asked him if I had to sign a contract He reached out one of his handsbig as a ham it wasand told me that was our contract I asked him where Id be going and what Id be doingall questions I should have asked first Im sure youd agree but I was so stunned it never crossed my mind Besides I was pretty sure I knew I thought Id be working for the government Some kind of Cold War deal The telepathic branch of the CIA or FBI set up on an island in the Pacific I remember thinking it would make one hell of a radio play Armitage told me Youll be traveling far Ted but it will also be right next door And for the time being thats all I can say Except to keep your mouth shut about our arrangement during the eight weeks before you actually mmm ship out Remember that loose lips sink ships At the risk of inculcating you with paranoia assume that you are being watched And of course I was watched Latertoo later in a manner of speakingI was able to replay my last two months in Frisco and realize that the cantoi were watching me the whole time The low men EIGHT Armitage and two other humes met us outside the Mark Hopkins Hotel said the voice from the tape recorder I remember the date with perfect clarity it was Halloween of  Five oclock in the afternoon Me Jace McGovern Dave Ittaway Dick I cant remember his last name he died about six months later Humma said it was pneumonia and the rest of the kicans backed him upkican sort of means shitpeople or shitfolken if youre interestedbut it was suicide and I knew it if no one else did The rest well remember Doc Number Two The rest were and are like him dont tell me what I dont want to know sai dont mess up my worldview Anyway the last one was Tanya Leeds Tough little thing A pause and a click Then Teds voice resumed sounding temporarily refreshed The third tape had almost finished He must have really burned through the rest of the story Eddie thought and found that the idea disappointed him Whatever else he was Ted was a hell of a good talespinner Armitage and his colleagues showed up in a Ford station wason what we called a woody in those charming days They drove us inland to a town called Santa Mira There was a paved main street The rest of them were dirt I remember there were a lot of oilderricks looking like praying mantises sort of although it was dark by then and they were really just shapes against the sky I was expecting a train depot or maybe a bus with CHARTERED in the destination window Instead we pulled up to this empty freight depot with a sign reading SANTA MIRA SHIPPING hanging askew on the front and I got a thought clear as day from Dick whateverhisname was They re going to kill us he was thinking They brought us out here to kill us and steal our stuff If youre not a telepath you dont know how scary something like that can be How the surety of it kind of invades your head I saw Dave Ittaway go pale and although Tanya didnt make a soundshe was a tough litde thing as I told youit was bright enough in the car to see there were tears standing in the corners of her eyes I leaned over her took Dicks hands in mine and squeezed down on them when he tried to pull away I thought at him They didnt give us a quarter of a mill each most of it still stashed safe in the Seamans Bank so they could bring us out to the ivilliwags and steal our watches And Jace thought at me  dont even have a watch I pawned my Gruen two years ago in Albuquerque and by the time I thought about buying another onearound midnight last night this wasall the stores were closed and I was too drunk to climb down off the barstool I was on anyway That relaxed us and we all had a laugh Armitage asked us what we were laughing about and that relaxed us even more because we had something they didnt could communicate in a way they couldnt I told him it was nothing then gave Dicks hands another little squeeze It did the job I facilitated him I suppose It was my first time doing that The first of many Thats part of the reason Im so tired all that facilitating wears a man out Armitage and the others led us inside The place was deserted but at the far end there was a door with two words chalked on it along with those moons and stars THUNDERCLAP STATION it said Well there was no station no tracks no buses no road other than the one wed used to get there There were windows on either side of the door and nothing on the other side of the building but a couple of smaller buildingsdeserted sheds one of them just a burntout shelland a lot of scrubland littered with trash Dave Ittaway said Why are we going out there and one of the others said Youll see and we certainly did Ladies first Armitage said and he opened the door It was dark on the other side but not the same kind of dark It was darker dark If youve seen Thunderclap at night youll know And it sounded different Old buddy Dick there had some second thoughts and turned around One of the men pulled a gun And Ill never forget what Armitage said Because he sounded kindly Too late to back out now he said Nowyou can only go forward And I think right then I knew that business about the sixyear plan and reupping if we wanted to was what my friend Bobby Garfield and his friend Sullyjohn would have called just a shuck and jive Not that we could read it in their thoughts They were all wearing hats you see You never see a low manor a low lady for that matterwithout a hat on The mens looked like plain old fedoras the sort most guys wore back then but these were no ordinary lids They were thinkingcaps Although anythinkingcaps would be more accurate they muffle the thoughts of the people wearing them If you try to prog someone whos wearing oneprog is Dinkys word for thoughtreadingyou just get a hum with a lot of whispering underneath Very unpleasant like the todash chimes If youve heard them you know Discourages too much effort and efforts the last thing most of the telepaths in the Algul are interested in What the Breakers are mostly interested in lady and gentlemen is going along to get along Which only shows up for what it ismonstrousif you pull back and take the long view One more thing most Breakers are not into Quite often you hear a sayinga little poemaround campus or see it chalked on the walls Enjoy the cruise turn on the fan theres nothing to lose so work on your tan It means a lot more thantake it easy The implications of that little piece of doggerel are extremely unpleasant I wonder if you can see that Eddie thought he could at least and it occurred to him that his brother Henry would have made an absolutely wonderful Breaker Always assuming hed been allowed to take along his heroin and his Creedence Clearwater Revival albums that was A longer pause from Ted then a rueful sort of laugh I believe its time to make a long story a little shorter We went through the door leave it at that If youve done it you know it can be very unpleasant if the doors not in tiptop working order And the door between Santa Mira California and Thunderclap was in better shape than some Ive been through since For a moment there was only darkness on the other side and the howl of what the taheen call desertdogs Then a cluster of lights went on and we saw these these things with the heads of birds and weasels and one with the head of a bull horns and all Jace screamed and so did I Dave Ittaway turned and tried to run but Armitage grabbed him Even if he hadnt where was there to go Back through the door It was closed and for all I know thats a oneway The only one of us who never made a sound was Tanya and when she looked at me what I saw in her eyes and read in her thoughts was relief Because we knew you see Not all the questions were answered but the two that mattered were Where were we In another world When were we coming back Never in life Our money would sit in the Seamans of San Francisco until it turned into millions and no one would ever spend it We were in for the long haul There was a bus there with a robot driver named Phil My names Phil Im over the hill but the best news is that I never spill he said He smelled like lightning and there were all sorts of discordant clicking sounds coming from deep in his guts Old Phils dead now dumped in the train and robot graveyard with God alone knows how many others but theyve got enough mechanized help to finish what theyve started Im sure Dick fainted when we came out on Thunderclapside but by the time we could see the lights of the compound hed come around again Tanya had his head in her lap and I remember how gratefully he was looking up at her Its funny what you remember isnt it They checked us in at the gate Assigned us our dorms assigned us our suites saw that we were fed and a damned fine meal it was The first of many The next day we went to work And barring my little vacation in Connecticut weve been working ever since Another pause Then God help us weve been working ever since And God forgive us most of us have been happy Because the only thing talent wants is to be used NINE He tells them of his first few shifts in The Study and his realizationnot gradual but almost immediatethat they are not here to search out spies or read the thoughts of Russian scientists or any of that spaceshot nonsense as Dinky would say not that Dinky was there at first although Sheemie was No what they are doing is breaking something He can feel it not just in the sky above Algul Siento but everywhere around them even under their feet Yet he is content enough The food is good and although his sexual appetites have subsided quite a bit over the years hes not a bit averse to the odd bonk just reminding himself every time that sim sex is really nothing but accessorized masturbation But then hes had the odd bonk with the odd whore over the years as many men living on the road have and he could testify that that sort of sex is also not much different than masturbation you re putting it to her just as hard as you can the sweat pouring off you and shes going Babybabybaby and all the time wondering if she ought to gas the car and trying to remember which day is double stamps at the Red amp White As with most things in life you have to use your imagination and Ted can do that hes good at the old visualization thing thank you oh so very much He likes the roof over his head he likes the companythe guards are guards yeah but he believes them when they say its as much their job to keep bad stuff from getting in as it is to make sure the Breakers dont get out He likes most of the inmates too and realizes after a year or huo that the inmates need him in some strange way Hes able to comfort them when they get the mean reds hes able to assuage their crampy waves of homesickness with an hour or so of murmured conversation And surely this is a good thing Maybe its all a good thingcertainly it feels like a good thing To be homesick is human but to Break is divine He tries to explain to Roland and his tet but the best he can do the closest he can come is to say its like finally being able to scratch that outofreach place on your back that always drives you crazy with its mild but persistent itch He likes to go to The Study and so do all the others He likes the feeling of sitting there of smelling the good wood and good leather of searching searching and then suddenly aahhh There you are You re hooked in swinging like a monkey on a limb You re breaking baby and to break is divine Dinky once said that The Study was the only place in the world where he really felt in touch with himself and that was why he wanted to see it shut down Burned down if possible Because I know the kind of shit I get up to when Im in touch with myself he told Ted When I you know really get in the groove And Ted knew exactly what he was talking about Because The Study was always too good to be true You sat down maybe picked up a magazine looked at pictures of models and margarine movie stars and motor cars and you felt your mind rise The Beam was all around it was like being in some vast corridor full of force but your mind always rose to the roof and when it got there it found that big old sliding groove Maybe once just after the Prim withdrew and Gan s voice still echoed in the rooms of the macroverse the Beams were smooth and polished but those days are gone Now the Way of the Bear and the Turtle is lumpy and eroded full of coves and cols and bays and cracks plenty of places to get your fingers in and take hold and sometimes you drag at it and sometimes you can feel yourself worming your way into it like a drop of acid that can think All these sensations are intensely pleasurable Sexy And for Ted theres something else as well although he doesnt know hes the only one whos got it until Trampas tells him Trampas never means to tell him anything but hes got this lousy case of eczema you see and it changes everything Hard to believe a flaky scalp might be responsible for saving the Dark Tower but the ideas not entirely farfetched Not entirely farfetched at all TEN There are about a hundred and eighty fulltime personnel at work in the Algul Ted said Im not the guy to tell anyone how to do his job but thats something you may want to write down or at least remember Roughly speaking its sixty per eighthour shift and split twentytwentytwenty Taheen have the sharpest eyes and generally man the watchtowers Humes patrol the outer run offence With guns mind youhard calibers Topside theres Prentiss the Master and Finli OTego the Security Chiefhume and taheen respectivelybut most of the floaters are cantoi the low men you understand Most low men dont get along with the Breakers a little stiff camaraderie is the best they can do Dinky told me once that theyre jealous of us because were what he calls finished humes Like the hume guards the cantoi wear thinkingcaps when theyre on duty so we cant prog them The fact is most Breakers havent tried to prog anyone or anything but the Beam in years and maybe cant anymore the mind is also a muscle and like any other it atrophies if you dont use it A pause A click on die tape Then Im not going to be able to finish Im disappointed but not entirely surprised This will have to be my last story folks Im sorry A low sound A sipping sound Susannah was quite sure Ted having another drink of water Have I told you that the taheen dont need the thinkingcaps They speak perfectly good English and Ive sensed from time to time that some have limited progging abilities of their own can send and receiveat least a littlebut if you dip into them you get these mindnumbing blasts of what sounds like mental staticwhite noise I assumed it was some sort of protective device Dinky believes its the way they actually think Either way it makes it easier for them They dont have to remember to put on hats in the morning when they go out Trampas was one of the cantoi rovers You might see him one day strolling along Main Street in Pleasantville or sitting on a bench in the middle of the Mall usually with some selfhelp book like Seven Steps to Positive Thinking Then the next day there he is leaning against the side of Heartbreak House taking in the sun Same with the other cantoi floaters If theres a pattern Ive never been able to anticipate it or Dinky either We dont think there is one Whats always made Trampas different is a complete lack of that sense of jealousy Hes actually friendlyor was in some ways he hardly seemed to be a low man at all Not many of his cantoi colleagues seem to like him a whole hell of a lot Which is ironic you know because if there really is such a thing as becoming then Trampas is one of the few who actually seem to be getting somewhere with it Simple laughter for instance When most low men laugh it sounds like a basket of rocks rolling down a tin coalchute makes you fair shiver as Tanya says When Trampas laughs he sounds a little highpitched but otherwise normal Because he is laughing I think Genuinely laughing The others are just forcing it Anyway I struck up a conversation with him one day On Main Street this was outside the Gem Star Wars was back for its umptyumpth revival If theres any movie the Breakers never get enough of its Star Wars I asked him if he knew where his name came from He said yes of course from his clanfam Each cantoi is given a hume name by his clanfam at some point in his development its a kind of maturitymarker Dinky says they get that name the first time they successfully whack off but thats just Dinky being Dinky The fact is we dont know and it doesnt matter but some of the names are pretty hilarious Theres one fellow who looks like Rondo Hatton a film actor from the thirties who sviffered from acromegaly and got work playing monsters and psychopadis but his name is Thomas Carlyle Theres another one named Beowulf and a fellow named Van Gogh Baez Susannah a Bleecker Street folkie from way back put her face in her hands to stifle a gust of giggles Anyway I told him that Trampas was a character from a famous Western novel called The Virginian Only second banana to the actual hero true but Trampas has got the one line from the book everyone remembers smzfcwhen you say that It tickled our Trampas and I ended up telling him the whole plot of the book over cups of drugstore coffee We became friends Id tell him what was going on in our little community of Breakers and hed tell me all sorts of interesting but innocent things about what was going on over on his side of the fence He also complained about his eczema which made his head itch terribly He kept lifting his hatthis little beanietype of thing almost like a yarmulke only made of denimto scratch underneath He claimed that was the worst place of all even worse than down there on your makieman And litde by litde I realized that every time he lifted his beanie to scratch I could read his thoughts Not just the ones on top but all of them If I was fastand I learned to beI could pick and choose exacdy die way youd pick and choose articles in an encyclopedia by turning die pages Only it wasnt really like that it was more like someone turning a radio on and off during a news broadcast Holy shit Eddie said and took another graham cracker He wished mightily for milk to dip them in graham crackers without milk were almost like Oreos without the white stuff in the middle Imagine turning a radio or a TV on fullblast Ted said in his rusty failing voice and then turning it off again justasquick He purposely ran this together and they all smiledeven Roland Thatll give you the idea Now Ill tell you what I learned I suspect you know it already but I just cant take the risk that you dont Its too important There is a Tower lady and gendemen as you must know At one time six beams crisscrossed there both taking power from itits some kind of unimaginable powersourceand lending support the way guywires support a radio tower Four of these Beams are now gone the fourth very recently The only two remaining are the Beam of the Bear Way of the Turtle Shardiks Beamand the Beam of the Elephant Way of the Wolfsome call that one Gans Beam I wonder if you can imagine my horror at discovering what Id actually been doing in The Study When Id been scratching that innocent itch Although I knew all along that it was something important knew it And there was something worse something I hadnt suspected something that applied only to me Id known that I was different in some ways for one thing I seemed to be the only Breaker with an ounce of compassion in my makeup When theyve got the mean reds I am as I told you the one they come to Pimli Prentiss the Master married Tanya and Joey Rastosovichinsisted on it wouldnt hear a word against the idea kept saying that it was his privilege and his responsibility he was just like the captain on an old cruiseshipand of course they let him do it But afterward they came to my rooms and Tanya said  You marry us Ted Then well really be married And sometimes I ask myself did you think that was all it was Before you started visiting with Trampas and listening every time he lifted up his cap to scratch did you truly think that having a litde pity and a little love in your soul were the only things that set you apart from the others Or were you fooling yourself about that too I dont know for sure but maybe I can find myself innocent on that particular charge I really did not understand that my talent goes far beyond progging and Breaking Im like a microphone for a singer or a steroid for a muscle I hype them Say theres a unit of forcecall it darks all right In The Study twenty or thirty people might be able to put out fifty darks an hour without me With me Maybe it jumps to five hundred darks an hour And it jumps all at once Listening to Trampass head I came to see that they considered me the catch of the century maybe of all time the one truly indispensable Breaker Id already helped them to snap one Beam and I was cutting centuries off their work on Shardiks Beam And when Shardiks Beam snaps lady and gentlemen Gans can only last a little while And when Gans Beam also snaps the Dark Tower will fall creation will end and the very Eye of Existence will turn blind How I ever kept Trampas from seeing my distress I dont know And Ive reason to believe that I didnt keep as complete a poker face as I thought at the time I knew I had to get out And that was when Sheemie came to me the first time I think hed been reading me all along but even now I dont know for sure and neither does Dinky All I know is that one night he came to my room and thought to me Ill make a hole for you sai if you want and you can go boogiebyebye I asked him what he meant and he just looked at me Its funny how much a single look can say isnt it Dont insult my intelligence Dont waste my time Dont waste your own I didnt read those thoughts in his mind not at all I saw them on his face Roland grunted agreement His brilliant eyes were fixed on the turning reels of the tape recorder I did ask him where the hole would come out He said he didnt knowId be taking luck of the draw All the same I didnt think it over for long I was afraid that if I did Id find reasons to stay I said Go ahead Sheemiesend me boogiebye bye He closed his eyes and concentrated and all at once the corner of my room was gone I could see cars going by They were distorted but they were actual American cars I didnt argue or question any more I just went for it I wasnt completely sure I could go through into that other world but Id reached a point where I hardly even cared I thought dying might be the best tiling I could do It would slow them down at least And just before I took the plunge Sheemie thought to me Look for my friend Will Dearborn His real name is Roland His friends are dead but I know hes not because I can hear him Hes a gunslinger and he has new friends Bring them here and theyll make the bad folks stop hurting the Beam the way he made Jonas and his friends stop when they were going to kill me For Sheemie this was a sermon I closed my eyes and went through There was a brief sensation of being turned on my head but that was all No chimes no nausea Really quite pleasant at least compared to the Santa Mira doorway I came out on my hands and knees beside a busy highway There was a piece of newspaper blowing around in the weeds I picked it up and saw Id landed in April of  almost five years after Armitage and his friends herded us through the door in Santa Mira on the other side of the country I was looking at a piece of the Hartford Courant you see And the road turned out to be the Merritt Parkway Sheemie can make magic doors Roland cried He had been cleaning his revolver as he listened but now he put it aside Thats what teleporting is Thats what it means Hush Roland Susannah said This must be his Connecticut adventure I want to hear this part ELEVEN But none of them hear about Teds Connecticut adventure He simply calls it a story for another day and tells his listeners that he was caught in Bridgeport while trying to accumulate enough cash to disappear permanently The low men bundled him into a car drove him to New York and took him to a ribjoint called the Dixie Pig From there to Fedic and from Fedic to Thunderclap Station from the station right back to the DevarToi oh Ted so good to see you ivelcome back The fourth tape is now threequarters done and Teds voice is little more than a croak Nevertheless he gamely pushes on I hadnt been gone long but over here time had taken one of its erratic slips forward Humma OTego was out possibly because of me and Prentiss of New Jersey the ki dam was in He and Finli interrogated me in the Masters suite a good many times There was no physical tortureI guess they still reckoned me too important to chance spoiling mebut there was a lot of discomfort and plenty of mindgames They also made it clear that if I tried to run again my Connecticut friends would be put to death I said dontyou boys get it If I keep doing my job theyre going out anyway Everybodys going out with the possible exception of the one you call the Crimson King Prentiss steepled his fingers in the annoying way he has and said That may be or may not be true sai but if it is we wont suffer when we go out as you put it Little Bobby and little Carol on the other hand not to mention Carols mother and Bobbys friend SullyJohnHe didnt have to finish I still wonder if they knew how terribly frightened theyd made me ivith that threat against my young friends And how terribly angry All their questions came down to two things they really wanted to know Why had I run and who helped me do it I could have fallen back on the old namerankserial number routine but decided to chance being a bit more expansive Id wanted to run I said because Id gotten a glimmering from some of the cantoi guards about what we were really doing and I didnt like the idea As for how Id gotten out I told them I didnt know I went to sleep one night I said and just woke up beside the Merritt Parkway They went from scoffing at this story to semibelieving it mostly because I never varied it a single jot or tittle no matter how many times they asked And of course they already knew how powerful I was and in ways that were different from the others Do you think youre a teleport in some subconscious way sai Finli asked me How could I say I asked in turnalways answer a question with a question is a good rule to follow during interrogation I think as long as its a relatively soft interrogation as this one was Ive never sensed any such ability but of course we dont always know whats lurking in our subconscious do we You better hope it wasnt you Prentiss said We can live with almost any wild talent around here except that one That one Mr Brautigan would spell the end even for such a valued employee as yourself Iwasnt sure I believed that but later Trampas gave me reason to think Prentiss might have been telling the truth Anyway that was my story and I never went beyond it Prentisss houseboy a fellow named Tassaa hume if it matierswould bring in cookies and cans of NozzALawhich I like because it tastes a bit like root beerand Prentiss would offer me all I wanted after that was I told them where Id gotten my information and how Id escaped Algal Siento Then the whole round of questions would start again only this time with Prentiss and the Wease munching cookies and drinking Nozzie But at some point they d always give in and allow me a drink and a bite to eat As interrogators Im afraid there just wasnt enough Nazi in them to make me give up my secrets They tried to prog me of course but have you heard that old saying about never bullshitting a bullshitter Eddie and Susannah both nod So does Jake who has heard his father say that during numerous conversations concerning Programming at the Network I bet you have Ted resumes Well its also fair to say that you cant prog a progger at least not one whos gone beyond a certain level of understanding And Id better get to the point before my voice gives out entirely One day about three weeks after the low men hauled me back Trampas approached me on Main Street in Pleasantville By then Id met Dinky had identified him as a kindred spirit and was with his help getting to know Sheemie better A lot was going on in addition to my daily interrogations in Wardens House Id hardly even thought about Trampas since returning but hed thought of little else than me As I quickly found out I know the answers to the questions they keep asking you he said What I dont know is why you havent given me up I said the idea had never crossed my mindthat tattletaking wasnt the way Id been raised to do things And besides it wasnt as if they were putting an electrified cattleprod up my rectum or pulling my fingernails although they might have resorted to such techniques had it been anyone other than me The worst they d done was to make me look at the plate of cookies on Prentisss desk for an hour and a half before relenting and letting me have one I was angry at you at first Trampas said but then I realizedreluctantlythat I might have done the same thing in your place The first week you were back I didnt sleep much I can tell you Id lie on my bed there in Damli expecting them to come for me at any minute You know what theyd do if they found out it was me dont you I told him I did not He said that hed be flogged by Gaskie Finlis Second and then sent rawbacked into the wastes either to die in theDiscordia or to find service in the castle of the Red King But such a trip would not be easy Southeast ofFedic one may also contract such things as the Eating Sickness probably cancer but a kind thats very fast very painful and very nasty or what they just call the Crazy The Children of Roderick commonly suffer from both these problems and others as well The minor skin diseases of Thunderclapthe eczema pimples and rashesare apparently only the beginning of ones problems in EndWorld But for an exile service in the Court of the Crimson King would be the only hope Certainly a cantoi such as Trampas couldnt go to the Callas Theyre closer granted and theres genuine sunshine there but you can imagine what would happen to low men or the taheen in the Arc of the Callas Rolands tet can imagine that very well Dont make too much of it I said As that new fellow Dinky might say I dont put my business on the street It s really as simple as that Theres no chivalry involved He said he was grateful nevertheless then looked around and said very low Id pay you back for your kindness Ted by telling you to cooperate with them to the extent that you can I dont mean you should get me in trouble but I dont want you to get in more trouble yourself either They may not need you quite as badly as you may think And Id have you hear me well now lady and gentlemen for this may be very important I simply dont know All I know for certain is that what Trampas told me next gave me a terrible deep chill He said that of all the otherside worlds theres one thats unique They call it the Real World All Trampas seems to know about it is that its real in the same way MidWorld was before the Beams began to weaken and MidWorld moved on In Americaside of this special real World he says time sometimes jerks but always runs one way ahead And in that world lives a man who also serves as a kind of facilitator he may even be a mortal guardian of Gans Beam TWELVE Roland looked at Eddie and as their eyes met both mouthed the same word King THIRTEEN Trampas told me that the Crimson King has tried to kill this man but ka has ever protected his life They say his song has cast the circle Trampas told me although no one seems to know exactly what that means Now however kanot the Red King but plain old kahas decreed that this man this guardian or whatever he is should die Hes stopped you see Whatever song it was he was supposed to sing hes stopped and that has finally made him vulnerable But not to the Crimson King Trampas kept telling me that No its ka hes vulnerable to He no longer sings Trampas said His song the one that matters has ended He has forgotten the rose FOURTEEN In the outer silence Mordred heard this and then withdrew to ponder it FIFTEEN Trampas told me all this only so Id understand I was no longer completely indispensable Of course they want to keep me presumably there would be honor in bringing down Shardik s Beam before this mans death could cause Gan s Beam to break A pause Do they see the lethal insanity of a race to the brink of oblivion and then over the edge Apparently not If they did surely they wouldnt be racing to begin with Or is it a simple failure of imagination One doesnt like to think such a rudimentary failing could bring about the end yet SIXTEEN Roland exasperated twirled his fingers almost as if the old man to whose voice they were listening could see them He wanted to hear very well and every word what the cantoi guard knew about Stephen King and instead Brautigan had gotten off onto some rambling discursive sidetrack It was understandablethe man was clearly exhaustedbut there was something here more important than everything else Eddie knew it too Roland could read it on the young mans strained face Together they watched the remaining brown tapenow no more than an eighth of an inch deepmelt away SEVENTEEN  yet were only poor benighted humies and I suppose we cant know about these things not with any degree of certainty He fetches a long tired sigh The tape turns melting off the final reel and running silently and uselessly between the heads Then at last Iasked this magic mans name and Trampas said Iknow it not Ted but I do know theres no magic in him anymore for hes ceased whatever it was that ka meant him to do If we leave him be the Ka of Nineteen which is that of his world and the Ka of Ninetynine which is that of our world will combine to But there is no more That is where the tape runs out EIGHTEEN The takeup reel turned and the shiny brown tapeend flapped making that low fwipfwipfwip sound until Eddie leaned forward and pressed STOP He muttered Fuck under his breath Just when it was getting interesting Jake said And those numbers again Nineteen and ninetynine He paused then said them together Nineteenninetynine Then a third time  The Keystone Year in the Keystone World Where Mia went to have her baby Where Black Thirteen is now Keystone World Keystone Year Susannah said She took the last tape off the spindle held it up to one of the lamps for a moment then put it back in its box Where time always goes in one direction Like its sposed to Gan created time Roland said This is what the old legends say Gan rose from the voidsome tales say from the sea but both surely mean the Primand made the world Then he tipped it with his finger and set it rolling and that was time Something was gathering in the cave Some revelation They all felt it a thing as close to bursting as Mias belly had been at the end Nineteen Ninetynine They had been haunted by these numbers They had turned up everywhere They saw them in the sky saw them written on board fences heard them in their dreams Oy looked up ears cocked eyes bright Susannah said When Mia left the room we were in at the PlazaPark to go to the Dixie Pigroom  it wasI fell into a kind of trance I had dreams jailhousedreams newscasters announcing that this one that one and tother one had died You told us Eddie said She shook her head violently Not all of it I didnt Because some of it didnt seem to make any sense Hearing Dave Garroway say that President Kennedys little boy was dead for instancelittle JohnJohn the one who saluted his Daddys coffin when the catafalque went by I didnt tell you because that part was nuts Jake Eddie had litde JohnJohn Kennedy died in your whens Either of your whens They shook their heads Jake was not even sure of whom Susannah was speaking But he did In the Keystone World and in a when beyond any of ours I bet it was in the when of  So dies the son of the last gunslinger O Discordia What I think now is that I was kind of hearing the obituary page from The Time Travelers Weekly It was all different times mixed together John John Kennedy then Stephen King Id never heard of him but David Brinkley said he wrote salems Lot Thats the book Father Callahan was in right Roland and Eddie nodded Father Callahan told us his story Yeah Jake said But what She overrode him Her eyes were hazy distant Eyes just a look away from understanding And then comes Brautigan to the KaTet of Nineteen and tells his tale And look Look at the tape counter They leaned over In the windows were  I think King might have written Teds story too she said Anybody want to take a guess what year that story showed up or wzZshow up in the Keystone World  Jake said low But not the part we heard The part we didnt hear Teds Connecticut Adventure And you met him Susannah said looking at her dinh and her husband You met Stephen King They nodded again He made the Pere he made Brautigan he made us she said as if to herself then shook her head No All things serve the Beam He he facilitated us Yeah Eddie was nodding Yeah okay That feels just about right In my dream I was in a cell she said I was wearing the clothes I had on when I got arrested And David Brinkley said Stephen King was dead woe Discordiasomething like that Brinkley said he was She paused frowning She would have demanded that Roland hypnotize the complete recollection out of her if it had been necessary but it turned out not to be Brinkley said King was killed by a minivan while walking near his home in Lovell Maine Eddie jerked Roland sat forward his eyes burning Do you say so Susannah nodded firmly He bought the house on Turtleback Lane the gunslinger roared He reached out and took hold of Eddies shirt Eddie seemed not to even notice Of course he did Ka speaks and the wind blows He moved a little further along the Path of the Beam and bought the house where its thin Where we saw the walkins Where we talked to John Cullum and then came back through Do you doubt it Do you doubt it so much as a single goddam bit Eddie shook his head Of course he didnt doubt it It had a ring like the one you got when you were at the carnival and hit the pedal just right with the mallet hit it with all your force and the lead slug flew straight to the top of the post and rang the bell up there You got a Kewpie doll when you rang the bell and was that because Stephen King thought it was a Kewpie doll Because King came from the world where Gan started time rolling with His holy finger Because if King says Kewpie we all say Kewpie and we all say thankya If hed somehow gotten the idea that the prize for ringing the Test Your Strength bell at the carnival was a Cloopie doll would they say Cloopie Eddie thought the answer was yes He thought the answer was yes just as surely as CoOp City was in Brooklyn David Brinkley said King was fiftytwo You boys met him so do the math Could he have been fiftytwo in the year of  You bet your purity Eddie said He tossed Roland a dark dismayed glance And since nineteens the part we keep running intoTed Stevens Brautigan go on count the letters I bet it has to do with more than just the year Nineteen Its a date Jake said flatly Sure it is Keystone Date in Keystone Year in Keystone World The nineteenth of something in the year of  Most likely a summer month because he was outwalking Its summer over there right now Susannah said Its June The month Turn  on its head and you get  Yeah and spell dog backward you get god Eddie said but he sounded uneasy I think shes right Jake said I think its June th Thats when King gets turned into roadkill and even the chance that he might go back to work on the Dark Tower storyour storyis kaput Gans Beam is lost in the overload Shardiks Beam is left but its already eroded He looked at Roland his face pale his lips almost blue Itll snap like a toothpick Maybe its happened already Susannah said No Roland said How can you be sure she asked He gave her a wintry humorless smile Because he said wed no longer be here NINETEEN How can we stop it from happening Eddie asked That guy Trampas told Ted it was ka Maybe he got it wrong Jake said but his voice was thin Trailing It was only a rumor so maybe he got it wrong And hey maybe Kings got until July Or August Or what about September It could be September doesnt that seem likely Septembers the month after all They looked at Roland who was now sitting with his leg stretched out before him Heres where it hurts he said as if speaking to himself He touched his right hip then his ribs last the side of his head Ive been having headaches Worse and worse Saw no reason to tell you He drew his diminished right hand down his right side This is where hell be hit Hip smashed Ribs busted Head crushed Thrown dead into the ditch Ka and the end of ka His eyes cleared and he turned urgently to Susannah What date was it when you were in New York Refresh me June first of  Roland nodded and looked to Jake And you The same yes Yes Then to Fedic a rest and on to Thunderclap He paused thinking then spoke four words with measured emphasis There is still time But time moves faster over there And if it takes one of those hitches Their words overlapped Then they fell quiet again looking at him again We can change ka Roland said Its been done before Theres always a price to paykashume mayhapbut it can be done How do we get there Eddie asked Theres only one way Roland said Sheemie must send us Silence in the cave except for a distant roll of the thunder that gave this dark land its name We have two jobs Eddie said The writer and the Breakers Which comes first The writer Jake said While theres still time to save him But Roland was shaking his head Why not Eddie cried Ah man why notfYou know how slippery time is over there And its oneway If we miss the window well never get another chance But we have to make Shardiks Beam safe too Roland said Are you saying Ted and this guy Dinky wouldnt let Sheemie help us unless we help them first No Sheemie would do it for me Im sure But suppose something happened to him while we were in the Keystone World Wed be stranded in  Theres the door on Turtleback Lane Eddie began Even if its still there in  Eddie Ted told us that Shardiks Beam has already started to bend Roland shook his head My heart says yonder prison is the place to start If any of you can say different I will listen and gladly They were quiet Outside the cave the wind blew We need to ask Ted before we make any final decision Susannah said at last No Jake said No Oy agreed Zero surprise there if Ake said it you could take it to the humbler bank as far as Oy was concerned Ask Sheemie Jake said Ask Sheemie what he thinks we should do Slowly Roland nodded ONE When Jake awoke from a night of troubled dreams most of them set in the Dixie Pig a thin and listless light was seeping into the cave In New York that kind of light had always made him want to skip school and spend the entire day on the sofa reading books watching gameshows on TV and napping the afternoon away Eddie and Susannah were curled up together inside a single sleepingbag Oy had eschewed the bed which had been left him in order to sleep beside Jake He was curled into a U snout on left forepaw Most people would have thought him asleep but Jake saw the sly glimmer of gold beneath his lids and knew that Oy was peeking The gunslingers sleepingbag was unzipped and empty Jake thought about this for a moment or two then got up and went outside Oy followed along padding quietly over the tamped dirt as Jake walked up the trail TWO Roland looked haggard and unwell but he was squatting on his hunkers and Jake decided that if he was limber enough to do that he was probably okay He squatted beside the gunslinger hands dangling loosely between his thighs Roland glanced at him said nothing then looked back toward the prison the staff called Algul Siento and the inmates called the DevarToi It was a brightening blur beyond and below them The sunelectric atomic whateverwasnt shining yet Oy plopped down next to Jake with a little whuffing sound then appeared to go back to sleep Jake wasnt fooled Hile and merrygreettheday Jake said when the silence began to feel oppressive Roland nodded Merry see merry be He looked as merry as a funeral march The gunslinger who had danced a furious commala by torchlight in Calla Bryn Sturgis might have been a thousand years in his grave How are you Roland Good enough to hunker Aye but how are you Roland glanced at him then reached into his pocket and brought out his tobacco pouch Old and full of aches as you must know Would you smoke Jake considered then nodded Theyll be shorts Roland warned Theres plenty in my purse I was glad to have back but not much blowweed Save it for yourself if you want Roland smiled A man who cant bear to share his habits is a man who needs to quit them He rolled a pair of cigarettes using some sort of leaf which he tore in two handed one to Jake then lit them up with a match he popped alight on his thumbnail In the still chill air of Can SteekTete the smoke hung in front of them then rose slowly stacking on the air Jake thought the tobacco was hot harsh and stale but he said no word of complaint He liked it He thought of all the times hed promised himself he wouldnt smoke like his father didnever in lifeand now here he was starting the habit And with his new fathers agreement if not approval Roland reached out a finger and touched Jakes forehead his left cheek his nose his chin The last touch hurt a little Pimples Roland said Its the air of this place He suspected it was emotional upset as wellgrief over the Perebut to let Jake know he thought that would likely just increase the boys unhappiness over Callahans passing You dont have any Jake said Skins as clear as a bell Huckee No pimples Roland agreed and smoked Below them in the seeping light was the village The peaceful village Jake thought but it looked more than peaceful it looked downright dead Then he saw two figures little more than specks from here strolling toward each other Hume guards patrolling the outer run of the fence he presumed They joined together into a single speck long enough for Jake to imagine a bit of their palaver and then the speck divided again No pimples but my hip hurts like a son of a bitch Feels like someone opened it in the night and poured it full of broken glass Hot glass But this is far worse He touched the right side of his head It feels cracked You really think its Stephen Kings injuries youre feeling Instead of making a verbal reply Roland laid the forefinger of his left hand across a circle made by the thumb and pinky of his right that gesture which meant I tell you the truth Thats a bummer Jake said For him as well as you Maybe maybe not Because think you Jake think you well Only living things feel pain What Im feeling suggests that King wont be killed instandy And that means he might be easier to save Jake thought it might only mean King was going to lie beside the road in semiconscious agony for awhile before expiring but didnt like to say so Let Roland believe what he liked But there was something else Something that concerned Jake a lot more and made him uneasy Roland may I speak to you dandinh The gunslinger nodded If you would A slight pause A flick at the left corner of the mouth that wasnt quite a smile If thee would Jake gathered his courage Why are you so angry now What are you angry at Or whom Now it was his turn to pause Is it me Rolands eyebrows rose then he barked a laugh Not you Jake Not a bit Never in life Jake flushed with pleasure I keep forgetting how strong the touch has become in you Youd have made a fine Breaker no doubt This wasnt an answer but Jake didnt bother saying so And the idea of being a Breaker made him repress a shiver Dont you know Roland asked If thee knows Im what Eddie calls royally pissed dont you know why I could look but it wouldnt be polite But it was a lot more than that Jake vaguely remembered a Bible story about Noah getting loaded on the ark while he and his sons were waiting out the flood One of the sons had come upon his old man lying drunk on his bunk and had laughed at him God had cursed him for it To peek into Rolands thoughts wouldnt be the same as lookingand laughingwhile he was drunk but it was close Thees a fine boy Roland said Fine and good aye And although the gunslinger spoke almost absently Jake could have died happily enough at that moment From somewhere beyond and above them came that resonant CLICK sound and all at once the specialeffects sunbeam speared down on the Devar Toi A moment later faintly they heard the sound of music Heyjude arranged for elevator and supermarket Time to rise and shine down below Another day of Breaking had just begun Although Jake supposed down there the Breaking never really stopped Lets have a game you and I Roland proposed You try to get into my head and see who Im angry at Ill try to keep you out Jake shifted position slightly That doesnt sound like a fun game to me Roland Nevertheless Id play against you All right if you want to Jake closed his eyes and called up an image of Rolands tired stubbled face His brilliant blue eyes He made a door between and slightly above those eyesa litde one with a brass knoband tried to open it For a moment the knob turned Then it stopped Jake applied more pressure The knob began to turn again then stopped once again Jake opened his eyes and saw that fine beads of sweat had broken on Rolands brow This is stupid Im making your headache worse he said Never mind Do your best My worst Jake thought But if they had to play this game he wouldnt draw it out He closed his eyes again and once again saw the little door between Rolands tangled brows This time he applied more force piling it on quickly It felt a little like armwrestling After a moment the knob turned and the door opened Roland grunted then uttered a painful laugh Thats enough for me he said By the gods thees strong Jake paid no attention to that He opened his eyes The writer King Why are you mad at him Roland sighed and cast away the smoldering butt of his cigarette Jake had already finished with his Because we have two jobs to do where we should have only one Having to do the second one is sai Kings fault He knew what he was supposed to do and I think that on some level he knew that doing it would keep him safe But he was afraid He was tired Rolands upper lip curled Now his irons are in the fire and we have to pull them out Its going to cost us and probably adearly Youre angry at him because hes afraid But Jake frowned But why wouldnt he be afraid Hes only a writer A talespinner not a gunslinger I know that Roland said but I dont think it was fear that stopped him Jake or not jurffear Hes lazy as well I felt it when I met him and Im sure that Eddie did too He looked at the job he was made to do and it daunted him and he said to himself All right Ill find an easier job one thats more to my liking and more to my abilities And if theres trouble theyll take care of me Theyll have to take care of me And so we do You didnt like him No Roland agreed I didnt Not a bit Nor trusted him Ive met talespinners before Jake and theyre all cut more or less from the same cloth They tell tales because theyre afraid of life Do you say so Jake thought it was a dismal idea He also thought it had the ring of truth I do But He shrugged It is what it is that shrug said Kashume Jake thought If their katet broke and it was Kings fault If it was Kings fault what Take revenge on him It was a gunslingers thought it was also a stupid thought like the idea of taking revenge on God But were stuck with it Jake finished Aye That wouldnt stop me from kicking his yellow lazy ass if I got the chance though Jake burst out laughing at that and the gunslinger smiled Then Roland got to his feet with a grimace both hands planted on the ball of his right hip Bugger he growled Hurts bad huh Never mind my aches and mollies Come with me Ill show you something more interesting Roland limping slightly led Jake to where the path curled around the flank of the lumpy little mountain presumably bound for the top Here the gunslinger tried to hunker grimaced and settled to one knee instead He pointed to the ground with his right hand What do you see Jake also dropped to one knee The ground was littered with pebbles and fallen chunks of rock Some of this talus had been disturbed leaving marks in the scree Beyond the spot where they knelt side by side two branches of what Jake thought was a mesquite bush had been broken off He bent forward and smelled the thin and acrid aroma of the sap Then he examined the marks in the scree again There were several of them narrow and not too deep If they were tracks they certainly werent human tracks Or those of a desertdog either Do you know what made these Jake asked If you do just say itdont make me armrassle you for it Roland gave him a brief grin Follow them a little See what you find Jake rose and walked slowly along the marks bent over at the waist like a boy with a stomachache The scratches in the talus went around a boulder There was dust on the stone and scratches in the dustas if something bristly had brushed against the boulder on its way by There were also a couple of stiff black hairs Jake picked one of these up then immediately opened his fingers and blew it off his skin shivering with revulsion as he did it Roland watched this keenly You look like a goose just walked over your grave Its awful Jake heard a faint stutter in his voice Oh God what was it What was wwatching us The one Mia called Mordred Rolands voice hadnt changed but Jake found he could hardly bring himself to look into the gunslingers eyes they were that bleak The chap she says I fathered He was here In the night Roland nodded ListeningJake couldnt finish Roland could Listening to our palaver and our plans aye I think so And Teds tale as well But you dont know for sure Those marks could be anything Yet the only thing Jake could think of in connection with those marks now that hed heard Susannahs tale were the legs of a monster spider Go thee a little further Roland said Jake looked at him questioningly and Roland nodded The wind blew bringing them the Muzak from the prison compound now he thought it was Bridge Over Troubled Water also bringing the distant sound of thunder like rolling bones What Follow Roland said nodding to the stony talus on the slope of the path Jake did knowing this was another lessonwith Roland you were always in school Even when you were in the shadow of death there were lessons to be learned On the far side of the boulder the path carried on straight for about thirty yards before curving out of sight once more On this straight stretch those dashmarks were very clear Groups of three on one side groups of four on the other She said she shot off one of its legs Jake said So she did Jake tried to visualize a sevenlegged spider as big as a human baby and couldnt do it Suspected he didnt want to do it Beyond the next curve there was a desiccated corpse in the path Jake was pretty sure it had been flayed open but it was hard to tell There were no innards no blood no buzzing flies Just a lump of dirty dusty stuff that vaguelyvery vaguelyresembled something canine Oy approached sniffed then lifted his leg and pissed on the remains He returned to Jakes side with the air of one who has concluded some important piece of business That was our visitors dinner last night Roland said Jake was looking around Is he watching us now What do you think Roland said I think growing boys need their rest Jake felt a twinge of some unpleasant emotion and put it behind him without much examination Jealousy Surely not How could he be jealous of a thing that had begun life by eating its own mother It was bloodkin to Roland yeshis true son if you wanted to be picky about itbut that was no more than an accident Wasnt it Jake became aware that Roland was looking at him closely looking in a way that made Jake uneasy Penny for em dimmyda the gunslinger said Nothing Jake said Just wondering where hes laid up Hard to tell Roland said Theres got to be a hundred holes in this hill alone Come Roland led the way back around the boulder where Jake had found the stiff black hairs and once he was there he began to methodically scuff away the tracks Mordred had left behind Why are you doing that Jake asked more sharply than he had intended Theres no need for Eddie and Susannah to know about this Roland said He only means to watch not to interfere in our business At least for the time being How do you know Jake wanted to ask but that twinge came againthe one that absolutely couldnt be jealousyand he decided not to Let Roland think whatever he wanted Jake meanwhile would keep his eyes open And if Mordred should be foolish enough to show himself Its Susannah Im most concerned about Roland said Shes the one most likely to be distracted by the chaps presence And her thoughts would be the easiest for him to read Because shes its mother Jake said He didnt notice the change of pronoun but Roland did The two of them are connected aye Can I count on you to keep your mouth shut Sure And try to guard your mindthats important as well I can try but Jake shrugged in order to say that he didnt really know how one did that Good Roland said And Ill do the same The wind gusted again Bridge Over Troubled Water had changed to Jake was pretty sure a Beatles tune the one with the chorus that ended Beepbeepmmmbeepbeep yeah Did they know that one in the dusty dying towns between Gilead and Mejis Jake wondered Were there Shebs in some of those towns that played Drive My Car jagtime on outoftune pianos while the Beams weakened and the glue that held the worlds together slowly stretched into strings and the worlds themselves sagged He gave his head a hard brisk shake trying to clear it Roland was still watching him and Jake felt an uncharacteristic flash of irritation Ill keep my mouth shut Roland and at least try to keep my thoughts to myself Dont worry about me Im not worried Roland said and Jake found himself fighting the temptation to look inside his dinhs head and find out if that was actually true He still thought looking was a bad idea and not just because it was impolite either Mistrust was very likely a kind of acid Their katet was fragile enough already and there was much work to do Good Jake said Thats good Good Oy agreed in a hearty thats settled tone that made them both grin We know hes there Roland said and its likely he doesnt know we know Under the circumstances theres no better way for things to be Jake nodded The idea made him feel a little calmer Susannah came to the mouth of the cave at her usual speedy crawl while they were walking back toward it She sniffed at the air and grimaced When she glimpsed them the grimace turned into a grin I see handsome men How long have you boys been up Only a little while Roland said And how are you feeling Fine Roland said I woke up with a headache but now its almost gone Really Jake asked Roland nodded and squeezed the boys shoulder Susannah wanted to know if they were hungry Roland nodded So did Jake Well come on in here she said and well see what we can do about that situation THREE Susannah found powdered eggs and cans of Prudence corned beef hash Eddie located a canopener and a small gaspowered hibachi grill After a litde muttering to himself he got it going and was only a bit startled when the hibachi began talking Hello Im threequarters filled with Gamry Bottled Gas available at WalMart Burnabys and other fine stores When you call for Gamry youre calling for quality Dark in here isnt it May I help you with recipes or cooking times You could help me by shutting up Eddie said and the grill spoke no more He found himself wondering if he had offended it then wondered if perhaps he should kill himself and spare the world a problem Roland opened four cans of peaches smelled them and nodded Okay I think he said Sweet They were just finishing this repast when the air in front of the cave shimmered A moment later Ted Brautigan Dinky Earnshaw and Sheemie Ruiz appeared With them cringing and very frightened dressed in fading and tattered biballs was the Rod Roland had asked them to bring Come in and have something to eat Roland said amiably as if a quartet of teleports showing up was a common occurrence Theres plenty Maybe well skip breakfast Dinky said We dont have much t Before he could finish Sheemies knees buckled and he collapsed at the mouth of the cave his eyes rolling up to whites and a thin froth of spit oozing out between his cracked lips He began to shiver and buck his legs kicking aimlessly his rubber moccasins scratching lines in the talus ONE Susannah supposed you couldnt classify what came next as pandemonium surely it took at least a dozen people to induce such a state and they were but seven Eight counting the Rod and you certainly had to count him because he was creating a large part of the uproar When he saw Roland he dropped to his knees raised his hands over his head like a ref signaling a successful extrapoint kick and began salaaming rapidly Each downstroke was extreme enough to thump his forehead on the ground He was at the same time babbling at the top of his lungs in his odd vowelly language He never took his eyes off Roland while he performed these gymnastics Susannah had little doubt the gunslinger was being saluted as some kind of god Ted also dropped on his knees but it was Sheemie with whom he was concerned The old man put his hands on the sides of Sheemies head to stop it whipping back and forth already Rolands old acquaintance from his Mejis days had cut one cheek on a sharp bit of stone a cut that was dangerously close to his left eye And now blood began to pour from the corners of Sheemies mouth and run up his modestly stubbled cheeks Give me something to put in his mouth Ted cried Come on somebody Wake up Hes biting the shit out of himself The wooden lid was still leaning against the open crate of sneetches Roland brought it smartly down on his raised kneeno sign of dry twist in that hip now she notedand smashed it to bits Susannah grabbed a piece of board on the fly then turned to Sheemie No need to get on her knees she was always on them anyway One end of the wooden piece was jagged with splinters She wrapped a protective hand around this and then put die piece of wood in Sheemies mouth He bit down on it so hard she could hear the crunch The Rod meanwhile continued his high almost falsetto chant The only words she could pick out of the gibberish were Hile Roland Gilead and Eld Somebody shut him up Dinky cried and Oy began barking Never mind die Rod get Sheemies feet Ted snapped Hold him still Dinky dropped to his knees and grabbed Sheemies feet one now bare the other still wearing its absurd rubber moc Oy hush Jake said and Oy did But he was standing with his short legs spread and his belly low to the ground his fur bushed out so he seemed nearly double his normal size Roland crouched by Sheemies head forearms on the dirt floor of the cave mouth by one of Sheemies ears He began to murmur Susannah could make out very little of it because of the Rods falsetto babbling but she did hear Will Dearborn that was and Alls well andshe thoughtrest Whatever it was it seemed to get through Litde by litde Sheemie relaxed She could see Dinky easing his hold on the former tavernboys ankles ready to grab hard again if Sheemie renewed his kicking The muscles around Sheemies mouth also relaxed and his teeth unlocked The piece of wood still nailed lightly to his mouth by his upper incisors seemed to levitate Susannah pulled it gently free looking with amazement at the bloodrimmed holes some almost half an inch deep diat had been driven into the soft wood Sheemies tongue lolled from the side of his moudi reminding her of how Oy looked at siesta time sleeping on his back with his legs spread to the four points of the compass Now there was only the rapid auctioneers babble of die Rod and die low growl deep in Oys chest as he stood protectively at Jakes side looking at die newcomer widi narrowed eyes Shut your mouth and be still Roland told the Rod then added something else in another language The Rod froze halfway into another salaam hands still raised above his head staring at Roland Eddie saw the side of his nose had been eaten away by a juicy sore red as a strawberry The Rod put his scabbed dirty palms over his eyes as if the gunslinger were a thing too bright to look at and fell on his side He drew his knees up to his chest producing a loud fart as he did so Harpo speaks Eddie said ajoke snappy enough to make Susannah laugh Then there was silence except for the whine of the wind outside the cave the faint sound of recorded music from the DevarToi and the distant rumble of thunder that sound of rolling bones Five minutes later Sheemie opened his eyes sat up and looked around with the bewildered air of one who knows not where he is how he got there or why Then his eyes fixed on Roland and his poor tired face lit in a smile Roland returned it and held out his arms Canee come to me Sheemie If not Ill come to you sure Sheemie crawled to Roland of Gilead on his hands and knees his dark and dirty hair hanging in his eyes and laid his head on Rolands shoulder Susannah felt tears stinging her eyes and looked away TWO Some short time later Sheemie sat propped against the wall of the cave with the movers pad that had been over Suzies Cruisin Trike cushioning his head and back Eddie had offered him a soda but Ted suggested water might be better Sheemie drank the first bottle of Perrier at a single go and now sat sipping another The rest of them had instant coffee except for Ted he was drinking a can of NozzALa Dont know how you stand that stuff Eddie said Each to his own taste said the old maid as she kissed the cow Ted replied Only the Child of Roderick had nothing He lay where he was at the mouth of the cave with his hands pressed firmly over his eyes He was trembling lighdy Ted had checked Sheemie over between Sheemies first and second bottle of water taking his pulse looking in his mouth and feeling his skull for any soft places Each time he asked Sheemie if it hurt Sheemie solemnly shook his head never taking his eyes off Roland during the examination After feeling Sheemies ribs Tickles sai so it do Sheemie said widi a smile Ted pronounced him fit as a fiddle Eddie who could see Sheemies eyes perfecdy wellone of the gaslanterns was nearby and cast a strong glow on Sheemies facethought that was a lie of near Presidential quality Susannah was cooking up a fresh batch of powdered eggs and corned beef hash The grill had spoken up againMore of the same eh it asked in a tone of cheery approval Eddie caught Dinky Earnshaws eye and said Want to step outside with me for a minute while Suze makes with the chow Dinky glanced at Ted who nodded then back at Eddie If you want Weve got a litde more time diis morning but that doesnt mean we can waste any I understand Eddie said THREE The wind had strengthened but instead of freshening the air it smelled fouler than ever Once in high school Eddie had gone on a field trip to an oil refinery in New Jersey Until now he thought that was handsdown the worst thing hed ever smelled in his life two of the girls and three of the boys had puked He remembered their tourguide laughing heartily and saying Just remember thats the smell of moneyit helps Maybe Perth Oil and Gas was still the alltime champeen but only because what he was smelling now wasnt quite so strong And just by the way what was there about Perth Oil and Gas that seemed familiar He didnt know and it probably didnt matter but it was strange the way things kept coming around over here Only coming around wasnt quite right was it Echoing back Eddie murmured Thats what it is Beg pardon partner Dinky asked They were once again standing on the path looking down at the blueroofed buildings in the distance and the tangle of stalled traincars and the perfect little village Perfect that was until you remembered it was behind a triple run of wire one of those runs carrying an electrical charge strong enough to kill a man on contact Nothing Eddie said Whats that smell Any idea Dinky shook his head but pointed beyond the prison compound in a direction that might or might not be south or east Something poison out there is all I know he said Once I asked Finli and he said there used to be factories in that direction Positronics business You know that name Yes But whos Finli Finli OTego The top security guy Prentisss number one boy also known as The Weasel A taheen Whatever your plans are youll have to go through him to make them work And he wont make it easy for you Seeing him stretched out dead on the ground would make me feel like it was a national holiday By the way my real names Richard Earnshaw Pleased as hell to meetcha He put out his hand Eddie shook it Im Eddie Dean Known as Eddie of New York out here west of the Pecos The womans Susannah My wife Dinky nodded Uhhuh And the boys Jake Also of New York Jake Chambers right Listen Rich I salute the effort he said smiling but Ive been Dinky too long to change now I guess And it could be worse I worked for awhile at the Supr Savr Supermarket with a twentysomething guy known as JJ the Fuckin Blue Jay People will still be calling him that when hes eighty and wearing a peebag Unless were brave lucky and good Eddie said nobodys gonna see eighty Not in this world or any of the others Dinky looked startled then glum You got a point That guy Roland used to know looks bad Eddie said Did you see his eyes Dinky nodded glummer than ever I think those little spots of blood in the whites are called petechiae Something like that Then in a tone of apology Eddie found rather bizarre under the circumstances I dont know if Im saying that right I dont care what you call them its not good And him pitching a fit like that Not a very nice way to put it Dinky said Eddie didnt give a shit if it was or wasnt Has it ever happened to him before Dinkys eyes broke contact with Eddies and looked down at his own shuffling feet instead Eddie thought that was answer enough How many times Eddie hoped he didnt sound as appalled as he felt There were enough pinpricksized bloodspots in the whites of Sheemies eyes to make them look as if someone had flung paprika into them Not to mention the bigger ones in the corners Still without looking at him Dinky raised four fingers Four times Yuh Dinky said He was still studying his makeshift mocs Starting with the time he sent Ted to Connecticut in It was like doing that ruptured something inside him He looked up trying to smile But he didnt faint yesterday when the three of us went back to the Devar Let me make sure Ive got this right In the prison down there you guys have all sorts of venial sins but only one mortal one teleportation Dinky considered this The rules certainly werent that liberal for the taheen and the cantoi they could be exiled or lobotomized for all sorts of reasons including such wrongs as negligence teasing the Breakers or the occasional act of outright cruelty Onceso he had been tolda Breaker had been raped by a low man who was said to have explained earnestly to the camps last Master that it was part of his becomingthe Crimson King himself had appeared to this fellow in a dream and told him to do it For this the cantoi had been sentenced to death The Breakers had been invited to attend his execution accomplished by a single pistolshot to the head which had taken place in the middle of Pleasantvilles Main Street Dinky told Eddie about this then admitted that yes for the inmates at least teleportation was the only mortal sin That he knew of anyway And Sheemies your teleport Eddie said You guys help himfacilitate for him to use the Tedsters wordand you cover up for him by fudging the records somehow They have no idea how easy it is to cook their telemetry Dinky said almost laughing Partner theyd be shocked The hard part is making sure we dont tip over the whole works Eddie didnt care about that either It worked That was the only thing that mattered Sheemie also worked but for how long but hes the one who does it Eddie finished Sheemie Yuh The only one who can do it Yuh Eddie thought about their two tasks freeing the Breakers or killing them if there was no other way to make them stop and keeping the writer from being struck and killed by a minivan while taking a walk Roland thought they might be able to accomplish both things but theyd need Sheemies teleportation ability at least twice Plus their visitors would have to get back inside the triple run of wire after todays palaver was done and presumably that meant hed have to do it a third time He says it doesnt hurt Dinky said If thats what youre worried about Inside the cave the others laughed at something Sheemie back to consciousness and taking nourishment everyone the best of friends Its not Eddie said What does Ted think is happening to Sheemie when he teleports That hes having brain hemorrhages Dinky said promptly Little tiny strokes on the surface of his brain He tapped a finger at different points on his own skull in demonstration Boink boink boink Is it getting worse It is isnt it Look if you think him jaunting us around is my idea you better think again Eddie raised one hand like a traffic cop No no Im just trying to figure out whats going on And what our chances are I hate using him that way Dinky burst out He kept his voice pitched low so those in the cave wouldnt hear but Eddie never for a moment considered that he was exaggerating Dinky was badly upset He doesnt mindhe wants to do itand that makes it worse not better The way he looks at Ted He shrugged Its the way a dogd look at the best master in the universe He looks at your dinh the same way as Im sure youve noticed Hes doing it for my dinh Eddie said and that makes it okay You may not believe that Dink but But you do Totally Now heres the really important question does Ted have any idea how long Sheemie can last Keeping in mind that now hes got a little more help at this end Who you tryin to cheer up bro Henry spoke up suddenly inside his head Cynical as always Him or yourself Dinky was looking at Eddie as if he were crazy or soft in the head at least Ted was an accountant Sometimes a tutor A daylaborer when he couldnt get anything better Hes no doctor But Eddie kept pushing What does he think Dinky paused The wind blew The music wafted Farther away thunder mumbled out of the murk At last he said Three or four times maybe but the effects are getting worse Maybe only twice But there are no guarantees okay He could drop dead of a massive stroke the next time he bears down to make that hole we go through Eddie tried to think of another question and couldnt Ihat last answer pretty well covered the waterfront and when Susannah called them back inside he was more than glad to go FOUR Sheemie Ruiz had rediscovered his appetite which all of them took as a good sign and was tucking in happily The bloodspots in his eyes had faded somewhat but were still clearly visible Eddie wondered what the guards back in Blue Heaven would make of those if they noticed them and also wondered if Sheemie could wear a pair of sunglasses without exciting comment Roland had gotten the Rod to his feet and was now conferring with him at the back of the cave Well sort of The gunslinger was talking and the Rod was listening occasionally sneaking tiny awed peeks at Rolands face It was gibberish to Eddie but he was able to pick out two words Chevin and Chayven Roland was asking this one about the one theyd met staggering along the road in Lovell Does he have a name Eddie asked Dink and Ted taking a second plate of food I call him Chucky Dinky said Because he looks a little bit like the doll in this horror movie I saw once Eddie grinned Childs Play yeah I saw that one After your when Jake And way after yours Suziella The Rods hair wasnt right but the chubby freckled cheeks and the blue eyes were Do you think he can keep a secret If no one asks him he can Ted said Which was not in Eddies view a very satisfactory answer After five minutes or so of chat Roland seemed satisfied and rejoined the others He hunkeredno problem doing that now that his joints had limbered upand looked at Ted This fellows name is Haylis of Chayven Will anyone miss him Unlikely Ted said The Rods show up at the gate beyond the dorms in littie groups looking for work Fetching and carrying mostly Theyre given a meal or something to drink as pay If they dont show up no one misses them Good Nowhow long are the days here Is it twentyfour hours from now until tomorrow morning at this time Ted seemed interested in the question and considered it for several moments before replying Call it twentyfive he said Maybe a litde longer Because time is slowing down at least here As the Beams weaken there seems to be a growing disparity in the timeflow between the worlds Its probably one of the major stress points Roland nodded Susannah offered him food and he shook his head with a word of thanks Behind them the Rod was sitting on a crate looking down at his bare and sorecovered feet Eddie was surprised to see Oy approach the fellow and more surprised still when the bumbler allowed Chucky or Haylis to stroke his head with one misshapen claw of a hand And is there a time of morning when things down there might be a little less I dont know A little disorganized Ted suggested Roland nodded Did you hear a horn a little while ago Ted asked Just before we showed up They all shook their heads Ted didnt seem surprised But you heard the music start correct Yes Susannah said and offered Ted a fresh can of NozzALa He took it and drank with gusto Eddie tried not to shudder Thank you maam In any case the horn signals the change of shifts The music starts then I hate that music Dinky said moodily If theres any time when control wavers Ted went on that would be it And what oclock is that Roland asked Ted and Dinky exchanged a doubtful glance Dinky showed eight fingers his eyebrows raised questioningly He looked relieved when Ted nodded at once Yes eight oclock Ted said then laughed and gave his head a cynical little shake What would be eight anyway in a world where yon prison might always lie firmly east and not east by southeast on some days and dead east on others But Roland had been living with the dissolving world long before Ted Brautigan had even dreamed of such a place as Algul Siento and he wasnt particularly upset by the way formerly hardandfast facts of life had begun to bend About twentyfive hours from right now Roland said Or a little less Dinky nodded But if youre counting on raging confusion forget it They know their places and go to them Theyre old hands Still Roland said its the best were apt to do Now he looked at his old acquaintance from Mejis And beckoned to him FIVE Sheemie set his plate down at once came to Roland and made a fist Hile Roland Will Dearborn that was Roland returned this greeting then turned to Jake The boy gave him an uncertain look Roland nodded at him and Jake came Now Jake and Sheemie stood facing each other with Roland hunkered between them seeming to look at neither now that they were brought together Jake raised a hand to his forehead Sheemie returned the gesture Jake looked down at Roland and said What do you want Roland didnt answer only continued to look serenely toward the mouth of the cave as if there were something in the apparently endless murk out there which interested him And Jake knew what was wanted as surely as if he had used the touch on Rolands mind to find out which he most certainly had not They had come to a fork in the road It had been Jake whod suggested Sheemie should be the one to tell them which branch to take At the time it had seemed like a weirdly good ideawho knew why Now looking into that earnest notverybright face and those bloodshot eyes Jake wondered two things what had ever possessed him to suggest such a course of action and why someoneprobably Eddie who retained a relatively hard head in spite of all theyd been throughhadnt told him kindly but firmly that putting their future in Sheemie hands was a dumb idea Totally noodgy as his old schoolmates back at Piper might have said Now Roland who believed that even in the shadow of death there were still lessons to be learned wanted Jake to ask the question Jake himself had proposed and the answer would no doubt expose him as the superstitious scatterbrain he had become Yet still why not ask Even if it were the equivalent of flipping a coin why not Jake had come possibly at the end of a short but undeniably interesting life to a place where there were magic doors mechanical butlers telepathy of which he was capable at least to some small degree himself vampires and werespiders So why not let Sheemie choose They had to go one way or the other after all and hed been through too goddam much to worry about such a paltry thing as looking like an idiot in front of his companions Besides he thought if Im not among friends here I never will be Sheemie he said Looking into those bloody eyes was sort of horrible but he made himself do it Were on a quest That means we have ajob to do We You have to save the Tower said Sheemie And my old friend is to go in and mount to the top and see whats to see There may be renewal there may be death or there may be both He was Will Dearborn once aye so he was Will Dearborn to me Jake glanced at Roland who was still hunkered down looking out of the cave But Jake thought his face had gone pale and strange One of Rolands fingers made his twirling goahead gesture Yes were supposed to save the Dark Tower Jake agreed nd thought he understood some of Rolands lust to see it and snter it even if it killed him What lay at the center of the umbrae What man or boy could but wonder once the question was thought of and want to see Even if looking drove him mad But in order to do that we have to do two jobs One nvolves going back to our world and saving a man A writer vhos telling our story The other job is the one weve been talking about Freeing the Breakers Honesty made him add Or stopping them at least Do you understand But this time Sheemie didnt reply He was looking where Roland was looking out into the murk His face was that of someone whos been hypnotized Looking at it made Jake uneasy but he pushed on He had come to his question after all and where else was there to go but on The question is which job do we do first Itd seem that saving the writer might be easier because theres no opposition that we know of anyway but theres a chance that well Jake didnt want to say But theres a chance that teleporting us might kill you and so came to a lame and unsatisfying halt For a moment he didnt think Sheemie would make any reply leaving him with the job of deciding whether or not to try again but then the former tavernboy spoke He looked at none of them as he did so but only out of the cave and into the dim of Thunderclap I had a dream last night so I did said Sheemie of Mejis whose life had once been saved by three young gunslingers from Gilead I dreamed I was back at the Travellers Rest only Coral wasnt there nor Stanley nor Pettie nor Shebhim that used to play the pianer There was nobbut me and I was moppin the floor and singin Careless Love Then the batwings screeked so they did they had this funny sound they made Jake saw that Roland was nodding a trace of a smile on his lips I looked up Sheemie resumed and in come this boy His eyes shifted briefly to Jake then back to the mouth of the cave He looked like you young sai so he did close enough to be twim But his face were covert wi blood and one of his eyen were put out spoiling his pretty and he walked all alimp Looked like death he did and frightent me terrible and made me sad to see him too I just kept moppin thinkin that if I did that he might not never mind me or even see me at all and go away Jake realized he knew this tale Had he seen it Had he actually been that bloody boy But he looked right at you Roland murmured still ahunker still looking out into the gloom Aye Will Dearborn that was right at me so he did and said Why must you hurt me when I love you so When I can do nothing else nor want to for love made me and fed me and And kept me in better days Eddie murmured A tear fell from one of his eyes and made a dark spot on the floor of the cave and kept me in better days Why will you cut me and disfigure my face and fill me with woe I have only loved you for your beauty as you once loved me for mine in the days before the world moved on Now you scar me with nails and put burning drops of quicksilver in my nose you have set the animals on me so you have and they have eaten of my softest parts Around me the cantoi gather and theres no peace from their laughter Yet still I love you and would serve you and even bring the magic again if you would allow me for that is how my heart was cast when I rose from the Prim And once I was strong as well as beautiful but now my strength is almost gone You cried Susannah said and Jake thought Of course he did He was crying himself So was Ted so was Dinky Earnshaw Only Roland was dryeyed and the gunslinger was pale so pale He wept said Sheemie tears were rolling down his cheeks as he told his dream and I did too for I could see that he had been fair as daylight He said If the torture were to stop now I might still recoverif never my looks then at least my strength My kes Jake said and although hed never heard the word before he pronounced it correcdy almost as if it were kiss and my kes But another week or maybe five days or even three and it will be too late Even if die torture stops Ill die And youll die too for when love leaves the world all hearts are still Tell them of my love and tell them of my pain and tell them of my hope which still lives For this is all I have and all I am and all I ask Then the boy turned and went out The batwing door made its same sound Skreeeek He looked at Jake now and smiled like one who has just awakened I cant answer your question sai He knocked a fist on his forehead Dont have much in the way of brains up here meonly cobwebbies Cordelia Delgado said so and I reckon she was right Jake made no reply He was dazed He had dreamed about the same disfigured boy but not in any saloon it had been in Gage Park the one where theyd seen Charlie the ChooChoo Last night Had to have been He hadnt remembered until now would probably never have remembered if Sheemie hadnt told his own dream And had Roland Eddie and Susannah also had a version of the same dream Yes He could see it on their faces just as he could see that Ted and Dinky looked moved but otherwise bewildered Roland stood up with a wince clamped his hand briefly to his hip then said Thankeesai Sheemie youve helped us greatly Sheemie smiled uncertainly How did I do that Never mind my dear Roland turned his attention to Ted My friends and I are going to step outside briefly We need to speak antet Of course Ted said He shook his head as if to clear it Do my peace of mind a favor and keep it short Dinky said Were probably still all right but I dont want to push our luck WilL you need him to jump you back inside Eddie asked nodding to Sheemie This was in the nature of a rhetorical question how else would the three of them get back Well yeah but Dinky began Then youll be pushing your luck plenty That said Eddie Susannah and Jake followed Roland out of the cave Oy stayed behind sitting with his new friend Haylis of Chayven Something about that troubled Jake It wasnt a feeling of jealousy but rather one of dread As if he were seeing an omen someone wiser than himselfone of the Mannifolk perhapscould interpret But would he want to know Perhaps not SIX I didnt remember my dream until he told his Susannah said and if he hadnt told his I probably never would have remembered Yeah Jake said But I remember it clearly enough now she went on I was in a subway station and the boy came down the stairs Jake said I was in Gage Park And I was at the Markey Avenue playground where me and Henry used to play oneonone Eddie said In my dream the kid with the bloody face was wearing a teeshirt that said NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN MIDWORLD Jake finished and Eddie gave him a startled look Jake barely noticed his thoughts had turned in another direction I wonder if Stephen King ever uses dreams in his writing You know as yeast to make the plot rise This was a question none of them could answer Roland Eddie asked Where were you in your dream The Travellers Rest where else Wasnt I there with Sheemie once upon a time With my friends now long gone he could have added but did not I was sitting at the table Eldred Jonas used to favor playing onehand Watch Me Susannah said quiedy The boy in die dream was the Beam wasnt he As Roland nodded Jake realized that Sheemie had told them which task came first after all Had told them beyond all doubt Do any of you have a question Roland asked One by one his companions shook their heads We are katet Roland said and in unison they answered We are one from many Roland tarried a moment longer looking at themmore than looking seeming to savor their facesand then he led them back inside Sheemie he said Yes sai Yes Roland Will Dearborn that was Were going to save the boy you told us about Were going to make the bad folk stop hurting him Sheemie smiled but it was a puzzled smile He didnt remember the boy in his dream not anymore Good sai thats good Roland turned his attention to Ted Once Sheemie gets you back this time put him to bed Or if that would attract the wrong sort of attention just make sure he takes it easy We can write him down for the sniffles and keep him out of The Study Ted agreed There are a lot of colds Thunderside But you folks need to understand that there are no guarantees He could get us back inside this time and then He snapped his fingers in the air Laughing Sheemie imitated him only snapping both sets of fingers Susannah looked away sick to her stomach I know that Roland said and although his tone did not change very much each member of his katet knew it was a good thing this palaver was almost over Roland had reached the rim of his patience Keep him quiet even if hes well and feeling fine We wont need him for what I have in mind and thanks to the weapons youve left us Theyre good weapons Ted agreed but are they good enough to wipe out sixty men cantoi and taheen Will the two of you stand with us once the fight begins Roland asked With the greatest pleasure Dinky said baring his teeth in a remarkably nasty grin Yes Ted said And it might be that I have another weapon Did you listen to the tapes I left you Yes Jake replied So you know the story about the guy who stole my wallet This time they all nodded What about that young woman Susannah asked One tough cookie you said What about Tanya and her boyfriend Or her husband if thats what he is Ted and Dinky exchanged a brief doubtful look then shook their heads simultaneously Once maybe Ted said Not now Now shes married All she wants to do is cuddle with her fella And Break Dinky added But dont they understand She found she couldnt finish She was haunted not so much by the remnants of her own dream as by Sheemies Now you scar me with nails the dreamboy had told Sheemie The dreamboy who had once been fair They dont want to understand Ted told her kindly He caught a glimpse of Eddies dark face and shook his head But I wont let you hate them for it Youwemay have to kill some of them but I wont let you hate them They did not put understanding away from them out of greed or fear but from despair And because to Break is divine Dinky said He was also looking at Eddie The way the half an hour after you shoot up can be divine If you know what Im talking about Eddie sighed stuck his hands in his pockets said nothing Sheemie surprised them all by picking up one of the Coyote machinepistols and swinging it in an arc Had it been loaded the great quest for the Dark Tower would have ended right there Ill fight too he cried Pow pow pow Bambambamba Eddie and Susannah ducked Jake threw himself instinctively in front of Oy Ted and Dinky raised their hands in front of their faces as if that could possibly have saved them from a burst of a hundred highcaliber steeljacketed slugs Roland plucked the machinepistol calmly from Sheemies hands Your time to help will come he said but after this first battles fought and won Do you see Jakes bumbler Sheemie Aye hes with the Rod He talks See if you can get him to talk to you Sheemie obediently went to where ChuckyHaylis was still stroking Oys head dropped to one knee and commenced trying to get Oy to say his name The bumbler did almost at once and with remarkable clarity Sheemie laughed and Haylis joined in They sounded like a couple of kids from the Calla The roont kind perhaps Roland meanwhile turned to Dinky and Ted his lips little more than a white line in his stern face SEVEN Hes to be kept out of it once the shooting starts The gunslinger mimed turning a key in a lock If we lose what happens to him later on wont matter If we win well need him at least one more time Probably twice To go where Dinky asked Keystone World America Eddie said A small town in western Maine called Lovell As early in June of  as oneway time allows Sending me to Connecticut appears to have inaugurated Sheemies seizures Ted said in a low voice You know that sending you back Americaside is apt to make him worse dont you Or kill him He spoke in a matteroffact tone Just askin gents We know Roland said and when the time comes Ill make the risk clear and ask him if Oh man you can stick that one where the sun dont shine Dinky said and Eddie was reminded so strongly of himselfthe way hed been during his first few hours on the shore of the Western Sea confused pissed off and jonesing for herointhat he felt a moment of deja vu If you told him you wanted him to set himself on fire the only thing hed want to know would be if you had a match He thinks youre Christ on a cracker Susannah waited with a mixture of dread and almost prurient interest for Rolands response There was none Roland only stared at Dinky his thumbs hooked into his gunbelt Surely you realize that a dead man cant bring you back from Americaside Ted said in a more reasonable tone Well jump that fence when and if we come to it Roland said In the meantime weve got several other fences to get over Im glad were taking on the DevarToi first whatever the risk Susannah said Whats going on down there is an abomination Yes maam Dinky drawled and pushed up an imaginary hat Ah reckon thats the word The tension in die cave eased Behind them Sheemie was telling Oy to roll over and Oy was doing so willingly enough The Rod had a big sloppy smile on his face Susannah wondered when Haylis of Chayven had last had occasion to use his smile which was childishly charming She thought of asking Ted if there was any way of telling what day it was in America right now then decided not to bother If Stephen King was dead dieyd know Roland had said so and she had no doubt he was right For now the writer was fine happily frittering away his time and valuable imagination on some meaningless project while the world hed been born to imagine continued to gather dust in his head If Roland was pissed at him it was really no wonder She was a little pissed at him herself Whats your plan Roland Ted asked It relies on two assumptions that we can surprise them and then stampede them I dont think they expect to be interrupted in these last days from Pimli Prentiss down to the lowliest hume guard outside the fence they have no reason to believe theyll be bothered in their work certainly not attacked If my assumptions are correct well succeed If we fail at least we wont live long enough to see the Beams break and the Tower fall Roland found the crude map of die Algul and put it on the floor of the cave They all gathered around it These railroad sidetracks he said indicating the hashmarks labeled  Some of the dead engines and traincars on them stand widiin twenty yards of the south fence it looks like through the binoculars Is that right Yeah Dinky said and pointed to the center of die nearest line Might as well call it south anywayits as good a word as any Theres a boxcar on this track thats real close to the fence Only ten yards or so It says soo LINE on the side Ted was nodding Good cover Roland said Excellent cover Now he pointed to the area beyond the north end of the compound And here all sorts of sheds There used to be supplies in them Ted said but now most are empty I think For awhile a gang of Rods slept there but six or eight months ago Pimli and the Wease kicked them out But more cover empty or full Roland said Is the ground behind and around them clear of obstacles and pretty much smooth Smooth enough for that thing to go back and forth He cocked a thumb at Suzies Cruisin Trike Ted and Dinky exchanged a glance Definitely Ted said Susannah waited to see if Eddie would protest even before he knew what Roland had in mind He didnt Good She was already thinking about what weapons shed want What guns Roland sat quiet for a moment or two gazing at the map almost seeming to commune with it When Ted offered him a cigarette the gunslinger took it Then he began to talk Twice he drew on the side of a weapons crate with a piece of chalk Twice more he drew arrows on the map one pointing to what they were calling north one to the south Ted asked a question Dinky asked another Behind them Sheemie and Haylis played with Oy like a couple of children The bumbler mimicked their laughter with eerie accuracy When Roland had finished Ted Brautigan said You mean to spill an almighty lot of blood Indeed I do As much as I can Risky for the lady Dink remarked looking first at her and then at her husband Susannah said nothing Neither did Eddie He recognized the risk He also understood why Roland would want Suze north of the compound The Cruisin Trike would give her mobility and theyd need it As for risk they were six planning to take on sixty Or more Of course there would be risk and of course there would be blood Blood and fire I may be able to rig a couple of other guns Susannah said Her eyes had taken on that special Detta Walker gleam Radiocontrolled like a toy airplane I dunno But Ill move all right Im goan speed around like grease on a hot griddle Can this work Dinky asked bluntly Rolands lips parted in a humorless grin It awork How can you say that Ted asked Eddie recalled Rolands reasoning before their call to John Cullum and could have answered that question but answers were for their katets dinh to giveif he wouldand so he left this one to Roland Because it has to the gunslinger said I see no other way ONE It was a day later and not long before the horn signaled the morning change of shift The music would soon start the sun would come on and the Breaker nightcrew would exit The Study stage left while the Breaker daycrew entered stage right Everything was as it should be yet Pimli Prentiss had slept less than an hour the previous night and even that brief time had been haunted by sour and chaotic dreams Finally around four what his bedside clock in fact claimed was four but who knew anymore and what did it matter anyway this close to the end hed gotten up and sat in his office chair looking out at the darkened Mall deserted at this hour save for one lone and poindess robot whod taken it into its head to patrol waving its six pincertipped arms aimlessly at the sky The robots that still ran grew wonkier by the day but pulling their batteries could be dangerous for some were boobytrapped and would explode it you tried it There was nothing you could do but put up with their antics and keep reminding yourself that all would be over soon praise Jesus and God the Fauier Almighty At some point the former Paul Prentiss opened the desk drawer above the kneehole pulled out the Peacemaker Colt inside and held it in his lap It was the one with which the previous Master Humma had executed the rapist Cameron Pimli hadnt had to execute anyone in his time and was glad of it but holding the pistol in his lap feeling its grave weight always offered a certain comfort Although why he should require comfort in the watches of the night especially when everything was going so well he had no idea All he knew for sure was that there had been some anomalous blips on what Finli and Jenkins their chief technician liked to call the Deep Telemetry as if these were instruments at the bottom of the ocean instead of just in a basement closet adjacent to die long low room holding the rest of the more useful gear Pimli recognized what he was feelingcall a spade a spadeas a sense of impending doom He tried to tell himself it was only his grandfathers proverb in action that he was almost home and so it was time to worry about the eggs Finally hed gone into his bathroom where he closed die lid of the toilet and knelt to pray And here he was still only something had changed in the atmosphere Hed heard no footfall but knew someone had stepped into his office Logic suggested who it must be Still without opening his eyes still with his hands clasped on the closed cover of the toilet he called Finli Finli OTego Is that you Yar boss its me What was he doing here before the horn Everyone even the Breakers knew what a fiend for sleep was Finli the Weasel But all in good time At this moment Pimli was entertaining die Lord although in truth hed nearly dozed off on his knees when some deep subinstinct had warned him he was no longer alone on the first floor of Wardens House One did not snub such an important guest as the Lord God of Hosts and so he finished his prayerGrant me die grace of Thy will amenbefore rising with a wince His damned back didnt care a bit for the belly it had to hoist in front Finli was standing by the window holding the Peacemaker up to the dim light turning it to and fro in order to admire die delicate scrollwork on the buttplates This is the one that said goodnight to Cameron true Finli asked The rapist Cameron Pimli nodded Have a care my son Its loaded Sixshot Eight Are you blind Look at the size of the cylinder for Gods love Finli didnt bother He handed the gun back to Pimli instead I know how to pull the trigger so I do and when it comes to guns thats enough Aye if its loaded What are you doing up at this hour and bothering a man at his morning prayers Finli eyed him If I were to ask you why I find you at your prayers dressed and combed instead of in your bathrobe and slippers with only one eye open what answer would you make Ive got the jitters Its as simple as that I guess you do too Finli smiled charmed Jitters Is that like heebiejeebies and harumscarum and hinkydidi Sort ofyar Finlis smile widened but Pimli thought it didnt look quite genuine I like it I like it very well Jittery Jittersome No Pimli said Got the jitters thats how you use it Finlis smile faded I also have the jitters Im heebie and jeebie I feel hinkydidi Im harum and youre scarum More blips on the Deep Telemetry Finli shrugged then nodded The problem with the Deep Telemetry was that none of them were sure exacdy what it measured It might be telepathy or God forbid teleportation or even deep tremors in the fabric of realityprecursors of the Bear Beams impending snap Impossible to tell But more and more of that previously dark and quiet equipment had come alive in the last four months or so What does Jenkins say Pimli asked He slipped the into his dockers clutch almost without thinking so moving us a step closer to what you will not want to hear and I will not want to tell Jenkins says whatever rides out of his mouth on the flying carpet of his tongue said the Tego with a rude shrug Since he dont even know what the symbols on the Deep Telemetry dials and vid screens signify how can you ask his opinion Easy Pimli said putting a hand on his Security Chiefs shoulder He was surprised and a little alarmed to feel the flesh beneath Finlis fine Turnbull amp Asser shirt thrumming slightly Or perhaps trembling Easy pal I was only asking I cant sleep I cant read I cant even fuck Finli said I tried all three by Gan Walk down to Damli House with me would you and have a look at the damned readouts Maybe youll have some ideas Im a trailboss not a technician Pimli said mildly but he was already moving toward the door However since Ive notiiing better to do Maybe its just the end coming on Finli said pausing in the doorway As if there could be any just about such a thing Maybe thats it Pimli said equably and a walk in the morning air cant do us any haHey Hey you You there You Rod Turn around when I talk to you hadnt you just better The Rod a scrawny fellow in an ancient pair of denim biballs the deeply sagging seat had gone completely white obeyed His cheeks were chubby and freckled his eyes an engaging shade of blue even though at the moment alarmed He actually wouldnt have been badlooking except for his nose which had been eaten away almost completely on one side giving him a bizarre onenostril look He was toting a basket Pimli was pretty sure hed seen this shufflefoot bahbo around the ranch before but couldnt be sure to him all Rods looked alike It didnt matter Identification was Finlis job and he took charge now pulling a rubber glove out of his belt and putting it on as he strode forward The Rod cringed back against the wall clasping his wicker basket tighter and letting go a loud fart that had to have been pure nerves Pimli needed to bite down on the inside of his cheek and quite fiercely to keep a smile from rising on his lips Nay nay nay the Security Chief cried and slapped the Rod briskly across the face with his newly gloved hand It did not do to touch the Children of Roderick skin to skin they carried too many diseases Loose spit flew from the Rods mouth and blood from the hole in his nose Speak not with your kibox to me sai Haylis The hole in thy heads not much better but at least it can give me a word of respect It had better be able to Hile Finli OTego Haylis muttered and fisted himself in the forehead so hard the back of his head bounced off the wallbonkThat did it Pimli barked a laugh in spite of himself Nor would Finli be able to reproach him with it on their walk to Damli House for he was smiling now too Although Pimli doubted that the Rod named Haylis would find much to comfort him in that smile It exposed too many sharp teeth Hile Finli OThe Watch long days and pleasant nights toee sai Better Finli allowed Not much but a little What in hells name are you doing here before Horn and Sun And tell me whats in thy bascomb wiggins Haylis hugged it tighter against his chest his eyes flashing with alarm Finlis smile disappeared at once You flip the lid and show me whats in thy bascomb this second cully or theell be picking thy teeth off the carpet These words came out in a smooth low growl For a moment Pimli thought the Rod still would not comply and he felt a twinge of active alarm Then slowly the fellow lifted the lid of the wicker basket It was the sort with handles known in Finlis home territory as a bascomb The Rod held it reluctantly out At the same time he closed his sorelooking boogerrimmed eyes and turned his head aside as if in anticipation of a blow Finli looked For a long time he said nothing then gave his own bark of laughter and invited Pimli to have a peek The Master knew what he was seeing at once but figuring out what it meant took a moment longer Then his mind flashed back to popping the pimple and offering Finli the bloody pus as one would offer a friend leftover hors doeuweat the end of a dinnerparty In the bottom of the Rods basket was a litde pile of used tissues Kleenex in fact Did Tammy Kelly send you to pick up the swill this morning Pimli asked The Rod nodded fearfully Did she tell you that you could have whatever you found and fancied from the wastecans He thought the Rod would lie If and when he did the Master would command Finli to beat the fellow as an objectlesson in honesty But the RodHaylisshook his head looking sad All right Pimli said relieved It was really too early in the day for beatings and howlings and tears They spoiled a mans breakfast You can go and with your prize But next time cully ask permission or youll leave here ahurt Doee ken The Rod nodded energetically Go on then go Out of my house and out of my sight They watched him leave him with his basket of snotty tissues that hed undoubtedly eat like candy nougat each shaming the other into keeping his face grave and stern until the poor disfigured son of no one was gone Then they burst into gales of laughter Finli OTego staggered back against the wall hard enough to knock a picture off its hook then slid to the floor howling hysterically Pimli put his face in his hands and laughed until his considerable gut ached The laughter erased the tension with which each had begun the day venting it all at once A dangerous fellow indeed Finli said when he could speak a litde again He was wiping his streaming eyes with one furry pawhand The Snot Saboteur Pimli agreed His face was bright red They exchanged a look and were off again braying gales of relieved laughter until they woke the housekeeper way up on the third floor Tammy Kelly lay in her narrow bed listening to yon kamais bellow below looking disapprovingly up into the gloom Men were much die same in her view no matter what sort of skin they wore Outside the hume Master and the taheen Security Chief walked up the Mall arm in arm The Child of Roderick meanwhile scurried out through the north gate head down heart thumping madly in his chest How close it had been Aye If WeaselHead had asked him Haylis didjer plant anything he would have lied as best he could but such as him couldnt lie successfully to such as Finli OTego never in life He would have been found out sure But he hadntbeen found out praise Gan The ballthing the gunslinger had given him was now stowed away in the back bedroom humming softly to itself Hed put it in the wastebasket as he had been told and covered it with fresh tissue from the box on the washstand also as he had been told Nobody had told him he might take the castaway tissues but he hadnt been able to resist their soupy delicious smell And it had worked for the best hadnt it Yar For instead of asking him all manner of questions he couldnt have answered theyd laughed at him and let him go He wished he could climb the mountain and play with the bum bier again so he did but the whitehaired old hume named Ted had told him to go away far and far once his errand was done And if he heard shooting Haylis was to hide until it was over And he wouldoh yes nair doot Hadnt he done what Roland o Gilead had asked of him The first of the humming balls was now in Feveral one of the dorms two more were in Damli House where the Breakers worked and the offduty guards slept and the last was in Masters House where hed almost been caught Haylis didnt know what the humming balls did nor wanted to know He would go away possibly widi his friend Garma if he could find her If shooting started they would hide in a deep hole and he would share his tissues with her Some had nothing on them but bits of shaving soap but there were wet snots and big boogies in some of the others he could smell their enticing aroma even now He would save the biggest of the latter the one with the jellied blood in it for Garma and she might let him pokeypoke Haylis walked faster smiling at the prospect of going pokeypoke with Garma TWO Sitting on the Cruisin Trike in the concealment afforded by one of the empty sheds north of the compound Susannah watched Haylis go She noted that the poor disfigured sai was smiling about something so things had probably gone well with him That was good news indeed Once he was out of sight she returned her attention to her end of Algul Siento She could see both stone towers although only the top half of the one on her left the rest was concealed by a fold of hillside They were shackled about with some sort of ivy Cultivated rather than wild Susannah guessed given the barrenness of the surrounding countryside There was one fellow in the west tower sitting in what appeared to be an easy chair maybe even a LaZBoy Standing at the railing of the east one were a taheen with a beavers head and a low man if he was a hume Susannah thought he was one buttugly son of a bitch the two of them in conversation pretty clearly waiting for the horn that would send them offshift and to breakfast in the commissary Between the two watchtowers she could see the triple line of fencing the runs strung widely enough apart so that more sentries could walk in the aisles between the wire without fear of getting a lethal zap of electricity She saw no one there this morning though The few folken moving about inside the wire were idling along none of them in a great hurry to get anywhere Unless the lackadaisical scene before her was the biggest con of the century Roland was right They were as vulnerable as a herd of fat shoats being fed their last meal outside the slaughteringpen comecomecommala shorribs to folia And while the gunslingers had had no luck finding any sort of radiocontrolled weaponry they had discovered diat three of the more sciencefictiony rifles were equipped with switches marked INTERVAL Eddie said he thought diese rifles were lazers although nothing about them looked lazy to Susannah Jake had suggested they take one of them out of sight of the DevarToi and try it out but Roland vetoed the idea immediately Last evening this had been while going over the plan for what seemed like the hundredth time Hes right kid Eddie had said The clowns down there might know we were shooting those things even if they couldnt see or hear anything We dont know what kind of vibes their telemetry can pick up Under cover of dark Susannah had set up all three of the lazers When the time came shed set the interval switches The guns might work thus adding to the impression they were trying to create they might not Shed give it a try when the time came and that was all she could do Heart thumping heavily Susannah waited for the music For the horn And if the sneetches the Rod had set worked the way Roland believed they would work for the fires The ideal would be for all of them to go hot during the five or ten minutes when theyre changing the guard Roland had said Everyone scurrying hither and thither waving to their friends and exchanging little bits o gossip We cant expect thatnot reallybut we can hope for it Yes they could do that much but wish in one hand shit in the other see which one fills up first In any case it would be her decision as to when to fire the first shot After that everything would happen jinjin Please God help me pick the right time She waited holding one of the Coyote machinepistols with the barrel in the hollow of her shoulder When the music starteda recorded version of what she thought might be Ats AmoreSusannah lurched on the seat of the SCT and squeezed the trigger involuntarily Had the safety not been on she would have poured a stream of bullets into the sheds ceiling and no doubt queered the pitch at once But Roland had taught her well and the trigger didnt move beneath her finger Still her heartbeat had doubledtrebled maybeand she could feel sweat trickling down her sides even though the day was once again cool The music had started and that was good But the music wasnt enough She sat on the SCTs saddle waiting for the horn THREE Dino Martino Eddie said almost too low to hear Hmmm Jake asked The three of them were behind the soo LINE boxcar having worked their way through the graveyard of old engines and train cars to that spot Both of the boxcars loading doors were open and all three of them had had a peek through them at the fence the south watchtowers and the village of Pleasantville which consisted of but a single street The sixarmed robot which had earlier been on the Mall was now here rolling up and down Main Street past the quaint and closed shops bellowing what sounded like math equations at the top of its lungs Dino Martino Eddie repeated Oy was sitting at Jakes feet looking up with his brilliant goldringed eyes Eddie bent and gave his head a brief pat Dean Martin did that song originally Yeah Jake asked doubtfully Sure Only we used to sing it Whena da moon hitsa yo lip like a big piecea shit ats amore Hush do ya please Roland murmured Dont suppose you smell any smoke yet do you Eddie asked Jake and Roland shook their heads Roland had his big iron with the sandalwood grips Jake was armed with an AR but the bag of Orizas was once more hung over his shoulder and not just for good luck If all went well he and Roland would be using them soon FOUR Like most men with whats known as househelp Pimli Prentiss had no clear sense of his employees as creatures with goals ambitions and feelingsas humes in other words As long as there was someone to bring him his afternoon glass of whiskey and set his chop rare in front of him at sixthirty he didnt think of them at all Certainly he would have been quite astounded to learn that Tammy his housekeeper and Tassa his houseboy loathed each other They treated each other with perfectif chillyrespect when they were around him after all Only Pimli wasnt around this morning as Ats Amore interpreted by the Billion Bland Strings rose from Algul Sientos hidden speakers The Master was walking up the Mall now in the company of Jakli a ravenhead taheen tech as well as his Security Chief They were discussing the Deep Telemetry and Pimli had no thought at all for the house he had left behind for the last time Certainly it never crossed his mind that Tammy Kelly still in her nightgown and Tassa of Sonesh still in his silk sleepshorts were on the verge of battle about the pantrystock Look at this she cried They were standing in the kitchen which was deeply gloomy It was a large room and all but three of the electric lights were burned out There were only a few bulbs left in Stores and they were earmarked for The Study Look at what Sulky Pouty And was that the remains of lip paint on his cunning little Cupidsbow of a mouth She thought it was Doee not see the empty spots on the shelves she asked indignantly Look No more baked beans He dont care beans for beans as you very well know No tunafish either and willee tell me he dont eat that Hed eat it until it ran out his ears and thee knows it Can you not No more soup Balls there aint he cried Look there and there and thn Not the Campbells Tamater he likes best she overrode him drawing closer in her excitement Their arguments had never developed into outright fisticuffs before but Tassa had an idea this might be the day And if it were so it were fineoh Hed love to sock this fat old runoffatthemouth bitch in the eye Do you see any Campbells Tamater Tassa o whereveryougrew Can you not bring back a box of tins yourself he asked taking his own step forward now they were nearly nosetonose and although the woman was large and the young man was willowy the Masters houseboy showed no sign of fear Tammy blinked and for the first time since Tassa had shuffled into the kitchenwanting no more than a cup of coffee say thanksan expression that was not irritation crossed her face It might have been nervousness it might even have been fear Are you so weak in die arms Tammy of whereverowgrew that you cant carry a box of souptins out of Stores She drew herself up to her full height stung Her jowls greasy and aglow with some sort of nightcream quivered with selfrighteousness Fetching pantry supplies has ever been the houseboysjob And thee knows it very well That dont make it a law that you cant help out I was mowing his lawn yesty as surely you know I spied you sitting akitchen with a glass of cold tea didnt I just as comfortable as old Ellie in your favorite chair She bristled losing any fear she might have had in her outrage I have as much right to rest as anyone else Id just warshed the floor Looked to me like Dobbie was doing it he said Dobbie was the sort of domestic robot known as a houseelf old but still quite efficient Tammy grew hotter still What would you know about house chores you mincy little queer Color flushed Tassas normally pale cheeks He was aware that his hands had rolled themselves into fists but only because he could feel his carefully caredfor nails biting into his palms It occurred to him that this sort of petty bitchandwhistle was downright ludicrous coming as it did with the end of everything stretching blackjust beyond them they were two fools sparring and catcalling on the very lip of the abyss but he didnt care Fat old sow had been sniping at him for years and now here was the real reason Here it was finally naked and out in the open Is that what bothers thee about me sai he enquired sweetly That I kiss the pole instead of plug the hole no more than that Now there were torches instead of roses flaring in Tammy Kellys cheeks Shed not meant to go so far but now that she hadthat they had for if there was to be a fight it was his fault as much as hersshe wouldnt back away Was damned if she would Masters Bible says queerin be a sin she told him righteously Ive read it myself so I have Book of Leviticracks Chapter Three Verse And what do Leviticracks say about the sin of gluttony he enquired What do it say about a woman with tits as big as bolsters and an ass as big as a kitchen ta Never mind the size o my ass you little cocksucker At least I can get a man he said sweetly and dont have to lie abed with a dustclout Dont you dare she cried shrilly Shut your foul mouth before I shut it for you to get rid of the cobwebs in my cunny so I can Ill knock thy teeth out if thee doesnt finger my tired old pokeberry pie Then something which would offend her even more deeply occurred to him My tired dirty old pokeberry pie She balled her own fists which were considerably bigger than his At least Ive never Go no further sai I beg you never had some mans nasty old nasty old She trailed off looking puzzled and sniffed the air He sniffed it himself and realized the aroma he was getting wasnt new Hed been smelling it almost since the argument started but now it was stronger Tammy said Do you smell smoke he finished and they looked at each other with alarm their argument forgotten perhaps only five seconds before it would have come to blows Tammys eyes fixed on the sampler hung beside the stove There were similar ones all over Algul Siento because most of the buildings which made up the compound were wood Old wood WE ALL MUST WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A FIREFREE ENVIRONMENT it Said Somewhere close byin the back hallwayone of the stillworking smoke detectors went off with a loud and frightening bray Tammy hurried into the pantry to grab the fireextinguisher in there Get the one in the library she shouted and Tassa ran to do it without a word of protest Fire was the one thing they all feared FIVE Gaskie OTego the Deputy Security Chief was standing in the foyer of Feveral Hall the dormitory directly behind Damli House talking with James Cagney Cagney was a redhaired cantoi who favored Westernstyle shirts and boots that added three inches to his actual fivefootfive Both had clipboards and were discussing certain necessary changes in the following weeks Damli security Six of the guards whod been assigned to the second shift had come down with what Gangli die compound doctor said was a hume disease called momps Sickness was common enough in Thunderclapit was the air as everyone knew and die poisoned leavings of the old peoplebut it was ever inconvenient Gangli said they were lucky there had never been an actual plague like the Black Death or the Hot Shivers Beyond them on the paved court behind Damli House an earlymorning basketball game was going on several taheen and cantoi guards who would be officially on duty as soon as the horn blew against a ragtag team of Breakers Gaskie watched Joey Rastosovich take a shot from way downtownswish Trampas snared the ball and took it out of bounds briefly lifting his cap to scratch beneath it Gaskie didnt care much for Trampas who had an entirely inappropriate liking for the talented animals who were his charges Closer by sitting on the dorms steps and also watching the game was Ted Brautigan As always he was sipping at a can of NozzALa Well fuggit James Cagney said speaking in the tones of a man who wants to be finished with a boring discussion If you dont mind taking a couple of humies off the fencewalk for a day or two Whats Brautigan doing up so early Gaskie interrupted He almost never rolls out until noon That kid he pals around with is the same way Whats his name Earnshaw Brautigan also palled around with that halfbright Ruiz but Ruiz was no kid Gaskie nodded Aye Earnshaw thats the one Hes on duty this morning I saw him earlier in The Study Cag as his friends called him didnt give a shit why Brautigan was up with the birdies not that there were many birdies left at least in Thunderclap he only wanted to get this roster business settled so he could stroll across to Damli and get a plate of scrambled eggs One of the Rods had found fresh chives somewhere or so hed heard and Doee smell something Cag Gaskie OTego asked suddenly The cantoi who fancied himself James Cagney started to enquire if Gaskie had farted then rethought this humorous riposte For in fact he did smell something Was it smoke Cag thought it was SIX Ted sat on the cold steps of Feveral Hall breathing the badsmelling air and listening to the humes and the taheen trashtalk each other from the basketball court Not the cantoi they refused to indulge in such vulgarity His heart was beating hard but not fast If there was a Rubicon that needed crossing he realized hed crossed it some time ago Maybe on the night the low men had hauled him back from Connecticut more likely on the day hed approached Dinky with the idea of reaching out to the gunslingers that Sheemie Rviiz insisted were nearby Now he was wound up to the max Dinky would have said but nervous No Nerves he thought were for people who still hadnt entirely made up their minds Behind him he heard one idiot Gaskie asking tother idiot Cagney if he smelled something and Ted knew for sure that Haylis had done his part the game was afoot Ted reached into his pocket and brought out a scrap of paper Written on it was a line of perfect pentameter although hardly Shakespearian GO SOUTH WITH YOUR HANDS UP YOU WONT BE HURT He looked at this fixedly preparing to broadcast Behind him in the Feveral rec room a smoke detector went off with a loud donkeybray Here we go here we go he thought and looked north to where he hoped the first shooterthe womanwas hiding SEVEN Threequarters of the way up the Mall toward Damli House Master Prentiss stopped with Finli on one side of him and Jakli on the other The horn still hadnt gone off but there was a loud braying sound from behind them They had no more begun to turn toward it when another bray began from the other end of the compoundthe dormitory end What the devil Pimli began Cis that was how he meant to finish but before he could Tammy Kelly came rushing out through the front door of Wardens House with Tassa his houseboy scampering along right behind her Both of them were waving their arms over their heads Fire Tammy shouted Fire Fire But thats impossible Pimli thought For if thats the smoke detector Fm hearing in my house and also the smoke detector Im hearing from one of the dorms then surely It must be a false alarm he told Finli Those smoke detectors do that when their batteries are Before he could finish this hopeful assessment a side window of Wardens House exploded outward The glass was followed by an exhalation of orange flame Gods Jakli cried in his buzzing voice It wfire Pimli stared with his mouth open And suddenly yet another smokeandfire alarm went off this one in a series of loud hiccuping whoops Good God sweet Jesus that was one of the Damli House alarms Surely nothing could be wrong at Finli OTego grabbed his arm Boss he said calmly enough Weve got real trouble Before Pimli could reply the horn went off signaling the change of shifts And suddenly he realized how vulnerable they would be for the next seven minutes or so Vulnerable to all sorts of things He refused to admit the word attack into his consciousness At least not yet EIGHT Dinky Earnshaw had been sitting in the overstuffed easy chair for what seemed like forever waiting impatiently for the party to begin Usually being in The Study cheered him uphell cheered everybody up it was the goodmind effectbvit today he only felt the wires of tension inside him winding tighter and tighter pulling his guts into a ball He was aware of taheen and cantoi looking down from the balconies every now and again riding the goodmind wave but didnt have to worry about being progged by the likes of them from that at least he was safe Was that a smoke alarm From Feveral perhaps Maybe But maybe not too No one else was looking around Wait he told himself Ted told you this would be the hard part didnt he And at least Sheemies out of the way Sheemies safe in his room and Corbett Halls safe from fire So calm down Relax That was the bray of a smoke alarm Dinky was sure of it Well almost sure A book of crossword puzzles was open in his lap For the last fifty minutes hed been filling one of the grids with nonsenseletters ignoring the definitions completely Now across the top he printed this in large dark block letters GO SOUTH WITH YOUR HANDS UP YOU WONT BE HU That was when one of the upstairs fire alarms probably the one in the west wing went off with a loud warbling bray Several of the Breakers jerked rudely from a deep daze of concentration cried out in surprised alarm Dinky also cried out but in relief Relief and something more Joy Yeah very likely it was joy Because when the fire alarm began to bray hed felt the powerful hum of goodmind snap The eerie combined force of the Breakers had winked out like an overloaded electrical circuit For the moment at least the assault on the Beam had stopped Meanwhile he had a job to do No more waiting He stood up letting the crossword magazine tumble to the Turkish rug and threw his mind at the Breakers in the room It wasnt hard hed been practicing almost daily for this moment with Teds help And if it worked If the Breakers picked it up rebroadcasting it and amping what Dinky could only suggest to the level of a command Why then it would rise It would become the dominant chord in a new goodmind gestalt At least that was the hope ITs A FIRE FOLKS THEREs A FIRE IN THE BUILDING As if to underscore this there was a soft bangandtinkle as something imploded and the first puff of smoke seeped from the ventilator panels Breakers looked around with wide dazed eyes some getting to their feet And Dinky sent DONT WORRY DONT PANIC ALL IS WELL WALK UP THE He sent a perfect practiced image of the north stairway then added Breakers Breakers walking up the north stairway Breakers walking through the kitchen Crackle of fire smell of smoke but both coming from the guards sleeping area in the west wing And would anyone question the truth of this mental broadcast Would anyone wonder who was beaming it out or why Not now Now they were only scared Now they were wanting someone to tell them what to do and Dinky Earnshaw was that someone NORTH STAIRWAY WALK UP THE NORTH STAIRWAY WALK OUT ONTO THE BACK LAWN And it worked They began to walk that way Like sheep following a ram or horses following a stallion Some were picking up the two basic ideas NO PANIC NO PANIC NORTH STAIRWAY NORTH STAIRWAY and rebroadcasting them And even better Dinky heard it from above too From the cantoi and the taheen who had been observing from the balconies No one ran and no one panicked but the exodus up the north stairs had begun NINE Susannah sat astride the SCT in the window of the shed where shed been concealed not worrying about being seen now Smoke detectorsat least three of themwere yowling A fire alarm was whooping even more loudly that one was from Damli House she was quite sure As if in answer a series of loud electronic goosehonks began from the Pleasantville end of the compound This was joined by a multitude of clanging bells With all that happening to their south it was no wonder that the woman north of the DevarToi saw only the backs of the three guards in the ivycovered watchtowers Three didnt seem like many but it was five per cent of the total A start Susannah looked down the barrel of her gun at the one in her sights and prayed God grant me true aim true aim Soon It would be soon TEN Finli grabbed the Masters arm Pimli shook him off and started toward his house again staring unbelievingly at the smoke that was now pouring out of all the windows on the left side Boss Finli shouted renewing his grip Boss never mind that Its the Breakers we have to worry about The Breakers It didnt get through but the shocking warble of the Damli Hovise fire alarm did Pimli turned back in that direction and for a moment he met Jaklis beady litde birds eyes He saw nothing in them but panic which had the perverse but welcome effect of steadying Pimli himself Sirens and buzzers everywhere One of them was a regular pulsing honk hed never heard before Coming from the direction of Pleasantville Come on boss Finli OTego almost pleaded We have to make sure the Breakers are okay Smoke Jakli cried fluttering his dark and utterly useless wings Smoke from Damli House smoke from Feveral too Pimli ignored him He pulled the Peacemaker from the dockers clutch wondering briefly what premonition had caused him to put it on He had no idea but he was glad for the weight of the gun in his hand Behind him Tassa was yelling Tammy was toobut Pimli ignored the pair of them His heart was beating furiously but he was calm again Finli was right The Breakers were the important thing right now Making sure they didnt lose a third of their trained psychics in some sort of electrical fire or halfassed act of sabotage He nodded at his Security Chief and they began to run toward Damli House with Jakli squawking and flapping along behind them like a refugee from a Warner Bros cartoon Somewhere up there Gaskie was hollering And then Pimli o New Jersey heard a sound that chilled him to the bone a rapid chowchowchow sound Gunfire If some clown was shooting at his Breakers that clowns head would finish the day on a high pole by the gods That the guards rather than the Breakers might be under attack had at that point still not crossed his mind nor that of the slighdy wilier Finli either Too much was happening too fast ELEVEN At the south end of the Devar compound the syncopated honking sound was almost loud enough to split eardrums Christ Eddie said and couldnt hear himself In the south watchtowers the guards were turned away from them looking north Eddie couldnt see any smoke yet Perhaps the guards could from their higher vantagepoints Roland grabbed Jakes shoulder then pointed at the soo LINE boxcar Jake nodded and scrambled beneath it with Oy at his heels Roland held both hands out to EddieStay where you areand then followed On the other side of the boxcar the boy and the gunslinger stood up side by side They would have been clearly visible to the sentries had the attention of those worthies not been distracted by the smoke detectors and fire alarms inside the compound Suddenly the entire front of the Pleasantville Hardware Company descended into a slot in the ground A robot fire engine all bright red paint and gleaming chrome came bolting out of the hitherto concealed garage A line of red lights pulsed down the center of its elongated body and an amplified voice bellowed STAND CLEAR THIS IS FIRERESPONSE TEAM BRAVO STAND CLEAR MAKE WAY FOR FIRERESPONSE TEAMBRAVOr There must be no gunfire from this part of the Devar not yet The south end of the compound must seem safe to the increasingly frightened inmates of Algul Siento dont worry folks heres your port in todays unexpected shitstorm The gunslinger dipped a Riza from Jakes dwindling supply and nodded for the boy to take another Roland pointed to the guard in the righthand tower then once more at Jake The boy nodded cocked his arm across his chest and waited for Roland to give him the go TWELVE Once you hear the horn that signals the change of shifts Roland had told Susannah take it to them Do as much damage as you can but dont let them see theyre only facing a single person for your fathers sake As if he needed to tell her that She could have taken the three watchtower guards while the horn was still blaring but something made her wait A few seconds later she was glad she had The rear door of the Queen Anne burst open so violently it tore off its upper hinge Breakers piled out clawing at those ahead of them in their panic these are the wouldbe destroyers of the universe she thought these sheep and among them she saw half a dozen of the freakboys with animal heads and at least four of those creepy humanoids with the masks on Susannah took the guard in the west tower first and had shifted her aim to the pair in the east tower before the first casualty in the Batde of Algul Siento had fallen over the railing and tumbled to the ground with his brains dribbling out of his hair and down his cheeks The Coyote machinepistol switched to the middle setting fired in lowpitched bursts of three Chow Chow Chow The taheen and the low man in the east tower spun widdershins to each other like figures in a dance The taheen crumpled on the catwalk that skirted the top of the watchtower the low man was driven into the rail flipped over it with his bootheels in the sky then plummeted headfirst to the ground She heard the crack his neck made when it broke A couple of the milling Breakers spotted this unfortunate fellows descent and screamed Put up your hands That was Dinky she recognized his voice Put up your hands if youre a Breaker No one questioned the idea in these circumstances anyone who sounded like he knew what was going on was in unquestioned charge Some of the Breakersbut not all not yetput their hands up It made no difference to Susannah She didnt need raised hands to tell the difference between the sheep and the goats A kind of haunted clarity had fallen over her vision She flicked the firecontrol switch from BURST to SINGLE SHOT and began to pick off the guards whod come up from The Study with the Breakers Taheen cantoi get him a hume but dont shoot her shes a Breaker even though she doesnt have her hands up dont ask me how I know but I do Susannah squeezed the Coyotes trigger and the head of the hume next to the woman in the bright red slacks exploded in a mist of blood and bone The Breakers screamed like children staring around with their eyes bulging and their hands up And now Susannah heard Dinky again only this time not his physical voice It was his mental voice she heard and it was much louder GO SOUTH WITH YOUR HANDS UP YOU WONT BE HURT Which was her cue to break cover and start moving Shed gotten eight of the Crimson Kings bad boys counting the three in the towersnot that it was mvich of an accomplishment given their panicand she saw no more at least for the time being Susannah twisted the handthrottle and scooted the SCT toward one of the other abandoned sheds The gadgets pickup was so lively that she almost tumbled off the bicyclestyle seat Trying not to laugh and laughing anyway she shouted at the top of her lungs in her best Detta Walker vulturescreech Git outta here muthafuckahs Git south Hands up so we knoiu youfum the bad boys Everyone doan have their hands up goan get a bullet in the haid Yall trus me on itn In through the door of the next shed scraping a balloon tire of the SCT on the jamb but not quite hard enough to tip it over Praise God for she never would have had enough strength to right it on her own In here one of the lazers was set on a snapdown tripod She pushed the toggleswitch marked ON and was wondering if she needed to do something else with the INTERVAL switch when the weapons muzzle emitted a blinding stream of reddishpurple light that arrowed into the compound above the triple run offence and made a hole in the top story of Damli House To Susannah it looked as big as a hole made by a pointblank artillery shell This is good she thought I gotta get the other ones going But she wondered if there would be time Already other Breakers were picking up on Dinkys suggestion rebroadcasting it and boosting it in the process GO SOUTH HANDS UP WONT BE HURT She flicked the Coyotes fireswitch to FULL AUTO and raked it across the upper level of the nearest dorm to emphasize the point Bullets whined and ricocheted Glass broke Breakers screamed and began to stampede around the side of Damli House with their hands up Susannah saw Ted come around the same side He was hard to miss because he was going against the current He and Dinky embraced briefly then raised their hands and joined the southward flow of Breakers who would soon lose their status as VTPs and become just one more bunch of refugees struggling to survive in a dark and poisoned land Shed gotten eight but it wasnt enough The hunger was upon her that dry hunger Her eyes saw everything They pulsed and ached in her head and they saw everything She hoped that other taheen low men or hume guards would come around the side of Damli House She wanted more THIRTEEN Sheemie Ruiz lived in Corbett Hall which happened to be the dormitory Susannah all unknowing had raked with at least a hundred bullets Had he been on his bed he almost certainly would have been killed Instead he was on his knees at the foot of it praying for the safety of his friends He didnt even look up when the window blew in but simply redoubled his supplications He could hear Dinkys thoughts GO SOUTH pounding in his head then heard other thoughtstreams join it WITH YOUR HANDS UP making a river And then Teds voice was there not just joining the others but amping them up turning what had been a river YOU WONT BE HURT into an ocean Without realizing it Sheemie changed his prayer Our Father and Pteck my pals became go south with your hands up you wont be hurt He didnt even stop this when the propane tanks behind the Damli House cafeteria blew up with a shattering roar FOURTEEN Gangli Tristum thats Doctor Gangli to you say thankya was in many ways the most feared man in Damli House He was a cantoi who hadperverselytaken a taheen name instead of a human one and he ran the infirmary on the third floor of the west wing with an iron fist And on roller skates Things on the ward were fairly relaxed when Gangli was in his office doing paperwork or off on his rounds which usually meant visiting Breakers with the sniffles in their dorms but when he came out the whole placenurses and orderlies as well as patientsfell respectfully and nervously silent A newcomer might laugh the first time he saw the squat darkcomplected heavilyjowled manthing gliding slowly down the center aisle between the beds arms folded over the stethoscope which lay on his chest the tails of his white coat wafting out behind him one Breaker had once commented He looks like John Irving after a bad facelift Such a one who was caught laughing would never laugh again however Dr Gangli had a sharp tongue indeed and no one made fun of his roller skates with impunity Now instead of gliding on them he went flying up and down the aisles the steel wheels for his skating gear far predated rollerblades rumbling on the hardwood All the papers he shouted Do you hear me If I lose one file in this fucking mess one godsdamned file Ill have someones eyes with my afternoon tea The patients were already gone of course hed had them out of their beds and down the stairs at the first bray of the smoke detector at the first whiff of smoke A number of orderliesgutless wonders and he knew who each of them was oh yes and a complete report would be made when the time camehad fled with the sickfolk but five had stayed including his personal assistant Jack London Gangli was proud of them although one could not have told it from his hectoring voice as he skated up and down up and down in the thickening smoke Get the papers dye hear You better by all the gods that ever walked or crawled You better A red glare shot in through the window Some sort of weapon for it blew in the glass wall that separated his office from the ward and set his favorite easychair asmolder Gangli ducked and skated under the laser beam never slowing Ganadamn cried one of the orderlies He was a hume extraordinarily ugly his eyes bulging from his pale face What in the hell was th Never mind Gangli bawled Never mind what it was you pissface clown Get the papers Get my motherfucking papers From somewhere in frontthe Mallcame the hideous approaching clangandyowl of some rescue vehicle STAND CLEAR Gangli heard THIS IS FIRERESPONSE TEAM BRAVO Gangli had never heard of such a thing as FireResponse Team Bravo but there was so much they didnt know about this place Why he could barely use a third of the equipment in his own surgical suite Never mind the thing that mattered right now Before he could finish his thought the gaspods behind the kitchen blew up There was a tremendous roarseemingly from directly beneath themand Gangli Tristum was thrown into the air the metal wheels on his roller skates spinning The others were thrown as well and suddenly the smoky air was full of flying papers Looking at them knowing that the papers would burn and he would be lucky not to burn with them a clear thought came to Dr Gangli the end had come early FIFTEEN Roland heard the telepathic command GO SOUTH WITH YOUR HANDS UP YOU WONT BE begin to beat in his mind It was time He nodded at Jake and the Orizas flew Their eerie whistling wasnt loud in the general cacophony yet one of the guards must have heard something coming because he was beginning to pivot when the plates sharpened edge took his head off and tumbled it backward into the compound the eyelashes fluttering in bewildered surprise The headless body took two steps and then collapsed with its arms over the rail blood pouring from the neck in a gaudy stream The other guard was already down Eddie rolled effortlessly beneath the soo LINE boxcar and bounced to his feet on the compound side Two more automated fire engines had come bolting out of the station hitherto hidden by the hardware store facade They were wheelless seeming to run on cushions of compressed air Somewhere toward the north end of the campus for so Eddies mind persisted in identifying the DevarToi something exploded Good Lovely Roland and Jake took fresh plates from the dwindling supply and used them to cut through the three runs of fence The highvoltage one parted with a bitter sizzling crack and a brief blink of blue fire Then they were in Moving quickly and without speaking they ran past the nowunguarded towers with Oy trailing closely at Jakes heels Here was an alley running between Henry Grahams Drug Store amp Soda Fountain and the Pleasantville Book Store At the head of the alley they looked out and saw that Main Street was currently empty although a tangy electric smell a subwaystation smell Eddie thought from the last two fire engines still hung in the air making the overall stench even worse In the distance firesirens whooped and smoke detectors brayed Here in Pleasantville Eddie couldnt help but think of the Main Street in Disneyland no litter in the gutters no rude graffiti on the walls not even any dust on the plateglass windows This was where homesick Breakers came when they needed a little whiff of America he supposed but didnt any of them want anything better anything more realistic than this plasticfantastic still life Maybe it looked more inviting with folks on the sidewalks and in the stores but that was hard to believe Hard for him to believe at least Maybe it was only a city boys chauvinism Across from them were Pleasantville Shoes Gay Paree Fashions Hair Today and the Gem Theater COME IN ITS KOOL INSIDE said the banner hanging from the bottom of the marquee Roland raised a hand motioning Eddie and Jake across to that side of the street It was there if all went as he hoped it almost never did that they would set their ambush They crossed in a crouch Oy still scurrying at Jakes heel So far everything seemed to be working like a charm and that made the gunslinger nervous indeed SIXTEEN Any battleseasoned general will tell you that even in a smallscale engagement as this one was there always comes a point where coherence breaks down and narrative flow and any real sense of how things are going These matters are recreated by historians later on The need to recreate the myth of coherence may be one of the reasons why history exists in the first place Never mind We have reached that point the one where the Battle of Algul Siento took on a life of its own and all I can do now is point here and there and hope you can bring your own order out of the general chaos SEVENTEEN Trampas the eczemaplagued low man who inadvertently let Ted in on so much rushed to the stream of Breakers who were fleeing from Damli House and grabbed one a scrawny excarpenter with a receding hairline named Birdie McCann Birdie what is it Trampas shouted He was currently wearing his thinkingcap which meant he could not share in the telepathic pulse all around him Whats happening do you kn Shooting Birdie yelled pulling free Shooting Theyre out there He pointed vaguely behind him Who How m Watch out you idiots its not slowing dozun yelled Gaskie OTego from somewhere behind Trampas arid McCann Trampas looked up and was horrified to see the lead fire engine come roaring and swaying along the center of the Mall red lights flashing two stainlesssteel robot firemen now clinging to the back Pimli Finli and Jakli leaped aside So did Tassa the houseboy But Tammy Kelly lay facedown on the grass in a spreading soup of blood She had been flattened by FireResponse Team Bravo which had not actually scrambled to fight a fire in over eight hundred years Her complaining days were over And STAND CLEAR blared the fire engine Behind it two more engines swerved gaudily around either side of Wardens House Once again Tassa the houseboy barely leaped in time to save his skin THIS IS FIRERESPONSE TEAM BRAVO Some sort of metallic node rose from the center of the engine split open and produced a steel whirligig that began to spray highpressure streams of water in eight different directions MAKE WAY FOR FIRERESPONSE TEAM BRAVO And James Cagneythe taheen who was standing with Gaskie in the foyer of the Feveral Hall dormitory when the trouble started remember himsaw what was going to happen and began yelling at the guards who were staggering out of Damlis west wing redeyed and coughing some with their pants on fire a fewoh praise Gan and Bessa and all the godswith weapons Cag screamed at them to get out of the way and could hardly hear himself in the cacophony He saw Joey Rastosovich pull two of them aside and watched the Earnshaw kid bump aside another A few of the coughing weeping escapees saw the oncoming fire engine and scattered on their own Then Fire Response Team Bravo was plowing through the guards from the west wing not slowing roaring straight for Damli House spraying water to every point of the compass And Dear Christ no Pimli Prentiss moaned He clapped his hands over his eyes Finli on the other hand was helpless to look away He saw a low manBen Alexander he was quite surechewed beneath the firetrucks huge wheels He saw another struck by the grille and mashed against the side of Damli House as the engine crashed spraying boards and glass then breaking through a bulkhead which had been partially concealed by a bed of sickly flowers One wheel dropped down into the cellar stairwell and a robot voice began to boom ACCIDENT NOTIFY THE STATION ACCIDENT No shit Sherlock Finli thought looking at the blood on the grass with a kind of sick wonder How many of his men and his valuable charges had the goddamned malfunctioning firetruck mowed down Six Eight A motherfucking dozen From behind Damli House came that terrifying chowchowchow sound once again the sound of automatic weapons fire A fat Breaker named Waverlyjostled him Finli snared him before Waverly could fly on by What happened Who told you to go south For Finli unlike Trampas wasnt wearing any sort of thinkingcap and the message GO SOUTH WITH YOUR HANDS UP YOU WONT BE HURT was slamming into his head so hard and loud it was nearly impossible to think of anything else Beside him Pimlistruggling to gather his witsseized on the beating thought and managed one of his own Thats almost got to be Brautigan grabbing an idea and amplifying it that way Who else could And Gaskie grabbed first Cag and then Jakli and shouted at them to gather up all the armed guards and put them to work flanking the Breakers who were hurrying south on the Mall and the streets that flanked the Mall They looked at him with blank starey eyespaniceyesand he could have screamed with balked fury And here came the next two engines with their sirens whooping The larger of the pair struck two of the Breakers bearing them to the ground and running them over One of these new casualties was Joey Rastosovich When the engine had passed beating at the grass with its compressedair vents Tanya fell on her knees beside her dying husband raising her hands to the sky She was screaming at the top of her lungs but Gaskie could barely hear her Tears of frustration and fear prickled the corners of his eyes Dirty dogs he thought Dirty ambushing dogs And North of the Algul compound Susannah broke cover moving in on the triple run offence This wasnt in die plan but the need to keep shooting to keep knocking them down was stronger than ever She simply couldnt help herself and Roland would have understood Besides the billowing smoke from Damli House had momentarily obscured everything at this end of the compound Red beams from the lazers stabbed into iton and off on and off like some sort of neon signand Susannah reminded herself not to get in the way of them not unless she wanted a hole two inches across all the way through her She used bullets from the Coyote to cut her end of the fenceouter run middle run inner runand then vanished into the thickening smoke reloading as she went And The Breaker named Waverly tried to pull free of Finli Nar nar none of that may it please ya Finli thought He yanked the manwhod been a bookkeeper or some such thing in his pre Algul lifecloser to him then slapped him twice across the face hard enough to make his hand hurt Waverly screamed in pain and surprise Who the fuck is back there Finli roared WHO THE FUCK IS DOING THIS The followup fire engines had halted in front of Damli House and were pouring streams of water into the smoke Finli didnt know if it could help but probably it couldnt hurt And at least the damned things hadnt crashed into the building they were supposed to save like the first one Sir I dont knozv Waverly sobbed Blood was streaming from one of his nostrils and the corner of his mouth I dont know but there has to be fifty maybe a hundred of the devils Dinky got us out God bless Dinky Earnshaw Gaskie OTego meanwhile wrapped one goodsized hand around James Cagneys neck and the other around Jaklis Gaskie had an idea son of a bitching crowheadjakli had been on the verge of running but there was no time to worry about that now He needed them both And Boss Finli shouted Boss grab the Earnshaw kid Something about this smells And With Cags face pressing against one of his cheeks and Jaklis against the other the Wease who thought as clearly as anyone that terrible morning was finally able to make himself heard Gaskie meanwhile repeated his command divide up the armed guards and put them with the retreating Breakers Dont try to stop them but stay with them And for Christs sake keep em from getting electrocuted Keep em off the fence if they go past Main Stree Before he could finish this admonishment a figure came plummeting out of the thickening smoke It was Gangli the compound doctor his white coat on fire his roller skates still on his feet And Susannah Dean took up a position at the left rear corner of Damli House coughing She saw three of die sons of bitches Gaskie Jakli and Cagney had she but known it Before she could draw a bead eddying smoke blotted them out When it cleared Jakli and Cag were gone rounding up armed guards to act as sheepdogs who would at least try to protect their panicked charges even if they could not immediately stop them Gaskie was still there and Susannah took him with a single headshot Pimli didnt see it It was becoming clear to him that all the confusion was on the surface Quite likely deliberate The Breakers decision to move away from the attackers north of the Algul had come a little too quickly and was a litde too organized Never mind Earnshaw he thought Brautigans the one I want to talk to But before he could catch up to Ted Tassa grabbed the Master in a frantic terrified hug babbling that Wardens House was on fire he was afraid terribly afraid that all of Masters clothes his books Pimli Prentiss knocked him aside with a hammerblow to the side of his head The pulse of the Breakers unified thought badmind now instead of goodmind yammered WITH YOUR HANDS UP YOU WONT BE crazily in his head threatening to drive out all thought Fucking Brautigan had done this he knew it and the man was too far ahead unless Pimli looked at the Peacemaker in his hand considered it then jammed it back into the dockers clutch under his left arm He wanted fucking Bravitigan alive Fucking Brautigan had some explaining to do Not to mention some more goddamned breaking Choiochowchow Bullets flicking all around him Running hume guards taheen and cantoi all around him And Christ only a few of them were armed mosdy humes whod been down for fencepatrol Those who guarded the Breakers didnt really need guns by and large the Breakers were as tame as parakeets and the thought of an outside attack had seemed ludicrous until Until it happened he thought and spied Trampas Trampas he bawled Trampas Hey cowboy Grab Earnshaw and bring him to me Grab Earnshaw Here in the middle of the Mall it was a litde less noisy and Trampas heard sai Prentiss quite clearly He sprinted after Dinky and grabbed the young man by one arm And Elevenyearold Daneeka Rostov came out of the rolling smoke that now entirely obscured the lower half of Damli House pulling two red wagons behind her Daneekas face was red and swollen tears were streaming from her eyes she was bent over almost double with the effort it was taking her to keep pulling Baj who sat in one Radio Flyer wagon and Sej who sat in the other Both had the huge heads and tiny wise eyes of hydrocephalic savants but Sej was equipped with waving stubs of arms while Baj had none Both were now foaming at the mouth and making hoarse gagging sounds Help me Dani managed coughing harder than ever Help me someone before they choke Dinky saw her and started in that direction Trampas restrained him although it was clear his heart wasnt in it No Dink he said His tone was apologetic but firm Let someone else do it Boss wants to talk to Then Brautigan was there again face pale mouth a single stitched line in his lower face Let him go Trampas I like you dog but you dont want to get in our business today Ted What Dink started toward Dani again Trampas pulled him back again Beyond them Baj fainted and tumbled headfirst from his wagon Although he landed on the soft grass his head made a dreadful rotten splitting sound and Dani Rostov shrieked Dinky lunged for her Trampas yanked him back once more and hard At the same time he pulled the Colt Woodsman he was wearing in his own dockers clutch There was no more time to reason with him Ted Brautigan hadnt thrown the mindspear since using it against the walletthief in Akron back in hadnt even used it when the low men took him prisoner again in the Bridgeport Connecticut of  although hed been sorely tempted He had promised himself hed never use it again and he certainly didnt want to throw it at smile when you say that Trampas who had always treated him decently But he had to get to the south end of the compound before order was restored and he meant to have Dinky with him when he arrived Also he was furious Poor little Baj who always had a smile for anyone and everyone He concentrated and felt a sick pain rip through his head The mindspear flew Trampas let go of Dinky and gave Ted a look of unbelieving reproach that Ted would remember to the end of his life Then Trampas grabbed the sides of his head like a man with the worst Excedrin Headache in the universe and fell dead on the grass with his throat swollen and his tongue sticking out of his mouth Come on Ted cried and grabbed Dinkys arm Prentiss was looking away for the time being thank God distracted by another explosion ButDaniandSej She can get Sej Sending the rest of it mentally now that she doesnt have to pull Baj too Ted and Dinky fled while behind them Pimli Prentiss turned looked unbelievingly at Trampas and bawled for them to stopto stop in the name of the Crimson King Finli OTego unlimbered his own gun but before he could fire Daneeka Rostov was on him biting and scratching She weighed almost nothing but for a moment he was so surprised to be attacked from this unexpected quarter that she almost bowled him over He curled a strong furry arm around her neck and threw her aside but by then Ted and Dinky were almost out of range cutting to the left side of Wardens House and disappearing into the smoke Finli steadied his pistol in both hands took in a breath held it and squeezed off a single shot Blood flew from the old mans arm Finli heard him cry out and saw him swerve Then the young pup grabbed the old cur and they cut around the corner of the house Im coming for you Finli bellowed after them Yar I am and when I catch you Ill make you wish you were never born But the threat felt horribly empty somehow Now the entire population of Algul SientoBreakers taheen hurae guards cantoi with bloody red spots glaring on their foreheads like third eyeswas in tidal motion flowing south And Finli saw something he really did not like at all the Breakers and only the Breakers were moving that way with their arms raised If there were more harriers down there theyd have no trouble at all telling which ones to shoot would they And In his room on the third floor of Corbett Hall still on his knees at the foot of his glasscovered bed coughing on the smoke rfiat was drifting in through his broken window Sheemie Ruiz had his revelation or was spoken to by his imagination take your pick In either case he leaped to his feet His eyes normally friendly but always puzzled by a world he could not quite understand were clear and full of joy BEAM SAYS THANKYA he cried to the empty room He looked around as happy as Ebenezer Scrooge discovering that the spirits have done it all in one night and ran for the door with his slippers crunching on the broken glass One sharp spear of glass pierced his footcarrying his death on its tip had he but known it say sorry say Discordiabut in his joy he didnt even feel it He dashed into the hall and then down the stairs On the second floor landing Sheemie came upon an elderly female Breaker named Belle ORourke grabbed her shook her BEAM SAYS THANKYA he hollered into her dazed and uncomprehending face BEAM SAYS ALL MAY YET BE WELL NOT TOO LATE JUST IN TIME He rushed on to spread the glad news glad to him anyway and On Main Street Roland looked first at Eddie Dean then at Jake Chambers Theyre coming and this is where we have to take them Wait for my command then stand and be true EIGHTEEN First to appear were three Breakers running full out with their arms raised They crossed Main Street that way never seeing Eddie who was in the boxoffice of the Gem hed knocked out the glass on all three sides with the sandalwood grip of the gun which had once been Rolands or Jake sitting inside an engineless Ford sedan parked in front of the Pleasantville Bake Shoppe or Roland himself behind a mannequin in the window of Gay Paree Fashions They reached the other sidewalk and looked around bewildered Go Roland thought at them Go on and get out of here take the alley get away while you can Come on one of them shouted and they ran down the alley between the drug store and the bookshop Another appeared then two more then the first of the guards a hume with a pistol raised to the side of his frightened wideeyed face Roland sighted him and then held his fire More of the Devar personnel began to appear running into Main Street from between the buildings They spread themselves wide apart As Roland had hoped and expected they were trying to flank their charges and channel them Trying to keep the retreat from turning into a rout Form two lines a taheen with a ravens head was shouting in a buzzing outofbreath voice Form two lines and keep em between for your fathers sakes One of the others a redheaded taheen with his shirttail out yelled What about the fence Jakli What if they run on the fence Cant do nothing about that Cag just A shrieking Breaker tried to run past the raven before he could finish and the ravenJakligave him such a mighty push that the poor fellow went sprawling in the middle of the street Stay together you maggots he snarled Run if ee will but keep some fucking order about it As if there could be any order in this Roland thought and not without satisfaction Then to the redhead the one called Jakli shouted Let one or two of em frythe restll see and stop It would complicate things if either Eddie or Jake started shooting at this point but neither did The three gunslingers watched from their places of concealment as a species of order rose from the chaos More guards appeared Jakli and the redhead directed them into the two lines which was now a corridor running from one side of the street to the other A few Breakers got past them before the corridor was fully formed but only a few A new taheen appeared this one with the head of a weasel and took over for the one called Jakli He pounded a couple of running Breakers on the back actually hurrying them up From south of Main Street came a bewildered shout Fence is cut And then another I think the guards are dead This latter cry was followed by a howl of horror and Roland knew as surely as if he had seen it that some unlucky Breaker had just come upon a severed watchmans head in the grass The terrified babble on the heels of this hadnt run itself out when Dinky Earnshaw and Ted Brautigan appeared from between the bakery and the shoe store so close to Jakes hiding place that he could have reached out the window of his car and touched them Ted had been winged His right shirtsleeve had turned red from the elbow down but he was movingwith a little help from Dinky who had an arm around him Ted turned as the two of them ran through the gauntlet of guards and looked directly at Rolands hiding place for a moment Then he and Earnshaw entered the alley and were gone That made them safe at least for the time being and that was good But where was the big bug Where was Prentiss the man in charge of this hateful place Roland wanted him and yon Weaselhead taheen sai bothcut off the snakes head and the snake dies But they couldnt afford to wait much longer The stream of fleeing Breakers was drying up The gunslinger didnt think sai Weasel would wait for the last stragglers hed want to keep his precious charges from escaping through the cut fence Hed know they wouldnt go far given the sterile and gloomy countryside all around but hed also know that if there were attackers at the north end of the compound there might be rescuers standing by at the And there he was thank the gods and Gansai Pimli Prentiss staggering and winded and clearly in a state of shock with a loaded dockers clutch swinging back and forth under his meaty arm Blood was coming from one nostril and the corner of one eye as if all this excitement had caused something to rupture inside of his head He went to the Weasel weaving slightly from side to sideit was this drunken weave that Roland would later blame in his bitter heart for the final outcome of that mornings workprobably meaning to take command of the operation Their short but fervent embrace both giving comfort and taking it told Roland all he needed to know about the closeness of their relationship He leveled his gun on the back of Prentisss head pulled the trigger and watched as blood and hair flew Master Prentisss hands shot out the fingers spread against the dark sky and he collapsed almost at the stunned Weasels feet As if in response to this the atomic sun came on flooding the world with light Hile you gunslingers kill them all Roland cried fanning the trigger of his revolver that ancient murdermachine with the flat of his right hand Four had fallen to his fire before the guards lined up like so many clay ducks in a shooting gallery had registered the sound of the gunshots let alone had time to react For Gilead for New York for the Beam for your fathers Hear me hear me Leave not one of them standing KILL THEM ALL And so they did the gunslinger out of Gilead the former drug addict out of Brooklyn the lonely child who had once been known to Mrs Greta Shaw as Bama Coming south from behind them rolling through thickening banners of smoke on the SCT diverting from a straight course only once to swerve around the flattened body of another housekeeper this one named Tammy was a fourth she who had once been instructed in the ways of nonviolent protest by young and earnest men from the Ndouble ACP and who had now embraced fully and with no regrets the way of the gun Susannah picked off three laggard humie guards and one fleeing taheen The taheen had a rifle slung over one shoulder but never tried for it Instead he raised his sleek furcovered armshis head was vaguely bearishand cried for quarter and parole Mindful of all that had gone on here not in the least how the pureed brains of children had been fed to the Beamkillers in order to keep them operating at top efficiency Susannah gave him neither although neither did she give him cause to suffer or time to fear his fate By the time she rolled down the alley between the movie theater and die hair salon the shooting had stopped Finli and Jakli were dying James Cagney was dead with his hume mask torn halfoff his repulsive rats head lying with these were another three dozen just as dead The formerly immaculate gutters of Pleasantville ran with their blood There were undoubtedly other guards about the compound but by now theyd be in hiding positive diat they had been set upon by a hundred or more seasoned fighters landpirates from God only knew where The majority of Algul Sientos Breakers were in the grassy area between the rear of Main Street and die south watchtowers huddled like the sheep they were Ted unmindful of his bleeding arm had already begun taking attendance Then the entire northern contingent of the harrier army appeared at the head of the alley next to the movieshow one shorleg black lady mounted on an ATV She was steering with one hand and holding the Coyote machinepistol steady on the handlebars with die other She saw the bodies heaped in the street and nodded with joyless satisfaction Eddie came out of the boxoffice and embraced her Hey sugarman hey she murmured fluttering kisses along the side of his neck in a way that made him shiver Then Jake was therepale from the killing but composedand she slung an arm around his shoulders and pulled him close Her eyes happened on Roland standing on die sidewalk behind the three he had drawn to MidWorld His gun dangled beside his left thigh and could he feel the expression of longing on his face Did he even know it was there She doubted it and her heart went out to him Come here Gilead she said This is a group hug and youre part of the group For a moment she didnt think he understood the invitation or was pretending not to understand Then he came pausing to reholster his gun and to pick up Oy He moved in between Jake and Eddie Oyjumped into Susannahs lap as though it were the most natural thing in the world Then the gunslinger put one arm around Eddies waist and the other around Jakes Susannah reached up the bumbler scrabbling comically for purchase on her suddenly tilting lap put her arms around Rolands neck and put a hearty smack on his sunburned forehead Jake and Eddie laughed Roland joined them smiling as we do when we have been surprised by happiness Id have you see them like this Id have you see them very well Will you They are clustered around Suzies Cruisin Trike embracing in the aftermath of their victory Id have you see them this way not because they have won a great battlethey know better than that every one of thembut because now they are katet for the last time The story of their fellowship ends here on this makebelieve street and beneath this artificial sun the rest of the tale will be short and brutal compared to all thats gone before Because when katet breaks the end always comes quickly Say sorry NINETEEN Pimli Prentiss watched through bloodcrusted dying eyes as the younger of the two men broke from the group embrace and approached Finli OTego The young man saw that Finli was still stirring and dropped to one knee beside him The woman now dismounted from her motorized tricycle and the boy began to check the rest of their victims and dispatch the few who still lived Even as he lay dying with a bullet in his own head Pimli understood this as mercy rather than cruelty And when the j ob was done Pimli supposed theyd meet with the rest of their cowardly sneaking friends and search those buildings of the Algul that were not yet on fire looking for the remaining guards and no doubt shooting out of hand those they discovered You wontfind many my yellowback friends he thought You ve wiped out twothirds of my men right here And how many of the attackers had Master Pimli Security Chief Finli and their men taken in return So far as Pimli knew not a single one But perhaps he could do something about that His right hand began its slow and painful journey up toward the dockers clutch and the Peacemaker holstered there Eddie meanwhile had put the barrel of the Gilead revolver with the sandalwood grips against the side of Weaselboys head His finger was tightening on the trigger when he saw that Weaselboy although shot in the chest bleeding heavily and clearly dying fast was looking at him with complete awareness And something else something Eddie did not much care for He thought it was contempt He looked up saw Susannah and Jake checking bodies at the eastern end of the killzone saw Roland on the far sidewalk speaking with Dinky and Ted as he knotted a makeshift bandage around the latters arm The two former Breakers were listening carefully and although both of them looked dubious they were nodding their heads Eddie returned his attention to the dying taheen Youre at the end of the path my friend he said Plugged in the pump it looks like to me Do you have something you want to say before you step into the clearing Finli nodded Say it then chum But Id keep it short if you want to get it all out Thee and thine are a pack of yellowback dogs Finli managed He probably was shot in the heartso it felt anywaybut he would say this it needed to be said and he willed his damaged heart to beat until it was out Then hed die and welcome the dark Pissstinking yellowback dogs killing men from ambush Thats what Id say Eddie smiled humorlessly And what about yellowback dogs whod use children to kill the whole world from ambush my friend The whole universe The Weasel blinked at that as if hed expected no such reply Perhaps any reply at all I had my orders I have no doubt of that Eddie said And followed them to the end Enjoy hell or Naar or whatever you call it He put the barrel of his gun against Finlis temple and pulled the trigger The Wease jerked a single time and was still Grimacing Eddie got to his feet He caught movement from the corner of his eye as he did so and saw anotfier onethe boss of the showhad struggled up onto one elbow His gun the Peacemaker that had once executed a rapist was leveled Eddies reflexes were quick but there was no time to use them The Peacemaker roared a single time fire licking from the end of its barrel and blood flew from Eddie Deans brow A lock of hair flipped on the back of his head as the slug exited He slapped his hand to the hole that had appeared over his right eye like a man who has remembered something of vital importance just a little too late Roland whirled on the rundown heels of his boots pulling his own gun in a dip too quick to see Jake and Susannah also turned Susannah saw her husband standing in the street with the heel of his hand pressed to his brow Eddie Sugar Pimli was struggling to cock the Peacemaker again his upper lip curled back from his teeth in a doglike snarl of effort Roland shot him in the throat and Algul Sientos Master snaprolled to his left the stilluncocked pistol flying out of his hand and clattering to a stop beside the body of his friend the Weasel It finished almost at Eddies feet Eddie Susannah screamed and began a loping crawl toward him thrusting herself on her hands Hes not hurt bad she told herself not hurt bad dear God dont let my man be hurt bad Then she saw the blood running from beneath his pressing hand pattering down into the street and knew it was bad Suze he asked His voice was perfectly clear Suzie where are you I cant see He took one step a second a third and then fell facedown in the street just as Granpere Jaffords had known he would aye from the first moment hed laid eyes on him For the boy was a gunslinger say true and it was the only end that one such as he could expect ONE That night found Jake Chambers sitting disconsolately outside the Clover Tavern at the east end of Main Street in Pleasantville The bodies of the guards had been carted away by a robot maintenance crew and that was at least something of a relief Oy had been in the boys lap for an hour or more Ordinarily he would never have stayed so close for so long but he seemed to understand that Jake needed him On several occasions Jake wept into the bumblers fur For most of that endless day Jake found himself thinking in two different voices This had happened to him before but not for years not since the time when as a very young child he suspected he might have suffered some sort of weird belowtheparental radar breakdown Eddies dying said the first voice the one that used to assure him there were monsters in his closet and soon they would emerge to eat him alive Hes in a room in Corbett Hall and Susannahs with him and he wont shut up but hes dying No denied the second voice the one that used to assure himfeeblythat there were no such things as monsters No that cant be Eddies Eddie And besides hes katet He might die when we reach the Dark Tower we might all die when we get there but not now not here thats crazy Eddies dying replied the first voice It was implacable Hes got a hole in his head almost big enough to stick your fist in and hes dying To this the second voice could offer only more denials each weaker than the last Not even the knowledge that they had likely saved the Beam Sheemie certainly seemed to think they had hed crisscrossed the weirdly silent campus of the DevarToi shouting the news BEAM SAYS ALL MAYBE WELL BEAM SAYS THANKYAat the top of his lungs could make Jake feel better The loss of Eddie was too great a price to pay even for such an outcome And the breaking of the tet was an even greater price Every time Jake thought of it he felt sick to his stomach and sent up inarticulate prayers to God to Gan to the Man Jesus to any or all of them to do a miracle and save Eddies life He even prayed to the writer Save my friends life and zvell save yours he prayed to Stephen King a man he had never seen Save Eddie and we wont let that van hit you I swear it Then again hed think of Susannah screaming Eddies name of trying to turn him over and Roland wrapping his arms around her and saying You mustnt do that Susannah you mustnt disturb him and how shed fought him her face crazy her face changing as different personalities seemed to inhabit it for a moment or two and then flee I have to help himshed sob in the Susannahvoice Jake knew and then in another harsher voice shed shout Let me go mahfah Let me do mah voodoo on him make mah houngun he goan git up an walk you see Sho And Roland holding her through all of it holding her and rocking her while Eddie lay in the street but not dead it would have been better almost if hed been dead even if being dead meant the end of talking about miracles the end of hope but Jake could see his dusty fingers twitching and could hear him muttering incoherently like a man who talks in his sleep Then Ted had come and Dinkyjust behind him and two or three of the other Breakers trailing along hesitantly behind them Ted had gotten on his knees beside the struggling screaming woman and motioned for Dinky to get kneebound on the other side of her Ted had taken one of her hands then nodded for Dink to take the other And something had flowed out of themsomething deep and soothing It wasnt meant for Jake no not at all but he caught some of it anyway and felt his wildly galloping heart slow He looked into Ted Brautigans face and saw that Teds eyes were doing their trick the pupils swelling and shrinking swelling and shrinking Susannahs cries faltered subsiding to little hurt groans She looked down at Eddie and when she bent her head her eyes had spilled tears onto the back of Eddies shirt making dark places like raindrops That was when Sheemie appeared from one of the alleys shouting glad hosannahs to all who would hear him BEAM SAYS NOT TOO LATE BEAM SAYS JUST IN TIME BEAM SAYS THANKYA AND WE MUST LET HIM HEALand limping badly on one foot none of them thought anything of it then or even noticed it Dinky murmured to the growing crowd of Breakers looking at the mortally wounded gunslinger and several went to Sheemie and got him to quiet down From the main part of the DevarToi the alarms continued but the followup fire engines were actually getting the three worst fires those in Damli House Wardens House and Feveral Hall under control What Jake remembered next was Teds fingersunbelievably gentle fingersspreading the hair on the back of Eddies head and exposing a large hole filled with a dark jelly of blood There were little white flecks in it Jake had wanted to believe those flecks were bits of bone Better than thinking they might be flecks of Eddies brain At the sight of this terrible headwound Susannah leaped to her feet and began to scream again Began to struggle Ted and Dinky who was paler than paste exchanged a glance tightened their grip on her hands and once more sent the peace ease quiet wait calm slow peace soothing message that was as much colorscool blue shading to quiet ashes of grayas it was words Roland meanwhile held her shoulders Can anything be done for him Roland asked Ted Anything at all He can be made comfortable Ted said We can do that much at least Then he pointed toward the Devar Dont you still have work there to finish Roland For a moment Roland didnt quite seem to understand that Then he looked at the bodies of the downed guards and did Yes he said I suppose I do Jake can you help me If the ones left were to find a new leader and regroup that wouldnt do at all What about Susannah Jake had asked Susannahs going to help us see her man to a place where he can be at his ease and die as peacefully as possible said Ted Brautigan Arent you dear heart Shed looked at him with an expression that was not quite vacant the understanding and the pleading in that gaze went into Jakes heart like the tip of an icicle Must he die she had asked him Ted had lifted her hand to his lips and kissed it Yes he said He must die and you must bear it Then you have to do something for me she said and touched Teds cheek with her fingers To Jake those fingers looked cold Cold What love Anything I can He took hold of her fingers and wrapped them peace ease quiet wait calm slow peace in his own Stop what youre doing unless I tell you different said she He looked at her surprised Then he glanced at Dinky who only shrugged Then he looked back at Susannah You mustnt use your goodmind to steal my grief Susannah told him for Id open my mouth and drink it to the dregs Every drop For a moment Ted only stood with his head lowered and a frown creasing his brow Then he looked up and gave her the sweetest smile Jake had ever seen Aye lady Ted replied Well do as you ask But if you need us whenyon need us Ill call Susannah said and once more slipped to her knees beside the muttering man who lay in the street TWO As Roland and Jake approached the alley which would take them back to the center of the DevarToi where they would put off mourning their fallen friend by taking care of any who might still stand against them Sheemie reached out and plucked the sleeve of Rolands shirt Beam says thankya Will Dearborn that was He had blown out his voice with shouting and spoke in a hoarse croak Beam says all may yet be well Good as new Better Thats fine Roland said and Jake supposed it was There had been no real joy then however as there was no real joy now Jake kept thinking of the hole Ted Brautigans gende fingers had exposed That hole filled with red jelly Roland put an arm around Sheemies shoulders squeezed him gave him a kiss Sheemie smiled delighted Ill come with you Roland Willee have me dear Not this time Roland said Why are you crying Sheemie asked Jake had seen the happiness draining from Sheemies face being replaced with worry Meanwhile more Breakers were returning to Main Street milling around in little groups Jake had seen consternation in the expressions they directed toward the gunslinger and a certain dazed curiosity and in some cases clear dislike Hate almost He had seen no gratitude not so much as a speck of gratitude and for that hed hated them My friend is hurt Roland had said I cry for him Sheemie And for his wife who is my friend Will you go to Ted and sai Dinky and try to soothe her should she ask to be soothed If you want aye Anything for you Thankeesai son of Stanley And help if they move my friend Your friend Eddie Him who lays hurt Aye his name is Eddie you say true Will you help Eddie Aye And theres something else Aye Sheemie asked then seemed to remember something Aye Help you go away travel far you and your friends Ted told me Make a hole he said like you did for me Only they brought him back The bad uns Theyd not bring you back for the bad uns are gone Beams at peace And Sheemie laughed a jarring sound to Jakes grieving ear To Rolands too maybe because his smile was strained In time Sheemie although I think Susannah may stay here and wait for us to return If we do return Jake thought But I have another chore you may be able to do Not helping someone travel to that other world but like that a little Ive told Ted and Dinky and theyd tell you once Eddies been put at his ease Will you listen Aye And help if I can Roland clapped him on the shoulder Good Then Jake and the gunslinger had gone in a direction that might have been north headed back to finish what they had begun THREE They flushed out another fourteen guards in the next three hours most of them humes Roland surprised Jakea littleby only killing the two who shot at them from behind the fire engine that had crashed with one wheel stuck in the cellar bulkhead The rest he disarmed and then gave parole telling them that any DevarToi guards still in the compound when the lateafternoon changeofshifts horn blew would be shot out of hand But where will we go asked a taheen with a snowywhite roosters head below a great floppyred coxcomb he reminded Jake a little of Foghorn Leghorn the cartoon character Roland shook his head I care not where you fetch he said as long as youre not here when the next horn blows kennit Youve done hells work here but hells shut and I mean to see it will never open this particular set of doors again What do you mean asked the roostertaheen almost timidly but Roland wouldnt say had only told the creature to pass on the message to any others he might run across Most of the remaining taheen and cantoi left Algul Siento in pairs and triplets going without argument and nervously looking back over their shoulders every few moments Jake thought they were right to be afraid because his dinhs face that day had been abstract with thought and terrible with grief Eddie Dean lay on his deathbed and Roland of Gilead would not bear crossing What are you going to do to the place Jake asked after the afternoon horn had blown They were making their way past the smoking husk of Damli House where the robot firemen had posted signs every twenty feet reading OFFLIMITS PENDING FIRE DEPT INVESTIGATION on their way to see Eddie Roland only shook his head not answering the question On the Mall Jake spied six Breakers standing in a circle holding hands They looked like folks having a seance Sheemie was there and Ted and Dani Rostov there also was a young woman an older one and a stout bankerlylooking man Beyond lying with their feet sticking out under blankets was a line of the nearly fifty guards who had died during the brief action Do you know what theyre doing Jake asked meaning the seancefolkenthe ones behind them were just being dead a job that would occupy them from now on Roland glanced toward the circle of Breakers briefly Yes What Not now said the gunslinger Now were going to pay our respects to Eddie Youre going to need all the serenity you can manage and that means emptying your mind FOUR Now sitting with Oy outside the empty Clover Tavern with its neon beersigns and silent jukebox Jake reflected on how right Roland had been and how grateful Jake himself had been when after fortyfive minutes or so the gunslinger had looked at him seen his terrible distress and excused him from the room where Eddie lingered giving up his vitality an inch at a time leaving the imprint of his remarkable will on every last inch of his lifes tapestry The litterbearing party Ted Brautigan had organized had borne the young gunslinger to Corbett Hall where he was laid in the spacious bedroom of the firstfloor proctors suite The litterbearers lingered in the dormitorys courtyard and as the afternoon wore on the rest of the Breakers joined them When Roland and Jake arrived a pudgy redhaired woman stepped into Rolands way Lady I wouldnt do thatake had thought Not this afternoon In spite of the days alarums and excursions this womanwhod looked to Jake like the Lifetime President of his mothers garden clubhad found time to put on a fairly heavy coat of makeup powder rouge and lipstick as red as the side of a Devar fire engine She introduced herself as Grace Rumbelow formerly of Aldershot Hampshire England and demanded to know what was going to happen nextwhere they would go what they would do who would take care of them The same questions the roosterheaded taheen had asked in other words For we have been taken care of said Grace Rumbelow in ringing tones Jake had been fascinated with how she said been so it rhymed with seen and are in no position at least for the time being to care for ourselves There were calls of agreement at this Roland looked her up and down and something in his face had robbed the lady of her measured indignation Get out of my road said the gunslinger or Ill push you down She grew pale beneath her powder and did as he said without uttering another word A birdlike clatter of disapproval followed Jake and Roland into Corbett Hall but it didnt start until the gunslinger was out of their view and they no longer had to fear falling beneath the unsettling gaze of his blue eyes The Breakers reminded Jake of some kids with whom hed gone to school at Piper classroom nitwits willing to shout out stuff like this test sucks or bite my bag but only when the teacher was out of the room The firstfloor hallway of Corbett was bright with fluorescent lights and smelled strongly of smoke from Damli House and Feveral Hall Dinky Earnshaw was seated in a folding chair to the right of the door marked PROCTORs SUITE smoking a cigarette He looked up as Roland and Jake approached Oy trotting along in his usual position just behind Jakes heel How is he Roland asked Dying man Dinky said and shrugged And Susannah Strong Once hes gone Dinky shrugged again as if to say it could go either way any way Roland knocked quietly on the door Who is it Susannahs voice muffled Roland and Jake the gunslinger said Will you have us The question was met with what seemed to Jake an unusually long pause Roland however didnt seem surprised Neither did Dinky for that matter At last Susannah said Come in They did FIVE Sitting with Oy in the soothing dark waiting for Rolands call Jake reflected on the scene that had met his eyes in the darkened room That and the endless threequarters of an hour before Roland had seen his discomfort and let him go saying hed call Jake back when it was time Jake had seen a lot of death since being drawn to MidWorld had dealt it had even experienced his own although he remembered very little of that But this was the death of a kamate and what had been going on in the bedroom of the proctors suite just seemed poindess And endless Jake wished with all his heart that hed stayed outside with Dinky he didnt want to remember his wisecracking occasionally hottempered friend this way For one thing Eddie looked worse than frail as he lay in the proctors bed with his hand in Susannahs he looked old and Jake hated to think of it stupid Or maybe the word was senile His mouth had folded in at the corners making deep dimples Susannah had washed his face but the stubble on his cheeks made them look dirty anyway There were big purple patches beneath his eyes almost as though that bastard Prentiss had beaten him up before shooting him The eyes themselves were closed but they rolled almost ceaselessly beneath the thin veils of his lids as though Eddie were dreaming And he talked A steady low muttering stream of words Some of the things he said Jake could make out some he couldnt Some of them made at least minimal sense but a lot of it was what his friend Benny would have called kicome utter nonsense From time to time Susannah would wet a rag in the basin on the table beside the bed wring it out and wipe her husbands brow and dry lips Once Roland got up took the basin emptied it in the bathroom refilled it and brought it back to her She thanked him in a low and perfectly pleasant tone of voice A little later Jake had freshened the water and she thanked him in the same way As if she didnt even know they were there We go for her Roland had told Jake Because later on shell remember who was there and be grateful But would she Jake wondered now in the darkness outside the Clover Tavern Would she be grateful It was down to Roland that Eddie Dean was lying on his deathbed at the age of twentyfive or six wasnt it On the other hand if not for Roland she would never have met Eddie in the first place It was all too confusing Like the idea of multiple worlds with New Yorks in every one it made Jakes head ache Lying there on his deathbed Eddie had asked his brother Henry why he never remembered to box out Hed asked Jack Andolini who hit him with the uglystick Hed shouted Look out Roland its BigNose George hes back And Suze if you can tell him the one about Dorothy and the Tin Woodman Ill tell him all the rest And chilling Jakes heart I do not shoot with my hand he who aims with his hand has forgotten the face of his father At that last one Roland had taken Eddies hand in the gloom for the shades had been drawn and squeezed it Aye Eddie you say true Will you open your eyes and see my face dear But Eddie hadnt opened his eyes Instead chilling Jakes heart more deeply yet the young man who now wore a useless bandage about his head had murmured All is forgotten in the stone halls of the dead These are the rooms of ruin where the spiders spin and the great circuits fall quiet one by one After that there was nothing intelligible for awhile only that ceaseless muttering Jake had refilled the basin of water and when he had come back Roland saw his drawn white face and told him he could go But Go on and go sugarbunch Susannah said Only be careful Might still be some of em out there looking for payback But how will I Ill call you when its time Roland said and tapped Jakes temple with one of the remaining fingers on his right hand Youll hear me Jake had wanted to kiss Eddie before leaving but he was afraid Not that he might catch death like a coldhe knew better than thatbut afraid that even the touch of his lips might be enough to push Eddie into the clearing at the end of the path And then Susannah might blame him SIX Outside in the hallway Dinky asked him how it was going Real bad Jake said Do you have another cigarette Dinky raised his eyebrows but gave Jake a smoke The boy tamped it on his thumbnail as hed seen the gunslinger do with tailormade smokes then accepted a light and inhaled deeply The smoke still burned but not so harshly as the first time His head only swam a little and he didnt cough Pretty soon Ill be a natural he thought If I ever make it back to New York maybe I can go to work for the Network in my Dads department Im already getting good at The Kill He lifted the cigarette in front of his eyes a little white missile with smoke issuing from the top instead of the bottom The word CAMEL was written just below the filter I told myself Id never do this Jake told Dinky Never in life And here I am with one in my hand He laughed It was a bitter laugh an adult laugh and the sound of it coming out of his mouth made him shiver I used to work for this guy before I came here Dinky said Mr Sharpton his name was He used to tell me that nevers the word God listens for when he needs a laugh Jake made no reply He was thinking of how Eddie had talked about the rooms of ruin Jake had followed Mia into a room like that once upon a time and in a dream Now Mia was dead Callahan was dead And Eddie was dying He thought of all the bodies lying out there under blankets while thunder rolled like bones in the distance He thought of the man whod shot Eddie snaprolling to the left as Rolands bullet finished him off He tried to remember the welcoming party for them back in Calla Bryn Sturgis the music and dancing and colored torches but all that came clear was the death of Benny Slightman another friend Tonight the world seemed made of death He himself had died and come back back to MidWorld and back to Roland All afternoon he had tried to believe the same thing might happen to Eddie and knew somehow that it would not Jakes part in the tale had not been finished Eddies was Jake would have given twenty years of his lifethirtynot to believe that but he did He supposed he had progged it somehow The rooms of ruin where the spiders spin and the great circuits fall quiet one by one Jake knew a spider Was Mias child watching all of this Having fun Maybe rooting for one side or the other like a fucking Yankee fan in the bleachers He is I know he is I feel him Are you all right kiddo Dinky asked No Jake said Not all right And Dinky nodded as if that was a perfectly reasonable answer Well Jake thought probably he expected it Hes a telepath after all As if to underline this Dinky had asked who Mordred was You dont want to know Jake said Believe me He snuffed his cigarette halfsmoked All your lung cancers right here in die last quarterinch his father used to say in tones of absolute certainty pointing to one of his own filterless cigarettes like a TV pitchman and left Corbett Hall He used the back door hoping to avoid the cluster of waiting anxious Breakers and in that he had succeeded Now he was in Pleasantville sitting on the curb like one of the homeless people you saw back in New York waiting to be called Waiting for the end He thought about going into the tavern maybe to draw himself a beer surely if he was old enough to smoke and to kill people from ambush he was old enough to drink a beer maybe just to see if the jukebox would play without change He bet that Algul Siento had been what his Dad had claimed America would become in time a cashless society and that old Seeberg was rigged so you only had to push the buttons in order to start the music And he bet that if he looked at the songstrip next to  hed see Someone Saved My Life Tonight by Elton John He got to his feet and that was when the call came Nor was he the only one who heard it Oy let go a short hurtsounding yip Roland might have been standing right next to them To me Jake and hurry Hes going SEVEN Jake hurried back down one of the alleys skirted the stillsmoldering Wardens House Tassa the houseboy who had either ignored Rolands order to leave or hadnt been informed of it was sitting silently on the stoop in a kilt and a sweatshirt his head in his hands and began to trot up the Mall sparing a quick and troubled glance at the long line of dead bodies The little seancecircle hed seen earlier was gone I wont cry he promised himself grimly If Im old enough to smoke and think about drawing myself a beer Im old enough to control my stupid eyes I wont cry Knowing he almost certainly would EIGHT Sheemie and Ted had joined Dinky outside the proctors suite Dinky had given up his seat to Sheemie Ted looked tired but Sheemie looked like shit on a cracker to Jake eyes bloodshot again a crust of dried blood around his nose and one ear cheeks leaden He had taken off one of his slippers and was massaging his foot as though it pained him Yet he was clearly happy Maybe even exalted Beam says all may yet be well youngjake Sheemie said Beam says not too late Beam says thankya Thats good Jake said reaching for the doorknob He barely heard what Sheemie was saying He was concentrating wont cry and make it harder for her on controlling his emotions once he was inside Then Sheemie said something that brought him back in a hurry Not too late in the Real World either Sheemie said We know We peeked Saw the moving sign Didnt we Ted Indeed we did Ted was holding a can of NozzALa in his lap Now he raised it and took a sip When you get in there Jake tell Roland that if its June th of  youre interested in youre still okay But the margins commencing to get a little thin Ill tell him Jake said And remind him that time sometimes slips over there Slips like an old transmission Thats apt to continue for quite awhile regardless of the Beams recovery And once the th is gone It can never come again Jake said Not there We know He opened the door and slipped into the darkness of the proctors suite NINE A single circle of stringent yellow light thrown by the lamp on the bedtable lay upon Eddie Deans face It cast the shadow of his nose on his left cheek and turned his closed eyes into dark sockets Susannah was kneeling on the floor beside him holding both of his hands in both of hers and looking down at him Her shadow ran long upon the wall Roland sat on the other side of the bed in deep shadow The dying mans long muttered monologue had ceased and his respiration had lost all semblance of regularity He would snatch a deep breath hold it then let it out in a lengthy whistling whoosh His chest would lie still so long that Susannah would look up into his face her eyes shining with anxiety until the next long tearing breath had begun Jake sat down on the bed next to Roland looked at Eddie looked at Susannah then looked hesitantly into the gunslingers face In the gloom he could see nothing there except weariness Ted says to tell you its almost June th Americaside please and thankya Also that time could slip a notch Roland nodded Yet well wait for this to be finished I think It wont be much longer and we owe him that How much longer Jake murmured I dont know I thought he might be gone before you got here even if you ran I did once I got to the grassy part but as you see He fights hard Susannah said and that this was the only thing left for her to take pride in made Jake cold My man fights hard Mayhap he still has a word to say TEN And so he did Five endless minutes after Jake had slipped into the bedroom Eddies eyes opened Sue He said Su sie She leaned close still holding his hands smiling into his face all her concentration fiercely narrowed And with an effort Jake wouldnt have believed possible Eddie freed one of his hands swung it a little to the right and grasped the tight kinks of her curls If the weight of his arm pulled at the roots and hurt her she showed no sign The smile that bloomed on her mouth was joyous welcoming perhaps even sensuous Eddie Welcome back Dont bullshit a bullshitter he whispered Im goin sweetheart not comin Thats just plain sil Hush he whispered and she did The hand caught in her hair pulled She brought her face to his willingly and kissed his living lips one last time I will wait for you he said forcing each word out with immense effort Jake saw beads of sweat surface on his skin the dying bodys last message to the living world and that was when the boys heart finally understood what his head had known for hours He began to cry They were tears that burned and scoured When Roland took his hand Jake squeezed it fiercely He was frightened as well as sad If it could happen to Eddie it could happen to anybody It could happen to him Yes Eddie I know youll wait she said In He pulled in another of those great wretched rasping breaths His eyes were as brilliant as gemstones In the clearing Another breath Hand holding her hair Lamplight casting them both in its mystic yellow circle The one at the end of the path Yes dear Her voice was calm now but a tear fell on Eddies cheek and ran slowly down to the line of jaw I hear you very well Wait for me and Ill find you and well go together Ill be walking then on my own legs Eddie smiled at her then turned his eyes to Jake Jake to me No Jake thought panicked no I cant I cant But he was already leaning close into that smell of the end He could see the fine line of grit just below Eddies hairline turning to paste as more tiny droplets of sweat sprang up Wait for me too Jake said through numb lips Okay Eddie Well all go on together Well be katet just like we were He tried to smile and couldnt His heart hurt too much for smiling He wondered if it might not explode in his chest the way stones sometimes exploded in a hot fire He had learned that little fact from his friend Benny Slightman Bennys death had been bad but this was a thousand times worse A million Eddie was shaking his head Not so fast buddy He drew in another breath and then grimaced as if the air had grown quills only he could feel He whispered thennot from weakness Jake thought later but because this was just between them Watch for Mordred Watch Dandelo Dandelion Eddie I dont Dandelo Eyes widening Enormous effort Protect your dinh from Mordred From Dandelo You Oy Your job His eyes cut toward Roland then back to Jake Shhh Then Protect I I will We will Eddie nodded a little then looked at Roland Jake moved aside and the gunslinger leaned in for Eddies word to him ELEVEN Never ever had Roland seen an eye so bright not even on Jericho Hill when Cuthbert had bade him a laughing goodbye Eddie smiled We had some times Roland nodded again You you But this Eddie couldnt finish He raised one hand and made a weak twirling motion I danced Roland said nodding Danced the commala Yes Eddie mouthed then drew in another of those whooping painful breaths It was the last Thank you for my second chance he said Thank you Father That was all Eddies eyes still looked at him and they were still aware but he had no breath to replace the one expended on that final word that father The lamplight gleamed on the hairs of his bare arms turning them to gold The thunder murmured Then Eddies eyes closed and he laid his head to one side His work was finished He had left the path stepped into the clearing They sat around him acircle but katet no more TWELVE And so thirty minutes later Roland Jake Ted and Sheemie sat on a bench in the middle of the Mall Dani Rostov and the bankerlylooking fellow were nearby Susannah was in the bedroom of the proctors suite washing her husbands body for burial They could hear her from where they were sitting She was singing All the songs seemed to be ones theyd heard Eddie singing along the trail One was Born to Run Another was The Rice Song from Calla Bryn Sturgis We have to go and right away Roland said His hand had gone to his hip and was rubbing rubbing Jake had seen him take a botde of aspirin gotten God knew where from his purse and dryswallow three Sheemie will you send us on Sheemie nodded He had limped to the bench leaning on Dinky for support and still none of them had had a chance to look at the wound on his foot His limp seemed so minor compared to their other concerns surely if Sheemie Ruiz were to die this night it would be as a result of opening a makeshift door between Thunderside and America Another strenuous act of teleportation might be lethal to himwhat was a sore foot compared to that Ill try he said Ill try my very hardest so I will Those who helped us look into New York will help us do this Ted said It was Ted who had figured out how to determine the current when on Americaside of the Keystone World He Dinky Fred Worthington the bankerlylooking man and Dani Rostov had all been to New York and were all able to summon up clear mental images of Times Square the lights the crowds the movie marquees and most important the giant newsticker which broadcast the events of the day to the crowds below making a complete circuit of Broadway and Fortyeighth Street every thirty seconds or so The hole had opened long enough to inform them that UN forensics experts were examining supposed mass graves in Kosovo that Vice President Gore had spent the day in New York City campaigning for President that Roger Clemens had struck out thirteen Texas Rangers but the Yankees had still lost the night before With the help of the rest Sheemie could have held the hole open a good while longer the others had been staring into the brilliance of that bustling New York night with a kind of hungry amazement not Breaking now but Opening Seeing only there turned out to be no need for that Following the baseball score the date and time had gone speeding past them in brilliant yellowgreen letters a story high JUNE   PM Jake opened his mouth to ask how they could be sure they had been looking into Keystone World the one where Stephen King had less than a day to live and then shut it again The answer was in the time stupid as the answer always was the numbers comprising  also added up to nineteen THIRTEEN And how long ago was it that you saw this Roland asked Dinky calculated Had tove been five hours at least Based on when the changeofshifts horn blew and the sun went out for the night Which should make it twothirty in the morning right now on the other side Jake calculated counting the hours on his fingers Thinking was hard now even simple addition slowed by constant thoughts of Eddie but he found he could do it if he really tried Only you cant depend on its only being five hours because time goes faster on Americaside That may change now that the Breakers have quit beating up on the Beamit may equalizebut probably not yet Right now its probably still running fast And it might slip One minute Stephen King could be sitting in front of his typewriter in his office on the morning of June th fine as paint and the next boom Lying in a nearby funeral parlor that evening eight or twelve hours gone by in a flash his grieving family sitting in their own circle of lamplight and trying to decide what kind of service King wouldve wanted always assuming that information wasnt in his will maybe even trying to decide where hed be buried And die Dark Tower Stephen Kings version of the Dark Tower Or Gans version or the Prims version Lost forever all of them And that sound you hear Why that must be the Crimson King laughing and laughing and laughing from somewhere deep in the Discordia And maybe Mordred the SpiderBoy laughing along with him For the first time since Eddies death something besides grief came to the forefront of Jakes mind It was a faint ticking sound like the one the Sneetches had made when Roland and Eddie programmed them Just before giving them to Haylis to plant this had been It was the sound of time and time was not their friend Hes right Jake said We have to go while we can still do something Ted Will Susannah No Roland said Susannah will stay here and youll help her bury Eddie Do you agree Yes Ted said Of course if thats how youd have it If were not back in Roland calculated one eye squinted shut the other looking off into the darkness If were not back by this time on the night after next assume that weve come back to EndWorld at Fedic Yes assumeFedic Jake thought Of course Because what good would it do to make the other even more logical assumption that were either dead or lost between the worlds todashforever Doee ken Fedic Roland was asking South of here isnt it asked Worthington He had wandered over with Dani the preteen girl Or what was south Trampas and a few of the other cantoi used to talk of it as though it were haunted Its haunted all right Roland said grimly Can you put Susannah on a train to Fedic in the event that were not able to come back here I know that at least some trains must still run because of The Greencloaks Dinky said nodding Or the Wolves as you think of them All the Dline trains still run Theyre automated Are they monos Do they talk Jake asked He was thinking of Blaine Dinky and Ted exchanged a doubtful look then Dinky returned his attention to Jake and shrugged How would we know I probably know more about Dcups than Dlines and I think thats true of everyone here The Breakers at least I suppose some of the guards might know something more Or that guy He jerked a thumb at Tassa who was still sitting on the stoop of Wardens House head in hands In any case well tell Susannah to be careful Roland murmured to Jake Jake nodded He supposed that was the best they could do but he had another question He made a mental note to ask either Ted or Dinky if he got a chance to do so without being overheard by Roland He didnt like the idea of leaving Susannah behindevery instinct of his heart cried out against itbut he knew she would refuse to leave Eddie unburied and Roland knew it too They could make her come but only by binding and gagging her and that would only make things worse than they were already It might be Ted said that a few Breakers would be interested in taking the traintrip south with Susannah Dani nodded Were not exactly loved around here for helping you out she said Ted and Dinky are getting it the worst but somebody spit at me half an hour ago while I was in my room getting this She held up a batteredlooking and clearly muchloved Pooh Bear I dont think dieyll do anything while you guys are around but after you go She shrugged Man I dont get that Jake said Theyre free Free to do what Dinky asked Think about it Most of them were misfits on Americaside Fifth wheels Over here we were VIPs and we got the best of everything Now all thats gone When you think about it that way is it so hard to understand Yes Jake said bluntly He supposed he didnt want to understand They lost something else too Ted told them quietly Theres a novel by Ray Bradbury called Fahrenheit  It was a pleasure to burn is that novels first line Well it was a pleasure to Break as well Dinky was nodding So were Worthington and Dani Rostov Even Sheemie was nodding his head FOURTEEN Eddie lay in that same circle of light but now his face was clean and the top sheet of the proctors bed had been folded neatly down to his midsection Susannah had dressed him in a clean white shirt shed found somewhere in the proctors closet was Jakes guess and she must have found a razor too because his cheeks were smooth Jake tried to imagine her sitting here and shaving the face of her dead husbandsinging Commalacomecome the rice has just begun as she did itand at first he couldnt Then all at once the image came to him and it was so powerful that he had to struggle once again to keep from bursting into sobs She listened quietly as Roland spoke to her sitting on the side of the bed hands folded in her lap eyes downcast To the gunslinger she looked like a shy virgin receiving a marriage proposal When he had finished she said nothing Do you understand what Ive told you Susannah Yes she said still without looking up Im to bury my man Ted and Dinky will help me if only to keep their friends she gave this word a bitterly sarcastic litde twist that actually encouraged Roland a bit she was in there after all it seemed from taking him away from me and lynching his body from a sour apple tree And then Either youll find a way to come back here and well return to Fedic together or Ted and Dinky will put me on the train and Ill go there alone Jake didnt just hate the cold disconnection in her voice it terrified him as well You know why we have to go back to the other side dont you he asked anxiously I mean you knoiu dont you To save the writer while theres still time She had picked up one of Eddies hands and Jake noted with fascination that his nails were perfectly clean What had she used to get die dirt out from beneath them he wonderedhad the proctor had one of those little nailcare gadgets like the one his father always kept on a keychain in his pocket Sheemie says weve saved the Beam of Bear and Turtle We think weve saved the rose But theres at least one more job to do The writer The lazybones writer Now she did look up and her eyes flashed Jake suddenly thought it might be good that Susannah wouldnt be with them whenifthey met sai Stephen King You bettah save him she said Both Roland and Jake could hear old sneakthief Detta creeping into her voice After whats happened today youjust bettah And this time Roland you tell him not to stop with his writin Not come hell high water cancer or gangrene of the dick Never mind worryin about the Pulitzer Prize neither You tell him to go on and be donewith his motherfuckin story I will pass the message on Roland said She nodded Youll come to us when this job is finished Roland said and his voice rose just slightly on the last word almost turning it into a question Youll come with us and finish the final job wont you Yes she said Not because I want toall the spit and git is out of mebut because it wanted me to Gently very gently she put Eddies hand back on his chest with the other one Then she pointed a finger at Roland The tip trembled minutely Just dont start up with any of that we are katet we are one from many crap Because those days are gone Aint they Yes Roland said But the Tower still stands And waits Lost my taste for that too big boy Not quite losmah tase fodat too but almost Tell you the truth But Jake realized that she was not telling the truth She hadnt lost her desire to see the Dark Tower any more than Roland had Any more than Jake had himself Their tet might be broken but ka remained And she felt it just as they did FIFTEEN They kissed her and Oy licked her face before leaving You be careful Jake Susannah said Come back safe hear Eddie would have told you the same I know Jake said and then kissed her again He was smiling because he could hear Eddie telling him to watch his ass it was cracked already and starting to cry once more for the same reason Susannah held him tight a moment longer then let him go and turned back to her husband lying so still and cold in the proctors bed Jake understood that she had little time for Jake Chambers or Jake Chamberss grief just now Her own was too big SIXTEEN Outside the suite Dinky waited by the door Roland was walking on with Ted the two of them already at the end of the corridor and deep in conversation Jake supposed they were headed back to the Mall where Sheemie with a little help from the others would attempt to send them once more to Americaside That reminded him of something The Dline trains go south Jake said Or whats supposed to be southis that right More or less partner Dinky said Some of the engines have got names like Delicious Rain or Spirit of the Snow Country but theyve all got letters and numbers Does the D stand for Dandelo Jake asked Dinky looked at him with a puzzled frown Dandelo What in the hell is that Jake shook his head He didnt even want to tell Dinky where hed heard the word Well I dont know not for sure Dinky said as they resumed walking but I always assumed the D stood for Discordia Because thats where all the trains supposedly end up you knowsomewhere deep in the universes baddest Badlands Jake nodded D for Discordia That made sense Sort of anyway You didnt answer my question Dinky said Whats a Dandelo Just a word I saw written on the wall in Thunderclap Station It probably doesnt mean anything SEVENTEEN Outside Corbett Hall a delegation of Breakers waited They looked grim and frightened Dfor Dandelo Jake thought Dfor Discordia Also Dfor desperate Roland faced them with his arms folded over his chest Who speaks for you he asked If one speaks let him come forward now for our time here is up A grayhaired gentlemananother bankerlylooking fellow in truthstepped forward He was wearing gray suitpants a white shirt open at the collar and a gray vest also open The vest sagged So did the man wearing it Youve taken our lives from us he said He spoke these words with a kind of morose satisfactionas if hed always known it would come to this or something like this The lives we knew What will you give back in return Mr Gilead There was a rumble of approval at this Jake Chambers heard it and was suddenly more angry than ever before in his life His hand seemingly of its own accord stole to the handle of the Coyote machinepistol caressed it and found a cold comfort in its shape Even a brief respite from grief And Roland knew for he reached behind him without looking and put his hand on top of Jakes He squeezed until Jake let loose of the gun Ill tell you what Ill give since you ask Roland said I meant to have this place where you have fed on the brains of helpless children in order to destroy the universe burned to the ground aye every stick of it I intended to set certain flying balls that have come into our possession to explode and blow apart anything that would not burn I intended to point you the way to the River Whye and the green Callas which lie beyond it and set you on with a curse my father taught me may you live long but not in good health A resentful murmur greeted this but not an eye met Rolands own The man who had agreed to speak for them and even in his rage Jake gave him points for courage was swaying on his feet as if he might soon faint away The Callas still lie in that direction Roland said and pointed If you go somemany evenmay die on the way for there are animals out there that are hungry and what water there is may be poison Ive no doubt the Callafolken will know who you are and what youve been about even if you lie for they have the Manni among them and the Manni see much Yet you may find forgiveness there rather than death for the capacity for forgiveness in the hearts of such people is beyond the capacity of hearts such as yours to understand Or mine for that matter That they would put you to work and that the rest of your lives would pass not in the comfort youve known but in toil and sweat I have no doubt yet I urge you to go if only to find some redemption for what you have done We didnt know what we were doing ye chary man a woman in the back yelled furiously YOU KNEW Jake shouted back screaming so loudly that he saw black dots in front of his eyes and Rolands hand was once again instantly over his to stay his draw Would he actually have sprayed the crowd with the Coyote bringing more death to this terrible place He didnt know What he did know was that a gunslingers hands were sometimes not under his control once a weapon was in them Dont you dare say you didnt You knew Ill give this much may it do ya Roland said My friends and Ithose who survive although Im sure the one who lies dead yonder would agree which is why I speak as I dowill let this place stand Theres food enough to see you through the rest of your lives I have no doubt and robots to cook it and wash your clothes and even wipe your asses if thats what you think you need If you prefer purgatory to redemption then stay here Were I you Id make the trek instead Follow the railroad tracks out of the shadows Tell them what you did before they can tell you and get on your knees with your heads bared and beg their forgiveness Never someone shouted adamantly but Jake thought some of the others looked unsure As you will said Roland Ive spoken my last word on it and the next who speaks back to me may remain silent ever after for one of my friends is preparing another her husband to lie in the ground and I am full of grief and rage Would you speak more Would you dare my rage If so you dare this He drew his gun and laid it in the hollow of his shoulder Jake stepped up beside him at last drawing his own There was a moment of silence and then the man who had spoken turned away Dont shoot us mister youve done enough someone said bitterly Roland made no reply and the crowd began to disperse Some went running and the others caught that like a cold They fled in silence except for a few who were weeping and soon the dark had swallowed them up Wow Dinky said His voice was soft and respectful Roland Ted said What they did wasnt entirely their fault I thought I had explained that but I guess I didnt do a very good job Roland holstered his revolver You did an excellentjob he said Thats why theyre still alive Now they had the Damli House end of the Mall to themselves again and Sheemie limped up to Roland His eyes were round and solemn Will you show me where youd go dear he asked Can you show me the place The place Roland had been so fixed on the when that hed scarcely thought of the where And his memories of the road they had traveled in Lovell were pretty skimpy Eddie had been driving John Cullums car and Roland had been deep in his own thoughts concentrating on the things he would say to convince the caretaker to help them Did Ted show you a place before you sent him on he asked Sheemie Aye so he did Only he didnt know he was showing me It was a babypicture I dont know how to tell you exactly stupid head Full of cobwebbies Sheemie made a fist and clouted himself between the eyes Roland took the hand before Sheemie could hit himself again and unrolled the fingers He did this with surprising gentleness No Sheemie I think I understand You found a thought a memory from when he was a little boy Ted had come over to them Of course that must be it he said I dont know why I didnt see it before now Too simple maybe I grew up in Milford and the place where I came out in I was barely a spit from there in geographical terms Sheemie must have found a memory of a carriageride or maybe a trip on the Hartford Trolley to see my Uncle Jim and Aunt Molly in Bridgeport Something in my subconscious He shook his head I knew the place where I came out looked familiar but of course it was years later The Merritt Parkway wasnt there when I was a boy Can you show me a picture like that Sheemie asked Roland hopefully Roland thought once more of the place in Lovell where theyd parked on Route  the place where hed called Chevin of Chayven out of the woods but it simply wasnt sure enough there was no landmark that made the place only itself and no other Not one that he remembered anyway Then another idea came One that had to do with Eddie Sheemie Aye Roland of Gilead Will Dearborn that was Roland reached out and placed his hands on the sides of Sheemies head Close your eyes Sheemie son of Stanley Sheemie did as he was told then reached out his own hands and grasped the sides of Rolands head Roland closed his own eyes See what I see Sheemie he said See where we would go See it very well And Sheemie did EIGHTEEN While they stood there Roland projecting and Sheemie seeing Dani Rostov softly called to Jake Once he was before her she hesitated as if unsure what she would say or do He began to ask her but before he could she stopped his mouth with a kiss Her lips were amazingly soft Thats for good luck she said and when she saw his look of amazement and understood the power of what she had done her timidity lessened She put her arms around his neck still holding her scuffed Pooh Bear in one hand he felt it soft against his back and did it again He felt the push of her tiny hard breasts and would remember the sensation for the rest of his life Would remember her for the rest of his life And thats for me She retreated to Ted Brautigans side eyes downcast and cheeks burning red before he could speak Not that he could have even if his life had depended upon it His throat was locked shut Ted looked at him and smiled You judge the rest of them by the first one he said Take it from me I know Jake could still say nothing She might have punched him in the head instead of kissing him on the lips He was that dazed NINETEEN Fifteen minutes later four men one girl a billybumbler and one dazed amazed and very tired boy stood on the Mall They seemed to have the grassy quad to themselves the rest of the Breakers had disappeared completely From where he stood Jake could see the lighted window on the first floor of Corbett Hall where Susannah was tending to her man Thunder rumbled Ted spoke now as he had in Thundercap Stations office closet where the red blazers brass tag read HEAD OF SHIPPING back when Eddies death had been unthinkable Join hands And concentrate Jake started to reach for Dani Rostovs hand but Dinky shook his head smiling a little Maybe you can hold hands with her another day hero but right now youre the monkey in the middle And your dinhs another one You hold hands with each other Sheemie said There was a quiet authority in his voice that Jake hadnt heard before Thatll help Jake tucked Oy into his shirt Roland were you able to show Sheemie Look Roland said taking his hands The others now made a tight circle around them Look I think youll see A brilliant seam opened in the darkness obliterating Sheemie and Ted from Jakes view For a moment it trembled and darkened and Jake thought it would disappear Then it grew bright again and spread wider He heard very faindy the way you heard things when you were underwater the sound of a car or truck passing in that other world And saw a building with a small asphalt lot in front of it Three cars and a pickup truck were parked there Daylight he thought dismayed Because if time never ran backward in the Keystone World that meant that time had slipped If that was Keystone World then it was Saturday the nineteenth of June in the year Quick Ted shouted from the other side of that brilliant hole in reality If youre going go now Hes going to faint If youre going Roland yanked Jake forward his purse bouncing on his back as he did so Wait Jake wanted to shout Wait I forgot my stuff But it was too late There was the sensation of big hands squeezing his chest and he felt all the air whoosh out of his lungs He thought Pressure change There was a sensation of falling up and then he was reeling onto the pavement of the parking lot with his shadow tacked to his heels squinting and grimacing wondering in some distant part of his mind how long it had been since his eyes had been exposed to plain old natural daylight Not since entering the Doorway Cave in pursuit of Susannah maybe Very faintly he heard someonehe thought it was the girl who had kissed himcall Good luck and then it was gone Thunderclap was gone and the DevarToi and the darkness They were Americaside in the parking lot of the place to which Rolands memory and Sheemies powerboosted by the other four Breakershad taken them It was die East Stoneham General Store where Roland and Eddie had been ambushed by Jack Andolini Only unless there had been some horrible error that had been twentytwo years earlier This was June th of  and the clock in the window ITs ALWAYS TIME FOR BOARs HEAD MEATS was written in a circle around the face said it was nineteen minutes of four in the afternoon Time was almost up ONE The fact of his own almost unearthly speed of hand never occurred to Jake Chambers All he knew was that when he staggered out of the DevarToi and back into America his shirtbelled out into a pregnant curve by Oys weightwas pulling out of his jeans The bumbler who never had much luck when it came to passing between the worlds hed nearly been squashed by a taxicab the last time tumbled free Almost anyone else in the world would have been unable to prevent that fall and in fact it very likely wouldnt have hurt Oy at all but Jake wasnt almost anyone Ka had wanted him so badly that it had even found its way around death to put him at Rolands side Now his hands shot out with a speed so great that they momentarily blurred away to nothing When they reappeared one was curled into the thick shag at the nape of Oys neck and the other into the shorter fur at the rump end of his long back Jake set his friend down on the pavement Oy looked up at him and gave a single short bark It seemed to express not one idea but two thanks and dont do that again Come on Roland said We have to hurry Jake followed him toward the store Oy falling in at his accustomed place by the boys left heel There was a sign hanging in the door from a little rubber suction cup It read WERE OPEN so COME IN N VISIT just as it had in Taped in the window to the left of the door was this COME ONE COME ALL TO THE ST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH BEANHOLE BEAN SUPPER Saturday June th  Intersection Route  amp Klatt Road PARISH HOUSE In Back  PM PM AT st CONGO WERE ALWAYS GLAD TO SEEYA NAYiAH Jake thought The bean supper will be starting in an hour or so They II already be putting down the tablecloths and setting the places Taped to the right of the door was a more startling message to the public ist LovellStoneham Church of the WalkIns Will YOU join us for Worship Sunday services io AM Thursday services y PM EVERY WEDNESDAY IS YOUTH NIGHT  PM Games Music Scripture NEWS OF WALKINS Hey Teens Be There or Be Square We Seek the Doorway to HeavenWill You Seek With Us Take found himself thinking of Harrigan the streetpreacher on the corner of Second Avenue and Fortysixth Street and wondering to which of these two churches he might have been attracted His head might have told him First Congo but his heart Hurry Jake Roland repeated and there was a jingle as the gunslinger opened the door Good smells wafted out reminding Jake as they had reminded Eddie of Tooks on the Calla high street coffee and peppermint candy tobacco and salami olive oil the salty tang of brine sugar and spice and most things nice He followed Roland into the store aware that he had brought at least two things with him after all The Coyote machinepistol was stuffed into the waistband of his jeans and the bag of Orizas was still slung over his shoulder hanging on his left side so that the half a dozen plates remaining inside would be within easy reach of his right hand TWO Wendell Chip McAvoy was at the deli counter weighing up a pretty sizable order of sliced honeycured turkey for Mrs Tassenbaum and until the bell over the door rang once more turning Chips life upside down You ve turned turtle the oldtimers used to say when your car rolled in the ditch they had been discussing the growing presence of Jet Skis on Keywadin Pond or rather Mrs Tassenbaum had been discussing it Chip thought Mrs T was a more or less typical summer visitor rich as Croesus or at least her husband who had one of those new dotcom businesses was gabby as a parrot loaded on whiskey and as crazy as Howard Hughes on a morphine toot She could afford a cabin cruiser and two dozen Jet Skis to pull it if she fancied but she came down to the market on this end of the lake in a battered old rowboat tying up right about where John Cullum used to tie his up until That Day as the years had refined his story to ever greater purity burnishing it like an oftpolished piece of teak furniture Chip had come more and more to convey its capitalletter status with his voice speaking of That Day in the same reverential tones the Reverend Conveigh used when speaking of Our Lord La Tassenbaum was talky meddlesome goodlooking kinda he supposed if you didnt mind the makeup and the hairspray loaded with green and a Republican Under the circumstances Chip McAvoy felt perfectlyjustified in sneaking his thumb onto the corner of the scale a trick he had learned from his father who had told him you practically had a duty to rook folks from away if they could afford it but you must never rook folks from the home place not even if they were as rich as that writer King from over in Lovell Why Because word got around and the next thing you knew outoftown custom was all a man had to get by on and try doing that in the month of February when the snowbanks on the sides of Route  were nine feet high This wasnt February however and Mrs Tassenbauma Daughter of Abraham if he had ever seen onewas not from these parts No Mrs Tassenbaum and her richasCroesus dotcom husband would be gone back to Jew York as soon as they saw the first colored leaf fall Which was why he felt perfecdy comfortable in turning her sixdollar order of turkey into seven dollars and eighty cents with the ball of his thumb on the scale Nor did it hurt to agree with her when she switched topics and started talking about what a terrible man that Bill Clinton was although in fact Chip had voted twice for Bubba and would have voted for him a third time had the Constitution allowed him to run for another term Bubba was smart he was good at persuading the ragheads to do what he wanted he hadnt entirely forgotten the working man and by the Lord Harry he got more pussy than a toilet seat And now Gore expects to just ride in on his coattails Mrs Tassenbaum said digging for her checkbook the turkey on the scale magically gained another two ounces and there Chip felt it prudent to lock it in Claims he invented the Internet Huh I know better In fact I know the man who really did invent the Internet She looked up Chips thumb now nowhere near the scales he had an instinct about such things damned if he didnt and gave Chip a roguish litde smile She lowered her voice into its confidential justwetwo register I ought to Ive been sleeping in the same bed with him for almost twenty years Chip gave a hearty laugh took the sliced turkey off the scale and put it on a piece of white paper He was glad to leave the subject of Jet Skis behind as he had one on order from Viking Motors The Boys with the Toys in Oxford himself I know what you mean That fella Gore too slick Mrs Tassenbaum was nodding endiusiastically and so Chip decided to lay on a little more Never hurt by Christ His hair for instancehow can you trust a man who puts that much goo in his That was when the bell over the door jingled Chip looked up Saw And froze A goddamned lot of water had gone under the bridge since That Day but Wendell Chip McAvoy knew the man whod caused all the trouble the moment he stepped through the door Some faces you simply never forgot And hadnt he always known deep in his hearts most secret place that the man with die terrible blue eyes hadnt finished his business and would be back Back for him That idea broke his paralysis Chip turned and ran He got no more than three steps along the inside of the counter before a shot rang out loud as thunder in the storethe place was bigger and fancier than it had been in  thank God for his fathers insistence on extravagant insurance coverageand Mrs Tassenbaum uttered a piercing scream Three or four people who had been browsing the aisles turned with expressions of astonishment and one of them hit the floor in a dead faint Chip had time to register that it was Rhoda Beemer eldest daughter of one of the two women whod been killed in here on That Day Then it seemed to him that time had folded back on itself and it was Ruth herself lying there with a can of creamed corn rolling free of one relaxing hand He heard a bullet buzz over his head like an angry bee and skidded to a stop hands raised Dont shoot mister he heard himself bawl in the thin wavering voice of an old man Take whatevers in the register but dont shoot me Turn around said the voice of the man who had turned Chips world turtle on That Day the man whod almost gotten him killed hed been in the hospital over in Bridgton for two weeks by the living Jesus and had now reappeared like an old monster from some childs closet The rest of you on the floor but you turn around shopkeeper Turn around and see me See me very well THREE The man swayed from side to side and for a moment Roland thought he would faint instead of turning Perhaps some survival oriented part of his brain suggested that fainting was more likely to get him killed for the shopkeeper managed to keep his feet and did finally turn and face the gunslinger His dress was eerily similar to what hed been wearing the last time Roland was here it could have been the same black tie and butchers apron tied up high on his midriff His hair was still slicked back along his skull but now it was wholly white instead of saltandpepper Roland remembered the way blood had dashed back from the left side of the shopkeepers temple as a bulletone fired by Andolini himself for all the gunslinger knewgrooved him Now there was a grayish knot of scartissue there Roland guessed the man combed his hair in a way that would display that mark rather than hide it Hed either had a fools luck that day or been saved by ka Roland thought ka the more likely Judging from the sick look of recognition in the shopkeepers eyes he thought so too Do you have a cartomobile a truckomobile or a tacksee Roland asked holding the barrel of his gun on the shopkeepers middle Jake stepped up beside Roland What are you driving he asked the shopkeeper Thats what he means Truck the shopkeeper managed International Harvester pickup Its outside in the lot He reached under his apron so suddenly that Roland came within an ace of shooting him The shopkeepermercifullydidnt seem to notice All of the stores customers were now lying prone including the woman whod been at the counter Roland could smell the meat she had been in the process of trading for and his stomach rumbled He was tired hungry overloaded with grief and there were too many things to think about too many by far His mind couldnt keep up Jake would have said he needed to take a timeout but he didnt see any timeouts in their immediate future The shopkeeper was holding out a set of keys His fingers were trembling and the keys jingled The lateafternoon sun slanting in the windows struck them and bounced complicated reflections into the gunslingers eyes First the man in the white apron had plunged a hand out of sight without asking permission and not slowly now this holding up a bunch of reflective metal objects as if to blind his adversary It was as if he were trying to get killed But it had been that way on the day of the ambush too hadnt it The storekeeper quicker on his feet then and without that widowers hump in his back had followed him and Eddie from place to place like a cat who wont stop getting under your feet seemingly oblivious to the bullets flying all around them just as hed seemed oblivious of the one that grooved the side of his head At one point Roland remembered he had talked about his son almost like a man in a barbershop making conversation while he waits his turn to sit under the scissors A kamai then and such were often safe from harm At least until ka tired of their antics and swatted them out of the world Take the truck take it and go the shopkeeper was telling him Its yours Im giving it to you Really If you dont stop flashing those damned keys in my eyes sai what Ill take is your breath Roland said There was another clock behind the counter He had already noticed that this world was full of clocks as if the people who lived here thought that by having so many they could cage time Ten minutes of four which meant theyd been Americaside for nine minutes already Time was racing racing Somewhere nearby Stephen King was almost certainly on his afternoon walk and in desperate danger although he didnt know it Or had it happened already TheyRoland anywayhad always assumed that the writers death would hit them hard like another Beamquake but maybe not Maybe the impact of his death would be more gradual How far from here to Turtleback Lane Roland rapped at the storekeeper The elderly sai only stared eyes huge and liquid with terror Never in his life had Roland felt more like shooting a man or at least pistolwhipping him He looked as foolish as a goat with its foot stuck in a crevice Then the woman lying in front of the meatcounter spoke She was looking up at Roland and Jake her hands clasped together at the small of her back Thats in Lovell mister Its about five miles from here One look in her eyeslarge and brown fearful but not panickyand Roland decided this was the one he wanted not the storekeeper Unless that was He turned to Jake Can you drive the shopkeepers truck five miles Roland saw the boy wanting to say yes then realizing he couldnt afford to risk ultimate failure by trying to do a thing hecity boy that he washad never done in his life No Jake said I dont think so What about you Roland had watched Eddie drive John Cullums car It didnt look that hard but there was his hip to consider Rosa had told him diat dry twist moved fastlike a fire driven by strong winds shed saidand now he knew what shed meant On the trail into Calla Bryn Sturgis the pain in his hip had been no more than an occasional twinge Now it was as if the socket had been injected with redhot lead then wrapped in strands of barbed wire The pain radiated all the way down his leg to the right ankle Hed watched how Eddie manipulated the pedals going back and forth between the one that made the car speed up and the one that made it slow down always using the right foot Which meant the ball of the right hip was always lolling in its socket He didnt think he could do that Not with any degree of safety I think not he said He took the keys from the shopkeeper then looked at the woman lying in front of the meatcounter Stand up sai he said Mrs Tassenbaum did as she was told and when she was on her feet Roland gave her the keys I keep meeting useful people in here he thought If this ones as good as Cullum turned out to be we might still be all right Youre going to drive my young friend and me to Lovell Roland said To Turtleback Lane she said You say true I say thankya Are you going to kill me after you get to where you want to go Not unless you dawdle Roland said She considered this then nodded Then I wont Lets go Good luck Mrs Tassenbaum the shopkeeper told her faintly as she started for the door If I dont come back she said you just remember one thing it was my husband who invented the Internethim and his friends partly at CalTech and partly in their own garages Not Albert Gore Rolands stomach rumbled again He reached over the counter the shopkeeper cringed away from him as if he suspected Roland of carrying the red plague grabbed the womans pile of turkey and folded three slices into his mouth The rest he handed to Jake who ate two slices and then looked down at Oy who was looking up at the meat with great interest Ill give you your share when we get in the truck Jake promised Ruck Oy said then with much greater emphasis Share Holy jumping Jesus Christ the shopkeeper said FOUR The Yankee shopkeepers accent might have been cute but his truck wasnt It was a standard shift for one thing Irene Tassenbaum of Manhattan hadnt driven a standard since she had been Irene Cantora of Staten Island It was also a stick shift and she had never driven one of those Jake was sitting beside her with his feet placed around said stick and Oy still chewing turkey on his lap Roland swung into the passenger seat trying not to snarl at the pain in his leg Irene forgot to depress the clutch when she keyed the ignition The IH lurched forward then stalled Luckily it had been rolling the roads of western Maine since the midsixties and it was the sedate jump of an elderly mare rather than the spirited buck of a colt otherwise Chip McAvoy would once more have lost at least one of his plateglass windows Oy scrabbled for balance on Jakes lap and sprayed out a mouthful of turkey along with a word he had learned from Eddie Irene stared at the bumbler with wide startled eyes Did that creature just say fuck young man Never mind what he said Jake replied His voice was shaking The hands of the Boars Head clock in the window now stood at five to four Like Roland the boy had never had a sense of time as a thing so little in their control Use the clutch and get us out of here Luckily the shifting pattern had been embossed on the head of the stick shift and was still faintly visible Mrs Tassenbaum pushed in the clutch with a sneakered foot ground the gears hellishly and finally found Reverse The truck backed out onto Route  in a series of jerks then stalled halfway across the white line She turned the ignition key realizing shed once more forgotten the clutch just a little too late to prevent another series of those spastic leaps Roland and Jake were now bracing their hands against the dusty metal dashboard where a faded sticker proclaimed AMERICA LOVE IT OR LEAVE in red white and blue This series of jerks was actually a good thing for at that moment a truck loaded with logsit was impossible for Roland not to think of the one that had crashed the last time theyd been herecrested the rise to the north of the store Had the pickup not jerked its way back into the General Stores parking lot bashing the fender of a parked car as it came to a stop they would have been centerpunched And very likely killed The logging truck swerved horn blaring rear wheels spuming up dust The creature in the boys lapit looked to Mrs Tassenbaum like some weird mixture of dog and raccoonbarked again Fuck She was almost sure of it The storekeeper and the other patrons were lined up on the other side of the glass and she suddenly knew what a fish in an aquarium must feel like Lady can you drive this thing or not the boy yelled He had some sort of bag over his shoulder It reminded her of a newsboys bag only it was leather instead of canvas and there appeared to be plates inside I can drive it young man dont you worry She was terrified and yet at the same time was she enjoying this She almost thought she was For the last eighteen years shed been little more than the great David Tassenbaums ornament a supporting character in his increasingly famous life the lady who said Try one of these as she passed around hors doeuvres at parties Now suddenly she was at the center of something and she had an idea it was something very important indeed Take a deep breath said the man with the hard sunburned face His brilliant blue eyes fastened upon hers and when they did it was hard to think of anything else Also the sensation was pleasant If this is hypnosis she thought they ought to teach it in the public schools Hold it then let it out And then drive us for your fathers sake She pulled in a deep breath as instructed and suddenly the day seemed brighternearly brilliant And she could hear faint singing voices Lovely voices Was the trucks radio on tuned to some opera program No time to check But it was nice whatever it was As calming as the deep breath Mrs Tassenbaum pushed in the clutch and restarted the engine This time she found Reverse on the first try and backed into the road almost smoothly Her first effort at a forward gear netted her Second instead of First and the truck almost stalled when she eased the clutch out but then the engine seemed to take pity on her With a wheeze of loose pistons and a manic rapping from beneath the hood they began rolling north toward the StonehamLovell line Do you know where Turtleback Lane is Roland asked her Ahead of them near a sign marked MILLION DOLLAR CAMPGROUND a battered blue minivan swung out onto the road Yes she said Youre sure The last thing the gunslinger wanted was to waste precious time casting about for the back road where King lived Yes We have friends who live there The Beckhardts For a moment Roland could only grope knowing hed heard the name but not where Then he got it Beckhardt was the name of the man who owned the cabin where he and Eddie had had their final palaver with John Cullum He felt a fresh stab of grief in his heart at the thought of Eddie as hed been on that thundery afternoon still so strong and vital All right he said I believe you She glanced at him across the boy sitting between Youre in one hell of a hurry misterlike the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland What very important date are you almost too late for Roland shook his head Never mind just drive He looked at the clock on the dashboard but it didnt work had stopped in the longago with the hands pointed at of course  It may not be too late yet he said while ahead of them unheeded the blue van began to pull away It strayed across the white line of Route  into the southbound lane and Mrs Tassenbaum almost committed a bon motsomething about people who started drinking before fivebut then the blue van pulled back into the northbound lane breasted the next hill and was gone toward the town of Lovell Mrs Tassenbaum forgot about it She had more interesting things to think about For instance You dont have to answer what Im going to ask now if you dont want to she said but I admit that Im curious are you boys walkins FIVE Bryan Smith has spent the last couple of nightsalong with his rottweilers littertwins he has named Bullet and Pistolin the Million Dollar Campground just over the LovellStoneham line Its nice there by the river the locals call the rickety wooden structure spanning the water Million Dollar Bridge which Bryan understands is a joke and a pretty funny one by God Also folkshippietypes down from the woods in Sweden Harrison and Waterford mostlysometimes show up there with drugs to sell Bryan likes to get mellow likes to get down may it doya and hes down this Saturday afternoon not a lot not the way he likes but enough to give him a good case of the munchies They have those MarsesBars at the CenterLovell Store Nothing better for the munchies than those He pulls out of the campground and onto Route  without so much as a glance in either direction then says Whoops forgot again No traffic though Later onespecially after the Fourth of July and until Labor Daytherell be plenty of traffic to contend with even out here in the boonies and hell probably stay closer to home He knows he isnt much of a driver one more speeding ticket or fenderbender and hell probably lose his license for six months Again No problem this time though nothing coming but an oldpickemup and that babys almost half a mile back Eat my dust cowboy he says and giggles He doesnt know why he said cowboy when the word in his mind was muthafuckah as in eat my dust muthafuckah but it sounds good It sounds right He sees hes drifted into the other lane and corrects his course Back on the road again he cries and lets loose another highpitched giggle Back on the road again is a good one and he always uses it n girls Another good one is when you twist the wheel from side to side making your car loop back and forth and you say Ahh jeez musta had too much coughsyrup He knows lots of lines like this even once thought of writing a book called Crazy Road Jokes wouldnt that be a sketch Bryan Smith writing a book just like that guy King over in Lovell He turns on the radio the van yawing onto the soft shoulder to the left of the tarvy throwing up a roostertail of dust but not quite running into the ditch and gets Steely Dan singing Hey Nineteen Good one Yassuh wicked good one He drives a little faster in response to the music He looks into the rearview mirror and sees his dogs Bullet and Pistol looking over the rear seat brighteyed For a moment Bryan thinks they re looking at him maybe thinking what a good guy he is then wonders how he can be so stupid Theres a Styrofoam cooler behind the drivers seat and a pound of fresh hamburger in it He means to cook it later over a campfire back at Million Dollar Yes and a couple more Morses Bars for dessert by the hairy oldJesus Marses Bars are wicked good You boys nemine that cooler Bryan Smith says speaking to the dogs he can see in the rearview mirror This time the minivan pitches instead ofyaioing crossing the white line as it climbs a blind grade at fifty miles an hour Luckilyor unluckily depending on your point of viewnothing is coming the other way nothing puts a stop to Bryan Smiths northward progress You nemine that hamburg thats my supper He says suppah as John Cullum would but the face looking back at the brighteyed dogs from the rearview mirror is the face ofSheemie Ruiz Almost exactly Sheemie could be Bryan Smiths littertwin SIX Irene Tassenbaum was driving the truck with more assurance now standard shift or not She almost wished she didnt have to turn right a quarter of a mile from here because that would necessitate using the clutch again this time to downshift But that was Turtleback Lane right up ahead and Turtleback was where these boys wanted to go Walkins They said so and she believed it but who else would Chip McAvoy maybe and surely the Reverend Peterson from that crazy Church of the WalkIns down in Stoneham Corners but anyone else Her husband for instance Nope Never If you couldnt engrave a thing on a microchip David Tassenbaum didnt believe it was real She wonderednot for the first time latelyif fortyseven was too old to think about a divorce She shifted back to Second without grinding the gears too much but then as she turned off the highway had to shift all the way down to First when the silly old pickup began to grunt and chug She thought that one of her passengers would make some sort of smart comment perhaps the boys mutant dog would even say fuck again but all the man in the passenger seat said was This doesnt look the same When were you here last Irene Tassenbaum asked him She considered shifting up to second gear again then decided to leave things just as they were If it aint broke dont fix it David liked to say Its been awhile the man admitted She had to keep sneaking glances at him There was something strange and exotic about himespecially his eyes It was as if theyd seen things shed never even dreamed of Stop it she told herself Hes probably a drugstore cowboy all the way from Portsmouth New Hampshire But she kind of doubted that The boy was odd as wellhim and his exotic crossbreed dogbut they were nothing compared to the man with the haggard face and the strange blue eyes Eddie said it was a loop the boy said Maybe last time you guys came in from the other end The man considered this and nodded Would the other end be the Bridgton end he asked the woman Yes indeed The man with the odd blue eyes nodded Were going to the writers house Cara Laughs she said at once Its a beautiful house Ive seen it from the lake but I dont know which driveway Its nineteen the man said They were currently passing the one marked  From this end of Turdeback Lane the numbers would go down rather than up What do you want with him if I may I be so bold It was the boy who answered We want to save his life SEVEN Roland recognized the steeply descending driveway at once even though hed last seen it under black thundery skies and much of his attention had been taken by the brilliant flying taheen There was no sign of taheen or other exotic wildlife today The roof of the house below had been dressed with copper instead of shingles at some point during the intervening years and the wooded area beyond it had become a lawn but the driveway was the same with a sign reading CARA LAUGHS on the lefthand side and one bearing the number  in large numerals on the right Beyond was the lake sparkling blue in the strong afternoon light From the lawn came the blat of a hardworking small engine Roland looked at Jake and was dismayed by the boys pale cheeks and wide frightened eyes What Whats wrong Hes not here Roland Not him not any of his family Just the man cutting the grass Nonsense you cant Mrs Tassenbaum began I know Jake shouted at her I know lady Roland was looking at Jake with a frank and horrified sort of fascination but in his current state the boy either did not understand the look or missed it entirely Why are you lying Jake the gunslinger thought And then on the heels of that Hes not What if its already happened Jake demanded and yes he was worried about King but Roland didnt think that was all he was worried about What if hes dead and his familys not here because the police called them and It hasnt happened Roland said but that was all of which he was sure What do you know Jake and why luontyou tell me There was no time to wonder about it now EIGHT The man with the blue eyes sounded calm as he spoke to the boy but he didnt look calm to Irene Tassenbaum not at all And those singing voices shed first noticed outside the East Stoneham General Store had changed Their song was still sweet but wasnt there a note of desperation in it now as well She thought so A high pleading quality that made her temples throb How can you know that the boy called Jake shouted at the manhis father she assumed How can you be so fucking sure Instead of answering the kids question the one called Roland looked at her Mrs Tassenbaum felt the skin of her arms and back break out in gooseflesh Drive down sai may it do ya She looked doubtfully at the steep slope of the Cara Laughs driveway If I do I might not get this bucket of bolts back up Youll have to Roland said NINE The man cutting the grass was Kings bondservant Roland surmised or whatever passed for such in this world He was whitehaired under his straw hat but straightbacked and hale wearing his years with little effort When the truck drove down the steep driveway to the house the man paused with one arm resting on the handle of the mower When the passenger door opened and the gunslinger got out he used the switch to turn the mower off He also removed his hatwithout being exactly aware that he was doing it Roland thought Then his eyes registered the gun that hung at Rolands hip and widened enough to make the crowsfeet around them disappear Howdy mister he said cautiously He thinks Im a walkin Roland thought Just as she did And they were walkins of a sort he and Jake they just happened to have come to a time and place where such things were common And where time was racing Roland spoke before the man could go on Where are they Where is he Stephen King Speak man and tell me the truth The hat slipped from the old mans relaxing fingers and fell beside his feet on the newly cut grass His hazel eyes stared into Rolands fascinated the bird looking at the snake Famblys across the lake at that place they gut on tother side he said Told Schindler place Havin some kind of paty they are Steve said hed drive over after his walk And he gestured to a small black car parked on the driveway extension its nose just visible around the side of the house Where is he walking Do ya know tell this lady The old man looked briefly over Rolands shoulder then back to the gunslinger Be easier was I tdrive ya there mself Roland considered this but only briefly Easier to begin with yes Maybe harder on the other end where King would either be saved or lost Because theyd found the woman in kas road However minor a role she might have to play it was her they had found first on the Path of the Beam In the end it was as simple as that As for the size of her part it was better not to judge such things in advance Hadnt he and Eddie believed John Cullum met in that same roadside store some three wheels north of here would have but a minor role to play in their story Yet it had turned out to be anything but All of this crossed his consciousness in less than a second information hunch Eddie would have called it delivered in a kind of brilliant mental shorthand No he said and jerked a thumb back over his shoulder Tell her Now TEN The boyJakehad fallen back against the seat with his hands lying limp at his sides The peculiar dog was looking anxiously up into the kids face but the kid didnt see him His eyes were closed and Irene Tassenbaum at first thought hed fainted SonJake I have him the boy said without opening his eyes Not Stephen KingI cant touch himbut the other one I have to slow him down How can I slow him down Mrs Tassenbaum had listened to her husband enough at workholding long muttered dialogues with himselfto know a selfdirected enquiry when she heard one Also she had no idea of whom the boy was speaking only that it wasnt Stephen King Which left about six billion other possibilities globally speaking Nevertheless she did answer because she knew what always slowed her down Too bad he doesnt need to go to the bathroom she said ELEVEN Strawberries arent out in Maine not this early in the season but there are raspberries Justine Anderson of May brook New York and Elvira Toothaker her Lovell friend are walking along the side of Route  which Elvira still calls The Old Fryeburg Road with their plastic buckets harvesting from the bushes which run for at least half a mile along the old rock wall Garrett McKeen built that wall a hundred years ago and it is to Garretts greatgrandson that RolandDeschain ofGilead is speaking at this very moment Ka is a wheel doya not kennit The two women have enjoyed their hours walk not because either of them has any great love of raspberries Justine reckons she wont even eat hers the seeds get caught in her teeth but because its given them a chance to catch up on their respective families and to laugh a little together about the years when their friendship was new and probably the most important thing in either girls life They met at Vassar College a thousand years ago so it does seem and carried the Daisy Chain together at graduation the year they were juniors This is what they are talking about when the blue minivanit is a  Dodge Caravan Justine recognizes the make and model because her oldest son had one just like it when his tribe started growingcomes around the curve by Melders German Restaurant and Brathaus Its all over the road looping from side to side first spuming up dust from the southbound shoulder then plunging giddily across the tar and spuming up more from the northbound one The second time it does thisrolling toward them now and coming at a pretty damned good clipJustine thinks it may actually go into the ditch and turn over turn turtle they used to say back in the forties when she and Elvira had been at Vassar but the driver hauls it back on the road just before that can happen Look out that persons drunk or something Justine says alarmed She pulls Elvira back but they find their way blocked by the old wall with its dressing of raspberry bushes The thorns catch at their slacks thank goodness neither of us was wearing shorts Justine will think later when she has time to think and pull out little puffs of cloth Justine is thinking she should put an arm around her friends shoulder and tumble them both over the thighhigh walldo a backflip just like in gym class all those years agobut before she can make up her mind to do it the blue van is by them and at the moment it passes its more or less on the road and not a danger to them Justine watches it go by in a muffled blare of rock music her heart thumping heavily in her chest the taste of something her body has dumpedadrenaline would be the most likely possibilityflat and metallic on her tongue And halfway up the hill the little blue van once again lurches across the white line The driver corrects the drift no overcorrects Once mare the blue van is on the righthand shoulder spuming up yellow dust for fifty yards Gosh I hope Stephen King sees that asshole Elvira says They have passed the writer half a mile or so back and said hello Probably everyone in town has seen him on his afternoon walk at one time or another As if the driver of the blue van has heard Elvira Toothaker call him an asshole the vans brakelights flare The van suddenly pulls all the way off the mad and stops When the door opens the ladies hear a louder blast of rock and roll music They also hear the drivera manyelling at someone Elvira and Justine just pity the person stuck driving with that guy on such a beautiful June afternoon You leave at alone he shouts That aint yoahs y hear And then the driver reaches back into the van brings out a cane and uses it to help him over the rock wall and into the bushes The van sits rumbling on the soft shoulder drivers door open emitting blue exhaust from one end and rock from the other Whats he doing Justine asks a little nervously Taking a leak would be my guess her friend replies But if Mr King back there is lucky maybe doing Number Two instead That might give him time to get off Route  and back onto Turtleback Lane Suddenly Justine doesnt feel like picking berries anymore She wants to go back home and have a strong cup of tea The man comes limping briskly out of the bushes and uses his cane to help him back over the rock wall Iguess he didnt need to Number Two Elvira says and as the bad driver climbs back into his blue van the two goingonold women look at each other and burst into giggles TWELVE Roland watched the old man give the woman instructionssomething about using Warringtons Road as a shortcutand then Jake opened his eyes To Roland the boy looked unutterably weary I was able to make him stop and take a leak he said Now hes fixing something behind his seat I dont know what it is but it wont keep him busy for long Roland this is bad Were awfully late We have to go Roland looked at the woman hoping that his decision not to replace her behind the wheel with die old man had been die right one Do you know where to go Do you understand Yes she said Up Warringtons to Route  We sometimes go to dinner at Warringtons I know that road Cant guarantee youll cut his path goin that way said the caretaker but it seems likely He bent down to pick up his hat and began to brush bits of freshly cut grass from it He did this with long slow strokes like a man caught in a dream Ayuh seems likely tme And then still like a man who dreams awake he tucked his hat beneath his arm raised a fist to his forehead and bent a leg to the stranger with the big revolver on his hip Why would he not The stranger was surrounded by white light THIRTEEN When Roland pulled himself back into the cab of the storekeepers trucka chore made more difficult by the rapidly escalating pain in his right hiphis hand came down on Jakes leg and just like that he knew what Jake had been keeping back and why He had been afraid that knowing might cause the gunslingers focus to drift It was not kashume the boy had felt or Roland would have felt it too How could there be kashume among them with the tet already broken Their special power something greater than all of them perhaps drawn from the Beam itself was gone Now they were just three friends four counting the bumbler united by a single purpose And they could save King Jake knew it They could save the writer and come a step closer to saving the Tower by doing so But one of them was going to die doing it Jake knew that too FOURTEEN An old sayingone taught to him by his fathercame to Roland then Ifka will say so let it be so Yes all right let it be so During the long years he had spent on the trail of the man in black the gunslinger would have sworn nothing in the universe could have caused him to renounce the Tower had he not literally killed his own mother in pursuit of it back at the start of his terrible career But in those years he had been friendless childless and he didnt like to admit it but it was true heartless He had been bewitched by that cold romance the loveless mistake for love Now he had a son and he had been given a second chance and he had changed Knowing that one of them must die in order to save the writerthat their fellowship must be reduced again and so soonwould not make him cry off But he would make sure that Roland of Gilead not Jake of New York provided the sacrifice this time Did the boy know that hed penetrated his secret No time to worry about that now Roland slammed the truckomobiles door shut and looked at the woman Is your name Irene he asked She nodded Drive Irene Do it as if Lord High Splitfoot were on your trail with rape on his mind do ya I beg Out Warringtons Road If we dont see him there out the SevenRoad Will you Youre fucking right said Mrs Tassenbaum and shoved the gearshift into First with real authority The engine screamed but the truck began to roll backward as if so frightened by the job ahead that it would rather finish up in the lake Then she engaged the clutch and the old International Harvester leaped ahead charging up the steep incline of the driveway and leaving a trail of blue smoke and burnt rubber behind Garrett McKeens greatgrandson watched them go with his mouth hanging open He had no idea what had just happened but he felt sure that a great deal depended on what would happen next Maybe everything FIFTEEN Needing to piss that bad was weird because pissing was the last thing Bryan Smith had done before leaving the Million Dollar Campground And once hed clambered over the fucking rock wall he hadnt been able to manage more than a few drops even though it had felt like a real bladderbuster at the time Bryan hopes hes not going to have trouble with his prostrate trouble with the old prostrate is the last thing he needs Hes got enough other problems by the hairy old Jesus Oh well now that hes stopped he might as well try to fix the Styrofoam cooler behind the seatthe dogs are still staring at it with their tongues hanging out He tries to wedge it underneath the seat but it wont gotheres not quite enough clearance What he does instead is to point a dirty finger at his rotties and tell them again to nemine the cooler and the meat inside thats his thats gonna be his suppah This time he even thinks to add a promise that later on hell mix a little of the hamburger in with their Purina if theyre good This is fairly deep thinking for Bryan Smith but the simple expedient of swinging the cooler up front and putting it in the unoccupied passenger seat never occurs to him You leave it alone he tells them again and hops back behind the wheel He slams the door takes a brief glance in the rearview mirror sees two old ladies back there he didnt notice them before because he wasnt exactly looking at the road when he passed them gives them a wave they never see through the Caravans filthy rear window and then pulls back onto Route  Now the radio is playing Gangsta Dream  by OwtRayJuss and Bryan turns it up once more swerving across the white line and into the northbound lane as he does sothis is the sort of person who simply cannot fix the radio without looking at it Rap rules And metal rules too All he needs now to make his day complete is a tune by OzzyCrazy Train would be good And some of those Marses bars SIXTEEN Mrs Tassenbaum came bolting out of the Cara Laughs driveway and onto Turtleback Lane in second gear the old pickup trucks engine overcranking if thered been an RPM gauge on the dashboard the needle would undoubtedly have been redlining the few tools in the back tapdancing crazily in the rusty bed Roland had only a bit of the touchhardly any at all compared to Jakebut he had met Stephen King and taken him down into the false sleep of hypnosis That was a powerful bond to share and so he wasnt entirely surprised when he touched the mind Jake hadnt been able to reach It probably didnt hurt that King was thinking about them He often does on his walks Roland thought When hes alone he hears the Song of the Turtle and knows that he has a job to do One hes shirking Well my friend that ends today If that was they could save him He leaned past Jake and looked at the woman Cant you make this godscursed thing go faster Yes she said I believe I can And then to Jake Can you really read minds son or is that only a game you and your friend play I cant read them exactly but I can touch them Jake said I hope to hell thats the truth she said because Turtlebacks hilly and only one lane wide in places If you sense someone coming the other way you have to let me know I will Excellent said Irene Tassenbaum She bared her teeth in a grin Really there was no longer any doubt this was the best thing that had ever happened to her The most exciting thing Now as well as hearing those singing voices she could see faces in the leaves of the trees on the sides of the road as if they were being watched by a multitude She could feel some tremendous force gathering all around them and she was possessed by a sudden giddy notion that if she floored the gaspedal of Chip McAvoys old rusty pickup it might go faster than the speed of light Powered by the energy she sensed around them it might outrace time itself Well lets just see about that she thought She swung the IH into the middle of Turtleback Lane then punched the clutch and yanked the gearshift into Third The old truck didnt go faster than die speed of light and it didnt outrace time but the speedometer needle climbed to fifty and then past The truck crested a hill and when it started down the other side it flew briefly into the air At least someone was happy Irene Tassenbaum shouted in excitement SEVENTEEN Stephen King takes two walks the short one and the long one The short one takes him out to the intersection ofWarringtons Road and Route  then back to his house Cam Laughs the same way That one is three miles The long walk which also happens to be the name of a book he once wrote under the Bachman name back before the world moved on takes him past the Warringtons intersection down Route  as far as the Slab City Road then all the way back Route  to Berry Hill bypassing Warringtons Road This walk returns him to his house by way of the north end of Turtleback Lane and is four miles This is the one he means to take today but when he gets back to the intersection of  and Warrington s he stops playing with the idea of going back the short way Hes always careful about walking on the shoulder of the public road though traffic is light on Route  even in summer the only time this highway ever gets busy is when the Fryeburg Fairs going on and that doesnt start until the first week of October Most of the sightlines are good anyway If a bad drivers coming or a drunk you can usually spot him half a mile away which gives you plenty of time to vacate the area Theres only one blind hill and thats the one directly beyond the Warringtons intersection Yet thats also an aerobic hill one that gets the old heart really pumping and isnt that what hes doing all these stupid walks for To promote what the TV talking heads call heart healthiness Hes quit drinking hes quit doping hes almost quit smoking he exercises What else is there Yet a voice whispers to him just the same Get off the main road it says Go on back to the house Youll have an extra hour before you have to meet the rest of them for the party on the other side of the lake You can do some work Maybe start the next Dark Tower story you know its been on your mind Aye so it has but he already has a story to work on and he likes it fine Going back to the tale of the Tower means swimming in deep water Maybe drowning there Yet he suddenly realizes standing here at this crossroads that if he goes back early he will begin He wont be able to help himself Hell have to listen to what he sometimes thinks of as Ves Ka Gan the Song of the Turtle and sometimes as Susannahs Song Hell junk the current story turn his back on the safety of the land and swim out into that dark water once again Hes done it four times before but this time hell have to swim all the way to the other side Sioim or drown No he says He speaks aloud and why not Theres no one to hear him out here He perceives faintly the attenuate sound of an approaching vehicleor is it two one on Route  and one on Warringtons Roadbut thats all No he says again Im gonna walk and then Im gonna party No more writing today Especially not that And so leaving the intersection behind he begins making his way up the steep hill with its short sightline He begins to walk toward the sound of the oncoming Dodge Caravan which is also the sound of his oncoming death The ka of the rational world wants him dead that of the Prim wants him alive and singing his song So it is that on this sunny afternoon in luestern Maine the irresistible force rushes toward the immovable object and for the first time since the Prim receded all worlds and all existence turn toward the Dark Tower which stands at the far end of Can Ka No Rey which is to say the Red Fields of None Even the Crimson King ceases his angry screaming For it is the Dark Tower that will decide Resolution demands a sacrifice King says and although no one hears but the birds and he has no idea what this means he is not disturbed Hes always muttering to himself its as though there is a Cave of Voices in his head one full of brilliantbut not necessarily intelligentmimics He walks swinging his arms beside his bluejeaned thighs unaware that his heart is isnt finishing its last few beats that his mind is isnt thinking its last few thoughts that his voices an arent making their last Delphic pronouncements VesKa Gan he says amused by the sound of ityet attracted too He has promised himself that hell try not to stuff his Dark Tower fantasies with unpronounceable words in some madeup not to say fuckedup languagehis editor Chuck Verrill in New York will only cut most of them if he doesbut his mind seems to be filling up with such words and phrases all the same ka katet sai soh cantoi that one at least is from another book of his Desperation taheen Can Tolkiens Cirith Ungol and H P Lovecrafts Great Blind Fiddler Nyarlahotep be far behind He laughs then begins to sing a song one of his voices has given him He thinks he will certainly use it in the next gunslinger book when he finally allows the Turtle its voice again Commalacomeone he sings as he walks theres a young man with a gun That young man lost his honey when she took it on the run And is that young man Eddie Dean Or is it Jake Chambers Eddie he says out loud Eddies the gunny with the honey Hes so deep in thought that at first he doesnt see the roof of the blue Dodge Caravan as it comes over the short horizon ahead of him and so does not realize this vehicle is not on the highway at all but on the soft shoulder where he is walking Nor does he hear the oncoming roar of the pickup truck behind him EIGHTEEN Bryan hears the scrape of the coolers lid even over the funky riprap beat of the music and when he looks in the rearview mirror hes both dismayed and outraged to see that Bullet always the more forward of the two rotties has leaped from the storage area at the rear of the van into the passenger compartment Bullets rear legs are up on the dirty seat his stubby tail is wagging happily and his nose is buried in Bryans cooler At this point any reasonable driver would pull over to the side of the road stop his vehicle and take care of his wayward animal Bryan Smith however has never gotten high marks for reason when behind the wheel and has the driving record to prove it Instead of pulling over he twists around to the right steering with his left hand and shoving ineffectually at the top of the rottweilers flat head with his right Leave at alone he shouts at Bullet as his minivan drifts first toward the righthand shoulder and then onto it Dinyou hear me Bullet Aw you foolish Leave at alone He actually succeeds in shoving the dogs head up for a moment but theres no fur for his fingers to grasp and Bullet while no genius is smart enough to know he has at least one more chance to grab the stuff in the white paper the stuff radiating that entrancing red smell He dips beneath Bryans hand and seizes the wrapped package of hamburger in his jaws Drop it Bryan screams You drop it right NOW In order to gain the purchase necessary to twist further in the drivers bucket he presses down firmly with both feet One of them unfortunately is on the accelerator The van puts on a burst of speed as it rushes toward the top of the hill At this moment in his excitement and outrage Bryan has completely forgotten where he is Route  and what hes supposed to be doing driving a van All he cares about is getting the package of meat out of Bullets jaws Gimme it he shouts tugging Tail wagging more furiously than ever to him its now a game as well as a meal Bullet tugs back Theres the sound of ripping butchers paper The van is now all the xoay off the road Beyond it is a grove of old pines lit by lovely afternoon light a haze of green and gold Bryan thinks only of the meat Hes not going to eat hamburg with dogdrool on it and you best believe it Gimme it he says not seeing the man in the path of his van not seeing the truck that has now pulled up just behind the man not seeing the trucks passenger door open or the lanky cowboytype who leaps out a revolver with big yellow grips spilling from the holster on his hip and onto the ground as he does Bryan Smiths world has narrowed to one very bad dog and one package of meat In the struggle for the meat bloodroses are blooming on the butchers paper like tattoos NINETEEN There he is the boy named Jake shouted but Irene Tassenbaum didnt need him to tell her Stephen King was wearing jeans a chambray workshirt and a baseball cap He was well beyond the place where the road to Warringtons intersected with Route  about a quarter of the way xxp the slope She punched the clutch downshifted to Second like a NASCAR driver with the checkered flag in view then turned hard left hauling on the wheel with both hands Chip McAvoys pickup truck teetered but did not roll She saw the twinkle of sun on metal as a vehicle coming the other way reached the top of the hill King was climbing She heard the man sitting by the door shout Pull in behind him She did as he told her even though she could now see that the oncoming vehicle was off the road and thus apt to broadside them Not to mention crushing Stephen King in a metal sandwich between them The door popped open and the one named Roland halfrolled halfjumped out of the truck After that things happened very very fast ONE What happened was lethally simple Rolands bad hip betrayed him He went to his knees with a cry of mingled rage pain and dismay Then the sunlight was blotted out as Jake leaped over him without so much as breaking stride Oy was barking crazily from the cab of the truck AkeAke AkeAke Jake noRoland shouted He saw it all with a terrible clarity The boy seized the writer around the waist as the blue vehicleneither a truck nor a car but seemingly a cross between the twobore down upon them in a roar of dissonant music Jake turned King to the left shielding him widi his body and so it was Jake the vehicle struck Behind the gunslinger who was now on his knees with his bleeding hands buried in the dirt the woman from the store screamed JAKE NORoland bellowed again but it was too late The boy he thought of as his son disappeared beneath the blue vehicle The gunslinger saw one small upraised handwould never forget itand then that was gone too King struck first by Jake and then by the weight of the van behind Jake was thrown to the edge of the little grove of trees ten feet from the point of impact He landed on his right side hitting his head on a stone hard enough to send the cap flying from his head Then he rolled over perhaps intending to try for his feet Or perhaps intending nothing at all his eyes were shocked zeroes The driver hauled on his vehicles steering wheel and it slipped past on Rolands left missing him by inches merely throwing dust into his face instead of running him down By then it was slowing the driver perhaps applying the machines brake now that it was too late The side squalled across the hood of the pickup truck slowing the van further but it was not done doing damage even so Before coming to a complete stop it struck King again this time as he lay on the ground Roland heard the snap of a breaking bone It was followed by the writers cry of pain And now Roland knew for sure about the pain in his own hip didnt he It had never been dry twist at all He scrambled to his feet only peripherally aware that his pain was entirely gone He looked at Stephen Kings unnaturally twisted body beneath the left front wheel of the blue vehicle and thought Good with unthinking savagery Good If someone has to die here let it be you To hell with Gan s navel to hell with the stories that come out of it to hell with the Tower let it be you and not my boy The bumbler raced past Roland to where Jake lay on his back at the rear of the van with blue exhaust blowing into his open eyes Oy did not hesitate he seized the Oriza pouch that was still slung over Jakes shoulder and used it to pull the boy away from the van doing it inch by inch his short strong legs digging up puffs of dust Blood was pouring from Jakes ears and the corners of his mouth The heels of his shorboots left a double line of tracks in the dirt and crisp brown pine needles Roland staggered to Jake and fell on his knees beside him His first thought was that Jake was all right after all The boys limbs were straight thank all the gods and the mark running across the bridge of his nose and down one beardless cheek was oil flecked with rust not blood as Roland had first assumed There was blood coming out of his ears yes and his mouth too but die latter stream might only be flowing from a cut in the lining of his cheek or Go and see to the writer Jake said His voice was calm not at all constricted by pain They might have been sitting around a little cookfire after a day on the trail waiting for what Eddie liked to call vittles or if he happened to be feeling particularly humorous as he often was wittles The writer can wait Roland said curdy thinking Ive been given a miracle One made by the combination of a boys yielding notquitefinished body and the soft earth that gave beneath him when that bastards truckomobile ran over him No Jake said He cant And when he moved trying to sit up his shirt pulled a little tighter against the top half of his body and Roland saw the dreadful concavity of the boys chest More blood poured from Jakes mouth and when he tried to speak again he began to cough instead Rolands heart seemed to twist like a rag inside his chest and there was a moment to wonder how it could possibly go on beating in the face of this Oy voiced a moaning cry Jakes name expressed in a halfhowl that made Rolands arms burst out in gooseflesh Dont try to talk Roland said Something may be sprung inside of you A rib mayhap two Jake turned his head to the side He spat out a mouthful of bloodsome of it ran down his cheek like chewing tobaccoand took a hold on Rolands wrist His grip was strong so was his voice each word clear Everythings sprung This is dyingI know because Ive done it before What he said next was what Roland had been thinking just before they started out from Cara Laughs If ka will say so let it be so See to the man we came to save It was impossible to deny the imperative in the boys eyes and voice It was done now the Ka of Nineteen played out to the end Except perhaps for King The man they had come to save How much of their fate had danced from the tips of his flying tobaccostained fingers All Some This Whatever the answer Roland could have killed him with his bare hands as he lay pinned beneath the machine that had struck him and never mind that King hadnt been driving the van if he had been doing what ka had meant him to be doing he never would have been here when the fool came calling and Jakes chest wouldnt have that terrible sunken look It was too much coming so soon after Eddie had been bushwhacked And yet Dont move he said getting up Oy dont lethim move I wont move Every word still clear still sure But now Roland could see blood also darkening the bottom of Jakes shirt and the crotch of his jeans blooming there like roses Once before he died and had come back But not from this world In this one death was always for keeps Roland turned to where the writer lay TWO When Bryan Smith tried to get out from behind the wheel of his van Irene Tassenbaum pushed him rudely back in His dogs perhaps smelling blood or Oy or both were barking and capering wildly behind him Now the radio was pounding out some new and utterly hellish heavy metal tune She thought her head would split not from the shock of what had just happened but from pure racket She saw the mans revolver lying on the ground and picked it up The small part of her mind still capable of coherent thought was amazed by the weight of the tiling Nevertheless she pointed it at the man then reached past him and punched the power button on the radio With the blaring fuzztone guitars gone she could hear birds as well as two barking dogs and one howling well one howling whateveriitwas Back your van off the guy you hit she said Slowly And if you run over the kid again when you do it I swear Ill blow your jackass head off Bryan Smith stared at her with bloodshot bewildered eyes What kid he asked THREE When the vans front wheel rolled slowly off the writer Roland saw that his lower body was twisted unnaturally to the right and a lump pushed out the leg of his jeans on that side His thighbone surely In addition his forehead had been split by the rock against which it had fetched up and the right side of his face was drowned in blood He looked worse than Jake worse by far but a single glance was enough to tell the gunslinger that if his heart was strong and the shock didnt kill him hed probably live through this Again he saw Jake seizing the man about the waist shielding him taking the impact with his own smaller body f You again King said in a low voice You remember me Yes Now King licked his lips Thirsty Roland had nothing to drink and wouldnt have given more than enough to wet Kings lips even if he had Liquid could induce vomiting in a wounded man and vomiting could lead to choking Sorry he said No Youre not He licked his lips again Jake Over there on the ground You know him King tried to smile Wrote him Wheres the one that was with you before Wheres Eddie Dead Roland said In the DevarToi King frowned Devar I dont know that No Thats why were here Why we had to come here One of my friends is dead another may be dying and the tet is broken All because one lazy fearful man stopped doing the job for which ka intended him No traffic on the road Except for the barking dogs the howling bumbler and the chirping birds the world was silent They might have been frozen in time Perhaps we are Roland thought He had now seen enough to believe that might be possible Anything might be possible I lost the Beam King said from where he lay on the carpet of needles at the edge of the trees The light of early summer streamed all around him that haze of green and gold Roland reached under King and helped him to sit up The writer cried ovxt in pain as the swollen ball of his right hip grated in the shattered compressed remains of its socket but he did not protest Roland pointed into the sky Fat white fairweather cloudslos dngeles the cowpokes of Mejis had called themhung motionless in the blue except for those directly above them There they hied rapidly across the sky as if blown by a narrow wind There Roland whispered furiously into the writers scraped dirtclogged ear Directly above you All around you Does thee not feel it Does thee not see it Yes King said I see it now Aye and twas always there You didnt lose it you turned your cowards eye away My friend had to save you for you to see it again Rolands left hand fumbled in his belt and brought out a shell At first his fingers wouldnt do their old dexterous trick they were trembling too badly He was only able to still them by reminding himself that the longer it took him to do this the greater the chance that they would be interrupted or that Jake would die while he was busy with this miserable excuse for a man He looked up and saw the woman holding his gun on the driver of the van That was good She was good why hadnt Gan given the story of the Tower to someone like her In any case his instinct to keep her with them had been true Even the infernal racket of dogs and bumbler had quieted Oy was licking the dirt and oil from Jakes face while in the van Pistol and Bullet were gobbling up the hamburger this time without interference from their master Roland turned back to King and the shell did its old sure dance across the backs of his fingers King went under almost immediately as most people did when theyd been hypnotized before His eyes were still open but now they seemed to look through the gunslinger beyond him Rolands heart screamed at him to get through this as quickly as he could but his head knew better You must not botch it Not unless you want to render Jakes sacrifice worthless The woman was looking at him and so was the vans driver as he sat in the open door of his vehicle Sai Tassenbaum was fighting it Roland saw but Bryan Smith had followed King into the land of sleep This didnt surprise the gunslinger much If the man had the slightest inkling of what hed done here hed be apt to seize any opportunity for escape Even a temporary one The gunslinger turned his attention back to the man who was he supposed his biographer He started just as he had before Days ago in his own life Over two decades ago in the writers Stephen King do you see me Gunslinger I see you very well When did you last see me When we lived in Bridgton When my tet was young When I was just learning how to write A pause and then he gave what Roland supposed was for him the most important way of marking time a thing that was different for every man When I was still drinking Are you deep asleep now Deep Are you under the pain Under it yes I thank you The billybumbler howled again Roland looked around terribly afraid of what it might signify The woman had gone to Jake and was kneeling beside him Roland was relieved to see Jake put an arm around her neck and draw her head down so he could speak into her ear If he was strong enough to do that Stop it You saw the changed shape of him under his shirt You cant afford to waste time on hope There was a cruel paradox here because he loved Jake he had to leave the business of Jakes dying to Oy and a woman they had met less than an hour ago Never mind His business now was with King Should Jake pass into the clearing while his back was turned ifka will say so let it be so Roland summoned his will and concentration He focused them to a burning point then turned his attention to the writer once more Are you Gan he asked abruptly not knowing why this question came to himonly that it was the right question No King said at once Blood ran into his mouth from the cut on his head and he spat it out never blinking Once I thought I was but that was just the booze And pride I suppose No writer is Ganno painter no sculptor no maker of music We are kaska Gan Not kaGan but kaska Gan Do you understand Do you do you ken Yes Roland said The prophets of Gan or the singers of Gan it could signify either or both And now he knew why he had asked And the song you sing is Ves Ka Gan Isnt it Oh yesl King said and smiled The Song of the Turde Its far too lovely for the likes of me who can hardly carry a tune I dont care Roland said He thought as hard and as clearly as his dazed mind would allow And now youve been hurt Am I paralyzed I dont know Nor care All I know is that youll live and when you can write again youll listen for the Song of the Turtle VesKa Gan as you did before Paralyzed or not And this time youll sing until the song is done All right Youll And UrsKa Gan the Song of the Bear King interrupted him Then he shook his head although this clearly hurt him despite the hypnotic state he was in UrsAKa Gan The Cry of die Bear The Scream of the Bear Roland didnt know which He would have to hope it didnt matter that it was no more than a writers quibble A car hauling a motor home went past the scene of die accident without slowing then a pair of large motorbicycles sped by heading the other way And an oddly persuasive thought came to Roland time hadnt stopped but they were for the time being dim Being protected in that fashion by the Beam which was no longer under attack and thus able to help at least a litde FOUR Tell him again There must be no misunderstanding And no weakening as he weakened before He bent down until his face was before Kings face their noses nearly touching This time youll sing until the song is done write until the tale is done Do you truly ken And they lived happily ever after until the end of their days King said dreamily I wish I could write that So do I And he did more than anything Despite his sorrow there were no tears yet his eyes felt like hot stones in his head Perhaps the tears would come later when the truth of what had happened here had a chance to sink in a litde Ill do as you say gunslinger No matter how the tale falls when the pages grow thin Kings voice was itself growing thin Roland thought he would soon fall into unconsciousness Im sorry for your friends truly I am Thank you Roland said still restraining the urge to put his hands around the writers neck and choke the life out of him He started to stand but King said something that stopped him Did yovi listen for her song as I told you to do For the Song of Susannah I yes Now King forced himself up on one elbow and although his strength was clearly failing his voice was dry and strong She needs you And you need her Leave me alone now Save your hate for those who deserve it more I didnt make your ka any more than I made Gan or the world and we both know it Put your foolishness behind youand your griefand do as youd have me do Kings voice rose to a rough shout his hand shot out and gripped Rolands wrist with amazing strength Finish the job At first nothing came out when Roland tried to reply He had to clear his throat and start again Sleep saisleep and forget everyone here except the man who hit you Kings eyes slipped closed Forget everyone here except the man who hit me You were taking your walk and this man hit you Walking and this man hit me No one else was here Not me not Jake not the woman No one else King agreed Just me and him Will he say the same Yar Very soon youll sleep deep You may feel pain later but you feel none now No pain now Sleep deep Kings twisted frame relaxed on the pine needles Yet before you sleep listen to me once more Roland said Im listening A woman may come to ywait Doee dream of love with men Are you asking if Im gay Maybe a latent homosexual King sounded weary but amused I dont know Roland paused I think so The answer is no King said Sometimes I dream of love with women A litde less now that Im older and probably not at all for awhile now That fucking guy really beat me up Not near so bad as he beat up mine Roland thought bitterly but he didnt say this IFee dream only of love with women its a woman that may come to you Do you say so King sounded faintly interested Yes If she comes shell be fair She may speak to you about the ease and pleasure of the clearing She may call herself Morphia Daughter of Sleep or Selena Daughter of the Moon She may offer you her arm and promise to take you there You must refuse I must refuse Even if you are tempted by her eyes and breasts Even then King agreed Why will you refuse sai Because the Song isnt done At last Roland was satisfied Mrs Tassenbaum was kneeling by Jake The gunslinger ignored both her and the boy and went to the man sitting slumped behind the wheel of the motorcarriage that had done all the damage This mans eyes were wide and blank his mouth slack A line of drool hung from his beardstubbly chin Do you hear me sai The man nodded fearfully Behind him both dogs had grown silent Four bright eyes regarded the gunslinger from between the seats Whats your name Bryan do it please youBryan Smith No it didnt please him at all Here was yet one more hed like to strangle Another car passed on the road and this time the person behind the wheel honked the horn as he or she passed Whatever their protection might be it had begun to grow thin Sai Smith you hit a man with your car or truckomobile or whatever it is thee calls it Bryan Smith began to tremble all over I aint never had so much as a parking ticket he whined and I have to go and run into the most famous man in the state My dogs us fightin Your lies dont anger me Roland said but the fear which brings them forth does Shut thy mouth Bryan Smith did as told The color was draining slowly but steadily from his face You were alone when you hit him Roland said No one here but you and the storyteller Do you understand I was alone Mister are you a walkin Never mind what I am You checked him and saw that he was still alive Still alive good Smith said I didnt mean to hurt nobody honest He spoke to you Thats how you knew he was alive Yes Smith smiled Then he frowned Whatd he say You dont remember You were excited and scared Scared and excited Excited and scared Yes I was You drive now As you drive youll wake up little by little And when you get to a house or a store youll stop and say theres a man hurt down the road A man who needs help Tell it back and be true Drive he said His hands caressed the steering wheel as if he longed to be gone immediately Roland supposed he did Wake up little by little When I get to a house or store tell them Stephen Kings hurt side of the road and he needs help I know hes still alive because he talked to me It was an accident He paused It wasnt my fault He was walking in the road A pause Probably Do I care upon whom the blame for this mess falls Roland asked himself In truth he did not King would go on writing either way And Roland almost hoped he would be blamed for it was indeed Kings fault hed had no business being out here in the first place Drive away now he told Bryan Smith I dont want to look at you anymore Smith started the van with a look of profound relief Roland didnt bother watching him go He went to Mrs Tassenbaum and fell on his knees beside her Oy sat by Jakes head now silent knowing his howls could no longer be heard by the one for whom he grieved What the gunslinger feared most had come to pass While he had been talking to two men he didnt like the boy whom he loved more than all odiersmore than hed loved anyone ever in his life even Susan Delgadohad passed beyond him for the second time Jake was dead FIVE He talked to you Roland said He took Jake in his arms and began to rock him gently back and forth The Rizas clanked in their pouch Already he could feel Jakes body growing cool Yes she said What did he say He told me to come back for you after the business here is done Those were his exact words And he said Tell my father I love him Roland made a sound choked and miserable deep in his throat He was remembering how it had been in Fedic after they had stepped through the door Hile Father Jake had said Roland had taken him in his arms then too Only then he had felt the boys beating heart He would give anything to feel it beat again There was more she said but do we have time for it now especially when I could tell you later Roland took her point immediately The story both Bryan Smith and Stephen King knew was a simple one There was no place in it for a lank travelscoured man with a big gun nor a woman with graying hair certainly not for a dead boy with a bag of sharpedged plates slung over his shoulder and a machinepistol in the waistband of his pants The only question was whether or not the woman would come back at all She was not the first person he had attracted into doing things they might not ordinarily have done but he knew things might look different to her once she was away from him Asking for her promiseDo you swear to come back for me sat Do you swear on this boys stilled heartwould do no good She could mean every word here and then think better of it once she was over the first hill Yet when hed had a chance to take the shopkeeper who owned the truck he didnt Nor had he swapped her for the old man cutting the grass at the writers house Later will do he said For now hurry on your way If for some reason you feel you cant come back here Ill not hold it against you Where would you go on your own she asked him Where would you know to go This isnt your world Is it Roland ignored the question If there are people still here the first time you come backpeace officers guards OThe watch bluebacks I dont knowdrive past without stopping Come back again in half an hours time If theyre still here drive on again Keep doing that until theyre gone Will they notice me going back and forth I dont know he said Will they She considered then almost smiled The cops in this part of the world Probably not He nodded accepting her judgment When you feel its safe stop You wont see me but Ill see you Ill wait until dark If youre not here by then I go Ill come for you but I wont be driving that miserable excuse for a truck when I do she said Ill be driving a MercedesBenz S She said this with some pride Roland had no idea what a MercedesBends was but he nodded as though he did Go Well talk later after you come back If you come back he thought I think you may want this she said and slipped his revolver back into its holster Thankeesai Youre welcome He watched her go to the old truck which he thought shed rather come to like despite her dismissive words and haul herself up by the wheel And as she did he realized there was something he needed something that might be in the truck Whoa Mrs Tassenbaum had put her hand on the key in the ignition Now she took it off and looked at him inquiringly Roland settled Jake gently back to the earth beneath which he must soon lie it was that thought which had caused him to call out and got to his feet He winced and put his hand to his hip but that was only habit There was no pain What she asked as he approached If I dont go soon It wouldnt matter if she went at all Yes I know He looked in the bed of the truck Along with the careless scatter of tools there was a square shape under a blue tarpaulin The edges of the tarp had been folded beneath the object to keep it from blowing away When Roland pulled the tarp free he saw eight or ten boxes made of the stiff paper Eddie called cardboard Theyd been pushed together to make the square shape The pictures printed on the cardboard told him they were boxes of beer He wouldnt have cared if they had been boxes of high explosive It was the tarpaulin he wanted He stepped back from the truck with it in his arms and said Wow you can go She grasped the key that started the engine once more but did not immediately turn it Sir said she I am sorry for your loss I just wanted to tell yovi that I can see what that boy meant to you Roland Deschain bowed his head and said nothing Irene Tassenbaum looked at him for a moment longer reminded herself that sometimes words were useless things then started the engine and slammed the door He watched her drive into the road her use of the clutch had already grown smooth and sure making a tight turn so she could drive north back toward East Stoneham Sorry for your loss And now he was alone with that loss Alone with Jake For a moment Roland stood surveying the litde grove of trees beside the highway looking at two of the three who had been drawn to this place a man unconscious and a boy dead Rolands eyes were dry and hot throbbing in their sockets and for a moment he was sure that he had again lost the ability to weep The idea horrified him If he was incapable of tears after all of thisafter what hed regained and then lost againwhat good was any of it So it was an immense relief when the tears finally came They spilled from his eyes quieting their nearly insane blue glare They ran down his dirty cheeks He cried almost silently but there was a single sob and Oy heard it He raised his snout to the corridor of fastmoving clouds and howled a single time at them Then he too was silent SIX Roland carried Jake deeper into the woods with Oy padding at his heel That the bumbler was also weeping no longer surprised Roland he had seen him cry before And the days when he had believed Oys demonstrations of intelligence and empathy might be no more than mimicry had long since passed Most of what Roland thovight about on that short walk was a prayer for the dead he had heard Cuthbert speak on their last campaign together the one that had ended at Jericho Hill He doubted that Jake needed a prayer to send him on but the gunslinger needed to keep his mind occupied because it did not feel strong just now if it went too far in the wrong direction it would certainly break Perhaps later he could indulge in hysteriaor even irina the healing madnessbut not now He would not break now He would not let the boys death come to nothing The hazy greengold summerglow that lives only in forests and old forests at that like the one where the Bear Shardik had rampaged deepened It fell through the trees in dusky beams and the place where Roland finally stopped felt more like a church than a clearing He had gone roughly two hundred paces from the road on a westerly line Here he set Jake down and looked about He saw two rusty beercans and a few ejected shellcasings probably the leavings of hunters He tossed them further into the woods so the place would be clean Then he looked at Jake wiping away his tears so he could see as clearly as possible The boys face was as clean as the clearing Oy had seen to that but one of Jakes eyes was still open giving the boy an evil winky look that must not be allowed Roland rolled the lid closed wiui a finger and when it sprang back up again like a balky windowshade he thought he licked the ball of his thumb and rolled the lid shut again This time it stayed closed There was dust and blood on Jakes shirt Roland took it off then took his own off and put it on Jake moving him like a doll in order to get it on him The shirt came almost to Jakes knees but Roland made no attempt to tuck it in this way it covered the bloodstains on Jakes pants All of this Oy watched his goldringed eyes bright with tears Roland had expected the soil to be soft beneath the thick carpet of needles and it was He had a good start on Jakes grave when he heard die sound of an engine from the roadside Other motorcarriages had passed since hed carried Jake into the woods but he recognized the dissonant beat of this one The man in the blue vehicle had come back Roland hadnt been entirely sure he would Stay he murmured to the bumbler Guard your master But that was wrong Stay and guard your friend It wouldnt have been unusual for Oy to repeat the command Saywas about the best he could manage in the same low voice but this time he said nothing Roland watched him lie down beside Jakes head however and snap a fly out of the air when it came in for a landing on the boys nose Roland nodded satisfied then started back the way he had come SEVEN Bryan Smith was out of his motorcarriage and sitting on the rock wall by the time Roland got back in view of him his cane drawn across his lap Roland had no idea if the cane was an affectation or something the man really needed and didnt care about this either King had regained some soupy version of consciousness and the two men were talking Please tell me its just sprained the writer said in a weak worried voice Nope Id say that legs broke in six maybe seven places Now that hed had time to settle down and maybe work out a story Smith sounded not just calm but almost happy Cheer me up why dont you King said The visible side of his face was very pale but the flow of blood from the gash on his temple had slowed almost to a stop Have you got a cigarette Nope Smith said in that same weirdly cheerful voice Gave em up Although not particularly strong in the touch Roland had enough of it to know this wasnt so But Smith only had three and didnt want to share them with this man who could probably afford enough cigarettes to fill Smiths entire van with them Besides Smith thought Besides folks who been in a accident aint supposed to smoke Smith said virtuously King nodded Hard to breathe anyway he said Trolly bust a rib or two too My names Bryan Smith Im the one who hit you Sorry He held out his hand andincrediblyKing shook it Nothin like this ever happened to me before Smith said I aint ever had so much as a parkin ticket King might or might not have known this for the lie it was but chose not to comment on it there was something else on his mind Mr SmithBryanwas anyone else here In the trees Roland stiffened Smith actually appeared to consider this He reached into his pocket pulled out a Mars bar and began to unwrap it Then he shook his head Just you n me But I called and Rescue up to the store They said someone was real close Said theyd be here in no time Dont you worry You know who I am God yeah Bryan Smith said and chuckled He took a bite of the candy bar and talked through it Reckonized you right away I seen all your movies My favorite was the one about the Saint Bernard What was that dogs name Cujo King said This was a word Roland knew one Susan Delgado had sometimes used when they were alone together In Mejis cujo meant sweet one Yeah That was great Scary as hell Im glad that litde boy lived In the book he died Then King closed his eyes and lay back waiting Smith took another bite a humongous one this time I liked the show they made about the clown too Very cool King made no reply His eyes stayed closed but Roland thought the rise and fall of the writers chest looked deep and steady That was good Then a truck roared toward them and swerved to a stop in front of Smiths van The new motorcarriage was about the size of a funeral bucka but orange instead of black and equipped with flashing lights Roland was not displeased to see it roll over the tracks of the storekeepers truck before coming to a stop Roland halfexpected a robot to get out of the coach but it was a man He reached back inside for a black sawbones bag Satisfied that everything here would be as well as it could be Roland returned to where he had laid Jake moving with all his old unconscious grace he cracked not a single twig surprised not a single bird into flight EIGHT Would it surprise you after all weve seen together and all the secrets weve learned to know that at quarter past five that afternoon Mrs Tassenbaum pulled Chip McAvoys old truck into the driveway of a house weve already visited Probably not because ka is a wheel and all it knows how to do is roll When last we visited here in  both it and the boathouse on the shore of Keywadin Pond were white with green trim The Tassenbaums who bought the place in  had painted it an entirely pleasing shade of cream no trim to Irene Tassenbaums way of thinking trim is for folks who cant make up their minds They have also put a sign reading SUNSET COTTAGE on a post at the head of the driveway and as far as Uncle Sams concerned its part of their mailing address but to the local folk this house at the south end of Keywadin Pond will always be the old John Cullum place She parked the truck beside her dark red Benz and went inside mentally rehearsing what shed tell David about why she had the local shopkeepers pickup but Sunset Cottage hummed with the peculiar silence only empty places have she picked up on it immediately She had come back to a lot of empty placesapartments at the beginning bigger and bigger houses as time went byover the years Not because David was out drinking or womanizing good Lord forbid No he and his friends had usually been out in one garage or another one basement workshop or another drinking cheap wine and discount beer from the Beverage Barn creating the Internet plus all the software necessary to support it and make it userfriendly The profits although most would not believe it had only been a sideeffect The silence to which their wives so often came home was another After awhile all that humming silence kind of got to you made you mad even but not today Today she was delighted the house was just hers Are you going to sleep with Marshal Dillon if he wants you It wasnt a question she even had to think about The answer was yes she would sleep with him if he wanted her sideways backward doggystyle or straightup fuck if that was his pleasure He wouldnteven if he hadnt been grieving for his young sai son friend he wouldnt have wanted to sleep with her she with her wrinkles she with her hair going gray at the roots she with the spare tire which her designer clothes could not quite conceal The very idea was ludicrous But yes If he wanted her she would She looked on the fridge and there under one of the magnets that dotted it WE ARE POSITHONICS BUILDING THE FUTURE ONE CIRCUIT AT A TIME this one said was a brief note Ree You wanted me to relax so Im relaxing dammit Ie gone fishin with Sonny Emerson tother end of the lake ayuh ayuh Will be back by  unless the bugs are too bad If I bring you a bass will you cook amp clean D PS Something going on at the store big enufto rate  police cars WALKINS maybe  If you hear fill me in Shed told him she was going to the store this afternooneggs and milk that shed of course never gottenand he had nodded Yes dear yes dear But his note held no hint of worry no sense that he even remembered what shed said Well what else did she expect When it came to David info entered ear A info exited ear B Welcome to Genius World She turned the note over plucked a pen from a teacup filled with them hesitated then wrote David Something has happened and I have to be gone for awhile  days at least I think maybe  or  Please dont worry about me and dont call anyone ESPECIALLY NOT POLICE Its a stray cat thin Would he understand that She thought he would if he remembered how theyd met At die Santa Monica ASPCA that had been ainong the stacked rows of kennels in back love blooms as the mongrels yap It sounded like James Joyce to her by God He had brought in a stray dog hed found on a suburban street near the apartment where he was staying with half a dozen egghead friends Shed been looking for a kitten to liven up what was an essentially friendless life Hed had all his hair then As for her shed thought women who dyed theirs mildly amusing Time was a thief and one of the first things it took was your sense of humor She hesitated then added Love you Ree Was that true any longer Well let it stand either way Crossing out what youd written in ink always looked ugly She put the note back on the fridge with the same magnet to hold it in place She got the keys to the Mercedes out of the basket by the door then remembered the rowboat still tied up at the little stub of dock behind the store It would be all right there But then she thought of something else someuiing the boy had told her He doesnt know about money She went into the pantry where they always kept a slim roll of fifties there were places out here in the boondocks where she would be willing to swear theyd never even heard of MasterCard and took three She started away shrugged went back and took the other three as well Why not She was living dangerously today On her way out she paused again to look at the note And then for absolutely no reason she could understand she took the Positronics magnet away and replaced it with an orange slice Then she left Never mind the future For the time being she had enough to keep her occupied in the present NINE The emergency bucka was gone bearing the writer to die nearest hospital or infirmary Roland assumed Peace officers had come just as it left and they spent perhaps half an hour talking with Bryan Smith The gunslinger could hear the palaver from where he was just over the first rise The bluebacks questions were clear and calm Smiths answers litde more than mumbles Roland saw no reason to stop working If the blues came back here and found him he would deal with them Just incapacitate them unless they made that impossible gods knew there had been enough killing But he would bury his dead one way or another He would bury his dead The lovely greengold light of the clearing deepened Mosquitoes found him but he did not stop what he was doing in order to slap them merely let them drink their fill and then lumber off heavy with dieir freight of blood He heard engines starting as he finished handdigging the grave die smooth roar of two cars and the more uneven sound of Smiths vanmobile He had heard the voices of only two peace officers which meant that unless there had been a third blueback with nothing to say they were allowing Smith to drive away by himself Roland thought this rather odd butlike the question of whether or not King was paralyzedit was none of his matter or mind All diat mattered was diis all diat mattered was seeing to his own He made three trips to collect stones because a grave dug by hand must necessarily be a shallow one and animals even in such a tame world as this are always hungry He stacked the stones at the head of the hole a scar lined with earth so rich it could have been black satin Oy lay by Jakes head watching die gunslinger come and go saying nothing Hed always been different from his kind as they were since the world had moved on Roland had even speculated that it was Oys extraordinary chattiness that had caused the others in his tet to expel him and not gently either When theyd come upon this fellow not too far from the town of River Crossing hed been scrawny to the point of starvation and with a halfhealed bitemark on one flank The bumbler had loved Jake from the first Thats as clear as Earth needs Cort might have said or Rolands own father for that matter And it was to Jake the bumbler had talked the most Roland had an idea that Oy might fall mostly silent now that the boy was dead and this thought was another way of defining what was lost He remembered the boy standing before the people of Calla Bryn Sturgis in the torchlight his face young and fair as if he would live forever  am Jake Chambers son of Elmer the Line of Eld the katet of the Ninety and Nine he had said and oh aye for here he was in the Ninety and Nine with his grave all dug clean and ready for him Roland began to weep again He put his hands over his face and rocked back and forth on his knees smelling the sweet aromatic needles and wishing he had cried off before ka that old and patient demon had taught him the real price of his quest He would have given anything to change what had happened anything to close this hole with nothing in it but this was the world where time ran just one way TEN When he had gained control of himself again he wrapped Jake carefully in the blue tarpaulin fashioning a kind of hood around the still pale face He would close that face away for good before refilling the grave but not until Oy he asked Will you say goodbye Oy looked at Roland and for a moment the gunslinger wasnt sure he understood Then the bumbler extended his neck and caressed the boys cheek a last time with his tongue I Ake he said Bye Jake or I ache it came to the same The gunslinger gathered the boy up how light he was this boy who had jumped from the barn loft with Benny Slightman and stood against the vampires with Pere Callahan how curiously light as if the growing weight of him had departed with his life and lowered him into the hole A crumble of dirt spilled down one cheek and Roland wiped it away That done he closed his eyes again and diought Then at lasthaltinglyhe began He knew that any translation into the language of this place would be clumsy but he did the best he could If Jakes spiritman lingered near it was this language that he would understand Time flies knells call life passes so hear my prayer Birth is nothing but death begun so hear my prayer Death is speechless so hear my speech The words drifted away into the haze of green and gold Roland let them then set upon the rest He spoke more quickly now This is Jake who served his ka and his tet Say true May the forgiving glance of Smana heal his heart Say please May the arms of Gan raise him from the darkness of this earth Say please Surround him Gan with light Fill him Chloe with strength If he is thirsty give him water in the clearing If he is hungry give him food in the clearing May his life on this earth and the pain of his passing become as a dream to his waking soul and let his eyes fall upon every lovely sight let him find the friends that were lost to him and let every one whose name he calls call his in return This is Jake who lived well loved his own and died as ka would have it Each man owes a death This is Jake Give him peace He knelt a moment longer with his hands clasped between his knees thinking he had not understood the true power of sorrow nor the pain of regret until this moment I cannot bear to let him go But once again that cruel paradox if he didnt the sacrifice was in vain Roland opened his eyes and said Goodbye Jake I love you dear Then he closed the blue hood around the boys face against the rain of earth that must follow ELEVEN When the grave was filled and the rocks placed over it Roland walked back to the clearing by the road and examined the tale the various tracks told simply because there was nothing else to do When that meaningless task was finished he sat down on a fallen log Oy had stayed by the grave and Roland had an idea he might bide there He would call the bumbler when Mrs Tassenbaum returned but knew Oy might not come if he didnt it meant that Oy had decided to join his friend in the clearing The bumbler would simply stand watch by Jakes grave until starvation or some predator took him The idea deepened Rolands sorrow but he would bide by Oys decision Ten minutes later the bumbler came out of the woods on his own and sat down by Rolands left boot Good boy Roland said and stroked the bumblers head Oy had decided to live It was a small thing but it was a good thing Ten minutes after that a dark red car rolled almost silently up to the place where King had been struck and Jake killed It pulled over Roland opened the door on the passenger side and got in still wincing against pain that wasnt there Oy jumped up between his feet without being asked lay down with his nose against his flank and appeared to go to sleep Did you see to your boy Mrs Tassenbaum asked pulling away Yes Thankeesai I guess I cant put a marker there she said but later on I could plant something Is there something you think he might like Roland looked up and for the first time since Jakes death he smiled Yes he said A rose TWELVE They rode for almost twenty minutes without speaking She stopped at a small store over the Bridgton town line and pumped gas MOBIL a brand Roland recognized from his wanderings When she went in to pay he looked up at los dngeles running clear and true across the sky The Path of the Beam and stronger already unless that was just his imagination He supposed it didnt matter if it was If the Beam wasnt stronger now it soon would be They had succeeded in saving it but Roland felt no gladness at the idea When Mrs Tassenbaum came out of the store she was holding a singletstyle shirt with a picture of a buckawagon on ita real buckawagonand words written in a circle He could make out HOME but nothing else He asked her what the words said BRIDGTON OLD HOME DAYS JULY TH TO JULY TH  she told him It doesnt really matter what it says as long as it covers your chest Sooner or later well want to stop and theres a saying we have in these parts No shirt no shoes no service Your boots look beatup and busted down but I guess theyll get you through the door of most places But topless Huhuh no way Jose Ill get you a better shirt later onone with a collarand some decent pants too Those jeans are so dirty I bet theyd stand up on their own She engaged in a brief but furious interior debate then plunged Youve got Im going to say roughly two billion scars And thats just on the part of you I can see Roland did not respond to this Do you have money he asked I got three hundred dollars when I went back to the house to get my car and I had thirty or forty with me Also credit cards but your late friend said to use cash as long as I could Until you go on by yourself if possible He said there might be folks looking for you He called them low men Roland nodded Yes there would be low men out there and after all he and his katet had done to thwart the plans of their master theyd be twice as eager to have his head Preferably smoking and on the end of a stick Also the head of sai Tassenbaum if they found out about her What else did Jake tell you Roland asked That I must take you to New York City if you wanted to go there He said theres a door there that will take you to a place called Faydag Was there more Yes He said there was another place you might want to go before you used the door She gave him a timid litde sideways glance Is there He considered this then nodded He also spoke to the dog It sounded as if he was giving the dog orders Instructions She looked at him doubtfully Could that be Roland thought it could The woman Jake could only ask As for Oy well it might explain why the bumbler hadnt stayed by the grave much as he might have wanted to For awhile they traveled in silence The road they were on led to a much busier one filled with cars and trucks running at high speed in many lanes She had to stop at a tollbooth and give money to get on The tolltaker was a robot with a basket for an arm Roland thought he might be able to sleep but he saw Jakes face when he closed his eyes Then Eddies with the useless bandage covering his forehead If this is what comes when I dose my eyes he thought what will my dreams be like He opened his eyes again and watched as she drove down a smooth paved ramp slipping into the heavy flow of traffic without a pause He leaned over and looked up through the window on his side There were the clouds los dngeles traveling above them in the same direction They were still on the Path of the Beam THIRTEEN Mister Roland She thought he had been dozing with his eyes open Now he turned to her from where he sat in the passenger bucket seat with his hands in his lap the good one folded over the mutilated one hiding it She thought she had never seen anyone who looked less like he belonged in a MercedesBenz Or any automobile She also thought she had never seen a man who looked so tired But hes not used up I dont think hes anywhere near used up although he may think otherwise The animal Oy Oy yes The bumbler looked up at the sound of his name but didnt repeat it as he might have done only yesterday Is it a dog It isnt exactly is it He not it And no hes not a dog Irene Tassenbaum opened her mouth then closed it again This was difficult because silence in company did not come naturally to her And she was with a man she found attractive even in his grief and exhaustion perhaps to some degree because of those things A dying boy had asked her to take this man to New York City and get him to the places he needed to go once they were there Hed said that his friend knew even less about New York than he did about money and she believed that was true But she also believed this man was dangerous She wanted to ask more questions but what if he answered them She understood that the less she knew the better her chance once he was gone of merging into the life shed been living at quarter to four this afternoon To merge the way you merged onto the turnpike from a side road That would be best She turned on the radio and found a station playing Amazing Grace The next time she looked at her strange companion she saw that he was looking out at the darkening sky and weeping Then she chanced to look down and saw something much odder something that moved her heart as it had not been moved in fifteen years when she had miscarried her one and only effort to have a child The animal the notdog the Oy he was crying too FOURTEEN She got off  just over the Massachusetts state line and checked them into a pair of sidebyside rooms in a dump called the Sea Breeze Inn She hadnt thought to bring her driving glasses the ones she called her bugsasshole glasses as in when Im wearing these things I can see up a bugs asshole and she didnt like driving at night anyway Bugsasshole glasses or not driving at night fried her nerves and that was apt to bring on a migraine With a migraine she would be of no use to either of them and her Imitrex was sitting uselessly in the medicine cabinet back in East Stoneham Plus she told Roland if this Tet Corporation youre looking for is in a business building you wont be able to get inside until Monday anyway Probably not true this was the sort of man who got into places when he wanted You couldnt keep him out She guessed that was part of his attraction to a certain kind of woman In any case he did not object to the motel No he would not go out to dinner with her and so she found the nearest bearable fastfood franchise and brought back a late dinner from RFC They ate in Rolands room Irene fixed Oy a plate without being asked Oy ate a single piece of the chicken holding it neatly between his paws then went into the bathroom and appeared to fall asleep on the mat in front of the tub Why do they call this the Sea Breeze Roland asked Unlike Oy he was eating some of everything but he did it with no sign of pleasure He ate like a man doing work I get no smell of the ocean Well probably you can when the winds in the right quarter and blowing a hurricane she said Its what we call poetic license Roland He nodded showing unexpected to her at least understanding Pretty lies he said Yes I suppose She turned on the television thinking it would divert him and was shocked by his reaction although she told herself that what she felt was amusement When he told her he couldnt see it she had no idea how to take what he was saying her first thought that it was some sort of oblique and teddibly intellectual criticism of the medium itself Then she thought he might be speaking in equally oblique fashion of his sorrow his state of mourning It wasnt until he told her that he heard voices yes but saw only lines which made his eyes water that she realized he was telling her the literal truth he could not see the pictures on the screen Not the rerun of Roseanne not the infomercial for AbFlex not the talking head on the local news She held on until the story about Stephen King taken by LifeFlight helicopter to Central Maine General in Lewiston where an earlyevening operation seemed to have saved his right legcondition listed as fair more operations ahead road to recovery expected to be long and uncertain then turned the TV off She bussed up the trashthere was always so much more of it from a KFC meal somehowbade Roland an uncertain goodnight which he returned in a distracted Imnotreallyhere way that made her nervous and sad then went to her own room next door There she watched an hour of an old movie in which Yul Brynner played a robot cowboy that had run amok before turning it off and going into the bathroom to brush her teeth There she realized that she hadof course dollinkforgotten her toothbrush She did the best she could with her finger then lay down on the bed in her bra and panties no nightgown either She spent an hour like that before realizing that she was listening for sounds from beyond the paperthin wall and for one sound in particular the crash of the gun he had considerately not worn from the car to the motel room The single loud shot that would mean he had ended his sorrow in the most direct fashion When she couldnt stand the quiet from the other side of the wall any longer she got up put her clothes back on and went outside to look at the stars There sitting on the curb she found Roland with the notdog at his side She wanted to ask how he had gotten out of his room without her being aware of it the walls were so thin and she had been listening so hard but she didnt She asked him what he was doing out here instead and found herself unprepared for both his answer and for the utter nakedness of the face he turned to hers She kept expecting a patina of civilization from hima nod in the direction of the nicetiesbut there was none of that His honesty was terrifying Im afraid to go to sleep he said Im afraid my dead friends will come to me and that seeing them will kill me She looked at him steadily in the mixture of light that which fell from her room and the horrible heardess Halloween glare of the parkinglot arc sodiums Her heart was beating hard enough to shake her entire chest but when she spoke her voice sounded calm enough Would it help if I lay down with you He considered this and nodded I think it would She took his hand and they went into the room she had rented him He stripped off his clothes with no sign of embarrassment and she looked awestruck and afraid at the scars which lapped and dented his upper body the red pucker of a knifeslash on one bicep the milky weal of a burn on another the white crisscross of lashmarks between and on the shoulderblades three deep dimples that could only be old bulletholes And of course there were the missing fingers on his right hand She was curious but knew shed never dare ask about those She took off her own outer clothes hesitated then took off her bra as well Her breasts hung down and there was a dented scar of her own on one from a lumpectomy instead of a bullet And so what She never would have been a Victorias Secret model even in her prime And even in her prime shed never mistaken herself for tits and ass attached to a lifesupport system Nor had ever let anyone elseincluding her husbandmake the same mistake She left her panties on however If she had trimmed her bush maybe she would have taken them off If shed known getting up that morning that she would be lying down with a strange man in a cheap hotel room while some weird animal snoozed on the bathmat in front of the tub Of course she would have packed a toothbrush and a tube of Crest too When he put her arms around her she gasped and stiffened then relaxed But very slowly His hips pressed against her bottom and she felt the considerable weight of his package but it was apparently only comfort he had in mind his penis was limp He clasped her left breast and ran his thumb into the hollow of the scar left by the lumpectomy Whats this he asked Well she said now her voice was no longer even according to my doctor in another five years it would have been cancer So they cut it out before it could I dont know exactlymetastasizing comes later if it comes at all Before it could flower he asked Yes Right Good Her nipple was now as hard as a rock and surely he must feel that Oh this was so weird Why is your heart beating so hard he asked Do I frighten you I yes Dont be frightened he said Killings done A long pause in the dark They could hear the faint drone of cars on the turnpike For now he added Oh she said in a small voice Good His hand on her breast His breath on her neck After some endless time that might have been an hour or only five minutes his breathing lengthened and she knew he had gone to sleep She was pleased and disappointed at the same time A few minutes later she went to sleep herself and it was the best rest shed had in years If he had bad dreams of his gone friends he did not disturb her with them When she woke in the morning it was eight oclock and he was standing naked at the window looking out through a slit hed made in the curtains with one finger Did you sleep she asked A little Will we go on FIFTEEN They could have been in Manhattan by three oclock in the afternoon and the drive into the city on a Sunday would have been far easier than during the Monday morning rush hour but hotel rooms in New York were expensive and even doubling up would have necessitated breaking out a credit card They stayed at a Motel  in Harwich Connecticut instead She took only a single room and that night he made love to her Not because he exactly wanted to she sensed but because he understood it was what she wanted Perhaps what she needed It was extraordinary although she could not have said precisely how despite the feel of all those scars beneath her handssome rough some smooththere was the sense of making love to a dream And that night she did dream It was a field filled with roses she dreamed of and a huge Tower made of slateblack stone standing at the far end Partway up red lamps glowed only she had an idea they werent lamps at all but eyes Terrible eyes She heard many singing voices thousands of them and understood that some were the voices of his lost friends She awoke with tears on her cheeks and a feeling of loss even though he was still beside her After today shed see him no more And that was for the best Still she would have given anything in her life to have him make love to her again even though she understood it had not been really her he had been making love to even when he came into her his thoughts had been far away with those voices Those lost voices ONE On the morning of Monday the st of June in the year of the sun shone down on New York City just as if Jake Chambers did not lie dead in one world and Eddie Dean in another as if Stephen King did not lie in a Lewiston hospitals Intensive Care ward drifting out into the light of consciousness only for brief intervals as if Susannah Dean did not sit alone with her grief aboard a train racing on ancient chancy tracks across the dark wastes of Thunderclap toward the ghosttown of Fedic There were others who had elected to accompany her on her journey at least that far but shed asked them to give her space and they had complied with her wish She knew she would feel better if she could cry but so far she hadnt been able to do thata few random tears like meaningless showers in the desert was the best she had been able to managealthough she had a terrible feeling that things were worse than she knew Fuck dat aint no feelin Detta crowed contemptuously from her place deep inside as Susannah sat looking out at the dark and rocky wastelands or the occasional ruins of towns and villages that had been abandoned when the world moved on You havin a jennawine intuition girl Only question you caint answer is whether it be ole long tall and ugly or Young Master Sxveetness now visitin wityo man in the clearin Please no she murmured Please not either of them God I cant stand another one But God remained deaf to her prayer Jake remained dead the Dark Tower remained standing at the end of CanKa No Rey casting its shadow over a million shouting roses and in New York the hot summer sun shone down on the just and the unjust alike Can you give me hallelujah Thankeesai Now somebody yell me a big old Godbomb amen TWO Mrs Tassenbaum left her car at Sir SpeedyPark on Sixtythird Street the sign on the sidewalk showed a knight in armor behind the wheel of a Cadillac his lance sticking jauntily out of the drivers window where she and David rented two stalls on a yearly basis They kept an apartment nearby and Irene asked Roland if he would like to go there and clean up although the man actually didnt look all that bad she had to admit Shed bought him a fresh pair of jeans and a white buttonup shirt which he had rolled to the elbows she had also bought a comb and a tube of hairmousse so strong its molecular makeup was probably closer to SuperGlue than it was to Vitalis With the unruly mop of grayflecked hair combed straight back from his brow she had revealed the spare good looks and angular features of an interesting crossbreed a mixture of Quaker and Cherokee was what she imagined The bag of Orizas was once more slung over his shoulder His gun the holster wrapped in its shellbelt was in there too He had covered it from enquiring eyes with the Old Home Days teeshirt Roland shook his head I appreciate the offer but Id as soon do what needs doing and then go back to where I belong He surveyed the hurrying throngs on the sidewalks bleakly If I belong anywhere You could stay at the apartment for a couple of days and rest up she said Id stay with you And fuck thy brains out do it please ya she thought and could not help a smile I mean I know you wont but you need to know the offers open He nodded Thankee but theres a woman who needs me to get back to her as soon as I can It felt like a lie to him and a grotesque one at that Based on everything that had happened part of him thought that Susannah Dean needed Roland of Gilead back in her life almost as much as nursery bahbos needed rat poison added to their bedtime bottles Irene Tassenbaum accepted it however And part of her was actually anxious to get back to her husband She had called him last night using a pay phone a mile from the motel just to be safe and it seemed that she had finally gotten David Seymour Tassenbaums attention again Based on her encounter with Roland Davids attention was definitely second prize but it was better than nothing by God Roland Deschain would vanish from her life soon leaving her to find her way back to northern New England on her own and explain what had happened as best she could Part of her mourned the impending loss but shed had enough adventure in the last forty hovxrs or so to last her for the rest of her life hadnt she And things to think about that too For one thing it seemed that the world was thinner than she had ever imagined And reality wider All right she said Its Second Avenue and Fortysixth Street you want to go to first correct Yes Susannah hadnt had a chance to tell them much about her adventures after Mia had hijacked their shared body but the gunslinger knew there was a tall buildingwhat Eddie Jake and Susannah called a skyscrapernow standing on the site of the former vacant lot and the Tet Corporation must surely be inside Will we need a tacksee Can you and your furry friend walk seventeen short blocks and two or three long ones Its your call but I wouldnt mind stretching my legs Roland didnt know how long a long block or how short a short one might be but he was more than willing to find out now that the deep pain in his right hip had departed Stephen King had that pain now along with the one in his smashed ribs and the right side of his split head Roland did not envy him those pains but at least they were back with their rightful owner Lets go he said THREE Fifteen minutes later he stood across from the large dark structure thrusting itself at the summer sky trying to keep his jaw from coming unhinged and perhaps dropping all the way to his chest It wasnt the Dark Tower not his Dark Tower at least although it wouldnt have surprised him to know there were people working in yon skytowersome of them readers of Rolands adventureswho called  Hammarskjold Plaza exactly that but he had no doubt that it was the Towers representative in this Keystone World just as the rose represented a field filled with them the field he had seen in so many dreams He could hear the singing voices from here even over the jostle and hum of the traffic The woman had to call his name three times and finally tug on one sleeve to get his attention When he turned to herreluctantlyhe saw it wasnt the tower across the street that she was looking at she had grown up just an hour from Manhattan and tall buildings were an old story to her but at the pocket park on their side of the street Her expression was delighted Isnt it a beautiful little place I must have been by this corner a hundred times and I never noticed it until now Do you see the fountain And the turtle sculpture He did And although Susannah hadnt told them this part of her story Roland knew she had been herealong with Mia daughter of noneand sat on the bench closest to the turtles wet shell He could almost see her there Id like to go in she said timidly May we Is there time Yes he said and followed her through the little iron gate FOUR The pocket park was peaceful but not entirely quiet Do you hear people singing Mrs Tassenbaum asked in a voice that was hardly more than a whisper A chorus from somewhere Bet your bottom dollar Roland answered and was sorry immediately Hed learned the phrase from Eddie and saying it hurt He walked to the turtle and dropped on one knee to examine it more closely There was a tiny piece gone from the beak leaving a break like a missing tooth On the back was a scratch in the shape of a question mark and fading pink letters What does it say she asked Something about a turde but thats all I can make out see the TURTLE of enormous girth He knew this without reading it What does it mean Roland stood up Its too much to go into Would you like to wait for me while I go in there He nodded in the direction of the tower with its black glass windows glittering in the sun Yes she said I would Ill just sit on the bench in the sunshine and wait for you Its refreshing Does that sound crazy No he said If someone whose looks you dont trust should speak to you IreneI think it unlikely because this is a safe place but its certainly possibleconcentrate just as hard as you can and call for me Her eyes widened Are you talking ESP He didnt know what ESP stood for but he understood what she meant and nodded Youd hear that Hear me He couldnt say for sure that he would The building might be equipped with damping devices like the thinkingcaps the cantoi wore that would make it impossible I might And as I say troubles unlikely This is a safe place She looked at the turde its shell gleaming with spray from the fountain It is isnt it She started to smile then stopped Youll come back wont you You wouldnt dump me without at least She shrugged one shoulder The gesture made her look very young Without at least saying goodbye Never in life And my business in yonder tower shouldnt take long In fact it was hardly business at all unless that was whoever was currently running the Tet Corporation had some with him We have another place to go and its there Oy and I would take our leave of you Okay she said and sat on the bench with the bumbler at her feet The end of it was damp and she was wearing a new pair of slacks bought in the same quick shoppingrun that had netted Rolands new shirt and jeans but this didnt bother her They would dry quickly on such a warm sunny day and she found she wanted to be near the turtle sculpture To study its tiny timeless black eyes while she listened to those sweet voices She thought that would be very restful It was not a word she usually thought of in connection with New York but this was a very unNew York place with its feel of quiet and peace She thought she might bring David here diat if they could sit on this bench he might hear the story of her missing three days without thinking her insane Or too insane Roland started away moving easilymoving like a man who could walk for days and weeks without ever varying his pace I wouldnt like to have him on my trail she thought and shivered a little at the idea He reached the iron gate through which he would pass to the sidewalk then turned to her once more He spoke in a soft singsong See the TURTLE of enormous girth On his shell he holds the earth His thought is slow but always kind He holds us all within his mind On his back all vows are made He sees the truth but maynt aid He loves the land and loves the sea And even loves a child like me Then he left her moving swiftly and cleanly not looking back She sat on the bench and watched him wait with the others clustered on the corner for the WALK light dien cross with them the leather bag slung over his shoulder bouncing lightly against his hip She watched him mount the steps of  Hammarskjold Plaza and disappear inside Then she leaned back closed her eyes and listened to the voices sing At some point she realized that at least two of the words they were singing were the ones that made her name FIVE It seemed to Roland that great multitudes of folken were streaming into the building but this was the perception of a man who had spent the latter years of his quest in mostly deserted places If hed come at quarter to nine while people were still arriving instead of at quarter to eleven he would have been stunned by the flood of bodies Now most of those who worked here were settled in their offices and cubicles generating paper and bytes of information The lobby windows were of clear glass and at least two stories high perhaps three Consequently the lobby was full of light and as he stepped inside the grief that had possessed him ever since kneeling by Eddie in the street of Pleasantville slipped away In here the singing voices were louder not a chorus but a great choir And he saw he wasnt the only one who heard them On the street people had been hurrying with their heads down and looks of distracted concentration on their faces as if they were deliberately not seeing the delicate and perishable beauty of the day which had been given them in here they were helpless not to feel at least some of that to which the gunslinger was so exquisitely attuned and which he drank like water in the desert As if in a dream he drifted across the rosemarble tile hearing the echoing clack of his bootheels hearing the faint and shifting conversation of the Orizas in their pouch He thought People who loork here wish they lived here They may not know it exactly but they do People who work here find excuses to work late And they will live long and productive lives In the eenter of the high echoing room the expensive marble floor gave way to a square of humble dark earth It was surrounded by ropes of winedark velvet but Roland knew that even die ropes didnt need to be there No one would transgress that litde garden not even a suicidal cantoi desperate to make a name for himself It was holy ground There were diree dwarf palm trees and plants he hadnt seen since leaving Gilead Spathiphyllum he believed they had been called there although they might not have the same name in this world There were other plants as well but only one mattered In the middle of the square by itself was the rose It hadnt been transplanted Roland saw that at once No It was where it had been in  when the place where he was now standing had been a vacant lot filled witfi trash and broken bricks dominated by a sign which announced die coming of Turtle Bay Luxury Condominiums to be built by Mills Construction and Sombra Real Estate Associates This building all one hundred stories of it had been built instead and around the rose Whatever business might be done here was secondary to that purpose Hammarskjold Plaza was a shrine SIX There was a tap on his shoulder and Roland whirled about so suddenly that he drew glances of alarm He was alarmed himself Not for yearsperhaps since his early teenage yearshad anyone been quiet enough to come within shouldertapping distance of him without being overheard And on this marble floor he surely should have The young and extremely beautiful woman who had approached him was clearly surprised by the suddenness of his reaction but the hands he shot out to seize her shoulders only closed on thin air and then themselves making a soft clapping sound that echoed back from the ceiling above a ceiling at least as high as that in the Cradle of Lud The womans green eyes were wide and wary and he would have sworn there was no harm in them but still first to be surprised then to miss like that He glanced down at the womans feet and got at least part of the answer She was wearing a kind of shoe hed never seen before something with deep foam soles and what might have been canvas uppers Shoes that would move as softly as moccasins on a hard surface As for the woman herself A queer double certainty came to him as he looked at her first that he had seen the boat she came in as familial resemblance was sometimes expressed in Calla Bryn Sturgis second that a society of gunslingers was abreeding in this world this special Keystone World and he had just been accosted by one of them And what better place for such an encounter than within sight of the rose I see your father in your face but cant quite name him Roland said in a low voice Tell me who he was do it please you The woman smiled and Roland almost had the name he was looking for Then it slipped away as such things often did memory could be bashful You never met him although I can understand why you might think you had Ill tell you later if you like but right now Im to take you upstairs Mr Deschain Theres a person who wants For a moment she looked selfconscious as if she thought someone had instructed her to use a certain word so shed be laughed at Then dimples formed at the corners of her mouth and her green eyes slanted enchantingly up at the corners it was as if she were thinking If its a joke on me let them have it  a person who wants to play with you she finished All right he said She touched his shoulder lightly to hold him where he was yet a moment longer Im asked to make sure that you read the sign in the Garden of the Beam she said Will you do it Rolands response was dry but still a bit apologetic I will if I may he said but Ive ever had trouble with your written language although it seems to come out of my mouth well enough when Im on this side I think youll be able to read this she said Give it a try And she touched his shoulder again gently turning him back to the square of earth in the lobby floornot earth that had been brought in wheelbarrows by some crew of gifted gardeners he knew but the actual earth of this place ground which might have been tilled but had not been otherwise changed At first he had no more success with the small brass sign in the garden than hed had with most signs in the shop windows or the words on the covers of the magdaseens He was about to say so to ask the woman with the faindy familiar face to read it to him when the letters changed becoming the Great Letters of Gilead He was then able to read what was writ diere and easily When he had finished it changed back again A pretty trick he said Did it respond to my thoughts She smiledher lips were coated with some pink candylike stuffand nodded Yes If you were Jewish you might have seen it in Hebrew If you were Russian it would have been in Cyrillic Say true True The lobby had regained its normal rhythm except Roland understood die rhythm of this place would never be like that in other business buildings Those living in Thunderclap would suffer all their lives from little ailments like boils and eczema and headaches and earstyke at the end of it they would die probably at an early age of some big and painful trum likely the cancers that ate fast and burned die nerves like brushfires as they made their meals Here was just the opposite health and harmony goodwill and generosity These folken did not hear the rose singing exactly but they didnt need to They were the lucky ones and on some level every one of them knew i t which was luckiest of all He watched them come in and cross to the liftboxes that were called elevaydors moving briskly swinging their pokes and packages their gear and their gunna and not one course was a perfecdy straight line from the doors A few came to what shed called the Garden of the Beam but even those who didnt bent their steps briefly in that direction as if attracted by a powerful magnet And if anyone tried to harm the rose There was a security guard sitting at a little desk by the elevators Roland saw but he was fat and old And it didnt matter If anyone made a threatening move everyone in this lobby would hear a scream of alarm in his or her head as piercing and imperative as that kind of whistle only dogs can hear And they would converge upon the wouldbe assassin of the rose They would do so swiftly and with absolutely no regard for their own safety The rose had been able to protect itself when it had been growing in the trash and the weeds of the vacant lot or at least draw those who would protect it and that hadnt changed Mr Deschain Are you ready to go upstairs now Aye he said Lead me as you would SEVEN The familiarity of the womans face clicked into place for him just as they reached the elevaydor Perhaps it was seeing her in profile that did it something about the shape of the cheekbone He remembered Eddie telling him about his conversation with Calvin Tower after Jack Andolini and George Biondi had left the Manhattan Restaurant of die Mind Tower had been speaking of his oldest friends family They like to boast that they have the most unique legal letterhead in New York perhaps in the United States It simply reads DEEPNEAU Are you sai Aaron Deepneaus daughter he asked her Surely not youre too young His granddaughter Her smile faded Aaron never had children Mr Deschain Im the granddaughter of his older brother but my own parents and grandfather died young Airy was the one who mosdy raised me Did you call him so Airy Roland was charmed As a child I did and it just kind of stuck She held out a hand her smile returning Nancy Deepneau And I am so pleased to meet you A litde frightened but pleased Roland shook her hand but the gesture was perfunctory hardly more than a touch Then with considerably more feeling for this was the ritual he had grown up with the one he understood he placed his fist against his forehead and made a leg Long days and pleasant nights Nancy Deepneau Her smile widened into a cheerful grin And may you have twice the number Roland of Gilead May you have twice the number The elevaydor came they got on and it was to the ninetyninth floor that they went EIGHT The doors opened on a large round foyer The floor was carpeted in a dusky pink shade that exacdy matched the hue of the rose Across from the elevaydor was a glass door with THE TET CORPORATION lettered on it Beyond Roland saw another smaller lobby where a woman sat at a desk apparendy talking to herself To the right of the outer lobby door were two men wearing business suits They were chatting to each other hands in pockets seemingly relaxed but Roland saw they were anything but And they were armed The coats of their suits were welltailored but a man who knows how to look for a gun usually sees one if a gun is there These two fellows would stand in this foyer for an hour maybe two it was difficult for even good men to remain totally alert for much longer falling into their little justchatting routine each time the elevaydor came ready to move instandy if they smelled something wrong Roland approved He didnt spend much time looking at the guards however Once he had identified them for what they were he let his gaze go where it had wanted to be from the moment the elevaydor doors opened There was a large blackandwhite picture on the wall to his left This was a photograph he had originally thought the word was fottergraf about five feet long and three wide mounted without a frame curved so cunningly to the shape of the wall diat it looked like a hole into some unnaturally still reality Three men in jeans and opennecked shirts sat on the top rail of a fence their boots hooked under the lowest rail How many times Roland wondered had he seen cowboys or pastorillas sitting just that way while they watched branding roping gelding or the breaking of wild horses How many times had he sat so himself sometimes with one or more of his old tetCuthbert Alain Jamie DeCurrysitting to either side of him as John Cullum and Aaron Deepneau sat flanking the black man with the goldrimmed spectacles and the tiny white moustache The remembering made him ache and this was no mere ache of the mind his stomach clenched and his heart sped up The three in the picture had been caught laughing at something and the result was a kind of timeless perfection one of those rare moments when men are glad to be what they are and where they are The Founding Fathers Nancy said She sounded both amused and sad That photo was taken on an executive retreat in  Taos New Mexico Three city boys in cow country how about that And dont they look like theyre having the time of their lives You say true Roland said Do you know all three Roland nodded He knew them all right although he had never met Moses Carver the man in the middle Dan Holmess partner Odetta Holmess godfather In the picture he looked to be a robust and healthy seventy but surely by  he had to be closer to eighty Perhaps eightyfive Of course Roland reminded himself there was a wild card here the marvelous thing hed just seen in the lobby of this building The rose was no more a fountain of youth than the turtle in the little pocket park across the street was the real Maturin but did he think it had certain beneficent qualities Yes he did Certain healing qualities Yes he did Did he believe that the nine years of life Aaron Deepneau had gotten between  and the taking of this picture in  had just been a matter of the tornreplacing pills and medical treatments of the old people No he did not These three menCarver Cullum and Deepneauhad come togetiier almost magically to fight for the rose in their old age Their tale the gunslinger believed would make a book in itself very likely a fine and exciting one What Roland believed was simplicity itself the rose had shown its gratitude When did they die he asked Nancy Deepneau John Cullum went first in  she said Victim of a gunshot wound He lasted twelve hours in the hospital long enough for everyone to say goodbye He was in New York for the annual board meeting According to the NYPD it was a streetside mugging gone bad We believe he was killed by an agent of either Sombra or North Central Positronics Probably one of the cantoi There were other attempts that missed Both Sombra and Positronics come to the same thing said Roland Theyre the agencies of the Crimson King in this world We know she said then pointed to the man on the left side of the picture the one she so strongly resembled Uncle Aaron lived until  When you met him in  Yes Roland said In  no one would have believed he could live so long Did the fayenfolken kill him too No the cancer came back thats all He died in his bed I was there The last thing he said was Tell Roland we did our best And so I do tell you Thankeesai He heard the roughness in his voice and hoped she would mistake it for curtness Many had done their best for him was it not true A great many beginning with Susan Delgado all those years ago Are you all right she asked in a low sympathetic voice Yes he said Fine And Moses Carver When did he pass She raised her eyebrows then laughed What Look for yourself She pointed toward the glass doors Now approaching them from the inside passing the deskminding woman who had apparently been talking to herself was a wizened man with fluffy flyaway hair and white eyebrows to match His skin was dark but the woman upon whose arm he leaned was even darker He was tallperhaps sixandthree if the bend had been taken out of his spinebut the woman was even taller at least sixandsix Her face was not beautiful but almost savagely handsome The face of a warrior The face of a gunslinger NINE Had Moses Carvers spine been straight he and Roland would have been eyetoeye As it was Carver needed to look up slightly which he did by cocking his head birdlike He seemed incapable of actually bending his neck arthritis had locked it in place His eyes were brown the whites so muddy it was difficult to tell where the irises ended and they were full of merry laughter behind their goldrimmed spectacles He still had the tiny white moustache Roland of Gilead said he How Ive longed to meet you sir I blieve its whats kept me alive so long after John and Aaron passed Let loose of me a minute Marian let loose Theres something I have to do Marian Carver let go of him and looked at Roland He didnt hear her voice in his head and didnt need to what she wanted to tell him was clear in her eyes Catch him if he falls sai But the man Susannah had called Daddy Mose didnt fall He put his loosely clenched arthritic fist to his forehead then bent his right knee taking all of his weight on his trembling right leg Hile you last gunslinger Roland Deschain out of Gilead son of Steven and true descendent of Arthur Eld I the last of what was called among ourselves the KaTet of the Rose salute you Roland put his own fisted hand to his forehead and did more than make a leg he went to his knee Hile Daddy Mose godfather of Susannah dinh of the KaTet of the Rose I salute you with my heart Thankee said the old man and then laughed like a boy Were well met in the House of the Rose What was once meant to be the Grave of the Rose Ha Tell me were not Can you Nay for it would be a lie Speak it the old man cried then uttered that cheery goto hell laugh once again But Im f gettin my manners in my awe gunslinger This handsome stretch of woman standing beside me itd be natural for you to call her my granddaughter cause I was semty in the year she was born which was nineteenand sixtynine But the truth isButna troof is was what reached Rolands earthat sometimes the best things in life are started late and having childrenChirrunis one of m in my opinion Which is a longwinded way of saying this is my daughter Marian Odetta Carver President of the Tet Corporation since I stepped down in  at the age of ninetyeight And do you think it would frost some countryclub balls Roland to know that this business now worth just about ten billion dollars is run by a Negro His accent growing deeper as his excitement and joy grew turned the last into Dis bidness now wuthjus bout tin binnion dolla is run bah NEEgrow Stop Dad the tall woman beside him said Her voice was kind but brooked no denial Youll have that heart monitor you wear sounding the alarm if you dont and this mans time is short She run me like a rayroad the old man cried indignantly At the same time he turned his head slightly and dropped Roland a wink of inexpressible slyness and good humor with the eye his daughter could not see As if she wasnt onto your tricks old man Roland thought amused even in his sorrow As if she hasnt been on to them for many and many a yearsay delah Marian Carver said Wed palaver with you for just a litde while Roland but first theres something I need to see Aint a bit o need for that the old man said his voice cracking with indignation Not a bit o need and you know it Did I raise ajackass Hes very likely right Marian said but always safe never sorry the gunslinger said Its a good rule aye What is it youd see What will tell you that I am who I say I am and you believe I am Your gun she said Roland took the Old Home Days shirt out of the leather bag then pulled out the holster He unwrapped the shellbelt and pulled out his revolver with the sandalwood grips He heard Marian Carver draw in a sharp awed breath and chose to ignore it He noticed that the two guards in their wellcut suits had drawn close their eyes wide You see it Moses Carver shouted Aye every one of you here Say God Might as well tell your granbabbies you saw Excalibur the Sword of Arthur fort comes to the same Roland held his fathers revolver out to Marian He knew she would need to take it in order to confirm who he was that she must do this before leading him into the Tet Corporations soft belly where the wrong someone could do terrible damage but for a moment she was unable to fulfill her responsibility Then she steeled herself and took the gun her eyes widening at the weight of it Careful to keep all of her fingers away from the trigger she brought the barrel up to her eyes and then traced a bit of the scrollwork near the muzzle Will you tell me what this means Mr Deschain she asked him Yes he said if you will call me Roland If you ask Ill try This is Arthurs mark he said tracing it himself The only mark on the door of his tomb do ya Tis his dinh mark and means WHITE The old man held out his trembling hands silent but imperative Is it loaded she asked Roland and then before he could answer Of course it is Give it to him Roland said Marian looked doubtful the two guards even more so but Daddy Mose still held his hands out for the widowmaker and Roland nodded The woman reluctandy held the gun out to her father The old man took it held it in both hands and then did something that both warmed and chilled the gunslingers heart he kissed the barrel with his old folded lips What does thee taste Roland asked honestly curious The years gunslinger Moses Carver said So I do And with that he held the gun out to the woman again butt first She handed it back to Roland as if glad to be rid of its grave and killing weight and he wrapped it once more in its belt of shells Come in she said And although our time is short well make it as joyful as your grief will allow Amen to that the old man said and clapped Roland on the shoulder Shes still alive my Odettashe you call Susannah Theres that Thought youd be glad to know it sir Roland was glad and nodded his thanks Come now Roland Marian Carver said Come and be welcome in our place for its your place as well and we know the chances are good that youll never visit it again TEN Marian Carvers office was on the northwest corner of the ninetyninth floor Here the walls were all glass unbroken by a single strut or muntin and the view took the gunslingers breath away Standing in that corner and looking out was like hanging in midair over a skyline more fabulous than any mind could imagine Yet it was one he had seen before for he recognized yonder suspension bridge as well as some of the tall buildings on this side of it He should have recognized the bridge for theyd almost died on it in another world Jake had been kidnapped off it by Gasher and taken to the TickTock Man This was the City of Lud as it must have been in its prime Do you call it New York he asked You do yes Yes Nancy Deepneau said And yonder bridge that swoops The George Washington Marian Carver said Or just the GWB if youre a native So yonder lay not only the bridge which had taken them into Lud but the one beside which Pere Callahan had walked when he left New York to start his wandering days That Roland remembered from his story and very well Would you care for some refreshment Nancy asked He began to say no took stock of how his head was swimming and changed his mind Something yes but only if it would sharpen wits that needed to be sharp Tea if you have it he said Hot strong tea with sugar or honey Can you We can Marian said and pushed a button on her desk She spoke to someone Roland couldnt see and all at once the woman in the outer officethe one who had appeared to be talking to herselfmade more sense to him When the ordering of hot drinks and sandwiches what Roland supposed he would always think of as popkins was done Marian leaned forward and captured Rolands eye Were wellmet in New York Roland so I hope but our time here isnt isnt vital And I suspect you know why The gunslinger considered this then nodded A trifle cautiously but over the years he had built a degree of caution into his nature There were othersAlain Johns had been one Jamie DeCurry anotherfor whom a sense of caution had been inbred but that had never been the case with Roland whose tendency had been to shoot first and ask questions later Nancy told you to read the plaque in the Garden of the Beam Marian said Did Garden of the Beam say Gawd Moses Carver interjected On the walk down the corridor to his daughters office he had picked a cane out of a faux elephantfoot stand and now he thumped it on the expensive carpet for emphasis Marian bore this patiently Say Gawdbomb My fathers recent friendship with the Reverend Harrigan who holds court down below has not been the high point in my life Marian said with a sigh but never mind Did you read the plaque Roland He nodded Nancy Deepneau had used a different wordsign or sigulbut he understood it came to the same The letters changed into Great Letters I could read it very well And what did it say GIVEN BY THE TET CORPORATION IN HONOR OF EDWARD CANTOR DEAN AND JOHN JAKE CHAMBERS He paused Then it said Camacammal Priatoi Gan delah which you might say as WHITE OVER RED THUS GAN WILLS EVER And to us it says GOOD OVER EVIL THIS IS THE WILL OF GOD Marian said God be praised Moses Carver said and thumped his cane May the Prim rise There was a perfunctory knock at the door and then the woman from the outer desk came in carrying a silver tray Roland was fascinated to see a small black knob suspended in front of her lips and a narrow black armature that disappeared into her hair Some sort of farspeaking device surely Nancy Deepneau and Marian Carver helped her set out steaming cups of tea and coffee bowls of sugar and honey a crock of cream There was also a plate of sandwiches Rolands stomach rumbled He thought of his friends in the groundno more popkins for themand also of Irene Tassenbaum sitting in the little park across the street patiently waiting for him Either thought alone should have been enough to kill his appetite but his stomach once more made its impudent noise Some parts of a man were conscienceless a fact he supposed he had known since childhood He helped himself to a popkin dumped a heaping spoonful of sugar into his tea then added honey for good measure He would make this as brief as possible and return to Irene as soon as he could but in the meantime May it do you fine sir Moses Carver said and blew across his coffee cup Over the teeth over the gums look out guts here it comes Hee Dad and I have a house on Montauk Point said Marian pouring cream into her own coffee and we were out there this past weekend At around fivefifteen on Saturday afternoon I got a call from one of the security people here The Hammarskjold Plaza Association employs them but the Tet Corporation pays them a bonus so we may know certain things of interest lets say as soon as they occur Weve been watching that plaque in the lobby with extraordinary interest as the nineteenth of June approached Roland Would it surprise you to know that until roughly quarter of five on that day it read GIVEN BY THE TET CORPORATION IN HONOR OF THE BEAM FAMILY AND IN MEMORY OF GILEAD Roland considered this sipped his tea it was hot and strong and good then shook his head No She leaned forward eyes gleaming And why do you say so Because until Saturday afternoon between four and five oclock nothing was sure Even with the Breakers stopped nothing was sure until Stephen King was safe He glanced around at them Do you know about the Breakers Marian nodded Not the details but we know the Beam they were working to destroy is safe from them now and that it wasnt so badly damaged it cant regenerate She hesitated then said And we know of your loss Both of your losses Were ever so sorry Roland Those boys are safe in the arms of Jesus Marians father said And even if they aint theyre together in the clearing Roland who wanted to believe this nodded and said thankya Then he turned back to Marian The thing with the writer was very close He was hurt and badly Jake died saving him He put his body between King and the vanmobile that would have taken his life King is going to live Nancy said And hes going to write again We have that on very good authority Whose Marian leaned forward In a minute she said The point is Roland we believe it were sure of it and Kings safety over the next few years means that your work in the matter of the Beams is done VesKa Gan Roland nodded The song would continue Theres plenty of work for us ahead Marian went on thirty years worth at least we calculate but But its ourwork not yours Nancy said You have this on the same good authority Roland asked sipping his tea Hot as it was hed gotten half of the large cup inside of him already Yes Your quest to defeat the forces of the Crimson King has been successful The Crimson King himself That want never this mans quest and you know it the centenarian sitting next to die handsome black woman said and he once more thumped his cane for emphasis His quest Dad thats enough Her voice was hard enough to make the old man blink Nay let him speak Roland said and they all looked at him surprised by and a little afraid of that dry whipcrack Let him speak for he says true If were going to have it out let us have it all out For me the Beams have always been no more than means to an end Had they broken the Tower would have fallen Had die Tower fallen I should never have gained it and climbed to the top of it Youre saying you cared more for the Dark Tower than for the continued existence of the universe Nancy Deepneau said She spoke in a justletmemakesureIvegotthisright voice and looked at Roland with a mixture of wonder and contempt For the continued existence of all the universes The Dark Tower is existence Roland said and I have sacrificed many friends to reach it over the years including a boy who called me father I have sacrificed my own soul in the bargain ladysai so turn thy impudent glass another way May you do it soon and do it well I beg His tone was polite but dreadfully cold All the color was dashed from Nancy Deepneaus face and the teacup in her hands trembled so badly that Roland reached out and plucked it from her hand lest it spill and burn her Take me not amiss he said Understand me for well never speak more What was done was done in both worlds well and ill for ka and against it Yet theres more beyond all worlds than you know and more behind them than you could ever guess My time is short so lets move on Well said sir Moses Carver growled and thumped his cane again If I offended Im truly sorry Nancy said To this Roland made no reply for he knew she was not sorry a bitshe was only afraid of him There was a moment of uncomfortable silence that Marian Carver finally broke We dont have any Breakers of our own Roland but at the ranch in Taos we employ a dozen telepaths and precogs What they make together is sometimes uncertain but always greater than the sum of its parts Do you know the term goodmind The gunslinger nodded They make a version of that she said although Im sure its not so great or powerful as that the Breakers in Thunderclap were able to produce Bcause they had hundreds the old man grumped And they were better fed Also because the servants of the King were more than willing to kidnap any who were particularly powerful Nancy said they always had what wed call the pick of the litter Still ours have served vis well enough Whose idea was it to put such folk to work for you Roland asked Strange as it might seem to you partner Moses said it was Cal Tower He never contributed muchnever did much but elect his books and drag his heels greedy highfalutin whitebread sumbitch that he was His daughter gave him a warning look Roland found he had to struggle to keep a straight face Moses Carver might be a hundred years old but he had pegged Calvin Tower in a single phrase Anyway he read about putting tellypaths to work in a bunch of science fiction books Do you know about science fiction Roland shook his head Well nemine Most of its bullshit but every now and then a good idear crops up Listen to me and Ill tell you a good un Youll understand if you know what Tower and your friend Mist Dean talked about twentytwo years ago when Mist Dean come n saved Tower from them two honky thugs Dad Marian said warningly You quit with the nigger talk now Youre old but not stupid He looked at her his muddy old eyes gleamed with malicious good cheer he looked back at Roland and once more came that sly droop of a wink Them two honky dago thugs Eddie spoke of it yes Roland said The slur disappeared from Carvers voice his words became crisp Then you know they spoke of a book called The Hogan by Benjamin Slightman The title of the book was misprinted and so was the writers name which was just the sort of thing that turned old fattys dials Yes Roland said The title misprint had been The Dogan a phrase that had come to have great meaning to Roland and his tet Well after your friend came to visit Cal Tower got interested in that fella all over again and it turned out hed written four other books under the name of Daniel Holmes He was as white as a Klansmans sheet this Slightman but the name he chose to write his other books under was the name of Odettas father And I bet that dont surprise you none does it No Roland said It was just one more faint click as the combinationdial of ka turned And all the books he wrote under the Holmes name were science fiction yarns about the government hiring tellypaths and precogs to find things out And thats where we got the idea He looked at Roland and gave his cane a triumphant thump Theres more to the tale a good deal but I dont guess youve got the time Thats what it all comes back to isnt it Time And in this world it only runs one way He looked wistful Id give a great lot gunslinger to see my goddaughter again but I dont guess thats in the cards is it Unless we meet in the clearing I think you say true Roland told him but Ill take her word of you and how I found you still full of hot spit and fire Say God say Gawdbombl the old man interjected and thumped his cane Tell it brother And see that you tell her So I will Roland finished the last of his tea then put the cup on Marian Carvers desk and stood with a supporting hand on his right hip as he did It would take him a long time to get used to the lack of pain there quite likely more time than he had And now I must take my leave of you Theres a place not far from here where I need to go We know where Marian said Therell be someone to meet you when you arrive The place has been kept safe for you and if the door you seek is still there and still working youll go through it Roland made a slight bow Thankeesai But sit a few moments longer if you will We have gifts for you Roland Not enough to pay you back for all youve donewhether doing it was your first purpose or notbut things you may want all the same Ones news from our goodmind folk in Taos Ones from more She considered  more normal researchers folks who work for us in this very building They call themselves the Calvins but not because of any religious bent Perhaps its a little homage to Mr Tower who died of a heart attack in his new shop nine years ago Or perhaps its only a joke A bad one if it is Moses Carver grumped And then there are two more from us From Nancy and me and my Dad and one whos gone on Will you sit a little longer And although he was anxious to be off Roland did as he was asked For the first time since Jakes death a true emotion other than sorrow had risen in his mind Curiosity ELEVEN First the news from the folks in New Mexico Marian said when Roland had resumed his seat They have watched you as well as they can and although what they saw Thunderside was hazy at best they believe that Eddie told Jake Chambers somethingperhaps something of importancenot long before he died Likely as he lay on the ground and before he I dont know Before he slipped into twilight Roland suggested Yes Nancy Deepneau agreed We think so That is to say they think so Our version of the Breakers Marian gave her a little frown that suggested this was a lady who did not appreciate being interrupted Then she returned her attention to Roland Seeing things on this side is easier for our people and several of them are quite surenot positive but quite surethat Jake may have passed this message on before he himself died She paused This woman youre traveling with Mrs Tannenbaum Tassenbaum Roland corrected He did it without thinking because his mind was otherwise occupied Furiously so Tassenbaum Marian agreed Shes undoubtedly told you some of what Jake told her before he passed on but there may be something else Not a thing shes holding back but something she didnt recognize as important Will you ask her to go over what Jake said to her once more before you and she part company Yes Roland said and of course he would but he didnt believe Jake had passed on Eddies message to Mrs Tassenbaum No not to her He realized that hed hardly thought of Oy since theyd parked Irenes car but Oy had been with them of course would now be lying at Irenes feet as she sat in the little park across the street lying in the sun and waiting for him All right she said Thats good Lets move on Marian opened the wide center drawer of her desk From it she brought out a padded envelope and a small wooden box The envelope she handed to Nancy Deepneau The box she placed on the desktop in front of her This next is Nancys to tell she said And Id just ask you to be brief Nancy because this man looks very anxious to be off Tell it Moses said and thumped his cane Nancy glanced at him then at Roland or in the vicinity of him anyway Color was climbing in her cheeks and she looked flustered Stephen King she said then cleared her throat and said it again From there she didnt seem to know how to go on Her color burned even deeper beneath her skin Take a deep breath Roland said and hold it She did as he told her Now let it out And this too Now tell me what you would Nancy niece of Aaron Stephen King has written nearly forty books she said and although the color remained in her cheeks Roland supposed he would find out what it signified soon enough her voice was calmer now An amazing number of them even the very early ones touch on the Dark Tower in one way or another Its as though it was always on his mind from the very first You say what I know is true Roland told her folding his hands I say thankya This seemed to calm her even further Hence the Calvins she said Three men and two women of a scholarly bent who do nothing from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon but read the works of Stephen King They dont just read them Marian said They crossreference them by settings by characters by themessuch as they areeven by mention of popular brandname products Part of their work is looking for references to people who live or did live in the Keystone World Nancy said Real people in other words And references to the Dark Tower of course She handed him the padded envelope and Roland felt the corners of what could only be a book inside If King ever wrote a keystone book Rolandoutside the Dark Tower series itself I meanwe think it must be this one The flap of the envelope was held by a clasp Roland looked askance at both Marian and Nancy They nodded The gunslinger opened the clasp and pulled out an extremely thick volume with a cover of red and white There was no picture on it only Stephen Kings name and a single word Red for the King White for Arthur Eld he thought White over Red thus Gan wills ever Or perhaps it was just a coincidence  What is this word Roland asked tapping the title Insomnia Nancy said It means I know what it means Roland said Why do you give me the book Because the story hinges on the Dark Tower Nancy said and because theres a character in it named Ed Deepneau He happens to be the villain of the piece The villain of the piece Roland thought No wonder her color rose Do you have anyone by that name in your family he asked her We did she said In Bangor which is the town King is writing about when he writes about Derry as he does in this book The real Ed Deepneau died in  the year King was born He was a bookkeeper as inoffensive as milk and cookies The one in Insomnia is a lunatic who falls under the power of the Crimson King He attempts to turn an airplane into a bomb and crash it into a building killing thousands of people Pray it never happens the old man said gloomily looking out at the New York City skyline God knows it could In the story the plan fails Nancy said Although some people are killed the main character in the book an old man named Ralph Roberts manages to keep the absolute worst from happening Roland was looking intently at Aaron Deepnaus grandniece The Crimson King is mentioned in here By actual name Yes she said The Ed Deepneau in Bangorthe real Deepneauwas a cousin of my fathers four or five times removed The Calvins could show you the family tree if you wanted but there really isnt much of a connection to Uncle Aarons part of it We think King may have used the name in the book as a way of getting your attentionor ourswithout even realizing what he was doing A message from his undermind the gunslinger mused Nancy brightened His subconscious yes Yes thats exactly what we think It wasnt exactly what Roland was thinking The gunslinger had been recalling how he had hypnotized King in the year of  how he had told him to listen for VesKa Gan the Song of the Turtle Had Kings undermind the part of him that would never have stopped trying to obey the hypnotic command put part of the Song of the Turde in this book A book the Servants of the King might have neglected because it wasnt part of the Dark Tower Cycle Roland thought that could be and that the name Deepneau might indeed be a sigul But I cant read this he said A word here and a word there perhaps but no more You cant but my girl can Moses Carver said My girl Odetta that you call Susannah Roland nodded slowly And although he had already begun to have his doubts his mind nevertheless cast up a brilliant image of the two of them sitting close by a firea large one for the night was coldwith Oy between In the rocks above them the wind howled bitter notes of winter but they cared not for their bellies were full their bodies were warm dressed in the skins of animals they had killed themselves and they had a story to entertain them Stephen Kings story of insomnia Shell read it to you on the trail Moses said On your last trail say God Yes Roland thought One last story to hear one last trail to follow The one that leads to Can Ka No Rey and the Dark Tower Or it would be nice to think so Nancy said In the story the Crimson King is using Ed Deepneau to kill one single child a boy named Patrick Danville Just before the attack while Patrick and his mother are waiting for a woman to make a speech the boy draws a picture one that shows you Roland and the Crimson King apparently imprisoned at the top of the Dark Tower Roland started in his seat The top Imprisoned at the top Easy Marian said Take it easy Roland The Calvins have been analyzing Kings work for years every word and every reference and everything they produce gets forwarded to the goodmind folken in New Mexico Although these two groups have never seen each other it would be perfectly correct to say that they work together Not that theyre always in agreement Nancy said They sure arentn Marian spoke in the exasperated tone of one whos had to referee more than her share of squabbles But one thing that they are in agreement about is that Kings references to the Dark Tower are almost always masked and sometimes mean nothing at all Roland nodded He speaks of it because his undermind is always thinking of it but sometimes he lapses into gibberish Yes Nancy said But obviously you dont think this entire book is a false trail or you would not want to give it to me Indeed we do not Nancy said But that doesnt mean the Crimson King is necessarily imprisoned at the top of the Tower Although I suppose it might Roland thought of his own belief that the Red King was locked out of the Tower on a kind of balcony Was it a genuine intuition or just something he wanted to believe In any case we think you should watch for this Patrick Danville Marian said The consensus is that hes a real person but we havent been able to find any trace of him here Perhaps you may find him in Thunderclap Or beyond it Moses put in Marian was nodding According to the story King tells in Insomniayoull see for yourselfPatrick Danville dies as a young man But that may not be true Do you understand Im not sure I do When you find Patrick Danvilleor when he finds youhe may still be the child described in this book Nancy said or he could be as old as Uncle Mose Bad luck Fhim if that be true said the old man and chortled Roland lifted the book stared at the red and white cover traced the slighdy raised letters that made a word he could not read Surely its just a story From the spring of  when he typed the line The man in black fled across the desert and the guns linger followed Marian Carver said very few of the things Stephen King wrote were just stories He may not believe that we do But years of dealing with the Crimson King may have left you with a way of jumping at shadows do it please ya Roland thought Aloud he said If not stories what It was Moses Carver who answered We think maybe messages in bottles In the way he spoke this wordbohuls almostRoland heard a heartbreaking echo of Susannah and suddenly wanted to see her and know she was all right This desire was so strong it left a bitter taste on his tongue that great sea Beg your pardon the gunslinger said I was woolgathering I said we believe that Stephen Kings cast his botdes upon that great sea The one we call the Prim In hopes that theyll reach you and the messages inside will make it possible for you and my Odetta to gain your goal Which brings us to our final gifts Marian said Our true gifts First She handed him the box It opened on a hinge Roland placed his left hand splayed over the top meaning to swing it back then paused and studied his interlocutors They were looking at him with hope and suspenseful interest an expression that made him uneasy A mad but surprisingly persuasive idea came to him that these were in truth agents of the Crimson King and when he opened the box the last thing hed see would be a primed sneetch counting down the last few clicks to red zero And the last sound hed hear before the world blew up around him would be their mad laughter and a cry of Hile the Red King It wasnt impossible either but a point came where one had to trust because the alternative was madness If ka will say so let it be so he thought and opened the box TWELVE Within resting on dark blue velvet which diey might or might not have known was the color of the Royal Court of Gilead was a watch within a coiled chain Engraved upon its gold cover were three objects a key a rose andbetween and slightly above thema tower with tiny windows marching around its circumference in an ascending spiral Roland was amazed to find his eyes once more filling with tears When he looked at the others againtwo young women and one old man the brains and guts of the Tet Corporationhe at first saw six instead of three He blinked the phantom doubles away Open the cover and look inside Moses Carver said And theres no need to hide your tears in this company you son of Steven for were not the machines the others would replace us with if they had their way Roland saw that the old man spoke true for tears were slipping down the weathered darkness of his cheeks Nancy Deepneau was also weeping freely And aldiough Marian Carver no doubt prided herself on being made of sterner stuff her eyes held a suspicious gleam He depressed the stem protruding from the top of the case and the lid sprang up Inside finely scrolled hands told the hour and the minute and with perfect accuracy he had no doubt Below in its own small circle a smaller hand raced away the seconds Carved on the inside of the lid was this To the Hand of ROLAND DESCHAIN From Those of MOSES ISAAC CARVER MARIAN ODETTA CARVER NANCY REBECCA DEEPNEAU With Our Gratitude White Over RedThus GOD Wills Ever Thankeesai Roland said in a hoarse and trembling voice I thank you and so would my friends were they here to speak In our hearts they do speak Roland Marian said And in your face we see them very well Moses Carver was smiling In our world Roland giving a man a gold watch has a special significance What would that be Roland asked He held the watcheasily die finest timepiece hed ever had in his lifeup to his ear and listened to the precise and delicate ticking of its machinery That his work is done and its time for him to go fishing or play with his grandchildren Nancy Deepneau said But we gave it to you for a different reason May it count the hours to your goal and tell you when you near it How can it do that We have one exceptional goodmind fellow in New Mexico Marian said His name is Fred Towne He sees a great deal and is rarely if ever mistaken This watch is a Patek Philippe Roland It cost nineteen thousand dollars and the makers guarantee a full refund of the price if its ever fast or slow It needs no winding for it runs on a batterynot made by North Central Positronics or any subsidiary thereof I can assure youthat will last a hundred years According to Fred when you near the Dark Tower the watch may nevertheless stop Or begin to run backward Nancy said Watch for it Moses Carver said I believe you will wont you Aye Roland agreed He put the watch carefully in one pocket after another long look at the carvings on the golden cover and the box in another I will watch diis watch very well You must watch for something else too Marian said Mordred Roland waited We have reason to believe that hes murdered the one you called Walter She paused And I see that does not surprise you May I ask why Walters finally left my dreams just as the ache has left my hip and my head Roland said The last time he visited them was in Calla Bryn Sturgis the night of the Beamquake He would not tell them how terrible those dreams had been dreams in which he wandered lost and alone down a dank castle corridor with cobwebs brushing his face the scuttering sound of something approaching from the darkness behind him or perhaps above him and just before waking up the gleam of red eyes and a whispered inhuman voice Father They were looking at him grimly At last Marian said Beware him Roland Fred Towne the fellow I mentioned says Mordred be ahungry He says thats a literal hunger Freds a brave man but hes afraid of your your enemy My son why dont you say it Roland thought but believed he knew She withheld out of care for his feelings Moses Carver stood and set his cane beside his daughters desk I have one more thing for you he said ony it was yours all alongyours to carry and lay down when you get to where youre bound Roland was honesdy perplexed and more perplexed still when the old man began to slowly unbutton his shirt down the front Marian made as if to help him and he motioned her away brusquely Beneath his dressshirt was an old mans strapstyle undershirt what the gunslinger thought of as a slinkum Beneath it was a shape that Roland recognized at once and his heart seemed to stop in his chest For a moment he was cast back to die cabin on the lakeBeckhardts cabin Eddie by his sideand heard his own words Put Aunties cross around your neck and when you meet with sai Carver show it to him It may go a long way toward convincing him you re on the straight But first The cross was now on a chain of fine gold links Moses Carver pulled it free of his slinkum by this looked at it for a moment looked up at Roland widi a little smile on his lips then down at the cross again He blew upon it Faint and faint raising the hair on the gunslingers arms came Susannahs voice We buried Pimsey under the apple tree Then it was gone For a moment there was nothing and Carver frowning now drew in breath to blow again There was no need Before he could John Cullums Yankee drawl arose not from the cross itself but seemingly from the air just above it We done our best partnerpaaatnuhand I hope twas good enough Now I always knew this was on loan to me and here it is back where it belongs You know where it finishes up I Here the words which had been fading ever since here it is became inaudible even to Rolands keen ears Yet he had heard enough He took Aunt Talithas cross which he had promised to lay at the foot of the Dark Tower and donned it once more It had come back to him and why would it not have done Was ka not a wheel I thank you sai Carver he said For myself for my katet that was and on behalf of the woman who gave it to me Dont thank me Moses Carver said ThankJohnny Cullum He give it to me on his deathbed That man had some hard bark on him I Roland began and for a moment could say no more His heart was too full I thank you all he said at last He bowed his head to them with the palm of his right fist against his brow and his eyes closed When he opened them again Moses Carver was holding out his thin old arms Now its time for us to go our way and you to go yours he said Put your arms around me Roland and kiss my cheek in farewell if you would and think of my girl as you do for Id say goodbye to her if I may Roland did as he was bid and in another world as she dozed aboard a train bound for Fedic Susannah put a hand to her cheek for it seemed to her that Daddy Mose had come to her and put an arm around her and bid her goodbye good luck good journey THIRTEEN When Roland stepped out of the elevaydor in the lobby he wasnt surprised to see a woman in a graygreen pullover and slacks the color of moss standing in front of the garden with a few other quietly respectful folken An animal which was not quite a dog sat by her left shoe Roland crossed to her and touched her elbow Irene Tassenbaum turned to him her eyes wide with wonder Do you hear it she asked Its like the singing we heard in Lovell only a hundred times sweeter I hear it he said Then he bent and picked up Oy He looked into the bumblers bright goldringed eyes as the voices sang Friend of Jake he said what message did he give Oy tried but the best he could manage was something that sounded like Dandyo a word Roland vaguely remembered from an old drinking song where it rimed with Adelina says shes randyo Roland put his forehead down against Oys forehead and closed his eyes He smelled the bumblers warm breath And more a scent deep in his fur that was the hay into which Jake and Benny Slightman had taken turns jumping not so long before In his mind mingled with the sweet singing of those voices he heard the voice of Jake Chambers for the last time Tell him Eddie says Watch for Dandelo Dont forget And Oy had not FOURTEEN Outside as they descended the steps of  Hammarskjold Plaza a deferential voice said Sir Madam It was a man in a black suit and a soft black cap He stood by the longest blackest car Roland had ever seen Looking at it made the gunslinger uneasy Whos sent us a funeral bucka he asked Irene Tassenbaum smiled The rose had refreshed herexcited and exhilarated her as wellbut she was still tired And concerned to get in touch with David who would likely be out of his mind with worry by this time Its not a hearse she said Its a limousine A car for special people or people who think theyre special Then to the driver While were riding can you have someone in your office check some airline info for me Of course madam May I ask your carrier of choice and your destination My destinations Portland Maine My carrier of choice is Rubberband Airlines if theyre going there this afternoon The limousines windows were smoked glass the interior dim and ringed with colored lights Oy jumped up on one of the seats and watched with interest as the city rolled past Roland was mildly amazed to see that there was a completely stocked liquorbar on one side of the long passenger compartment He thought of having a beer and decided that even such a mild drink would be enough to dim his own lights Irene had no such worries She poured herself what looked like whiskey from a small bottle and then held the glass toward him May your road wind ever upward and the wind be ever at your back me foine bucko she said Roland nodded A good toast Thankeesai These have been the most amazing three days of my life I want to thankeesai you For choosing me Also for laying me she thought but did not add She and Dave still enjoyed the occasional snuggle but not like that of the previous night It had never been like that And if Roland hadnt been distracted Very likely she would have blown her silly self up like a Black Cat firecracker Roland nodded and watched the streets of the citya version of Lud but still young and vitalgo by What about your car he asked If we want it before we come back to New York well have someone drive it up to Maine Probably Davids Beemer will do us Its one of the advantages of being wealthywhy are you looking at me that way You have a cartomobile called a Beamer Its slang she said Its actually BMW Stands for Bavarian Motor Works Ah Roland tried to look as if he understood Roland may I ask you a question He twirled his hand for her to go ahead When we saved the writer did we also save the world We did somehow didnt we Yes he said How does it happen that a writer whos not even very goodand I can say that Ive read four or five of his booksgets to be in charge of the worlds destiny Or of the entire universes If hes not very good why didnt you stop at one Mrs Tassenbaum smiled Touche He is readable Ill give him thattells a good story but has a tin ear for language I answered your question now answer mine God knows there are writers who feel that the whole world hangs on what they say Norman Mailer comes to mind also Shirley Hazzard and John Updike But apparently in this case the world really does How did it happen Roland shrugged He hears the right voices and sings the right songs Which is to say ka It was Irene Tassenbaums turn to look as though she understood FIFTEEN The limousine drew up in front of a building with a green awning out front Another man in another wellcut suit was standing by the door The steps leading up from the sidewalk were blocked with yellow tape There were words printed on it which Roland couldnt read It says CRIME SCENE DO NOT ENTER Mrs Tassenbaum told him But it looks like its been there awhile I think they usually take the tape down once theyre finished with their cameras and little brushes and things You must have powerful friends Roland was sure the tape had indeed been there awhile three weeks give or take That was when Jake and Pere Callahan had entered the Dixie Pig positive they were going to their deaths but pushing ahead anyway He saw there was a little puddle of liquor left in Irenes glass and swallowed it grimacing at the hot taste of the alcohol but relishing the burn on the way down Better she asked Aye thanks He reset the bag with the Orizas in it more firmly on his shoulder and got out with Oy at his heel Irene paused to talk to the driver who seemed to have been successful in making her travel arrangements Roland ducked beneath the tape and then just stood where he was for a moment listening to the honk and pound of the city on this bright June day relishing its adolescent vitality He would never see another city of that much he was almost positive And perhaps that was just as well He had an idea that after New York all others would be a step down The guardobviously someone who worked for the Tet Corporation and not this citys constabularyjoined him on the walk If you want to go in there sir theres something you should show me Roland once more took his gunbelt from the pouch once more unwrapped it from the holster once more drew his fathers gun This time he did not offer to hand it over nor did that gentleman ask to take it He only examined the scrollwork particularly that at the end of the barrel Then he nodded respectfully and stepped back Ill unlock the door Once you go inside youre on your own You understand that dont you Roland who had been on his own for most of his life nodded Irene took his elbow before he could move forward turned him and put her arms around his neck She had also bought herself a pair of lowheeled shoes and only needed to tilt her head back slightly in order to look into his eyes You take care of yourself cowboy She kissed him briefly on the mouththe kiss of a friendand then knelt to stroke Oy And take care of the little cowboy too Ill do my best Roland said Will you remember your promise about Jakes grave A rose she said Ill remember Thankee He looked at her a moment longer consulted the workings of his own inner instinctshunchthinkand came to a decision From the bag containing the Orizas he took the envelope containing the bulky book the one Susannah would never read to him on the trail after all He put it in Irenes hands She looked at it frowning Whats in here Feels like a book Yar One by Stephen King Insomnia its called Has thee read that one She smiled a bit No thee hasnt Has thee No And wont It feels tricksy to me I dont understand you It feels thin He was thinking of Eyebolt Canyon in Mejis She hefted it Feels pretty goddamned thick to me A Stephen King book for sure He sells by the inch America buys by the pound Roland only shook his head Irene said Never mind Im being smart because Ree doesnt do goodbyes well never has You want me to keep this right Yes Okay Maybe when Big Steve gets out of the hospital Ill get him to sign it The way I look at it he owes me an autograph Or a kiss Roland said and took another for himself With the book out of his hands he felt somehow lighter Freer Safer He drew her fully into his arms and hugged her Irene Tassenbaum returned his strength with her own Then Roland let her go touched his forehead lightly with his fist and turned to the door of the Dixie Pig He opened it and slipped inside with no look back That he had found was ever the easiest way SIXTEEN The chrome post which had been outside on the night Jake and Pere Callahan had come here had been put in the lobby for safekeeping Roland stumbled against it but his reflexes were as quick as ever and he grabbed it before it could fall over He read the sign on top slowly sounding the words out and getting the sense of only one CLOSED The orange electric flambeaux which had lit the dining room were off but the batterypowered emergency lights were on filling the area beyond the lobby and the bar with a flat glare To the left was an arch and another dining room beyond it There were no emergency lights there that part of the Dixie Pig was as dark as a cave The light from the main dining room seemed to creep in about four feetjust far enough to illuminate the end of a long tableand then fall dead The tapestry of which Jake had spoken was gone It might be in the evidence room of the nearest police station or it might already have joined some collectors trove of oddities Roland could smell the faint aroma of charred meat vague and unpleasant In the main dining room two or three tables were overturned Roland saw stains on the red rug several dark ones that were almost certainly blood and a yellowish curd that was something else Hrozv it aside Nasty bauble of the heepGod hrow it aside if you dare And the Peres voice echoing dimly in Rolands ears unafraid  neednt stake my faith on the challenge of such a thing as you sai The Pere Another of those he had left behind Roland thought briefly of the scrimshaw turde that had been hidden in the lining of the bag they had found in the vacant lot but didnt waste time looking for it If it had been here he thought he would have heard its voice calling to him in the silence No whoever had appropriated die tapestry of the vampireknights at dinner had very likely taken the skoldpadda as well not knowing what it was only knowing it was something strange and wonderful and otherworldly Too bad It might have come in handy The gunslinger moved on weaving his way among the tables with Oy trotting at his heel SEVENTEEN He paused in die kitchen long enough to wonder what the constabulary of New York had made of it He was willing to bet diey had never seen another like it not in this city of clean machinery and bright electric lights This was a kitchen in which Hax the cook he remembered best from his youth and beneath whose dead feet he and his best friend had once scattered bread for die birds would have felt at home The cookfires had been out for weeks but the smell of the meat that had been roasted heresome of the variety known as long porkwas strong and nasty There were more signs of trouble here as well a scumcaked pot lying on the green tiles of the floor blood which had been burned black on one of the stovetops and Roland could imagine Jake fighting his way through the kitchen But not in panic no not he Instead he had paused to demand directions of the cooks boy Whats your name cully Jochabim that be I son of Hossa Jake had told them this part of his story but it was not memory that spoke to Roland now It was the voices of the dead He had heard such voices before and knew them for what they were EIGHTEEN Oy took the lead as he had done the last time he had been here He could still smell Akes scent faint and sorrowful Ake had gone on ahead now but not so very far he was good Ake was good Ake would wait and when the time camewhen the j ob Ake had given him was doneOy would catch up and go with him as before His nose was strong and he would find fresher scent than this when the time came to search for it Ake had saved him from death which did not matter Ake had saved him from loneliness and shame after Oy had been cast out by the tet of his kind and that did In the meantime there was this j ob to finish He led the man Olan into the pantry The secret door to the stairs had been closed but the man Olan felt patiently along the shelves of cans and boxes until he found the way to open it All was as it had been the long descending stair dimly lit by overhead bulbs the scent damp and overlaid with mold He could smell the rats which scuttered in the walls rats and other things too some of them bugs of the sort he had killed the last time he and Ake had come here That had been good killing and he would gladly have more if more were offered Oy wished the bugs would show themselves again and challenge him but of course they didnt They were afraid and they were right to be afraid for ever had his kind stood enemy to theirs He started down the stairs with the man Olan following behind NINETEEN They passed the deserted kiosk with its ageyellowed signs NEW YORK SOUVENIRS LAST CHANCE a n d VISIT SEPTEMBER   and fifteen minutes laterRoland checked his new watch to be sure of the timethey came to a place where there was a good deal of broken glass on the dusty corridor floor Roland picked Oy up so he wouldnt cut the pads of his feet On both walls he saw the shattered remains of what had been glasscovered hatches of some kind When he looked in he saw complicated machinery They had almost caught Jake here snared him in some kind of mindtrap but once again Jake had been clever enough and brave enough to get through He survived everything but a man too stupid and too careless to do the simple job of driving his bucka on an empty road Roland thought bitterly And the man who brought him therethat man too Then Oy barked at him and Roland realized that in his anger at Bryan Smith and at himself he was squeezing the poor little fellow too tightly Cry pardon Oy he said and put him down Oy trotted on without making any reply and not long after Roland came to the scattered bodies of the boogers who had harried his boy from the Dixie Pig Here also printed in the dust that coated the floor of this ancient corridor were the tracks he and Eddie had made when they arrived Again he heard a ghostvoice this time that of the man who had been the harriers leader I know your name by your face and your face by your mouth Tis the same as the mouth of your mother who did suck John Farson with such glee Roland turned the body over with the toe of his boot a hume named Flaherty whose da had put a fear of dragons in his head had the gunslinger known or cared which he did not and looked down into the dead face which was already growing a crop of mold Next to him was the stoathead taheen whose final proclamation had been Be damned to you then charyka And beyond the heaped bodies of these two and their mates was the door that would take him out of the Keystone World for good Assuming that it still worked Oy trotted to it and sat down before it looking back at Roland The bumbler was panting but his old amiably fiendish grin was gone Roland reached the door and placed his hands against the closegrained ghostwood Deep within he felt a low and troubled vibration This door was still working but might not be for much longer He closed his eyes and thought of his mother bending over him as he lay in his little bed how soon before he had been promoted from the cradle he didnt know but surely not long her face a patchwork of colors from the nursery windows Gabrielle Deschain who would later die at those hands which she caressed so lightly and lovingly with her own daughter of Candor the Tall wife of Steven mother of Roland singing him to sleep and dreams of those lands only children know Babybunting babydear Baby bring your berries here Chussit chissit chassit Bring enough to fill your basket So far Ive traveled he thought with his hands splayed on the ghostwood door So far Ive traveled and so many Ive hurt along the way hurt or killed and what I may have saved was saved by accident and can never save my soul do I have one Yet theres this much Ive come to the head of the last trail and I need not travel it alone if only Susannah loillgo with me Mayhap theres still enough to fill my basket Chassit Roland said and opened his eyes as the door opened He saw Oy leap nimbly through He heard the shrill scream of the void between the worlds and then stepped through himself sweeping the door shut behind him and still without a backward look ONE Look at how brilliant it is here When we came before Fedic was shadowless and dull but there was a reason for that it wasnt the real Fedic but only a kind of todash substitute a place Mia knew well and remembered well just as she remembered the castle allure where she went often before circumstancesin the person of Walter o Dimgave her a physical body and could thus recreate Today however the deserted village is almost too bright to look at although well no doubt see better once our eyes have adjusted from the murk of Thunderclap and the passage beneath the Dixie Pig Every shadow is crisp they might have been cut from black felt and laid upon the oggan The sky is a sharp and cloudless blue The air is chill The wind whining around the eaves of the empty buildings and through the battlements of Castle Discordia is autumnal and somehow introspective Sitting in Fedic Station is an atomic locomotivewhat was called a hotenj by the old peoplewith the words SPIRIT OF TOPEKA written on both sides of the bullet nose The slim pilothouse windows have been rendered almost completely opaque by centuries of desert grit flung against the glass but little does that matter the Spirit ofTopeka has made her last trip and even when she did run regularly no mere hume ever guided her course Behind the engine are only three cars There were a dozen when she set out from Thunderclap Station on her last run and there were a dozen when she arrived in sight of this ghost town but Ah well thats Susannahs tale to tell and we will listen as she tells it to the man she called dinh when there was a katet for him to guide And here is Susannah herself sitting where we saw her once before in front of the GinPuppy Saloon Parked at die hitching rail is her chrome steed which Eddie dubbed Suzies Cruisin Trike Shes cold and hasnt so much as a sweater to pull close around her but her heart tells her that her wait is almost over And how she hopes her heart is right for diis is a haunted place To Susannah the whine of die wind sounds too much like the bewildered cries of the children who were brought here to have their bodies roont and their minds murdered Beside the rusty Quonset hut up the street the Arc Experimental Station do ya not recall it are the gray cyborg horses A few more have fallen over since the last time we visited a few more click their heads resdessly back and forth as if trying to see the riders who will come and untether them But that will never happen for the Breakers have been set free to wander and theres no more need of children to feed their talented heads And now look you At last comes what the lady has waited for all this long day and the day before and the day before that when Ted Brautigan Dinky Earnshaw and a few others not Sheemie hes gone into the clearing at the end of the path say sorry bade her goodbye The door of the Dogan opens and a man comes out The first thing she sees is that his limp is gone Next she notices his new bluejeans and shirt Nifty duds but hes otherwise as illprepared for this cold weather as she is In his arms the newcomer holds a furry animal with its ears cocked That much is well but the boy who should be holding the animal is absent No boy and her heart fills with sorrow Not surprise however because she has known just as yonder man yonder chary man would have known had she been the one to pass from the path She slips down from her seat on her hands and the stumps of her legs she hoists herself off the boardwalk and into the street There she raises a hand and waves it over her head Roland she cries Hey gunslinger Im over here He sees her and waves back Then he bends and puts down the animal Oy races toward her hellbent for election head down ears flat against his skull running with the speed and lowslung leaping grace of a weasel on a crust of snow While hes still seven feet away from her seven at least he jumps into the air his shadow flying fleetly over the packed dirt of the street She grabs him like a deep receiver hauling in a Hail Mary pass The force of his forward motion knocks the breath from her and bowls her over in a puff of dust but the first breath shes able to take in goes back out as laughter Shes still laughing as he stands with his stubby front legs on her chest and his stubby rear ones on her belly ears up squiggly tail wagging licking her cheeks her nose her eyes Let up on it she cries Let up on it honey fore you kill me She hears this so lighdy meant and her laughter stops Oy steps off her sits tilts his snout at the empty blue socket of the sky and lets loose a single long howl that tells her everything she would need to know had she not known already For Oy has more eloquent ways of speaking than his few words She sits up slapping puffs of dust out of her shirt and a shadow falls over her She looks up but at first cannot see Rolands face His head is directly in front of the sun and it makes a fierce corona around him His features are lost in blackness But hes holding out his hands Part of her doesnt want to take them and do ya not kennit Part of her would end it here and send him into the Badlands alone No matter what Eddie wanted No matter what Jake undoubtedly wanted too This dark shape with the sun blazing around its head has dragged her out of a mosdy comfortable life oh yes she had her ghostsand at least one meanhearted demon as wellbut which of us dont He has introduced her first to love then to pain then to horror and loss The deals run pretty much downhill in other words It is his balefully talented hand that has authored her sorrow this dusty knighterrant who has come walking out of the old world in his old boots and with an old deathengine on each hip These are melodramatic thoughts purple images and the old Odetta patron of The Hungry i and allaround cool kitty would no doubt have laughed at them But she has changed he has changed her and she reckons that if anyone is entitled to melodramatic thoughts and purple images it is Susannah daughter of Dan Part of her would turn him away not to end his quest or break his spirit only death will do those things but to take such light as remains out of his eyes and punish him for his relentless unmeaning cruelty But ka is the wheel to which we all are bound and when the wheel turns we must perforce turn with it first with our heads up to heaven and then revolving hellward again where the brains inside them seem to burn And so instead of turning away TWO Instead of turning away as part of her wanted to do Susannah took Rolands hands He pulled her up not to her feet for she had none although for awhile a pair had been given her on loan but into his arms And when he tried to kiss her cheek she turned her face so that his lips pressed on hers Let him understand its no halfway thing she thought breathing her air into him and then taking his back changed Let him understand that if Im in it Im in to the end God help me Im in with him to the end THREE There were clothes in the Fedic Millinery amp Ladies Wear but they fell apart at the touch of their handsthe moths and the years had left nothing usable In the Fedic Hotel QUIET ROOMS GUD BEDS Roland found a cabinet with some blankets that would do them at least against the afternoon chill They wrapped up in themthe afternoon breeze wasjust enough to make their musty smell bearableand Susannah asked about Jake to have the immediate pain of it out of the way The writer again she said bitterly when he had finished wiping away her tears God damn the man My hip let go and the and Jake never hesitated Roland had almost called him the boy as he had taught himself to think of Elmers son as they closed in on Walter Given a second chance he had promised himself he would never do that again No of course he didnt she said smiling He never would He had a yard of guts our Jake Did you take care of him Did you do him right Id hear that part So he told her not failing to include Irene Tassenbaums promise of the rose She nodded then said I wish we could do the same for your friend Sheemie He died on the train Im sorry Roland Roland nodded He wished he had tobacco but of course there was none He had both guns again and they were seven Oriza plates to the good as well Otherwise they were stocked with littlegoingonnone Did he have to push again while you were coming here I suppose he did I knew one more might kill him Sai Brautigan did too And Dinky But that wasnt it Roland It was his foot The gunslinger looked at her not understanding He cut it on a piece of broken glass during the fight to take Blue Heaven and the air and dirt of that place was poison It was Detta who spat the last word her accent so thick that the gunslinger barely understood it Pizen Goddam foot swole up toes like sausages then his cheeks and throat went all dusky like a bruise he took fever She pulled in a deep breath clutching the two blankets she wore tighter around her He was delirious but his head cleared at the end He spoke of you and of Susan Delgado He spoke with such love and such regret She paused then burst out We will go there Roland we will and if it isnt worth it your Tower somehow well make it worth it Well go he said Well find the Dark Tower and nothing will stand against us and before we go in well speak their names All of the lost Your list will be longer than mine she said but mine will be long enough To this Roland did not reply but the robot huckster perhaps startled out of its long sleep by the sound of their voices did Girls girls girls it cried from inside the batwing doors of the Gaiety Bar and Grill Some are humie and some are cybie but who cares you cant tell who cares they give you tell girls tell you tell There was a pause and then the robot huckster shouted one final wordSATISFACTIONand fell silent By the gods but this is a sad place he said Well stay the night and then see it no more At least die suns out and thats a relief after Thunderclap but isnt it cold He nodded then asked about the others Theyve gone on she said but there was a minute there when I didnt think any of us were going anywhere except to the bottom of yonder crevasse She pointed to the end of the Fedic high street furthest from the castle wall There are TV screens that still work in some of the traincars and as we came up on town we got a fine view of the bridge thats gone We could see the ends sticking out over the hole but the gap in the middle had to be a hundred yards across Maybe more We could see the train trestle too That was still intact The train was slowing down by then but not enough so any of us could have jumped off By then there was no time And the jump would likely have killed anyone who tried We were going oh Im gonna say fifty miles an hour And as soon as we were on the trestle the fucking thing started to creak and groan Or to queel and grale if youve ever read your James Thurber which I suppose you have not The train was playing music Like Blaine did do you remember Yes But we could hear the trestle getting ready to let go even over that Then everything started shaking from side to side A voicevery calm and soothingsaid We are experiencing minor difficulties please take your seats Dinky was holding that little Russian girl Dani Ted took my hands and said I want to tell you madam that it has been a pleasure to know you There was a lurch so hard it damn near threw me out of my s e a t would have if Ted hadnt been holding onto meand I thought Thats it were gone please God let me be dead before whatevers down there gets its teeth into me and for a second or two we were going backward Backward Roland I could see the whole carwe were in the first one behind the jocotilting up There was the sound of tearing metal Then the good old Spirit of Topeka put on a burst of speed Say what you want to about the old people I know they got a lot of things wrong but they built machines that had some balls The next thing I knew we were coasting into the station And here comes that same soothing voice this time telling us to look around our seats and make sure weve got all our personalsour gunna you ken Like we were on a damn TWA flight landing at Idlewild It wasnt until we were out on the platform that we saw the last nine cars of the train were gone Thank God they were all empty She cast a baleful but frightened eye toward the far end of the street Hope whatevers down there chokes on em Then she brightened Theres one good thingat speeds of up to three hundred miles an hour which is what that aintwehappy voice said the Spirit of Topeka was doing we must have left Master Spider Boy in the dust I wouldnt count on it Roland said She rolled her eyes wearily Dont tell me that I do tell you But well deal with Mordred when the time comes and I dont think that will be today Good Have you been beneath the Dogan again I take it you have Susannahs eyes grew round Isnt it something Makes Grand Central look like a train station someplace out in Sticksville US A How long did it take you to find your way up If it had just been me Id still be wandering around down there Roland admitted Oy found the way out I assumed he was following your scent Susannah considered this Maybe he was Jakes more likely Did you cross a wide passage with a sign on the wall reading SHOW ORANGE PASS ONLY BLUE PASS NOT ACCEPTED Roland nodded but the fading sign painted on the wall had meant litde to him He had identified the passage which the Wolves took at the beginning of their raids by the sight of two motionless gray horses far down the passage and another of those snarling masks He had also seen a moccasin he remembered quite well one that had been made from a chunk of rubber One of Teds or Dinkys he decided Sheemie Ruiz had no doubt been buried in his So he said You got off the trainhow many were you Five with Sheemie gone she said Me Ted Dinky Dani Rostov and Fred Worthingtondo you remember Fred Roland nodded The man in the bankerly suit I gave them the guided tour of the Dogan she said As much as I could anyway The beds where they stole the brains out of the kids and the one where Mia finally gave birth to her monster the oneway door between Fedic and the Dixie Pig in New York that still works Nigels apartment Ted and his friends were pretty amazed by the rotunda where all the doors are especially the one going to Dallas in  where President Kennedy was killed We found another door two levels downthis is where most of the passages arethat goes to Fords Theater where President Lincoln was assassinated in  Theres even a poster for the play he was watching when Booth shot him Our American Cousin it was called What kind of people would want to go and watch things like that Roland thought a lot of people might actually but knew better than to say so Its all very old she said And very hot And very fucking scary if you want to know the truth Most of the machinery has quit and there are puddles of water and oil and God knows what everywhere Some of the puddles gave off a glow and Dinky said he thought it might be radiation I dont like to think what I got growin on my bones or when my hairll start fallin out There were doors where we could hear those awful chimes the ones that set your teeth on edge Todash chimes Yep And things behind some of em Slithery things Was it you or was it Mia who told me there are monsters in the todash darkness I might have he said Gods knew there were There are things in that crack beyond town too Was Mia told me that Monsters that cozen diddle increase and plot to escape she said And then Ted Dinky Dani and Fredjoined hands They made what Ted called the little goodmind I could feel it even though I wasnt in their circle and I was glad to feel it because thats one spooky old place down there She clutched her blankets more tightly I dont look forward to going again But you believe we have to Theres a passage that goes deep under the castle and comes out on the other side in the Discordia Ted and his friends located it by picking up old thoughts what Ted called ghostthoughts Fred had a piece of chalk in his pocket and he marked it for me but itll still be hard to find again What its like down there is the labyrinth in an old Greek story where this bullmonster was supposed to run I guess we can find it again Roland bent and stroked Oys rough fur Well find it This fella will backtrail your scent Wont you Oy Oy looked up at him with his goldringed eyes but said nothing Anyway she went on Ted and the others touched the minds of the things that live in that crack outside of town They didnt mean to but they did Those things are neither for the Crimson King nor against him theyre only for themselves but they think And theyre telepathic They knew we were there and once the contact was made they were glad to palaver Ted and his friends said that theyve been tunneling their way toward the catacombs under the Experimental Station for a long long time and now theyre close to breaking through Once they do theyll be free to roam wherever they want Roland considered this silendy for a few moments rocking back and forth on the eroded heels of his boots He hoped he and Susannah would be long gone before that breakthrough happened but perhaps it would happen before Mordred got here and the halfling would have to face them if he wanted to follow Baby Mordred against the ancient monsters from under the earththat was a happy thought At last he nodded for Susannah to go on We heard todash chimes coming from some of the passages too Not just from behind the doors but from passages with no doors to block em off Do you see what that means Roland did If they picked the wrong oneor if Ted and his friends were wrong about the passageway they had markedhe Susannah and Oy would likely disappear forever instead of coming out on the far side of Castle Discordia They wouldnt leave me down therethey took me back as far as the infirmary before going on themselvesand I was damned glad I wasnt looking forward to finding my way alone although I guess I probably couldve Roland put an arm around her and gave her a hug And their plan was to use the door that the Wolves used Uhhuh the one at the end of the ORANGE PASS corridor Theyll come out where the Wolves did find their way to the River Whye and then across it to Calla Bryn Sturgis The Callage few will take them in wont they Yes And once they hear the whole story they wont wont lynch them or anything Im sure not Henchick will know theyre telling the truth and stand up for them even if no one else will Theyre hoping to use the Doorway Cave to get back Americaside She sighed I hope it works for them but I have my doubts Roland did as well But the four of diem were powerful and Ted had struck him as a man of extraordinary determination and resource The Mannifolk were also powerful in their way and great travelers between the worlds He thought that sooner or later Ted and his friends probably would get back to America He considered telling Susannah that it would happen if ka willed it then thovight better of it Ka was not her favorite word just now and he could hardly blame her for that Now hear me very well and think hard Susannah Does the word Dandelo mean anything to you Oy looked up eyes bright She thought about it It might have some faint ring she said but I cant do better than that Why Roland told her what he believed that as Eddie lay dying he had been granted some sort of vision about a thing or a place or a person Something named Dandelo Eddie had passed this on to Jake Jake had passed it to Oy and Oy had passed it on to Roland Susannah was frowning doubtfully Its maybe been handed around too much There was this game we used to play when we were kids Whisper it was called The first kid would think something up a word or a phrase and whisper it to the next kid You could only hear it once no repeats allowed The next kid would pass on what he thought hed heard and the next and the next By the time it got to the last kid in line it was something entirely different and everyone would have a good laugh But if this is wrong I dont think well be laughing Well Roland said well keep a lookout and hope that I got it right Mayhap it means nothing at all But he didnt really believe that What are we going to do for clothes if it gets colder than this she asked Well make what we need I know how Its something else we dont need to worry about today What we do need to worry about is finding something to eat I suppose if we have to we can find Nigels pantry I dont want to go back under the Dogan until we have to Susannah said Theres got to be a kitchen near the infirmary they must have fed those poor kids something Roland considered this then nodded It was a good idea Lets do it now she said I dont even want to be on the top floor of that place after dark FOUR On Turtleback Lane in the year of  month of August Stephen King awakes from a waking dream of Fedic He types I dont even want to be on the top floor of that place after dark The words appear on the screen before him Its the end of what he calls a subchapter but that doesnt always mean hes done for the day Being done for the day depends on what he hears Or more properly on what he doesnt What he listens for is VesKa Gan the Song of the Turtle This time the music which is faint on some days and so loud on others that it almost deafens him seems to have ceased It will return tomorrow At least it always has He pushes the controlkey and the Skey together The computer gives a little chime indicating that the material hes written today has been saved Then he gets up wincing at the pain in his hip and walks to the window of his office It looks out on the driveway slanting up at a steep angle to the road where he now rarely walks And on the main road Route  never The hip is very bad this morning and the big muscles of his thigh are on fire He rubs the hip absently as he stands looking out Roland you bastard you gave me back the pain he thinks It runs down his right leg like a redhot rope can ya not say Gawd can ya not say Gawdbomb and hes the one who got stuck with it in the end Its been three years since the accident that almost took his life and the pain is still there Its less now the human body has an amazing engine of healing inside it a hotenj he thinks and smiles but sometimes its still bad He doesnt think about it much when hes writing writings a sort of benign todash but its always stiff after hes spent a couple of hours at his desk He thinks of Jake Hes sorry as hell that Jake died and he guesses that when this last book is published the readers are going to be just wild And why not Some of them have known Take Chambers for twenty years almost twice as long as the boy actually lived Oh theyll be wild all right and when he writes back and says hes as sorry as they are as surprised as they are will they believe him Not on your tintype as his grandfather used to say He thinks of MiseryAnnie Wilkes calling Paul Sheldon a cockadoodie brat for trying to get rid of silly bubbleheaded Misery Chastain Annie shouting that Paul was the writer and the writer is God to his characters he doesnt have to kill any of them if he doesnt want to But hes not God At least not in this case He knows damned well that Jake Chambers wasnt there on the day of his accident nor Roland Deschain eitherthe ideas laughable theyre makebelieve for Christs sakebut he also knows that at some point the song he hears when he sits at his fancy Macintosh writingmachine became Jakes deathsong and to ignore that would have been to lose touch with VesKa Gan entirely and he must not do that Not if he is to finish That song is the only thread he has the trail of breadcrumbs he must follow if he is ever to emerge from this bewildering forest of plot he has planted and Are you sure you planted it Well no In fact he is not So call for the men in the white coats And are you completely sure Jake wasnt there that day After all how much of the damned accident do you actually remember Not much He remembers seeing the top of Bryan Smiths van appear over the horizon and realizing its not on the road where it should be but on the soft shoulder After that he remembers Smith sitting on a rock wall looking down at him and telling him that his leg was broke in at least six places maybe seven But between these two memoriesthe one of the approach and the one of the immediate aftermaththe film of his memory has been burned red Or almost red But sometimes in the night when he awakes from dreams he cant quite remember Sometimes there are well Sometimes there are voices he says Why dont you just say it And then laughing I guess Ijust did He hears the approaching click of toenails down the hall and Marlowe pokes his long nose into the office Hes a Welsh Corgi with short legs and big ears and a pretty old guy now with his own aches and pains not to mention the eye he lost to cancer the previous year The vet said he probably wouldnt make it back from that one but he did What a good guy What a tough guy And when he raises his head from his necessarily low perspective to look at the writer hes wearing his old fiendish grin Hows it goin bubba that look seems to say Gettin any good words today How do ya I do fine he tells Marlowe Hangin in How are you doin Marlowe sometimes known as The Snoutmaster waggles his arthritic rear end in response You again Thats what I said to him And he asked Do you remember me Or maybe he said itYou remember meI told him I was thirsty He said he didnt have anything to drink he said sorry and I called him a liar And I was right to call him a liar because he wasnt sorry a bit He didnt care a row of pins if I was thirsty because Jake was dead and he tried to put it on me son of a bitch tried to put the blame on me But none of that actually happened King says watching Marlowe waddle back toward the kitchen where he will check his dish again before taking one of his increasingly long naps The house is empty except for the two of them and under those circumstances he often talks to himself I mean you know that dont you That none of it actually happened He supposes he does but it was so odd for Jake to die like that Jake is in all his notes and no surprise diere because Jake was supposed to be around until the very end All of them were in fact Of course no story except a bad one one that arrives DOA is ever completely under the writers control but this one is so out of control its ridiculous It really is more like watching something happenor listening to a songthan writing a damned madeup story He decides to make himself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch and forget the whole damned thing for another day Tonight he will go to see the new Clint Eastwood movie Bloodxoork and be glad he can go anywhere do anything Tomorrow hell be back at his desk and something from the film may slip out into the bookcertainly Roland himself was partly Clint Eastwood to start with Sergio Leones Man with No Name And speaking of books Lying on the coffeetable is one that came via FedEx from his office in Bangor just this morning The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Browning It contains of course Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came the narrative poem that lies at the root of Kings long and trying story An idea suddenly occurs to him and it brings an expression to his face that stops just short of outright laughter As if reading his feelings and possibly he can King has always suspected dogs are fairly recent emigres from that great Iknowjusthowyoufeel country of Empathica Marlowes own fiendish grin appears to widen One place for the poem old boy King says and tosses the book back onto the coffeetable Its a big un and lands with a thud One place and one place only Then he settles deeper in the chair and closes his eyes Just gonna sit here like this for a minute or two he thinks knowing hes fooling himself knowing hell almost certainly doze off As he does ONE They did indeed find a goodsized kitchen and an adjoining pantry at groundlevel in the Arc Experimental Station and not far from the infirmary They found something else as well the office of sai Richard P Sayre once the Crimson Kings Head of Operations now in the clearing at the end of the path courtesy of Susannah Deans fast right hand Lying atop Sayres desk were amazingly complete files on all four of them These they destroyed using the shredder There were photographs of Eddie and Jake in the folders that were simply too painful to look at Memories were better On Sayres wall were two framed oilpaintings One showed a strong and handsome boy He was shirtless barefooted touslehaired smiling dressed only in jeans and wearing a dockers clutch He looked about Jakes age This picture had a notquitepleasant sensuality about it Susannah thought that the painter sai Sayre or both might have been part of the Lavender Hill Mob as she had sometimes heard homosexuals called in the Village The boys hair was black His eyes were blue His lips were red There was a livid scar on his side and a birthmark on his left heel as crimson as his lips A snowwhite horse lay dead before him There was blood on its snarling teeth The boys marked left foot rested on the horses flank and his lips were curved in a smile of triumph Thats Llamrei Arthur Elds horse Roland said Its image was carried into battle on the pennons of Gilead and was the sigul of all InWorld So according to this picture the Crimson King wins she asked Or if not him then Mordred his son Roland raised his eyebrows Thanks to John Farson the Crimson Kings men won the InWorld lands long ago he said But then he smiled It was a sunny expression so unlike his usual look that seeing it always made Susannah feel dizzy But I think wwon the only battle that matters Whats shown in this picture is no more than someones wishful fairytale Then with a savagery that startled her he smashed the glass over the frame with his fist and yanked the painting free ripping it most of the way down the middle as he did so Before he could tear it to pieces as he certainly meant to do she stopped him and pointed to the bottom Written there in small but nonetheless extravagant calligraphy was the artists name afoich DwrnuZe The other painting showed the Dark Tower a sootygray black cylinder tapering upward It stood at the far end of CanKa No Rey the field of roses In their dreams the Tower had seemed taller than the tallest skyscraper in New York to Susannah this meant the Empire State Building In the painting it looked to be no more than six hundred feet high yet this robbed it of none of its dreamlike majesty The narrow windows rose in an ascending spiral around it just as in their dreams At the top was an oriel window of many colorseach Roland knew corresponding to one of the Wizards glasses The inmost circle but one was the pink of the ball that had been left for awhile in the keeping of a certain witchwoman named Rhea the center was the dead ebony of Black Thirteen The room behind that window is where I would go Roland said tapping the glass over the picture That is where my quest ends His voice was low and awestruck This picture wasnt done from any dream Susannah Its as if I could touch the texture of every brick Do you agree Yes It was all she could say Looking at it here on the late Richard Sayres wall robbed her breath Suddenly it all seemed possible The end of the business was quite literally in sight The person who painted it must have been there Roland mused Must have set up his easel in the very roses Patrick Danville she said Its the same signature as on the one of Mordred and the dead horse do you see I see it very well And do you see the path through the roses that leads to the steps at the base Yes Nineteen steps I have no doubt Chassit And the clouds overhead She saw them too They formed a kind of whirlpool before streaming away from the Tower and toward the Place of the Turtle at the other end of the Beam they had followed so far And she saw another thing Outside the barrel of the Tower at what might have been fiftyfoot intervals were balconies encircled with waisthigh wroughtiron railings On the second of these was a blob of red and three tiny blobs of white a face that was too small to see and a pair of upraised hands Is that the Crimson King she asked pointing She didnt quite dare put the tip of her finger on the glass over that tiny figure It was as if she expected it to come to life and snatch her into the picture Yes Roland said Locked out of the only thing he ever wanted Then maybe we could go right up the stairs and past him Give him the old raspberry on the way by And when Roland looked puzzled at that she put her tongue between her lips and demonstrated This time the gunslingers smile was faint and distracted I dont think it will be so easy he said Susannah sighed Actually I dont either They had what theyd come forquite a bit more in factbut they still found it hard to leave Sayres office The picture held them Susannah asked Roland if he didnt want to take it along Certainly it would be simple enough to cut it out of the frame with the letteropener on Sayres desk and roll it up Roland considered the idea then shook his head There was a kind of malevolent life in it that might attract the wrong sort of attention like moths to a bright light And even if that were not the case he had an idea that both of them might spend too much time looking at it The picture might distract them or even worse hypnotize them In the end maybe its just another mindtrap he thought Like Insomnia Well leave it he said Soon enoughin months maybe even weekswell have the real thing to look at Do you say so she asked faintly Roland do you really say so I do All three of us Or will Oy and I have to die too in order to open your way to the Tower After all you started alone didnt you Maybe you have to finish that way Isnt that how a writer would want it That doesnt mean he can do it Roland said Stephen Kings not the water Susannahhes only the pipe the water runs through I understand what youre saying but Im not sure I entirely believe it Roland wasnt completely sure he did either He thought of pointing out to Susannah that Cuthbert and Alain had been with him at the true beginning of his quest in Mejis and when they set out from Gilead the next time Jamie DeCurry had joined them making the trio a quartet But the quest had really started after the batde of Jericho Hill and yes by then he had been on his own I started lonejohn but thats not how Ill finish he said She had been making her way quite handily from place to place in a rolling officechair Now he plucked her out of it and setded her on his right hip the one that no longer pained him You and Oy will be with me when I climb the steps and enter the door youll be with me when I climb the stairs youll be with me when I deal with yon capering red goblin and youll be with me when I enter the room at the top Although Susannah did not say so this felt like a lie to her In truth it felt like a lie to both of them TWO They brought canned goods a skillet two pots two plates and two sets of utensils back to the Fedic Hotel Roland had added a flashlight that provided a feeble glow from nearly dead batteries a butchers knife and a handy little hatchet with a rubber grip Susannah had found a pair of net bags in which to store this little bit of fresh gunna She also found three cans of jellylike stuff on a high shelf in the pantry adjacent to the infirmary kitchen Its Sterno she told the gunslinger when he inquired Good stuff You can light it up It burns slow and makes a blue flame hot enough to cook on I thought wed build a little fire behind the hotel he said I wont need this smelly stuff to make one certainly He said it with a touch of contempt No I suppose not But it might come in handy How I dont know but She shrugged Near the door to the street they passed what appeared to be a janitors closet filled with piles of rickrack Susannah had had enough of the Dogan for one day and was anxious to be out but Roland wanted to have a look He ignored the mop buckets and brooms and cleaning supplies in favor of a jumble of cords and straps heaped in a corner Susannah guessed from the boards on top of which they lay that this stuff had once been used to build temporary scaffoldings She also had an idea what Roland wanted the strappage for and her heart sank It was like going all the way back to the beginning Thought I was done with piggybackin she said crossly and with more than a touch of Detta in her voice Its the only way I think Roland said Im just glad Im whole enough again to carry your weight And that passage underneaths the only way through Youre sure of that I suppose there might be a way through the castle he began but Susannah was already shaking her head Ive been up top with Mia dont forget The drop into the Discordia on the far sides at least five hundred feet Probably more There might have been stairs in the longago but theyre gone now Then were for the passage he said and the passage is for us Mayhap well find something for you to ride in once were on the other side In another town or village Susannah was shaking her head again I think this is where civilization ends Roland And I think we better bundle up as much as we can because its gonna get cold Bundlingup materials seemed to be in short supply however unlike the foodstuffs No one had thought to store a few extra sweaters and fleecelined jackets in vacuumpacked cans There were blankets but even in storage they had grown thin and fragile just short of useless I dont give a bedbugs ass she said in a wan voice Just as long as we get out of this place We will he said THREE Susannah is in Central Park and its cold enough to see her breath The sky overhead is white from side to side a snowsky Shes looking down at the polar bear whos rolling around on his rocky island seeming to enjoy the cold just fine when a hand snakes around her waist Warm lips smack her cold cheek She turns and there stand Eddie and fake They are wearing identical grins and nearly identical red stocking caps Eddies says MERRY across the front and fakes says CHRISTMAS She opens her mouth to tell them You boys cant be here you boys are dead and then she realizes with a great and singing relief that all that business was just a dream she had And really how could you doubt it There are no talking animals called billybumblers not really no taheencreatures with the bodies of humans and the heads of animals no places called Fedic or Castle Discordia Most of all there are no gunslingers John Kennedy was the last her chauffeur Andrew was right about that Broughtyou hot chocolate Eddie says and holds it out to her Its the perfect cup of hot chocolate mit schlag on top and little sprinkles of nutmeg dotting the cream she can smell it and as she takes it she can feel his fingers inside his gloves and the first flakes of that winters snow drift down between them She thinks how good it is to be alive in plain old New York how great that reality is reality that they are together in the Year of Our Lord What Year of Our Lord She frowns because this is a serious question isnt it After all Eddies an eighties man and she never got any further than  or was it  As for Jake Jake Chambers with the toord CHRISTMAS printed on the front of his happy hat isnt he from the seventies And if the three of them represent three decades from the second half of the twentieth century what is their commonality What year is this NINETEEN says a voice out of the air perhaps it is the voice of Bango Skank the Great Lost Character this is NINETEEN this is CHASSIT All your friends are dead With each word the world becomes more unreal She can see through Eddie and Jake When she looks doion at the polar bear she sees its lying dead on its rock island with its paws in the air The good smell of hot chocolate is fading being replaced by a musty smell old plaster ancient wood The odor of a hotel room where no one has slept for years No her mind moans No I want Central Park I want Mr MERRY and Mr CHRISTMAS I want the smell of hot chocolate and the sight of Decembers first hesitant snowflakes Ive had enough of Fedic InWorld MidWorld and EndWorld I want AfyWorld I dont care if I ever see the Dark Tower Eddies and Jakes lips move in unison as if they are singing a song she cant hear but its not a song the words she reads on their lips just before the dream breaks apart are FOUR Watch out for Dandelo She woke up with these words on her own lips shivering in the early notquitedawn light And the breathseeing part of her dream was true if no other She felt her cheeks and wiped away the wetness tihere It wasnt quite cold enough to freeze die tears to her skin but justadamnbout She looked around the dreary room here in the Fedic Hotel wishing witfi all her heart tfiat her dream of Central Park had been true For one thing shed had to sleep on the floorthe bed was basically nothing but a rustsculpture waiting to disintegrateand her back was stiff For another the blankets shed used as a makeshift mattress and the ones shed wrapped around her had all torn to rags as she tossed and turned The air was heavy with their dust tickling her nose and coating her throat making her feel like she was coming down with the worlds worst cold Speaking of cold she was shivering And she needed to pee which meant dragging herself down the hall on her stumps and halfnumbed hands And none of that was really what was wrong with Susannah Odetta Holmes Dean this morning all right The problem was that she had just come from a beautiful dream to a world this is NINETEEN all your friends are dead where she was now so lonely that she felt halfcrazy with it The problem was that the place where the sky was brightening was not necessarily the east The problem was that she was tired and sad homesick and heartsore griefstruck and depressed The problem was that in this hour before dawn in this frontier museumpiece of a hotel room where the air was full of musty blanketfibers she felt as if all but the last two ounces of fuckyou had been squeezed out of her She wanted the dream back She wanted Eddie I see youre up too said a voice and Susannah whirled around pivoting on her hands so quickly she picked up a splinter The gunslinger leaned against the door between the room and the hall He had woven the straps into the sort of carrier with which she was all too familiar and it hung over his left shoulder Hung over his right was a leather sack filled with their new possessions and the remaining Orizas Oy sat at Rolands feet looking at her solemnly You scared the living Jesus out of me sai Deschain she said Youve been crying Isnt any of your nevermind if I have been or if I havent Well feel better once were out of here he said Fedics curdled She knew exacdy what he meant The wind had kicked up fierce in the night and when it screamed around the eaves of die hotel and the saloon next door it had sounded to Susannah like the screams of childrenwee ones so lost in time and space they would never find their way home All right but Rolandbefore we cross the street and go into that Dogan I want your promise on one thing What promise would you have If something looks like getting ussome monster out of the Devils Arse or one from the todash betweenlandsyou put a bullet in my head before it happens When it comes to yourself you can do whatever you want but what What are you holding that out for It was one of his revolvers Because Im only really good with one of them these days And because I wont be the one to take your life If you should decide to do it yourself however Roland your fuckedup scruples never cease to amaze me she said Then she took the gun with one hand and pointed to the harness with the other As for that thing if you think Im gonna ride in it before I have to youre crazy A faint smile touched his lips Its better when its the two of us isnt it She sighed then nodded A little bit yeah but far from perfect Come on big fella lets blow this place My ass is an icecube and the smell is killing my sinuses FIVE He put her in the rolling officechair once they were back in the Dogan and pushed her in it as far as the first set of stairs Susannah holding their gunna and the bag of Orizas in her lap At the stairs the gunslinger booted the chair over the edge and then stood with Susannah on his hip both of them wincing at the crashing echoes as the chair tumbled over and over to the bottom Thats the end of that she said when the echoes had finally ceased You might as well have left it at the top for all the good its going to do me now Well see Roland said starting down You might be surprised That thing aint gonna work fo shit an we bofe know it Detta said Oy uttered a short sharp bark as if to say Thats right SIX The chair did survive its tumble however And the next as well But when Roland hunkered to examine the poor battered thing after being pushed down a third and extremely long flight of stairs one of the casters was bent badly out of true It reminded him a little of how her abandoned wheelchair had looked when theyd come upon it after the battle with the Wolves on the East Road There now dint I tell you she asked and cackled Reckon its time to start to tin dat barge Roland He eyed her Can you make Detta go away She looked at him surprised then used her memory to replay the last thing she had said She flushed Yes she said in a remarkably small voice Say sorry Roland He picked her up and got her settled into the harness Then they went on As unpleasant as it was beneath the Doganas creepy as it was beneath the DoganSusannah was glad that they were putting Fedic behind them Because that meant they were putting the rest of it behind them too Lud the Callas Thunderclap Algul Siento New York City and western Maine as well The castle of the Red King was ahead but she didnt think they had to worry much about it because its most celebrated occupant had run mad and decamped for the Dark Tower The extraneous was slipping away They were closing in on the end of their long journey and there was little else to worry about That was good And if she should happen to fall on her way to Rolands obsession Well if there was only darkness on the other side of existence as she had for most of her adult life believed then nothing was lost as long as it wasnt todash darkness a place filled with creeping monsters And hey Perhaps there was an afterlife a heaven a reincarnation maybe even a resurrection in the clearing at the end of the path She liked that last idea and had now seen enough wonders to believe it might be so Perhaps Eddie and Jake would be waiting for her there all bundled up and with the first downdrifting snowflakes of winter getting caught in their eyebrows Mr MERRY and Mr CHRISTMAS offering her hot chocolate Mit schlag Hot chocolate in Central Park What was the Dark Tower compared to that SEVEN They passed through the rotunda with its doors to everywhere they came eventually to the wide passage with the sign on the wall reading SHOW ORANGE PASS ONLY BLUE PASS NOT ACCEPTED A little way down it in the glow of one of the stillworking fluorescent lights and near the forgotten rubber moccasin they saw something printed on the tile wall and detoured down to read it J i j C I  I  I  I   L  O Av aYVn VVC Aft C Owr sJQjy ViH UO amp amp JACK Under the main message they had signed their names Fred Worthington Dani Rostov Ted Brautigan and Dinky Earnshaw Below the names were two more lines written in another hand Susannah thought it was Teds and reading them made her feel like crying We PO Vx s e e k ex oeVWrLoorlo God love em Susannah said hoarsely May God love and keep em all Keepum said a small and rather timid voice from Rolands heel They looked down Decided to talk again sugarpie Susannah asked but to this Oy made no reply It was weeks before he spoke again EIGHT Twice they got lost Once Oy rediscovered their way through the maze of tunnels and passagessome moaning with distant drafts some alive with sounds that were closer and more menacingand once Susannah came back to the route herself spotting a Mounds Bar wrapper Dani had dropped The Algul had been wellstocked with candy and the girl had brought plenty with her Although not one single change of clothes Susannah said with a laugh and a shake of her head At one point in front of an ancient ironwood door that looked to Roland like the ones hed found on the beach they heard an unpleasant chewing sound Susannah tried to imagine what might be making such a noise and could think of nothing but a giant disembodied mouth full of yellow fangs streaked with dirt On the door was an indecipherable symbol Just looking at it made her uneasy Do you know what that says she asked Rolandalthough he spoke over half a dozen languages and was familiar with many moreshook his head Susannah was relieved She had an idea that if you knew the sound that symbol stood for youd want to say it Might have to say it And then the door would open Would you want to run when you saw the thing that was chewing on the other side Probably Would you be able to Maybe not Shortly after passing this door they went down another shorter flight of stairs I guess I forgot this one when we were talking yesterday but I remember it now she said and pointed to the dust on the risers which was disturbed Look theres our tracks Fred carried me going down Dinky when we came back up Were almost there now Roland promise you But she got lost again in the warren of diverging passages at the bottom of the stairs and this was when Oy put them right trotting down a dim tunnellike passage where the gunslinger had to walk bentover with Susannah clinging to his neck I dont know Susannah began and that was when Oy led them into a brighter corridor comparatively brighter half of the overhead fluorescents were out and many of the tiles had fallen from the walls revealing the dark and oozy earth beneath The bumbler sat down on a scuffed confusion of tracks and looked at them as if to say Is this what you wanted Yeah she said obviously relieved Okay Look just like I told you She pointed to a door marked FORDs THEATER  SEE THE LINCOLN ASSASSINATION Beside it under glass was a poster for Our American Cousin that looked as if it had been printed the day before What we wants just down here a little way Two lefts and then a rightI think Anyway Ill know it when I see it Through it all Roland was patient with her He had a nasty idea which he did not share with Susannah that the maze of passageways and corridors down here might be in drift just as the points of the compass were in what he was already thinking of as the world above If so they were in trouble It was hot down here and soon they were both sweating freely Oy panted harshly and steadily like a litde engine but kept a steady pace beside the gunslingers left heel There was no dust on die floor and the tracks theyd seen off and on earlier were gone The noises from behind the doors were louder however and as they passed one something on the other side thumped it hard enough to make it shudder in its frame Oy barked at it laying his ears back against his skull and Susannah voiced a litde scream Steadyoh Roland said It cant break through None of them can break through Are you sure of that Yes said the gunslinger firmly He wasnt sure at all A phrase of Eddies occurred to him All bets are off They skirted the puddles being careful not even to touch the ones diat were glowing with what might have been radiation or witchlight They passed a broken pipe that was exhaling a listless plume of green steam and Susannah suggested they hold their breadi until diey were well past it Roland thought that an extremely good idea Thirty or forty yards further along she bid him stop I dont know Roland she said and he could hear her struggling to keep die panic out of her voice I thought we had it made in the shade when I saw the Lincoln door but now this this here Her voice wavered and he felt her draw a deep breadi struggling to get herself under control This all looks different And the sounds how they get in your head He knew what she meant On their left was an unmarked door that had setded crookedly against its hinges and from the gap at the top came the atonal jangle of todash chimes a sound that was both horrible and fascinating With the chimes came a steady draft of stinking air Roland had an idea she was about to suggest they go back while they still could maybe rethink this whole goingunderthecastle idea and so he said Lets see whats up there Its a litde brighter anyway As they neared an intersection from which passages and tiled corridors rayed off in all directions he felt her shift against him sitting up There she shouted That pile of rubble We walked around that We walked around that Roland  remember Part of the ceiling had fallen into the middle of the intersection creating a jumble of broken tiles smashed glass snags of wire and plain old dirt Along the edge of it were tracks Down there she cried Straight ahead Ted said I think this is the one they called Main Street and Dinky said he thought so too Dani Rostov said that a long time ago around the time the Crimson King did whatever it was that darkened Thunderclap a whole bunch of people used that way to get out Only they left some of their thoughts behind I asked her what feeling that was like and she said it was a litde like seeing dirty soapscum on the sides of the tub after you let out the water Not nice she said Fred marked it and then we went all the way back up to the infirmary I dont want to brag and queer the deal but I think were gonna be okay And they were at least for the time being Eighty paces beyond the pile of rubble they came upon an arched opening Beyond it flickering white balls of radiance hung down from the ceiling leading off at a downwardsloping angle On the wall in four chalkstrokes that had already started to run because of the moisture seeping through the tiles was the last message left for them by the liberated Breakers They rested here for awhile eating handfuls of raisins from a vacuumsealed can Even Oy nibbled a few although it was clear from the way he did it that he didnt care for them much When theyd all eaten their fill and Roland had once more stored the can in the leather sack hed found along the way he asked her Are you ready to go on Yes Right away I think before I lose mymy God Roland what was that From behind them probably from one of the passages leading away from the rubblechoked intersection had come a low thudding sound It had a liquid quality to it as if a giant in waterfilled rubber boots had just taken a single step I dont know he said Susannah was looking uneasily back over her shoulder but could see only shadows Some of them were moving but that could have been because some of the lights were flickering Could have been You know she said I think it might be a good idea if we vacated this areajust about as fast as we can I think youre right he said resting on one knee and the splayed tips of his fingers like a runner getting ready to burst from the blocks When she was back in the harness he got to his feet and moved past the arrow on the wall setting a pace that was just short of a jog NINE They had been moving at that nearjog for about fifteen minutes wjien they came upon a skeleton dressed in the remains of a rotting military uniform There was still a flap of scalp on its head and tuft of listless black hair sprouting from it The jaw grinned as if welcoming them to the underworld Lying on the floor beside the things naked pelvis was a ring that had finally slipped from one of the moldering fingers of the dead mans right Hand Susannah asked Roland if she could have a closer look He picked it up and handed it to her She examined it just long enough to confirm what she had thought then cast it aside It made a little clink and then there were only the sounds of dripping water and the todash chimes fainter now but persistent What I thought she said Arid what was that he asked moving on again The guy was an Elk My father had the same damn ring An elk I dont understand Its a fraternal order A kind of goodoleboy katet But what in the hell would an Elk be doing down here A Shriner now that I could understand And she laughed a trifle wildly The hanging bulbs were filled with some brilliant gas that pulsed with a rhythmic but not quite constant beat Susannah knew there was something there to get and after a litde while she got it While Roland was hurrying the pulse of the guidelights was rapid When he slowed down never stopping but conserving his energy all the same the pulse in the globes also slowed down She didnt think they were responding to his heartbeat exactly or hers but that was part of it Had she known the term biorhythm she would have seized upon it Fifty yards or so ahead of their position at any given time Main Street was dark Then one by one the lights would come on as they approached It was mesmerizing She turned to look backonly once she didnt want to throw him off his strideand saw that yes the lights were going dark again fifty yards or so behind These lights were much brighter than the flickering globes at the entrance to Main Street and she guessed that those ran off some other powersource one that was like almost everything else in this world starting to give out Then she noticed that one of the globes they were approaching remained dark As they neared and then passed under it she saw that it wasnt completely dead a dim core of illumination burned feebly deep inside twitching to the beat of their bodies and brains It reminded her of how youd sometimes see a neon sign with one or more letters on the fritz turning PABST into PA ST or TASTY BRATWURST into TASTY RATWURST A hundred feet or so further on they came to another burntout bulb then another then two in a row Chances are good were gonna be in the dark before long she said glumly I know Roland said He was starting to sound the teensiest bit out of breath The air was still dank and a chill was gradually replacing the heat There were posters on the walls most rotted far beyond the point of readability On a dry stretch of wall she saw one that depicted a man who had just lost an arena battle to a tiger The big cat was yanking a bloody snarl of intestines from the screaming mans belly while the crowd went nuts There was one line of copy in half a dozen different languages English was second from the top VISIT CIRCUS MAXIMUS YOU WILL CHEER it said Christ Roland Susannah said Christ almighty what were they Roland did not reply although he knew the answer they were folken who had run mad TEN At hundredyard intervals little flights of stairsthe longest was only ten risers from top to bottomtook them gradually deeper into the bowels of the earth After theyd gone what Susannah estimated to be a quarter of a mile they came to a gate that had been torn away perhaps by some sort of vehicle and smashed to flinders Here were more skeletons so many that Roland had to tread upon some in order to pass They did not crunch but made a damp puttering sound that was somehow worse The smell that arose from them was sallow and wet Most of the tiles had been torn away above these bodies and those that were still on the walls had been pocked with bullet holes A firefight then Susannah opened her mouth to say something about it but before she could that low thudding sound came again She thought it was a little louder this time A little closer She looked behind her again and saw nothing The lights fifty yards back were still going dark in a line I dont like to sound paranoid Roland but I think we are being followed I know we are You want me to throw a shot at it Or a plate That whistling can be pretty spooky No Why not It may not know what we are If you shoot it will It took her a moment to realize what he was really saying he wasnt sure bulletsor an Orizawould stop whatever was back there Or worse perhaps he was sure When she spoke again she worked very hard to sound calm and thought she succeeded tolerably well Its something from that crack in the earth do you think It might be Roland said Or it might be something that got through from todash space Now hush The gunslinger went on more quickly finally reaching jogging pace and then passing it She was amazed by his mobility now that the pain that had troubled his hip was gone but she could hear his breathing as well as feel it in the rise and fall of his backquick gasping intakes followed by rough expulsions that sounded almost like cries of annoyance She would have given anything to be running beside him on her own legs the strong ones Jack Mort had stolen from her The overhead globes pulsed faster now the pulsation easier to see because there were fewer of them In between their combined shadow would stretch long ahead of them then shorten little by litde as they approached the next light The air was cooler the ceramic stuff which floored the passage less and less even In places it had split apart and pieces of it had been tossed aside leaving traps for the unwary These Oy avoided with ease and so far Roland had been able to avoid them too She was about to tell him that she hadnt heard their follower for awhile when something behind them pulled in a great gasping breath She felt the air around her reverse direction felt the tight curls on her head spring wildly about as the air was sucked backward There was an enormous slobbering noise that made her feel like screaming Whatever was back there it was big No Enormous ELEVEN They pelted down another of those short stairways Fifty yards beyond it three more of the pulsing globes bloomed with unsteady light but after that there was just darkness The ragged tiled sides of the passage and its uneven decaying floor melted into a void so deep that it looked like a physical substance great clouds of loosely packed black felt They would run into it she thought and at first their momentum would continue to carry them forward Then the stuff would shove them backward like a spring and whatever was back there would be on them She would catch a glimpse of it something so awful and alien her mind would not be able to recognize it and that might be a mercy Then it would pounce and Roland ran into the darkness without slowing and of course they did not bounce back At first there was a little light some from behind them and some from the globes overhead a few were still giving off a last dying core of radiance Just enough to see another short stairway its upper end flanked by crumbling skeletons wearing a few wretched rags of clothing Roland hurried down the stepsthere were nine in this flightwithout stopping Oy ran at his side ears back against his skull fur rippling sleekly almost dancing his way down Then they were in pure dark Bark Oy so we dont run into each other Roland snapped Bark Oy barked A thirtycount later he snapped the same order and Oy barked again Roland what if we come to another stairway We will he said and a ninetycount after that they did She felt him tip forward feet stuttering She felt the muscles in his shoulders jump as he put his hands out before him but they did not fall Susannah could only marvel at his reflexes His boots rapped unhesitatingly downward in the dark Twelve steps this time Fourteen They were back on the flat surface of the passageway before she could get a good count So now she knew he was capable of negotiating stairs even in the dark even at a dead run Only what if he stuck his foot in a hole God knew it was possible given the way the flooring had rotted Or suppose they came to a stacked bonebarrier of skeletons In the flat passageway at the speed he was now running that would mean a nasty tumble at the very least Or suppose they ran into a jumble of bones at the head of one of the little stairways She tried to block the vision of Roland swooping out into blackness like a crippled highdiver and couldnt quite do it How many of their bones would be broken when they crashlanded at the bottom Shit sugar pick a number Eddie might have said This flatout run was insanity But there was no choice She could hear the thing behind them all too clearly now not just its slobbering breath but a sandpapery rasping sound as something slid across one of the passageway wallsor maybe both Every now and then shed also hear a clink and a clitter as a tile was torn off It was impossible not to construct a picture from these sounds and what Susannah began to see was a great black worm whose segmented body filled the passage from side to side occasionally ripping off loose ceramic squares and crushing them beneath its gelatinous body as it rushed ever onward hungry closing the gap between it and them And closing it much more rapidly now Susannah thought she knew why Before they had been running in a moving island of light Whatever that thing behind them was it didnt like the light She thought of the flashlight Roland had added to their gunna but without fresh batteries it would be next to useless Twenty seconds after flicking the switch on its long barrel the damn thing would be dead Except wait a minute Its barrel Its long barrel Susannah reached into the leather bag bouncing around at Rolands side finding tins of food but those werent the tins she wanted At last she found one that she did recognizing it by the circular gutter running around the lid There was no time to wonder why it should feel so immediately and intimately familiar Detta had her secrets and something to do with Sterno was probably one of them She held die can up to smell and be sure then promptly bashed herself on the bridge of the nose with it when Roland stumbled over somethingmaybe a chunk of flooring maybe another skeletonand had to batde again for balance He won diis time too but eventually hed lose and the thing back there might be on them before he could get up Susannah felt warm blood begin to course down her face and the thing behind them perhaps smelling it let loose an enormous damp cry She thought of a gigantic alligator in a Florida swamp raising its scaly head to bay at the moon And it was so close Oh dear God give me time she thought I dont want to go like this getting shots one thing but getting eaten alive in the dark That was another Go fasterV she snarled at Roland and thumped at his sides with her thighs like a rider urging on a weary horse Somehow Roland did His respiration was now an agonized roar He had not breathed so even after dancing the commala If he kept on his heart would burst in his chest But Faster Tex Let it all out goddammit I might have a trick up my sleeve but in the meantime you give it everydamneverything you got And there in the dark beneath Casde Discordia Roland did TWELVE She plunged her free hand once more into the bag and it closed on the flashlights barrel She pulled it out and tucked it under her arm knowing if she dropped it they were gone for sure then snapped back the tabrelease on the Sterno can relieved to hear the momentary hiss as the vacuumseal broke Relieved but not surprisedif the seal had been broken the flammable jelly inside would have evaporated long ago and the can would have been lighter Roland she shouted Roland I need matches Shirt pocket he panted Reach for them But first she dropped the flashlight into the seam where her crotch met the middle of his back then snatched it up just before it could slide away Now with a good hold on it she plunged the barrel into the can of Sterno To grab one of the matches while holding the can and the jellycoated flashlight would have taken a third hand so she jettisoned the can There were two others in the bag but if this didnt work shed never have a chance to reach for one of them The thing bellowed again sounding as if it were right behind them Now she could smell it the aroma like a load of fish rotting in the sun She reached over Rolands shoulder and plucked a single match from his pocket There might be time to light one not for two Roland and Eddie were able to pop them alight with their thumbnails but Detta Walker had known a trick worth two of that had used it on more than one occasion to impress her whiteboy victims in the roadhouses where shed gone trolling She grimaced in the dark peeling her lips away from her teeth and placed the head of the match between the two front ones on top Eddie if youre there help me sugarhelp me do right She struck the match Something hot burned the roof of her mouth and she tasted sulfur on her tongue The head of the match nearly blinded her darkadapted eyes but she could see well enough to touch it to the jellycoated barrel of the flashlight The Sterno caught at once turning the barrel into a torch It was weak but it was something Turn around she screamed Roland skidded to a stop immediatelyno questions no protestand pivoted on his heels She held the burning flashlight out before her and for a moment they both saw the head of something wet and covered with pink albino eyes Below them was a mouth the size of a trapdoor filled with squirming tentacles The Sterno didnt burn brightly but in this Stygian blackness it was bright enough to make the thing recoil Before it disappeaied into the blackness again she saw all those eyes squeezing shut and had a moment to think of how sensitive they must be if even a little guttering flame like this could Lining the floor of the passageway on both sides were jumbled heaps of bones In her hand the bulb end of the flashlight was already growing warm Oy was barking frantically looking back into the dark with his head down and his short legs splayed every hair standing on end Squat down Roland squat He did and she handed him the makeshift torch which was already beginning to gutter the yellow flames running up and down the stainless steel barrel turning blue The thing in the dark let out another deafening roar and now she could see its shape again weaving from side to side It was creeping closer as the light faltered If the floors wet here were most likely done she thought but the touch of her fingers as she groped for a thighbone suggested it was not Perhaps that was a false message sent by her hopeful sensesshe could certainly hear water dripping from the ceiling somewhere up aheadbut she didnt think so She reached into the bag for another can of Sterno but at first the releasering defied her The thing was coming and now she could see any number of short misshapen legs beneaui its raised lump of a head Not a worm after all but some kind of giant centipede Oy placed himself in front of her still barking every tooth on display It was Oy the thing would take first if she couldnt Then her finger slipped into the ring lying almost flat against the lid of the can There was a pophissh sound Roland was waving die flashlight back and forth trying to fan a litde life into the guttering flames which might have worked had there been fuel for them and she saw their fading shadows rock deliriously back and fordi on the decaying tile walls The circumference of die bone was too big for the can Now lying in an awkward sprawl half in and half out of the harness she dipped into it brought out a handful of jelly and slathered it up and down the bone If the bone was wet this would only buy them a few more seconds of horror If it was dry however then maybe just maybe The thing was creeping ever closer Amid the tentacles sprouting from its mouth she could see jutting fangs In another moment it would be close enough to lunge at Oy taking him with the speed of a gecko snatching a fly out of the air Its rottedfish aroma was strong and nauseating And what might be behind it What other abominations No time to think about that now She touched her thighbone torch to the fading flames licking along the barrel of the flashlight The bloom of fire was greater than she had expectedfar greaterand the things scream this time was filled with pain as well as surprise There was a nasty squelching sound like mud being squeezed in a vinyl raincoat and it lashed backward Git me more bones she said as Roland cast the flashlight aside And make sure theyre dem drah bones She laughed at her own wit since nobody else would a downanddirty Detta cackle Still gasping for breath Roland did as she told him THIRTEEN They resumed their progress along the passage Susannah now riding backward a position that was difficult but not impossible If they got out of here her back would ache a bitch for the next day or two And Ill relish every single throb she told herself Roland still had the Bridgton Old Home Days teeshirt Irene Tassenbaum had bought him He handed it up to Susannah She wrapped it around the bottom of the bone and held it out as far as she possibly could while still keeping her balance Roland wasnt able to runshe would have surely tumbled out of the harness had he tried doing thatbut he maintained a good fast walking pace pausing every now and then to pick up a likelylooking arm or legbone Oy soon got the idea and began bringing them to the gunslinger in his mouth The thing continued to follow them Every now and then Susannah caught a glimpse of its slickgleaming skin and even when it drew back beyond the chancy light of her current torch they would hear those liquid stomping sounds like a giant in mudfilled boots She began to think it was the sound of the things tail This filled her with a horror that was unreasoning and private and almost powerful enough to undo her mind That it should have a tail her mind nearly raved A tail that sounds like its filled with water or jelly or halfcoagulated blood Christ My God My Christ It wasnt just light keeping it from attacking them she reckoned but fear of fire The thing must have hung back while they were in the part of the passage where the glowglobes still worked thinking if it could think that it would wait and take them once they were in the dark She had an idea that if it had known they had access to fire it might simply have closed some or all of its many eyes and pounced on them where a few of the globes were out and the light was dimmer Now it was at least temporarily out of luck because the bones made surprisingly good torches the idea that they were being helped by the recovering Beam in this regard did not cross her mind The only question was whether or not the Sterno would hold out She was able to conserve now because the bones burned on their own once they were goingexcept for a couple of damp ones that she had to cast aside after lighting her next torches from their guttering tipsbut you did have to get diem going and she was already deep into the third and last can She bitterly regretted the one shed tossed away when the thing had been closing in on them but didnt know what else she could have done She also wished Roland would go faster although she guessed he now couldnt have maintained much speed even if shed been faced around the right way and holding onto him Maybe a short burst but surely no more She covild feel his muscles trembling under his shirt He was close to blown out Five minutes later while getting a handful of canned heat to slather on a bony bulb of knee atop a shinbone her fingers touched the bottom of the Sterno can From the darkness behind them came another of those watery stomping sounds The tail of their friend her mind insisted It was keeping pace Waiting for them to run out of fuel and for the world to go dark again Then it would pounce Then it would eat FOURTEEN They were going to need a fallback position She became sure of that almost as soon as the tips of her fingers touched the bottom of the can Ten minutes and three torches later Susannah prepared to tell the gunslinger to stop whenand ifthey came to another especially large ossuary They could make a bonfire of rags and bones and once it was going hot and bright theyd simply run like hell Whenand ifthey heard the thing on their side of the firebarrier again Roland could lighten his load and speed his heels by leaving her behind She saw this idea not as selfsacrificing but merely logicalthere was no reason for the monstrous centipede to get both of them if they could avoid it And she had no plans to let it take her as far as that went Certainly not alive She had his gun and shed use it Five shots for Sai Centipede if it kept coming after that the sixth for herself Before she could say any of these things however Roland got in three words that stopped all of hers Light he panted Up ahead She craned around and at first saw nothing probably because of the torch shed been holding out Then she did a faint white glow More of those globes she asked A stretch of them that are still working Maybe I dont think so Five minutes later she realized she could see the floor and walls in the light of her latest torch The floor was covered with a fine scrim of dust and pebbles such as could only have been blown in from outside Susannah threw her arms up over her head one hand holding a blazing bone wrapped in a shirt and gave a scream of triumph The thing behind her answered with a roar of fury and frustration that did her heart good even as it pebbled her skin with goosebumps Goodbye honey she screamed Goodbye you eyecovered muthafuck It roared again and thrust itself forward For one moment she saw it plain a huge round lump that couldnt be called a face in spite of the lolling mouth the segmented body scratched and oozing from contact with the rough walls a quartet of stubby armlike appendages two on each side These ended in snapping pincers She shrieked and thrust the torch back at it and the thing retreated with another deafening roar Did your mother never teach you that its wrong to tease the animals Roland asked her and his tone was so dry she couldnt tell if he was kidding her or not Five minutes after that they were out ONE They exited through a crumbling hillside arch beside a Quonset hut similar in shape but much smaller than the Arc Experimental Station The roof of this little building was covered with rust There were piles of bones scattered around the front in a rough ring The surrounding rocks had been blackened and splintered in places one boulder the size of the Queen Anne house where the Breakers had been kept was split in two revealing an interior filled with sparkling minerals The air was cold and they could hear the resdess whine of the wind but the rocks blocked the worst of it and they turned their faces up to the sharp blue sky with wordless gratitude There was some kind of battle here wasnt there she asked Yes Id say so A big one long ago He sounded utterly whipped A sign lay facedown on the ground in front of the Quonsets halfopen door Susannah insisted that he put her down so she could turn it over and read it Roland did as she asked and then sat with his back propped against a rock staring at Castle Discordia which was now behind them Two towers jutted into the blue one whole and the other shattered off near what he judged had been the top He concentrated on getting his breath back The ground under him was very cold and he knew already that their trek through the Badlands was going to be difficult Susannah meanwhile had lifted the sign She held it with one hand and wiped off an ancient scrum of dirt with the other The words she uncovered were in English and gave her a deep chill THIS CHECKPOINT IS CLOSED FOREVER Below it in red seeming to glare at her was the Eye of the King TWO There was nothing in the Quonsets main room butjumbles of equipment that had been blasted to ruin and more skeletons none whole In the adjoining storeroom however she found delightful surprises shelves and shelves of canned foodmore than they could possibly carryand also more Sterno She did not think Roland would sneer at the idea of canned heat anymore and she was right She poked her head out of the storerooms rear door almost as an afterthought not expecting to find anything except maybe a few more skeletons and there was one The prize was the vehicle in which this loose agglomeration of bones was resting a dogcart a bit like the one shed found herself sitting in atop the castle during her palaver with Mia This one was both smaller and in much better shape Instead of wood the wheels were metal coated with thin rinds of some synthetic stuff Pullhandles jutted from the sides and she realized it wasnt a dogcart at all but a kind of rickshaw Git ready to pull yo sweetie gray meat This was a typically nasty Detta Walker thought but it surprised a laugh out of her all the same What have you found thats amusing Roland called Youll see she called back straining to keep Detta out of her voice at least In this she did not entirely succeed You gonna see soon enough sho THREE There was a small motor at the rear of the rickshaw but both saw at a glance it had been ages since it had run In the storeroom Roland found a few simple tools including an adjustable wrench It was frozen with its jaw open but an application of oil in what was to Susannah a very familiar redandblack Inl can got it working again Roland used the wrench to unbolt the motor from its mounts and then tumbled it off the side While he worked and Susannah did what Daddy Mose would have called the heavy lookingon Oy sat forty paces outside the arch through which they had exited clearly on guard against the thing that had followed them in the dark No more than fifteen pounds Roland said wiping his hands on his jeans and looking at the tumbled motor but I reckon Ill be glad we got rid of it by the time were done with this thing When do we start she asked As soon as weve loaded as much canned stuff into the back as I think I can carry he said and fetched a heavy sigh His face was pale and stubbly There were dark circles beneath his eyes new lines carving his cheeks and descending to his jaw from the corners of his mouth He looked as thin as a whip Roland you cant Not so soon Youre done up He gestured at Oy sitting so patiently and at the maw of darkness forty paces beyond him Do you want to be this close to that hole when dark comes We can build a fire It may have friends he said that arent shy of fire While we were in yonder shaft that thing wouldnt have wanted to share us because it didnt think it had to share Now it might not care especially if its vengeanceminded A thing like that cant think Surely not This was easier to believe now that they were out But she knew she might change her mind once the shadows began to grow long and pool together I dont think its a chance we can afford to take Roland said She decided very reluctandy that he was right FOUR Luckily for them this first stretch of the narrow path winding into the Badlands was mosdy level and when they did come to an uphill stretch Roland made no objection to Susannahs getting out and hopping gamely along behind what she had dubbed Ho Fats Luxury Taxi until they reached die crest of die hill Little by litde Castle Discordia fell behind them Roland kept going after the rocks had blocked the blasted tower from their view but when the odier one was gone as well he pointed to a stony bower beside the path and said Thats where well camp tonight unless you have objections She had none Theyd brought along enough bones and khaki rags to make a fire but Susannah knew the fuel wouldnt last long The bits of clodi would burn as rapidly as newspaper and the bones would be gone before the hands of Rolands fancy new watch which he had shown her with something like reverence stood together at midnight And tomorrow night there would likely be no fire at all and cold food eaten directly from the cans She was aware that things could have been ever so much worseshe put the daytime temperature at fortyfive degrees give or take and they did have foodbut she would have given a great deal for a sweater even more for a pair of longjohns Probably well find more stuff we can use for fuel as we go along she said hopefully once the fire was lit the burning bones gave off a nasty smell and they were careful to sit downwind Weeds bushes more bones maybe even deadwood I dont think so he said Not on this side of the Crimson Kings castle Not even devilgrass which grows damned near anywhere in MidWorld You dont know that Not for sure She couldnt bear thinking about days and days of unvarying chill with the two of them dressed for nothing more challenging than a spring day in Central Park I think he murdered this land when he darkened Thunderclap Roland mused It probably wasnt much of a shake to begin with and its sterile now But count your blessings He reached over and touched a pimple that had popped out of her skin beside her full lower lip A hundred years ago this might have darkened and spread and eaten your skin right off your bones Gotten into your brain and run you mad before you died Cancer Radiation Roland shrugged as if to say it didnt matter Somewhere beyond the Crimson Kings castle we may come to grasslands and even forests again but the grass will likely be buried under snow when we get there for the seasons wrong I can feel it in the air see it in the way the days darkening so quickly She groaned striving for comic effect but what came out was a sound of fear and weariness so real that it frightened her Oy pricked up his ears and looked around at them Why dont you cheer me up a little Roland You need to know the truth he said We can get on as we are for a good long while Susannah but it isnt going to be pleasant We have food enough in yonder cart to keep us for a month or more if we stretch it out and we will When we come again to land thats alive well find animals even if there is snow And thats what I want Not because well be hungry for fresh meat by then although we will be but because well need the hides I hope we wont need them desperately that it wont be that near a thing but But youre afraid it will Yes he said Im afraid it will For over a long period of time theres little in life so disheartening as constant coldnot deep enough to kill mayhap but always there stealing your energy and your will and your bodyfat an ounce at a time Im afraid were in for a very hard stretch Youll see She did FIVE Theres little in life thats so disheartening as constant cold The days werent so bad They were on the move at least exercising and keeping their blood up Yet even during the days she began to dread the open areas they sometimes came to where the wind howled across miles of broken bushless rock and between the occasional butte or mesa These stuck up into the unvarying blue sky like the red fingers of otherwise buried stone giants The wind seemed to grow ever sharper as they trudged below the milky swirls of cloud moving along the Path of the Beam She would hold her chapped hands up to shield her face from it hating the way her fingers would never go completely numb but instead turned into dazed things full of buried buzzings Her eyes would well up with water and then the tears would gush down her cheeks These teartracks never froze the cold wasnt that bad It was just deep enough to make their lives a slowly escalating misery For what pittance would she have sold her immortal soul during those unpleasant days and horrible nights Sometimes she thought a single sweater would have purchased it at other times she thought No honey you got too much selfrespect even now Would you be willing to spend an eternity in hellor maybe in the todash darknessfor a single sweater Surely not Well maybe not But if the devil tempting her were to throw in a pair of earmuffs And it would have taken so little really to make them comfortable She thought of this constantly They had the food and they had water too because at fifteenmile intervals along the path they came to pumps that still worked pulling great cold gushes of mineraltasting water from deep under the Badlands Badlands She had hours and days and ultimately weeks to meditate on that word What made lands bad Poisoned water The water out here wasnt sweet not by any means but it wasnt poisoned either Lack of food They had food although she guessed it might become a problem later on if they didnt find more In the meantime she was getting almighty tired of corned beef hash not to mention raisins for breakfast and raisins if you wanted dessert Yet it was food Bodygasoline What made the Badlands bad when you had food and water Watching the sky turn first gold and then russet in the west watching it turn purple and then starshot black in the east She watched the days end with increasing dread the thought of another endless night the three of them huddled together while the wind whined and twined its way through the rocks and the stars glared down Endless stretches of cold purgatory while your feet and fingers buzzed and you thought If I only had a sweater and a pair of gloves I could be comfortable Thats all it would take just a sweater and a pair of gloves Because its really not that cold Exactly how cold did it get after sundown Never below thirtytwo degrees Fahrenheit she knew because the water she put out for Oy never froze solid She guessed that the temperature dropped to around forty in the hours between midnight and dawn on a couple of nights it might have fallen into the thirties because she saw tiny spicules of ice around the edge of the pot that served Oy as a dish She began to eye his fur coat At first she told herself this was nothing but a speculative exercise a way of passing the timeexactly how hot did the bumblers metabolism run and exactly how warm did that coat that thick luxuriantly thick that amazingly thick coat keep him Little by little she recognized her feelings for what they were jealousy that muttered in Dettas voice Lil buggah doanfeel no pain after the sun go down do he No not him You reckon you could git two sets o mittens outta that hide She would thrust these thoughts away miserable and horrified wondering if there was any lower limit to the human spirit at its nasty calculating selfserving worst not wanting to know Deeper and deeper that cold worked into them day by day and night by night It was like a splinter They would sleep huddled together with Oy between them then turn so the sides of them that had been facing the night were turned inward again Real restorative sleep never lasted long no matter how tired they were When the moon began to wax brightening the dark they spent two weeks walking at night and sleeping in the daytime That was a little better The only wildlife they saw were large black birds either flying against the southeastern horizon or gathered in a sort of convention atop the mesas If the wind was right Roland and Susannah could hear their shrill gabby conversation You think those thingsd be any good to eat Susannah asked the gunslinger once The moon was almost gone and they had reverted to traveling during the daytime so they could see any potential hazards on several occasions deep crevasses had crossed the path and once they came upon a sinkhole that appeared to be bottomless What do you think Roland asked her Probly not but I wouldnt mind tryin one and finding out She paused What do you reckon they live on Roland only shook his head Here the path wound through a fantastic petrified garden of needlesharp rock formations Further off a hundred or more black crowlike birds either circled a flattopped mesa or sat on its edge looking in Roland and Susannahs direction like a beadyeyed panel of jurors Maybe we ought to make a detour she said See if we cant find out If we lost the path we might not be able to find it again Roland said Thats bullshit Oy would Susannah I dont want to hear any more about it He spoke in a sharply angry tone she had never heard before Angry yes she had heard Roland angry many times But there was a pettiness in this a sulkiness that worried her And frightened her a little as well They went on in silence for the next half an hour Roland pulling Ho Fats Luxury Taxi and Susannah riding Then the narrow path Badlands Avenue shed come to call it tilted upward and she hopped down catching up with him and then going along beside For such forays shed torn his Old Home Days teeshirt in half and wore it wrapped around her hands It protected her from sharp stones and also warmed her fingers at least a little He glanced down at her then back at the path ahead His lower lip was stuck out a bit and Susannah thought that surely he couldnt know how absurdly willful that expression waslike a threeyearold who has been denied a trip to the beach He couldnt know and she wouldnt tell him Later maybe when they could look back on this nightmare and laugh When they could no longer remember what exactly was so terrible about a night when the temperature was fortyone degrees and you lay awake shivering on the cold ground watching the occasional meteor scrape cold fire across the sky thinking Just a sweater thats all I need Just a sweater and Id go along as happy as a parakeet at feeding time And wondering if there was enough hide on Oy to make them each a pair of underdrawers and if killing him might not actually be doing the poor litde beastie a favor hed just been so sad since Jake passed into the clearing Susannah Roland said I was sharp with you just now and I cry your pardon Theres no need she said I think there is Weve enough problems without making problems between us Without making resentments between us She was quiet Looking up at him as he looked off into the southeast at the circling birds Those rooks he said She was quiet waiting In my childhood we sometimes called them Gans Blackbirds I told you and Eddie about how my friend Cuthbert and I spread bread for the birds after the cook was hanged didnt I Yes They were birds exactly like those named Casde Rooks by some Never Royal Rooks though for they were scavenger birds You asked what yonder rooks live on Could be theyre scavenging in the yards and streets of his casde now that hes departed Le Casse Roi Russe or Roi Rouge or whatever you call it Aye I dont say for sure but Roland didnt finish and didnt need to After that she kept an eye on the birds and yes they seemed to be both coming and going from the southeast The birds might mean that they were making progress after all It wasnt much but enough to buoy her spirits for the rest of that day and deep into another shivering rottencold night SIX The following morning as they were eating another cold breakfast in another fireless camp Roland had promised that tonight they would use some of the Sterno and have food that was at least warm Susannah asked if she could look at the watch he had been given by the Tet Corporation Roland passed it over to her willingly enough She looked long at the three siguls cut into the cover especially the Tower with its ascending spiral of windows Then she opened it and looked inside Without looking up at Roland she said Tell me again what they said to you They were passing on what one of their goodminds told them An especially talented one by their accounts although I dont remember his name According to him the watch may stop when we near the Dark Tower or even begin to run backward Hard to imagine a Patek Philippe running backward she said According to this its eightsixteen AM or PM back in New York Here it looks about sixthirty AM but I dont guess that means much one way or the other Howre we supposed to know if this baby is running fast or slow Roland had stopped storing goods in his gunna and was considering her question Do you see the tiny hand at the bottom The one that runs all by himself The secondhand yes Tell me when hes straight up She looked at the secondhand racing around in its own circle and when it was in the noon position she said Right now Roland was hunkered down a position he could accomplish easily now that the pain in his hip was gone He closed his eves and wrapped his arms around his knees Each breath he exhaled emerged in a thin mist Susannah tried not to look at this it was as if the hated cold had actually grown strong enough to appear before them still ghostlike but visible Roland whatre you d He raised a hand to her palm out not opening his eyes and she hushed The secondhand hurried around its circle first dipping down then rising until it was straight up again And when it had arrived there Roland opened his eyes and said Thats a minute A true minute as I live beneath the Beam Her mouth dropped open How in the name of heaven did you do that Roland shook his head He didnt know He only knew that Cort had told them they must always be able to keep time in their heads because you couldnt depend on watches and a sundial was no good on a cloudy day Or at midnight for that matter One summer he had sent them out into the Baby Forest west of the castle night after uncomfortable night and it was scary out there too at least when one was on ones own although of course none of them would ever have said so out loud even to each other until they could come back to the yard behind the Great Hall at the very minute Cort had specified It was strange how that clockinthehead thing worked The thing was at first it didnt And didnt And didnt Down would come Corts callused hand down it would come aclout and Cort would growl Am maggot back to the woods tomorrow night You must like it out there But once that headclock started ticking it always seemed to run true For awhile Roland had lost it just as the world had lost its points of the compass but now it was back and that cheered him greatly Did you count the minute she asked Mississippione Mississippitwo like that He shook his head I just know When a minutes up or an hour Bolsheveckyl she scoffed You guessed If Id guessed would I have spoken after exactly one revolution of the hand You mought got lucky Detta said and eyed him shrewdly with one eye mostly closed an expression Roland detested But never said so that would only cause Detta to goad him with it on those occasions when she peeked out Do you want to try it again he asked No Susannah said and sighed I take your word for it that your watch is keeping perfect time And that means were not close to the Dark Tower Not yet Perhaps not close enough to affect the watch but closer than Ive ever been Roland said quietly Comparatively speaking were now almost in its shadow Believe me SusannahI know But From over their heads came a cawing that was both harsh and oddly muffled Croo croo instead of Caw caw Susannah looked up and saw one of the huge blackbirdsthe sort Roland had called Castle Rooksflying overhead low enough so that they could hear the labored strokes of its wings Dangling from its long hooked bill was a limp strand of something yellowygreen To Susannah it looked like a piece of dead seaweed Only not entirely dead She turned to Roland looked at him widi excited eyes He nodded Devilgrass Probably bringing it back to feather his mates nest Certainly not for the babies to eat Not that stuff But devilgrass always goes last when youre walking into the Nowhere Lands and always shows up first when youre walking back out of them as we are As we finally are Now listen to me Susannah Id have you listen and Id have you push that tiresome bitch Detta as far back as possible Nor would I have you waste my time by telling me shes not there when I can see her dancing the commala in your eyes Susannah looked surprised then piqued as if she would protest Then she looked away without saying anything When she looked back at him again she could no longer feel the presence of the one Roland had called that tiresome bitch And Roland must no longer have detected her presence because he went on I think it will soon look like were coming out of the Badlands but youd do well not to trust what you seea few buildings and maybe a little paving on the roads doesnt make for safety or civilization And before too long were going to come to his castle Le Casse Roi Russe The Crimson King is almost certainly gone from there but he may have left a trap for us I want you to look and listen If theres talking to be done I want you to let me do it What do you know that I dont she asked What are you holding back Nothing he said with what was for him a rare earnestness Its only a feeling Susannah Were close to our goal now no matter what the watch may say Close to winning our way to the Dark Tower But my teacher Vannay used to say that theres just one rule with no exceptions before victory comes temptation And the greater the victory to win the greater the temptation to withstand Susannah shivered and put her arms around herself All I want is to be warm she said If nobody offers me a big load of firewood and a flannel union suit to cry off the Tower I guess well be all right awhile longer Roland remembered one of Corts most serious maxims Never speak the worst aloudbut kept his own mouth shut at least on that subject He put his watch away carefully and then rose ready to move on But Susannah paused a moment longer Ive dreamed of the other one she said There was no need for her to say of whom she was speaking Three nights in a row scuttering along our backtrail Do you think hes really there Oh yes Roland said And I think hes got an empty belly Hungry Mordreds ahungry she said for she had also heard these words in her dream Susannah shivered again SEVEN The path they walked widened and that afternoon the first scabby plates of pavement began to show on its surface It widened further still and not long before dark they came to a place where another path which had surely been a road in the longago joined it Here stood a rusty rod that had probably supported a streetsign although there was nothing atop it now The next day they came to die first building on this side of Fedic a slumped wreck with an overturned sign on the remains of the porch There was a flattened barn out back With Rolands help Susannah turned the sign over and they could make out one word LIVERY Below it was the red eye they had come to know so well I think the track weve been following was once a coachroad between Casde Discordia and the Le Casse Roi Russe he said It makes sense They began to pass more buildings more intersecting roads It was the outskirts of a town or villageperhaps even a city that had once spread around the Crimson Kings casde But unlike Lud there was very litde of it left Sprigs of devilgrass grew in listless clumps around the remains of some of the buildings but nothing else alive And the cold clamped down harder than ever On their fourth night after seeing the rooks they tried camping in the remains of a building that was still standing but both of them heard whispering voices in the shadows Roland identified thesewith a matteroffactness Susannah found eerieas the voices of ghosts of what he called housies and suggested they move back out into the street I dont believe they could do harm to us but they might hurt the little fellow Roland said and stroked Oy who had crept into his lap with a timidity very unlike his usual manner Susannah was more than willing to retreat The building in which they had tried to camp had a chill that she diought was worse than physical cold The tilings they had heard whispering in there might be old but she thought they were still hungry And so the three of them huddled together once more for warmth in the middle of Badlands Avenue beside Ho Fats Luxury Taxi and waited for dawn to raise the temperature a few degrees They tried making a fire from the boards of one of the collapsed buildings but all they succeeded in doing was wasting a double handful of Sterno The jelly guttered along the splintered pieces of a broken chair they had used for kindling then went out The wood simply refused to burn Why Susannah asked as she watched the last few wisps of smoke dissipate Why Are you surprised Susannah of New York No but I want to know why Is it too old Petrified or something It wont burn because it hates us Roland said as if this should have been obvious to her This is his place still his even though hes moved on Everything here hates us But listen Susannah Now that were on an actual road still more paved than not what do you say to walking at night again Will you try it Sure she said Anythings got to be better than lying out on the tarvy and shivering like a kitten that just got a ducking in a waterbarrel So that was what they didthe rest of that first night all the next and the two after that She kept thinking Im gonna get sick I cant go on like this without coming down with something but she didnt Neither of them did There was just that pimple to the left of her lower lip which sometimes popped its top and trickled a little flow of blood before clotting and scabbing over again Their only sickness was the constant cold eating deeper and deeper into the center of them The moon had begun to fatten once more and one night she realized that they had been trekking southeast from Fedic nearly a month Slowly a deserted village replaced the fantastic needlegardens of rock but Susannah had taken what Roland had said to heart they were still in the Badlands and although they could now read the occasional sign which proclaimed this to be THE KINGs WAY with the eye of course always there was the red eye she understood they were really still on Badlands Avenue It was a weirding village and she could not begin to imagine what species of freakish people might once have lived here The sidestreets were cobbled The cottages were narrow and steeproofed the doorways thin and abnormally high as if made for the sort of narrow folk seen in the distorted curves of funhouse mirrors They were Lovecraft houses Clark Ashton Smith houses William Hope Hodgson borderlands houses all crammed together under a Lee Brown Coye sickle moon the houses all atilt and alean on the hills that grew up gradually around the way they walked Here and there one had collapsed and there was an unpleasantly organic look to these ruins as if they were torn and rotted flesh instead of ancient boards and glass Again and again she caught herself seeing dead faces peering at her from some configuration of boards and shadow faces that seemed to rotate in the rubble and follow their course with terrible zombie eyes They made her think of the Doorkeeper on Dutch Hill and that made her shiver On their fourth night on The Kings Way they came to a major intersection where the main road made a crooked turn bending more south than east and thus off the Path of the Beam Ahead less than a nights walk or ride if one happened to be aboard Ho Fats Luxury Taxi was a high hill with an enormous black castle dug into it In the chancy moonlight it had a vaguely Oriental look to Susannah The towers bulged at the tops as if wishing they could be minarets Fantastic walkways flew between them crisscrossing above the courtyard in front of the casde proper Some of these walkways had fallen to ruin but most still held She could also hear a vast low rumbling sound Not machinery She asked Roland about it Water he said What water Do you have any idea He shook his head But Id not drink what flowed close to that castle even were I dying of thirst This place is bad she muttered meaning not just the castle but the nameless village of leaning leering houses that had grown up all around it And Rolandits not empty Susannah if thee feels spirits knocking for entrance into thy headknocking or gnawingthen bid them away Will that work Im not sure it will he admitted but Ive heard that such things must be granted entry and that theyre wily at gaining it by trick and by ruse She had read Dracula as well as heard Pere Callahans story of Jerusalems Lot and understood what Roland meant all too well He took her gendy by the shoulders and turned her away from the castlewhich might not be naturally black after all she had decided but only tarnished by the years Daylight would tell For the present their way was lit by a cloudscummed quartermoon Several other roads led away from the place where they had stopped most as crooked as broken fingers The one Roland wanted her to look upon was straight however and Susannah realized it was the only completely straight street she had seen since the deserted village began to grow silently up around their way It was smoothly paved rather than cobbled and pointed southeast along the Path of die Beam Above it flowed the moongilded clouds like boats in a procession Does thee glimpse a darkish blur at the horizon dear he murmured Yes A dark blur and a whitish band in front of it What is it Do you know I have an idea but Im not sure Roland said Lets have us a rest here Dawns not far off and then well both see And besides I dont want to approach yonder castle at night If the Crimson Kings gone and if the Path of the Beam lies that way She pointed Why do we need to go to his damn old casde at all To make sure he is gone for one thing Roland said And we may be able to trap the one behind us I doubt ithes wilybut theres a chance Hes also young and the young are sometimes careless Youd kill him Rolands smile was wintry in the moonlight Merciless Without a moments hesitation said he EIGHT In the morning Susannah woke from an uncomfortable doze amid the scattered supplies in the back of the rickshaw and saw Roland standing in the intersection and looking along the Path of the Beam She got down moving with great care because she was stiff and didnt want to fall She imagined her bones cold and brittle inside her flesh ready to shatter like glass What do you see he asked her Now that its light what do you see over that way The whitish band was snow which did not surprise her given the fact that those were true uplands What did surprise herand gladdened her heart more than she would have believed possiblewere the trees beyond the band of snow Green firtrees Living things Oh Roland they look lovely she said Even with their feet in the snow they look lovely Dont they Yes he said He lifted her high and turned her back the way they had come Beyond the nasty crowding suburb of dead houses she could see some of the Badlands theyd come through all those crowding spines of rock broken by the occasional butte or mesa Think of this he said Back yonder as you look is Fedic Beyond Fedic Thunderclap Beyond Thunderclap the Callas and the forest that marks the borderland between MidWorld and EndWorld Lud is further back that way and River Crossing further still the Western Sea and the great Mohaine Desert too Somewhere back there lost in the leagues and lost in time as well is what remains of InWorld The Baronies Gilead Places where even now there are people who remember love and light Yes she said not understanding That was the way the Crimson King turned to cast his petulance Roland said He meant to go the other way ye must ken to the Dark Tower and even in his madness he knew better than to kill the land he must pass through he and whatever band of followers he took with him He drew her toward him and kissed her forehead with a tenderness that made her feel like crying We three will visit his castle and trap Mordred there if our fortune is good and his is ill Then well go on and back into living lands Therell be wood for fires and game to provide fresh food and hides to wrap around us Can you go on a little longer dear Can theeV Yes she said Thank you Roland She hugged him and as she did she looked toward the red castle In the growing light she could see that the stone of which it had been made although darkened by the years had once been the color of spilled blood This called forth a memory of her palaver with Mia on the Castle Discordia allure a memory of steadily pulsing crimson light in the distance Almost from where they now were in fact Come to me now if you d come at all Susannah Mia had told her For the King can fascinate even at a distance It was that pulsing red glow of which she had been speaking but Its gone she said to Roland The red light from the castle Forge of the King she called it Its gone We havent seen it once in all this time No he said and this time his smile was warmer I believe it must have stopped at the same time we ended the Breakers work The Forge of the King has gone out Susannah Forever if the gods are good That much we have done although it has cost us much That afternoon they came to Le Casse Roi Russe which turned out not to be entirely deserted after all ONE They were a mile from the castle and the roar of the unseen river had become very loud when bunting and posters began to appear The bunting consisted of red white and blue swagsthe kind Susannah associated with Memorial Day parades and smalltown Main Streets on the Fourth of July On the facades of these narrow secretive houses and the fronts of shops long closed and emptied from basement to attic such decoration looked like rouge on the cheeks of a decaying corpse The faces on the posters were all too familiar to her Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge flashed Vsforvictory and carsalesmen grins NIXONLODGE BECAUSE THE WORKs NOT DONE these read John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson stood with their arms around each other and their free hands raised Below their feet was the bold proclamation WE STAND ON THE EDGE OF A NEW FRONTIER Any idea who won Roland asked over his shoulder Susannah was currently riding in Ho Fats Luxury Taxi taking in the sights and wishing for a sweater even a light cardigan would do her just fine by God Oh yes she said There was no doubt in her mind that these posters had been mounted for her benefit Kennedy did He became your dinh Dinh of the entire United States And Johnson got the job when Kennedy was gunned down Shot Do you say so Roland was interested Aye Shot from hiding by a coward named Oswald And your United States was the most powerful country in the world Well Russia was giving us a run for our money when you grabbed me by the collar and yanked me into MidWorld but yes basically And the folk of your country choose their dinh for themselves Its not done on account of fathership Thats right she said a little warily She halfexpected Roland to blast the democratic system Or laugh at it Instead he surprised her by saying To quote Blaine the Mono that sounds pretty swell Do me a favor and dont quote him Roland Not now not ever Okay As you like he said then went on without a pause but in a much lower voice Keep my gun ready may it do ya Does me fine she agreed at once and in the same low voice It came out Does ee ine because she didnt even want to move her lips She could feel that they were now being watched from within the buildings that crowded this end of The Kings Way like shops and inns in a medieval village or a movie set of one She didnt know if they were humans robots or maybe just stilloperating TV cameras but she hadnt mistrusted the feeling even before Roland spoke up and confirmed it And she only had to look at Oys head ticktocking back and forth like the pendulum in a grandfather clock to know he felt it too And was he a good dinh this Kennedy Roland asked resuming his normal voice It carried well in the silence Susannah realized a rather lovely thing for once she wasnt cold even though this close to the roaring river the air was dank as well as chill She was too focused on the world around her to be cold At least for the present Well not everyone thought so certainly the nut who shot him didnt but I did she said He told folks when he was running that he meant to change things Probably less than half the voters thought he meant it because most politicians lie for the same reason a monkey swings by his tail which is to say because he can But once he was elected he started in doin the things hed promised to do There was a showdown over a olace called Cuba and he was just as brave as well lets just say you would have been pleased to ride with him When some folks saw just how serious he was the motherfucks hired the nut to shoot him Ozwalt She nodded not bothering to correct him thinking that there was nothing to correct really Ozwalt Oz It all came around again didnt it And Johnson took over when Kennedy fell Yep How did he do Was too early to tell when I left but he was more the kind of fella used to playing the game Go along to get along we used to say Do yovi ken it Yes indeed he said And Susannah I think weve arrived Roland brought Ho Fats Luxury Taxi to a stop He stood with the handles wrapped in his fists looking at Le Casse Roi Russe TWO Here The Kings Way ended spilling into a wide cobbled forecourt that had once no doubt been guarded as assiduously by the Crimson Kings men as Buckingham Palace was by the Beefeaters of Queen Elizabeth An eye that had faded only slightly over the years was painted on the cobbles in scarlet From groundlevel one could only assume what it was but from the upper levels of the casde itself Susannah guessed the eye would dominate the view to the northwest Same damn things probably painted at every other point of the compass too she thought Above this outer courtyard stretched between two deserted guardtowers was a banner that looked freshly painted Stenciled upon it also in red white and blue was this WELCOME ROLAND AND SUSANNAH OY TOO KEEP ON ROCKIN IN THE FREE WORLD The castle beyond the inner courtyard and the caged river which here served as a moat was indeed of dark red stone blocks that had darkened to nearblack over the years Towers and turrets burst upward from the castle proper swelling in a way that hurt the eye and seemed to defy gravity The castle within these gaudy brackets was sober and undecorated except for the staring eye carved into the keystone arch above the main entrance Two of the overhead walkways had fallen littering the main courtyard with shattered chunks of stone but six others remained in place crisscrossing at different levels in a way that made her think of turnpike entrances and exits where a number of major highways met As with the houses the doors and windows were oddly narrow Fat black rooks were perched on the sills of the windows and lined up along the overhead walkways peering at them Susannah swung down from the rickshaw with Rolands gun stuffed into her belt within easy reach She joined him looking at the main gate on this side of the moat It stood open Beyond it a humped stone bridge spanned the river Beneath the bridge dark water rushed through a stone throat forty feet wide The water smelled harsh and unpleasant and where it flowed around a number of fangy black rocks the foam was yellow instead of white What do we do now she asked Listen to those fellows for a start he said and nodded toward the main doors on the far side of the castles cobbled forecourt The portals were ajar and through them now came two menperfectly ordinary men not narrow funhouse fellows as she had rather expected When they were halfway across the forecourt a third slipped out and scurried along after None appeared to be armed and as the two in front approached the bridge she was not exactly flabbergasted to see they were identical twins And the one behind looked the same Caucasian fairly tall long black hair Triplets then two to meet and one for good luck They were wearing jeans and heavy peacoats of which she was instantly and achingly jealous The two in front carried large wicker baskets by leather handles Put spectacles and beards on them and theyd look exactly like Stephen King as he was when Eddie and I first met him Roland said in a low voice Really Say true Yes Do you remember what I told you Let you do the talking And before victory comes temptation Remember that too I will Roland are you afraid of em I think theres little to fear from those three But be ready to shoot They dont look armed Of course there were those wicker baskets anything might be in those All the same be ready Count on it said she THREE Even with the roar of the river rushing beneath the bridge they could hear the steady tocktock of the strangers bootheels The two with the baskets advanced halfway across the bridge and stopped at its highest point Here they put down their burdens side by side The third man stopped on the castle side and stood with his empty hands clasped decorously before him Now Susannah could smell the cooked meat that was undoubtedly in one of the boxes Not long pork either Roast beef and chicken all mingled was what it smelled like to her an aroma that was heavensent Her mouth began to water Hile Roland of Gilead said the darkhaired man on their right Hile Susannah of New York Hile Oy of MidWorld Long days and pleasant nights Ones ugly and the others are worse his companion remarked Dont mind him said the righthand Stephen King lookalike dont mind him mocked the other screwing his face up in a grimace so purposefully ugly that it was funny May you have twice the number Roland said responding to the more polite of the two He cocked his heel and made a perfunctory bow over his outstretched leg Susannah curtsied in the Calla fashion spreading imaginary skirts Oy sat by Rolands left foot only looking at the two identical men on the bridge We are uffis said the man on the right Do you ken uffis Roland Yes he said and then in an aside to Susannah Its an old word ancient in fact He claims theyre shapechangers To this he added in a much lower voice that could surely not be heard over the roar of the river I doubt its true Yet it is said the one on the right pleasantly enough Liars see their own kind everywhere observed the one on the left and rolled a cynical blue eye Just one Susannah didnt believe she had ever seen a person roll just one eye before The one behind said nothing only continued to stand and watch with his hands clasped before him We can take any shape we like continued the one on the right but our orders were to assume that of someone youd recognize and trust Id not trust sai King much further than I could throw his heaviest grandfather Roland remarked As troublesome as a trouserseating goat that one We did the best we could said the righthand Stephen King We could have taken the shape of Eddie Dean but felt that might be too painful to the lady The lady looks as if shed be happy to fuck a rope could she make it stand up between her thighs remarked the lefthand Stephen King and leered Uncalledfor said the one behind he with his hands crossed in front of him He spoke in the mild tones of a contest referee Susannah almost expected him to sentence Badmouth King to five minvxtes in the penalty box She wouldnt have minded either for hearing Badmouth King crack wise hurt her heart it reminded her of Eddie Roland ignored all the byplay Could the three of you take three different shapes he inquired of Goodmouth King Susannah heard the gunslinger swallow quite audibly before asking this question and knew she wasnt the only one struggling to keep from drooling over the smells from the foodbasket Could one of you have been sai King one sai Kennedy and one sai Nixon for instance A good question said Goodmouth King on the right A stupid question said Badmouth King on the left Nothing at all to the point Off we go into the wild blue yonder Oh well was there ever an action hero who was an intellectual Prince Hamlet of Denmark said Referee King quietly from behind them But since hes the only one who comes immediately to mind he may be no more than the exception that proves the rule Goodmouth and Badmouth both turned to look at him When it was clear that he was done they turned back to Roland and Susannah Since were actually one being said Goodmouth and of fairly limited capabilities at that the answer is no We could all be Kennedy or we could all be Nixon but Jam yesterday jam tomorrow but never jam today said Susannah She had no idea why this had popped into her head even less why she should have said it out loud but Referee King said Exactly and gave her a gototheheadoftheclass nod Move on for your fathers sake said Badmouth King on the left I can barely look at these traitors to the Lord of the Red wiout puking Very well said his partner Although calling them traitors seems rather unfair at least if one adds ka to the equation Since the names we give ourself would be unpronounceable to you Like Supermans rival Mr Mxyzptlk said Badmouth you may as well use those Los used Him being the one you call the Crimson King Im ego roughly speaking and go by the name of Feemalo This fellow beside me is Fumalo Hes our id So the one behind you must be Fimalo Susannah said pronouncing it imalo Whats he your superego Oh brilliant Fumalo exclaimed I bet you can even say Freud so it doesnt rhyme with lewd He leaned forward and gave her his knowing leer But can you spell it you shorleg New York blackbird Dont mind him said Feemalo hes always been threatened by women Are you Stephen Kings ego id and superego Susannah asked What a good question Feemalo said approvingly What a dumb question Fumalo said disapprovingly Did your parents have any kids that lived Blackbird You dont want to start in playing the dozens with me Susannah said Ill bring out Detta Walker and shut you down Referee King said I have nothing to do with sai King other than having appropriated some of his physical characteristics for a short time And I understand that short time is really all the time you have I have no particular love for your cause and no intention of going out of my way to help younot far out of my way at leastand yet I understand that you two are largely responsible for the departure of Los Since he kept me prisoner and treated me as little more than his court jesteror even his pet monkeyIm not at all sorry to see him go Id help you if I cana little at leastbut no I wont go out of my way to do so Lets get that up front as your late friend Eddie Dean might have said Susannah tried not to wince at this but it hurt It hurt As before Feemalo and Fumalo had turned to look at Fimalo when he spoke Now they turned back to Roland and Susannah Honestys the best policy said Feemalo with a pious look Cervantes Liars prosper said Fumalo with a cynical grin Anonymous Feemalo said There were times when Los would make us divide into six or even seven and for no other reason than because it hurt Yet we could leave no more than anyone else in the castle could for hed set a deadline around its walls We thought hed kill us all before he left Fumalo said and with none of his previous fuckyou cynicism His face wore the long and introspective expression of one who looks back on a disaster perhaps averted by mere inches Feemalo He did kill a great many Beheaded his Minister of State Fumalo Who had advanced syphilis and no more idea what was happening to him than a pig in a slaughterhouse chute mores the pity Feemalo He lined up the kitchen staff and the women o work Fumalo All of whom had been very loyal to him very loyal indeed Feemalo And made them take poison as they stood in front of him He could have killed them in their sleep if hed wanted to Fumalo And by no more than wishing it on them Feemalo But instead he made them take poison Rat poison They swallowed large brown chunks of it and died in convulsions right in front of him as he sat on his throne Fumalo Which is made of skulls do ye ken Feemalo He sat there with his elbow on his knee and his fist on his chin like a man thinking long thoughts perhaps about squaring the circle or finding the Ultimate Prime Number all the while watching them writhe and vomit and convulse on the floor of the Audience Chamber Fumalo with a touch of eagerness Susannah found both prurient and extremely unattractive Some died begging for water It was a thirsty poison aye And we thought we were next At this Feemalo at last betrayed if not anger then a touch of pique Will you let me tell this and have done with it so they can go on or back as they please Bossy as ever Fumalo said and dropped into a sulky silence Above them the Castle Rooks josded for position and looked down with beady eyes No doubt hoping to make a meal of those who dont walk away Susannah thought He had six of the surviving Wizards Glasses Feemalo said And when you were still in Calla Bryn Sturgis he saw something in them that finished the job of running him mad We dont know for sure what it was for we didnt see but we have an idea it was your victory not just in the Calla but further on at Algul Siento If so it meant the end of his scheme to bring down the Tower from afar by breaking the Beams Of course thats what it was Fimalo said quiedy and once more both Stephen Kings on the bridge turned to look at him It could have been nothing else What brought him to the brink of madness in die first place were two conflicting compulsions in his mind to bring the Tower down and to get diere before you could get diere Roland and mount to die top To destroy it or to rule it Im not sure he has ever cared overmuch about understandingitjust about beating you to something you want and then snatching it away from you About such things hed care much Itd no doubt please you to know how he raved about you and cursed your name in the weeks before he smashed his precious playthings said Fumalo How he came to fear you insofar as he can fear Not this one Feemalo contradicted and rather glumly Susannah thought It wouldnt please this one much at all He wins with no better grace than he loses Fimalo said When the Red King saw that the Algul would fall to you he understood that die working Beams would regenerate More That eventually those two working Beams would recreate the other Beams knitting them forth mile by mile and wheel by wheel If that happens then eventually Roland was nodding In his eyes Susannah saw an entirely new expression glad surprise Maybe he does know how to win she thought Then eventually what has moved on might return again the gunslinger said Perhaps MidWorld and InWorld He paused Perhaps even Gilead The light The White No perhaps about it Fimalo said For ka is a wheel and if a wheel be not broken it will always roll Unless the Crimson King can become either Lord of the Tower or its Lord High Executioner all that was will eventually return Lunacy said Fumalo And destructive lunacy at that Bixt of course Big Red always was Gans crazy side He gave Susannah an ugly smirk and said Thats Frooood Lady Blackbird Feemalo resumed And after the Balls were smashed and the killing was done This is what wed have you understand said Fumalo If that is your heads arent too thick to get the sense of it After those chores were finished he killed himself Fimalo said and once more the other two turned to him It was as if they were helpless to do otherwise Did he do it with a spoon Roland asked For that was die prophecy my friends and I grew up with Twas in a bit of doggerel Yes indeed said Fimalo I thought hed cut his throat with it for the edge of the spoons bowl had been sharpened like certain plates ye kenkas a wheel and always comes around to where it started but he swallowed it Swallowed it can you imagine Great gouts of blood poured from his mouth Freshets Then he mounted the greatest of the gray horseshe calls it Nis after the land of sleep and dreamsand rode southeast into the white lands of Empathica with his litde bit of gunna before him on the saddle He smiled There are great stores of food here but he has no need of it as you may ken Los no longer eats Wait a minute time out Susannah said raising her hands in a Tshape it was a gesture shed picked up from Eddie although she didnt realize it If he swallowed a sharpened spoon and cut himself open as well as choking Lady Blackbird begins to see the light Fumalo exulted and shook his hands at the sky then how could he do anything Los cannot die Feemalo said as if explaining something obvious to a threeyearold And you You poor saps his partner put in with goodnatured viciousness You cant kill a man whos already dead Fimalo finished As he was Roland your guns might have ended him Roland was nodding Handed down from father to son with barrels made from Arthur Elds great sword Excalibur Yes thats also part of the prophecy As he of course would know But now hes safe from them Has put himself beyond them He is Undead We have reason to believe that hes been shunted onto a balcony of the Tower Roland said Undead or not he never could have gained the top without some sigul of the Eld surely if he knew so much prophecy then he knew that Fimalo was smiling grimly Aye but as Horatio held the bridge in a story told in Susannahs world so Los the Crimson King now holds the Tower He has found his way into its mouth but cannot climb to the top tis true Yet while he holds it hard neither can you It seems old King Red wasnt entirely mad after all Feemalo said Crayzee laka de focks Fumalo added He tapped his temple gravely and then burst out laughing But if you go on said Fimalo you bring to him the siguls of the Eld he needs to gain possession of that which now holds him captive Hed have to take them from me first Roland said From us He spoke without drama as if merely commenting on the weather True Fimalo agreed but consider Roland You cannot kill him with them but it is possible that he might be able to take them from you for his mind is devious and his reach is long If he were to do so well Imagine a dead king and mad at the top of the Dark Tower with a pair of the great old guns in his possession He might rule from there but I think that given his insanity hed choose to bring it down instead Which he might be able to do Beams or no Beams Fimalo studied them gravely from his place on the far side of the bridge And then he said all would be darkness FOUR There was a pause during which those gathered in that place considered the idea Then Feemalo said almost apologetically The cost might not be so great if one were just to consider this world which we might call Tower Keystone since the Dark Tower exists here not as a rose as it does on many or an immortal tiger as it does on some or the urlog Rover as it does on at least one A dog named Rover Susannah asked bemused Do you really say so Lady you have all the imagination of a halfburnt stick Fumalo said in a tone of deep disgust Feemalo paid no heed In this world the Tower is itself In the world where you Roland have most lately been most species still breed true and many lives are sweet There is still energy and hope Would you risk destroying that world as well as this and the other worlds sai King has touched with his imagination and drawn from For it was not he that created them you know To peek in Gans navel does not make one Gan although many creative people seem to think so Would you risk it all Were just asking not trying to convince you Fimalo said But the truth is bald now this is only your quest gunslinger Thats all it is Nothing sends you further Once you pass beyond this castle and into the White Lands you and your friends pass beyond ka itself And you need not do it All you have been through was set in motion so that you might save the Beams and by saving them ensure the eternal existence of the Tower the axle upon which all worlds and all life spins That is done If you turn back now the dead King will be trapped forever where he is Sez you Susannah put in and with a rudeness worthy of sai Fumalo Whether you speak true or speak false Roland said I will push on For I have promised To whom have you given your promise Fimalo burst out For the first time since stopping on the castle side of the bridge he unclasped his hands and used them to push his hair back from his brow The gesture was small but expressed his frustration with perfect eloquence For theres no prophecy of such a promise I tell you so There wouldnt be For its one I made myself and one I mean to keep This man is as crazy as Los the Red Fumalo said not without respect All right Fimalo said He sighed and once more clasped his hands before him I have done what I can do He nodded to his other two thirds who were looking attentively back at him Feemalo and Fumalo each dropped to one knee Feemalo his right Fumalo his left They lifted away the lids of the wicker boxes they had carried and tilted them forward Susannah was fleetingly reminded of how the models on The Price Is Right and Concentration showed off the prizes Inside one was food roasts of chicken and pork joints of beef great pink rounds of ham Susannah felt her stomach expand at the sight as if making ready to swallow all of it and it was only with a great effort that she stopped the sensual moan rising in her throat Her mouth flooded with saliva and she raised a hand to wipe it away They would know what she was doing she supposed there was no help for that but she could at least keep them from the satisfaction of seeing the physical evidence of her hunger gleaming on her lips and chin Oy barked but kept his seat by the gunslingers left heel Inside the other basket were big cableknit sweaters one green and one red Christmas colors Theres also long underwear coats fleecelined shorboots and gloves said Feemalo For Empathicas deadly cold at this time of year and youll have months of walking ahead On the outskirts of town weve left you a light aluminum sledge Fimalo said You can throw it in the back of your little cart and then use it to carry the lady and your gunna once you reach the snowlands You no doubt wonder why we do all this since we disapprove of your journey said Feemalo The fact is were grateful for our survival We really did think we were done for Fumalo broke in The quarterback is toast Eddie might have said And this too hurt her but not as much as looking at all that food Not as much as imagining how it would feel to slip one of those bulky sweaters over her head and let the hem fall all the way to the middle of her thighs My decision was to try and talk you out of going if I could said Fimalothe only one who spoke of himself in the firstperson singular Susannah had noticed And if I couldnt Id give you the supplies youd need to go on with You cant kill him Fumalo burst out Dont you see that you woodenheaded killing machine dont you see All you can do is get overeager and play into his dead hands How can you be so stu Hush Fimalo said mildly and Fumalo hushed at once Hes taken his decision What will you do Roland asked Once weve pushed on that is The three of them shrugged in perfect mirror unison but it was Fimalothe socalled uffis superegowho answered Wait here he said See if the matrix of creation lives or dies In the meanwhile try to refurbish Le Casse and bring it to some of its previous glory It was a beautiful place once It can be beautiful again And now I think our palavers done Take your gifts with our thanks and good wishes Grudging good wishes said Fumalo and actually smiled Coming from him that smile was both dazzling and unexpected Susannah almost started forward Hungry as she was for fresh food for fresh meat it was the sweaters and the thermal underwear that she really craved Although supplies were getting thin and would surely run out before they were past the place die uffi called Empathica there were still cans of beans and tuna and corned beef hash rolling around in the back of Ho Fats Luxury Taxi and their bellies were currendy full It was the cold that was killing her That was what it felt like at least cold working its way inward toward her heart one painful inch at a time Two dungs stopped her One was the realization that a single step forward was all it would take to destroy what little remained of her will shed run to the center of the bridge and fall on her knees before that deep basket of clothes and go grubbing through it like a predatory housewife at the annual Filenes whitesale Once she took diat first step nothing would stop her And losing her will wouldnt be the worst of it she would also lose the selfrespect Odetta Holmes had labored all her life to win despite die barely suspected saboteur lurking in her mind Yet even that wouldnt have been enough to hold her back What did was a memory of die day theyd seen die crow with die green stuff in its beak the crow that had been going Croo crool instead of Caw cawOnly devilgrass true but green stuff all the same Living stuff That was die day Roland had told her to hold her tongue had told herwhat was it Before victory comes temptation She never would have suspected that her lifes greatest temptation would be a cableknit fishermans sweater but She suddenly understood what the gunslinger must have known if not from the first then from soon after the three Stephen Kings appeared this whole thing was a shuck She didnt know what exacdy was in those wicker baskets but she doubted like hell that it was food and clothes She setded within herself Well Fimalo asked patiendy Will you come and take the presents Id give you You must come if youd have them for halfway across the bridge is as far as I can go myself Just beyond Feemalo and Fumalo is the Kings deadline You and she may pass both ways We may not Roland said We thank you for your kindness sai but were going to refuse We have food and clothing is waiting for us up ahead still on the hoof Besides its really not that cold No Susannah agreed smiling into the three identicaland identically dumbfoundedfaces Its really not Well be pushing on Roland said and made another bow over his cocked leg Say thankya say may ya do well Susannah put in and once more spread her invisible skirts She and Roland began to turn away And that was when Feemalo and Fumalo still down on their knees reached inside the open baskets before them Susannah needed no instruction from Roland not so much as a shouted word She drew the revolver from her belt and shot down the one on her leftFumalojust as he swung a longbarreled silver gun out of the basket What looked like a scarf was hanging from it Roland drew from his holster as blindingly fast as ever and fired a single shot Above them the rooks took wing cawing affrightedly turning the blue sky momentarily black Feemalo also holding one of the silver guns collapsed slowly forward across his basket of food with a dying expression of surprise on his face and a bullethole dead center in his forehead FIVE Fimalo stood where he was on the far side of the bridge His hands were still clasped in front of him but he no longer looked like Stephen King He now wore the long yellowcomplexioned face of an old man who is dying slowly and not well What hair he had was a dirty gray rather than luxuriant black His skull was a peeling garden of eczema His cheeks chin and forehead were lumped with pimples and open sores some pustulating and some bleeding What are you really Roland asked him A hume just as you are said Fimalo resignedly Rando Thoughtful was my name during my years as the Crimson Kings Minister of State Once upon a time however I was plain old Austin Cornwell from upstate New York Not the Keystone World I regret to say but another I ran the Niagara Mall at one time and before that I had a successful career in advertising You might be interested to know I worked on accounts for both NozzALa and the Takuro Spirit Susannah ignored this bizarre and unexpected resume So he didnt have his top boy beheaded after all she said What about the three Stephen Kings Just a glammer said the old man Are you going to kill me Go ahead All I ask is that you make quick work of it Im not well as you must see Was any of what you told us true Susannah asked His old eyes looked at her with watery amazement All of it was he said and advanced onto the bridge where two other old menhis assistants once upon a time she had no doubtlay sprawled All of it anyway save for one lie and this He kicked the baskets over so that the contents spilled out Susannah gave an involuntary shout of horror Oy was up in a flash standing protectively in front of her with his short legs spread and his head lowered Its all right she said but her voice was still trembling I was just startled The wicker basket which had seemed to contain all sorts of freshly cooked roasts was actually filled with decaying human limbslong pork after all and in bad shape even considering what it was The flesh was mostly blueblack and ateem with maggots And there were no clothes in the other basket What Fimalo had spilled out of it was actually a shiny knot of dying snakes Their beady eyes were dull their forked tongues flickered listlessly in and out several had already ceased to move You would have refreshed them wonderfully if youd pressed them against your skin Fimalo said regretfully You didnt really expect that to happen did you Roland asked No the old man admitted He sat on the bridge with a weary sigh One of the snakes attempted to crawl into his lap and he pushed it away with a gesture that was both absent and impatient But I had my orders so I did Susannah was looking at the corpses of the other two with horrified fascination Feemalo and Fumalo nowjust a couple of dead old men were rotting with unnatural rapidity their parchment skins deflating toward the bone and oozing slack rivulets of pus As she watched the sockets of Feemalos skull surfaced like twin periscopes giving the corpse a momentary expression of shock Some of the snakes crawled and writhed around these decaying corpses Others were crawling into the basket of maggoty limbs seeking the undoubtedly warmer regions at the bottom of the heap Decay brought its own temporary fevers and she supposed that she herself might be tempted to luxuriate in it while she could If she were a snake that was Are you going to kill me Fimalo asked Nay Roland said for your duties arent done You have another coming along behind Fimalo looked up a gleam of interest in his rheumy old eyes Your son Mine and your masters as well Would you give him a word for me during your palaver If Im alive to give it sure Tell him that Im old and crafty while hes but young Tell him that if he lies back he may live awhile yet with his dreams of revenge although what Ive done to him requiring his vengeance I know not And tell him that if he comes forward Ill kill him as I intend to kill his Red Father Either you listen and dont hear or hear and dont believe Fimalo said Now that his own ruse had been exposed nothing so glamorous as an uffi Susannah thought just a retreaded adman from upstate New York he seemed unutterably weary You cannot kill a creature that has killed itself Nor can you enter the Dark Tower for there is only one entrance and the balcony upon which Los is imprisoned commands it And hes armed with a sufficiency of weapons The sneetches alone would seek you out and slay you before youd crossed halfway through the field of roses Thats our worry Roland said and Susannah thought hed rarely spoken a truer word she was worrying about it already As for you will you pass my message on to Mordred when you see him Fimalo made a gesture of acquiescence Roland shook his head Dont just flap thy hand at me cullylet me hear from your mouth Ill pass along your message said Fimalo then added If I see him and we palaver You will day to you sir Roland began to turn away but Susannah caught his arm and he turned back Swear to me that all you told us was true she bade the ugly ancient sitting on the cobbled bridge and below the cold gaze of the crows who were beginning to settle back to their former places What she meant to learn or prove by this she had not the slightest idea Would she know this mans lies even now Probably not But she pressed on just the same Swear it on the name of your father and on his face as well The old man raised his right hand to her palm out and Susannah saw there were open sores even there I swear it on the name of Andrew John Cornwell of Tioga Springs New York And on his face too The King of this casde really did run mad and really did burst those Wizards Glasses that had come into his hands He really did force the staff to take poison and he really did watch them die He flung out the hand hed held up in pledge to the box of severed limbs Where do you think I got those Lady Blackbird Body Parts R Us She didnt understand the reference and remained still He really has gone on to the Dark Tower Hes like the dog in some old fable or other wanting to make sure that if he cant get any good from the hay no one else will either I didnt even lie to you about what was in these boxes not really I simply showed you the goods and let you draw your own conclusions His smile of cynical pleasure made Susannah wonder if she ought to remind him that Roland at least had seen through this trick She decided it wasnt worth it I told you only one outright lie said the former Austin Cornwell That hed had me beheaded Are you satisfied Susannah Roland asked her Yes she said although she wasnt not really Lets go Climb up in Ho Fat then and dont turn thy back on him when thee does Hes sly Tell me about it Susannah said and then did as she was asked Long days and pleasant nights said the former sai Cornwell from where he sat amid the squirming dying snakes May the Man Jesus watch over you and all your clanfam And may you show sense before its too late for sense and stay away from the Dark Tower SIX They retraced their path to the intersection where they had turned away from the Path of the Beam to go to the Crimson Kings castle and here Roland stopped to rest for a few minutes A little bit of a breeze had gotten up and the patriotic bunting flapped She saw it now looked old and faded The pictures of Nixon Lodge Kennedy and Johnson had been defaced by graffiti which was itself ancient All the glammersuch ragged glammer as the Crimson King had been able to manage at any ratewas gone Masks off masks off she thought tiredly It was a wonderful party but now its finished and the Red Death holds sway over all She touched the pimple beside her mouth then looked at the tip of her finger She expected to see blood or pus or both There was neither and that was a relief How much of it do you believe Susannah asked him Pretty much all of it Roland replied So hes up there In the Tower Not in it Trapped outside it He smiled Theres a big difference Is there really And what will you do to him I dont know Do you think that if he did get control of your guns diat he could get back inside the Tower and climb to the top Yes The reply was immediate What will you do about it Not let him get either of them He spoke as if this should have been selfevident and Susannah supposed it should have been What she had a way of forgetting was how goddamned literalhe was About everything You were diinking of trapping Mordred back at the castle Yes Roland agreed but given what we found thereand what we were toldit seemed better to move on Simpler Look He took out the watch and snapped open the lid They both observed the secondhand racing its solitary course But at the same speed as before Susannah didnt know for sure but she didnt think so She looked up at Roland with her eyebrows raised Most of die time its still right Roland said but no longer all of the time I think that its losing at least a second every sixdi or seventh revolution Perhaps three to six minutes a day all told Thats not very much No Roland admitted putting the watch away but its a start Let Mordred do as he will The Dark Tower lies close beyond the white lands and I mean to reach it Susannah could understand his eagerness She only hoped it wouldnt make him careless If it did Mordred Deschains youth might no longer matter If Roland made the right mistake at the wrong moment she he and Oy might never see the Dark Tower at all Her thoughts were interrupted by a great fluttering from behind them Not quite lost within it came a human sound that began as a howl and quickly rose to a shriek Although distance diminished that cry the horror and pain in it were all too clear At last mercifully it faded The Crimson Kings Minister of State has entered the clearing Roland said Susannah looked back toward the castle She could see its blackishred ramparts but nothing else She was glad she could see nothing else Mordreds ahungry she thought Her heart was beating fast and she thought she had never been so frightened in her whole lifenot lying next to Mia as she gave birth not even in the blackness under Castle Discordia Mordreds ahungry but now hell be fed SEVEN The old man who had begun life as Austin Cornwell and who would end it as Rando Thoughtful sat at the casde end of the bridge The rooks waited above him perhaps sensing that the days excitement was not yet done Thoughtful was warm enough thanks to the peacoat he was wearing and he had helped himself to a mouthful of brandy before leaving to meet Roland and his blackbird ladyfriend Well perhaps that wasnt quite true Perhaps it was Brass and Compson also known as Feemalo and Fumalo whod had die mouthfuls of die Kings best brandy and Loss exMinister of State who had polished off the last third of the bottle Whatever the cause the old man fell asleep and the coming of Mordred RedHeel didnt wake him He sat with his chin on his chest and drool trickling from between his pursed lips looking like a baby who has fallen asleep in his highchair The birds on the parapets and walkways were gathered more thickly than ever Surely they would have flown at the approach of the young Prince but he looked up at them and made a gesture in the air the open right hand waved brusquely across the face then curled into a fist and pulled downward Wait it said Mordred stopped on the town side of the bridge sniffing delicately at the decayed meat That smell had been charming enough to bring him here even though he knew Roland and Susannah had continued along the Path of the Beam Let them and their pet bumbler get fairly back on their way was the boys thinking This wasnt the time to close the gap Later perhaps Later his White Daddy would let down his guard if only for a moment and then Mordred would have him For dinner he hoped but lunch or breakfast would do almost as well When we last saw this fellow he was only babybunting babydear baby bring your berries here an infant The creature standing beyond the gates of the Crimson Kings castle had grown into a boy who looked about nine years old Not a handsome boy not the sort anyone except for his lunatic mother would have called comely This had less to do with his complicated genetic inheritance than with plain starvation The face beneath the dry spall of black hair was haggard and far too thin The flesh beneath Mordreds blue bombardiers eyes was a discolored pouchy purple His complexion was a birdshot blast of sores and blemishes These like the pimple beside Susannahs mouth could have been the result of his journey through the poisoned lands but surely Mordreds diet had something to do with it He could have stocked up on canned goods before setting out from the checkpoint beyond the tunnels mouthRoland and Susannah had left plenty behindbut he hadnt thought to do so He was as Roland knew still learning the tricks of survival The only thing Mordred had taken from the checkpoint Quonset was a rotting railwaymans pillowtick jacket and a pair of serviceable boots Finding the boots was good fortune indeed although they had mostly fallen apart as the trek continued Had he been a humeor even a more ordinary werecreature for that matterMordred would have died in the Badlands coat or no coat boots or no boots Because he was what he was he had called the rooks to him when he was hungry and the rooks had no choice but to come The birds made nasty eating and the bugs he summoned from beneath the parched and still faintly radioactive rocks were even worse but he had choked them down One day he had touched the mind of a weasel and bade it come It had been a scrawny wretched thing on the edge of starvation itself but it tasted like the worlds finest steak after the birds and the bugs Mordred had changed into his other self and gathered the weasel into his sevenlegged embrace sucking and eating until there was nothing left but a torn piece of fur He would have gladly eaten another dozen but that had been the only one And now there was a whole basket of food set before him It was wellaged true but what of that Even the maggots would provide nourishment More than enough to carry him into the snowy woods southeast of the castle which would be teeming with game But before them there was the old man Rando he said Rando Thoughtful The old man jerked and mumbled and opened his eyes For a moment he looked at the scrawny boy standing before him with a total lack of understanding Then his rheumy eyes filled with fright Mordred son of Los he said trying a smile Hile to you King that will be He made a shuffling gesture with his legs then seemed to realize that he was sitting down and it wouldnt do He attempted to find his feet fell back with a bump that amused the boy amusement had been hard to come by in the Badlands and he welcomed it then tried again This time he managed to get up I see no bodies except for those of two fellows who look like they died even older than you Mordred remarked looking around in exaggerated fashion I certainly see no dead gunslingers of either the longleg or shorleg variety You say trueand I say thankya ocourse I dobut I can explain that sai and quite easily Oh but wait Hold thy explanation excellent though Im sure it is Let me guess instead Is it that the snakes have bound the gunslinger and his lady long fat snakes and youve had them removed into yonder castle for safekeeping My lord If so Mordred continued there must have been an almighty lot of snakes in thy basket for I still see many out here Some appear to be dining on what should have been my supper Although the severed rotting limbs in the basket would still be his supperpart of it anywayMordred gave the old fellow a reproachful look Have the gunslingers been put away then The old mans look of fright departed and was replaced by one of resignation Mordred found this downright infuriating What he wanted to see in old sai Thoughtfuls face was not fright and certainly not resignation but hope Which Mordred would snatch away at his leisure His shape wavered For a moment the old man saw the unformed blackness which lurked beneath and the many legs Then it was gone and the boy was back For the moment at least May I not die screaming the former Austin Cornwell thought At least grant me that much you gods that be May I not die screaming in the arms of yonder monstrosity You know whats happened here young sai Its in my mind and so its in yours Why not take the mess in that basketthe snakes too do ya like emand leave an old man to what little life he has left For your fathers sake if not your own I served him well even at the end I could have simply hunkered in the castle and let them go their course But I didnt I tried You had no choice Mordred replied from his end of the bridge Not knowing if it was true or not Nor caring Dead flesh was only nourishment Living flesh and blood still rich with the air of a mans last breath ah that was something else That was fine diningDid he leave me a message Aye you know he did Tell me Why dont you just pick it out of my mind Again there came that fluttering momentary change For a moment it was neither a boy nor a boysized spider standing on the far end of the bridge but something that was both at the same time Sai Thoughtfuls mouth went dry even while the drool that had escaped during his nap still gleamed on his chin Then the boyversion of Mordred solidified again inside his torn and rotting coat Because it pleases me to hear it from your drooping old stewhole he told Thoughtful The old man licked his lips All right may it do ya fine He said that hes crafty while youre young and without so much as a sip of guile He said that if you dont stay back where you belong hell have your head off your shoulders He said hed like to hold it up to your Red Father as he stands trapped upon his balcony This was quite a bit more than Roland actually said as we should know having been there and more than enough for Mordred Yet not enough for Rando Thoughtful Perhaps only ten days before it would have accomplished the old mans purpose which was to goad the boy into killing him quickly But Mordred had seasoned in a hurry and now withstood his first impulse to simply bolt across the bridge into the castle courtyard changing as he charged and tearing Rando Thoughtfuls head from his body with the swipe of one barbed leg Instead he peered up at the rookshundreds of them nowand they peered back at him as intent as pupils in a classroom The boy made a fluttering gesture with his arms then pointed at the old man The air was at once filled with the rising whir of wings The Kings Minister turned to flee but before hed gotten a single step the rooks descended on him in an inky cloud He threw his arms up to protect his face as they lit on his head and shoulders turning him into a scarecrow This instinctive gesture did no good more of them alit on his upraised arms until the very weight of the birds forced them down Bills nipped and needled at the old mans face drawing blood in tiny tattoo stipples No Mordred shouted Save the skin for me but you may have his eyes It was then as the eager rooks tore Rando Thoughtfuls eyes from their living sockets that the exMinister of State uttered the rising howl Roland and Susannah heard as they neared the edge of Castletown The birds who couldnt find a roostingplace hung around him in a living thunderhead They turned him on his levitating heels and carried him toward the changeling who had now advanced to die center of the bridge and squatted there The boots and rotted pillowtick coat had been left behind for the nonce on the town side of the bridge what waited for sai Thoughtful reared up on its back legs forelegs pawing the air red mark on its hairy belly all too visible was DanTete the Little Red King The man floated to his fate shrieking and eyeless He thrust his hands out in front of him making wardingoff gestures and the spiders front legs seized one of them guided it into the bristling maw of its mouth and bit it off with a candycane crunch Sweet EIGHT That night beyond the last of the oddly narrow oddly unpleasant townhouses Roland stopped in front of what had probably been a smallhold farm He stood facing the ruin of the main building sniffing What Roland What Can you smell the wood of that place Susannah She sniffed I can as a matter of factwhat of it He turned to her smiling If we can smell it we can burn it This turned out to be correct They had trouble kindling the fire even aided by Rolands slyest tricks of trailcraft and half a can of Sterno but in die end they succeeded Susannah sat as close to it as she could turning at regular intervals in order to toast bodi sides equally relishing die sweat diat popped out first on her face and her breasts then on her back She had forgotten what it was to be warm and went on feeding wood to die flames until the campfire was a roaring bonfire To animals in the open lands furdier along die Padi of die healing Beam diat fire must have looked like a comet that had fallen to Earth still blazing Oy sat beside her ears cocked looking into the fire as if mesmerized Susannah kept expecting Roland to objectto tell her to stop feeding the damned thing and start letting it burn down for her fathers sakebut he didnt He only sat with his disassembled guns before him oiling the pieces When the fire grew too hot he moved back a few feet His shadow danced a skinny wavering commala in the firelight Can you stand one or two more nights of cold he asked her at last She nodded If I have to Once we start climbing toward the snowlands it will be really cold he said And while I cant promise you well have to go fireless for only a single night I dont believe itll be any longer than two You think itll be easier to take game if we dont build a fire dont you Roland nodded and began putting his guns back together Will there be game as early as day after tomorrow Yes How do you know He considered this then shook his head I cant saybut I do Can you smell it No Touch their minds Its not that either She let it go Roland what if Mordred sends the birds against us tonight He smiled and pointed to the flames Below them a deepening bed of bright red coals waxed and waned like dragons breath Theyll not come close to thy bonfire And tomorrow Tomorrow well be further from Le Casse Roi Russe than even Mordred can persuade them to go And how do you know that He shook his head yet again although he thought he knew the answer to her question What he knew came from the Tower He could feel the pulse of it awakening in his head It was like green coming out of a dry seed But it was too early to say so Lie down Susannah he said Take your rest Ill watch until midnight then wake you So now we keep a watch she said He nodded Is he watching us Roland wasnt sure but thought that Mordred was What his imagination saw was a skinny boy but with a potbelly pooched out in front of him now for hed have eaten well naked inside the rags of a filthy torn coat A skinny boy laid up in one of those unnaturally skinny houses perhaps on the third floor where the sightline was good He sits at a window with his knees pulled up against his chest for warmth the scar on his side perhaps aching in the bony cold looking out at the flare of their fire jealous of it Jealous of their companionship as well Halfmother and White Father with their backs turned to him Its likely he said She started to lie down then stopped She touched the sore beside her mouth This isnt a pimple Roland No He sat quiet watching her I had a friend in college who got one just like it Susannah said Itd bleed then stop then almost heal up then darken and bleed a little more At last she went to see a doctora special kind we call a dermatologistand he said it was an angioma A bloodtumor He gave her a shot of novocaine and took it off with a scalpel He said it was a good thing she came when she did because every day she waited that thing was sinking its roots in a litde deeper Eventually he said it would have worked its way right through the roof of her mouth and maybe into her sinuses too Roland was silent waiting The term she had used clanged in his head bloodtumor He thought it might have been coined to describe the Crimson King himself Mordred as well We dont have no novocaine BabyBoots Detta Walker said and Ah know dat sho But if de time come and Ah tell you you goan whip out yo knife and cut dat ugly mahfah right offn me Goan do it faster than yon bumblah cn snatch a fly out de air You unnerstand me Kitch mah drift Yes Now lie over Take some rest She lay over Five minutes after she had appeared to go to sleep Detta Walker opened her eyes and gave him I watchin you xuhite boy a glare Roland nodded to her and she closed her eyes again A minute or two later they opened a second time Now it was Susannah who looked at him and this time when her eyes closed they didnt open again He had promised to wake her at midnight but let her sleep two hours longer knowing that in the heat of the fire her body was really resting at least for this one night At what his fine new watch said was one OThe clock he finally felt the gaze of their pursuer slip away Mordred had lost his fight to stay awake through the darkest watches of the night as had innumerable children before him Wherever his room was the unwanted lonely child now slept in it with his wreck of a coat pulled around him and his head in his arms And does his mouth still caked with sai Thoughtfuls blood purse and quiver as if dreaming of the nipple it knew but once the milk it never tasted Roland didnt know Didnt particularly want to know He was only glad to be awake in the stillwatch of the night feeding the occasional piece of wood to the lowering fire It would die quickly he thought The wood was newer than that of which the townhouses were constructed but it was still ancient hardened to a substance that was nearly stone Tomorrow they would see trees The first since Calla Bryn Sturgis if one set aside those growing beneath Algul Sientos artificial sun and those hed seen in Stephen Kings world That would be good Meanwhile the dark held hard Beyond the circle of the dying fire a wind moaned lifting Rolands hair from his temples and bringing a faint sweet smell of snow He tilted his head back and watched the clock of the stars turn in the blackness overhead ONE They had to go fireless three nights instead of one or two The last was the longest most wretched twelve hours of Susannahs life Is it worse than the night Eddie died she asked herself at one point Are you really saying this is worse than lying awake in one of those dormitory rooms knowing that was how you d be lying from then on Worse than washing his face and hands and feet Washing them for the ground Yes This was worse She hated knowing it and would never admit it to anyone else but the deep endless cold of that last night was far worse She came to dread every light breath of breeze from the snowlands to the east and soudi It was both terrible and oddly humbling to realize how easily physical discomfort could take control expanding like poison gas until it owned all the floorspace took over the entire playing field Grief Loss What were those things when you could feel cold on the march moving in from your fingers and toes crawling up your motherfucking nose and moving where Toward the brain do it please ya And toward the heart In the grip of cold like that grief and loss were nothing but words No not even that Only sounds So much meaningless quack as you sat shuddering under the stars waiting for a morning that would never come What made it worse was knowing there were potential bonfires all around them for theyd reached the live region Roland called the undersnow This was a series of long grassy slopes most of the grass now white and dead and shallow valleys where there were isolated stands of trees and brooks now plugged with ice Earlier in daylight Roland had pointed out several holes in the ice and told her theyd been made by deer He pointed out several piles of scat as well In daylight such sign had been interesting even hopeful But in this endless ditch of night listening to the steady low click of her chattering teeth it meant nothing Eddie meant nothing Jake neither The Dark Tower meant nothing nor did the bonfire theyd had out the outskirts of Castletown She could remember the look of it but the feel of heat warming her skin until it brought an oil of sweat was utterly lost Like a person who has died for a moment or two and has briefly visited some shining afterlife she could only say that it had been wonderful Roland sat with his arms around her sometimes voicing a dry harsh cough Susannah thought he might be getting sick but this thought also had no power Only the cold Onceshortly before dawn finally began to stain the sky in the east this wasshe saw orange lights swirldancing far ahead past the place where the snow began She asked Roland if he had any idea what they were She had no real interest but hearing her voice reassured her that she wasnt dead Not yet at least I think theyre hobs WWhat are ththey She now stuttered and stammered everything I dont know how to explain them to you he said And theres really no need Youll see them in time Right now if you listen youll hear something closer and more interesting At first she heard only the sigh of the wind Then it dropped and her ears picked up the dry swish of the grass below as something walked through it This was followed by a low crunching sound Susannah knew exactly what it was a hoof stamping through thin ice opening the running water to the cold world above She also knew that in three or four days time she might be wearing a coat made from the animal that was now drinking nearby but this also had no meaning Time was a useless concept when you were sitting awake in the dark and in constant pain Had she thought she had been cold before That was quite funny wasnt it What about Mordred she asked Is he out there do you think Yes And does he feel the cold like we do I dont know I cant stand much more of this RolandI really cant You wont have to Itll be dawn soon and I expect well have a fire tomorrow come dark He coughed into his fist then put his arm back around her Youll feel better once were up and in the doings Meantime at least were together TWO Mordred was as cold as they were every bit and he had no one He was close enough to hear them though not the actual words but the sound of their voices He shuddered uncontrollably and had lined his mouth with dead grass when he became afraid that Rolands sharp ears might pick up the sound of his chattering teeth The railwaymans jacket was no help he had thrown it away when it had fallen into so many pieces that he could no longer hold it togetlier Hed worn the arms of it out of Castletown but then they had fallen to pieces as well starting at the elbows and hed cast them into the low grass beside the old road with a petulant curse He was only able to go on wearing the boots because hed been able to weave long grass into a rough twine With it hed bound what remained of them to his feet Hed considered changing back to his spiderform knowing that body would feel the cold less but his entire short life had been plagued by the specter of starvation and he supposed that part of him would always fear it no matter how much food he had at hand The gods knew there wasnt much now three severed arms four legs two partially eaten and a piece of a torso from the wicker basket that was all If he changed the spider would gobble that little bit up by daylight And while there was game out herehe heard the deer moving around just as clearly as his White Daddy didMordred wasnt entirely confident of his ability to trap it or run it down So he sat and shivered and listened to the sound of their voices until the voices ceased Maybe they slept He might have dozed a litde himself And the only thing that kept him from giving up and going back was his hatred of them That they should have each other when he had no one No one at all Mordreds ahungry he thought miserably Mordreds acold And Mordred has no one Mordreds alone He slipped his wrist into his mouth bit deep and sucked the warmth that flowed out In the blood he tasted the last of Rando Thoughtfuls life but so litde So soon gone And once it was there was nothing but the useless recycled taste of himself In the dark Mordred began to cry THREE Four hours after dawn under a white sky that promised rain or sleet perhaps both at the same time Susannah Dean lay shivering behind a fallen log looking down into one of the little valleys Youll hear Oy the gunslinger had told her And youll hear me too Ill do what I can but Ill be driving them ahead of me and you II have the best shooting Make every shot count What made things worse was her creeping intuition that Mordred was very close now and he might try to bushwhack her while her back was turned She kept looking around but they had picked a relatively clear spot and the open grass behind her was empty each time save once when she had seen a large brown rabbit lolloping along with its ears dragging the ground At last she heard Oys highpitched barking from the copse of trees on her left A moment later Roland began to yell Hyah Hyah Get on brisk Get on brisk I tell thee Never tarry Never tarry a single Then the sound of him coughing She didnt like that cough No not at all Now she could see movement in the trees and for one of the few times since Roland had forced her to admit there was another person hiding inside of her she called on Detta Walker I need you If you want to be warm again you settle my hands so I can shoot straight And the ceaseless shivering of her body stopped As the herd of deer burst out of the treesnot a small herd either there had to be at least eighteen of them led by a buck with a magnificent rackher hands also stopped their shaking In the right one she held Rolands revolver with the sandalwood grips Here came Oy bursting out of the woods behind the final straggler This was a mutie doe running and with eerie grace on four legs of varying sizes with a fifth waggling bonelessly from the middle of her belly like a teat Last of all came Roland not really running at all not anymore but rather staggering onward at a grim jog She ignored him tracking the buck with the gun as the big fellow ran across her field of fire This way she whispered Break to your right honeychild lets see you do it Commalacomecome And while diere was no reason why he should have the buck leading his litde fleeing herd did indeed veer slightly in Susannahs direction Now she was filled with the sort of coldness she welcomed Her vision seemed to sharpen until she could see the muscles rippling under the bucks hide the white crescent as his eye rolled the old wound on the nearest does foreleg where the fur had never grown back She had a moment to wish Eddie and Jake were lying on either side of her feeling what she was feeling seeing what she was seeing and then that was gone too I do not kill with my gun she who kills with her gun has forgotten the face of her father I kill with my heart she murmured and began shooting The first bullet took the lead buck in the head and he crashed over on his left side The others ran past him A doe leaped over his body and Susannahs second bullet took her at the height of her leap so that she crashed down dead on the other side one leg splayed and broken all grace gone She heard Roland fire three times but didnt look to see how hed done she had her own business to attend to and she attended to it well Each of the last four bullets in the cylinder took down a deer and only one was still moving when he fell It didnt occur to her that this was an amazing piece of shooting especially with a pistol she was a gunslinger after all and shooting was her business Besides the morning was windless Half the herd now lay dead in the grassy valley below All the remainder save one wheeled left and pelted away downslope toward the stream A moment later they were lost in a screen of willows The last one a yearling buck ran directly toward her Susannah didnt bother trying to reload from the little pile of bullets lying beside her on a square of buckskin but took one of the Riza plates instead her hand automatically finding die dull grippingplace Riza she screamed and flung it It flew across the dry grass elevating slightly as it did giving off that weird moaning sound It struck the racing buck at midneck Droplets of blood flew in a garland around its head black against the white sky A butchers cleaver could not have done a neater job For a moment the buck ran on heedless and headless blood jetting from the stump of its neck as its racing heart gave up its last half a dozen beats Then it crashed to its splayed forelegs less than ten yards in front of her hide staining the dry yellow grass a bright red The previous nights long misery was forgotten The numbness had departed her hands and her feet There was no grief in her now no sense of loss no fear For the moment Susannah was exactly the woman that ka had made her The mixed smell of gunpowder and blood from the downed buck was bitter it was also the worlds sweetest perfume Standing up straight on her stumps Susannah spread her arms Rolands pistol clenched in her right hand and made a Y against the sky Then she screamed There were no words in it nor could there have been Our greatest moments of triumph are always inarticulate FOUR Roland had insisted that they eat a huge breakfast and her protests that cold corned beef tasted like so much lumpy mush cut zero ice with him By two that afternoon according to his fancyschmancy pocketwatchright around the time the steady cold rain fattened into an icy drizzle in other wordsshe was glad She had never done a harder day of physical labor and the day wasnt finished Roland was by her all the while matching her in spite of his worsening cough She had time during their brief but crazily delicious noon meal of seared deersteaks to consider how strange he was how remarkable After all this time and all these adventures she had still not seen the bottom of him Not even close She had seen him laughing and crying killing and dancing shed seen him sleeping and on the squat behind a screen of bushes with his pants down and his ass hung over what he called the Log of Ease Shed never slept with him as a woman does with a man but she thought shed seen him in every other circumstance and no Still no bottom That coughs sounding more and more like pneumonia to me Susannah remarked not long after the rain had started They were then in the part of the days activities Roland called avencar carrying the kill and preparing to make it into something else Never let it worry you Roland said I have what I need here to cure it Say true she asked doubtfully Yar And these which I never lost He reached into his pocket and showed her a handful of aspirin tablets She thought the expression on his face was one of real reverence and why not It might be that he owed his life to what he called astin Astin and cheflet They loaded their kill into the back of Ho Fats Luxury Taxi and dragged it down to the stream It took three trips in all After theyd stacked the carcasses Roland carefully placed the head of the yearling buck atop the pile where it looked at them from its glazed eyes What you want that for Susannah asked with a trace of Detta in her voice Were going to need all die brains we can get Roland said and coughed dryly into his curled fist again Its a dirty way to do the job but its quick and it works FIVE When they had their kill piled beside the icy stream At least we dont have the flies to worry about Roland said the gunslinger began gathering deadwood Susannah looked forward to the fire but her terrible need of the previous night had departed She had been working hard and for the time being at least was warm enough to suit her She tried to remember the depth of her despair how the cold had crept into her bones turning them to glass and couldnt do it Because the body had a way of forgetting the worst things she supposed and without the bodys cooperation all the brain had were memories like faded snapshots Before beginning his woodgathering chore Roland inspected the bank of the icy stream and dug out a piece of rock He handed it to her and Susannah rubbed a thumb over its milky watersmoothed surface Quartz she asked but she didnt think it was Not quite I dont know that word Susannah We call it chert It makes tools that are primitive but plenty useful axeheads knives skewers scrapers Its scrapers well want Also at least one handhammer I know what were going to scrape but what are we going to hammer Ill show you but first will you join me here for a moment Roland got down on his knees and took her cold hand in one of his Together they faced the deers head We thank you for what we are about to receive Roland told the head and Susannah shivered It was exactly how her father began when he was giving the grace before a big meal one where all the family was gathered Our ozon family is broken she thought but did not say done was done The response she gave was the one she had been taught as a young girl Father we thank thee Guide our hands and guide our hearts as we take life from death Roland said Then he looked at her eyebrows raised asking without speaking a word if she had more to say Susannah found that she did Our Father Who art in heaven hallowd be Thy name Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us Lead us not into temptation deliver us from evil Thou art the kingdom and the power and the glory now and forever Thats a lovely prayer he said Yes she agreed I didnt say it just rightits been a long timebut its still the best prayer Now lets do our business while I can still feel my hands Roland gave her an amen SIX Roland took the severed head of the yearling deer the antlernubs made lifting it easy set it in front of him then swung the fistsized chunk of rock against the skull There was a muffled cracking sound that made Susannahs stomach cringe Roland gripped the antlers and pulled first left and then right When Susannah saw the way the broken skull wiggled under the hide her stomach did more than cringe it did a slow looptheloop Roland hit twice more wielding the piece of chert with nearsurgical precision Then he used his knife to cut a circle in the headhide which he pulled off like a cap This revealed the cracked skull beneath He worked the blade of his knife into the widest crack and used it as a lever When the deers brain was exposed he took it out set it carefully aside and looked at Susannah Well want the brains of every deer we killed and thats what we need a hammer for Oh she said in a choked voice Brains To make a tanning slurry But theres more use for chert than that Look He showed her how to bang two chunks together until one or both shattered leaving large nearly even pieces instead of jagged lumps She knew that metamorphic rocks broke that way but schists and such were generally too weak to make good tools This stuff was strong When you get chunks that break thick enough to hold on one side but thin to an edge on the other Roland said lay them by Those will be our scrapers If we had more time we could make handles but we dont Our hands will be plenty sore by bedtime How long do you think it will take to get enough scrapers Not so long Roland said Chert breaks lucky or so I used to hear While Roland dragged deadwood for a fire into a copse of mixed willows and alders by the edge of the frozen stream Susannah inspected her way along the embankments looking for chert By the time shed found a dozen large chunks she had also located a granite boulder rising from the ground in a smooth weatherworn curve She thought it would make a fine anvil The chert did indeed break lucky and she had thirty potential scrapers by the time Roland was bringing back his third large load of firewood He made a little pile of kindling which Susannah shielded with her hands By then it was sleeting and although they were working beneath a fairly dense clump of trees she thought it wouldnt be long before both of them were soaked When the fire was lit Roland went a few steps away once more fell on his knees and folded his hands Praying again she asked amused What we learn in our childhood has a way of sticking he said He closed his eyes for a few moments then brought his clasped hands to his mouth and kissed them The only word she heard him say was Gan Then he opened his eyes and lifted his hands spreading them and making a pretty gesture that looked to her like birds flying away When he spoke again his voice was dry and matteroffact Mr TakingCareofBusiness Thats very well then he said Lets go to work SEVEN They made twine from grass just as Mordred had done and hung the first deerthe one already headlessby its back legs from the low branch of a willow Roland used his knife to cut its belly open then reached into the guts rummaged and removed two dripping red organs that she thought were kidneys These for fever and cough he said and bit into the first one as if it were an apple Susannah made a gurking noise and turned away to consider the stream until he was finished When he was she turned back and watched him cut circles around the hanging legs close to where theyjoined the body Are you any better she asked him uneasily I will be he said Now help me take the hide off this fellow Well want the first one with the hair still on itwe need to make a bowl for our slurry Now watch He worked his fingers into the place where the deers hide still clung to the body by the thin layer of fat and muscle beneath then pulled The hide tore easily to a point halfway down the deers midsection Now do your side Susannah Getting her fingers underneath was the only hard part This time they pulled together and when they had the hide all the way down to the dangling forelegs it vaguely resembled a shirt Roland used his knife to cut it off then began to dig in the ground a little way from the roaring fire but still beneath the shelter of the trees She helped him relishing the way the sweat rolled down her face and body When they had a shallow bowlshaped depression two feet across and eighteen inches deep Roland lined it with the hide All that afternoon they took turns skinning the eight other deer they had killed It was important to do it as quickly as possible for when the underlying layer of fat and muscle dried up the work would become slower and harder The gunslinger kept the fire burning high and hot every now and then leaving her to rake ashes out onto the ground When they had cooled enough so they would not burn holes in their bowlliner he pushed them into the hole theyd made Susannahs back and arms were aching fiercely by five oclock but she kept at it Rolands face neck and hands were comically smeared with ash You look like a fella in a minstrel show she said at one point Rastus Coon Whos that Nobody but the white folks fool she said Do you suppose Mordreds out there watching us work All day shed kept an eye peeled for him No he said pausing to rest He brushed his hair back from his forehead leaving a fresh smear and now making her think of penitents on Ash Wednesday I think hes gone off to make his own kill Mordreds ahungry she said And then You can touch him a little cant you At least enough to know if hes here or if hes gone Roland considered this then said simply Im his father EIGHT By dark they had a large heap of deerskins and a pile of skinned headless carcasses that surely would have been black with flies in warmer weather They ate another huge meal of sizzling venison steaks utterly delicious and Susannah spared another thought for Mordred somewhere out in the dark probably eating his own supper raw He might have matches but he wasnt stupid if they saw another fire in all this darkness they would rush down upon it And him Then bangbangbang goodbye SpiderBoy She felt a surprising amount of sympathy for him and told herself to beware of it Certainly he would have felt none for either her or Roland had the shoe been on the other foot When they were done eating Roland wiped his greasy fingers on his shirt and said That tasted fine You got that right Now lets get the brains out Then well sleep One at a time Susannah asked Yesso far as I know brains only come one to a customer For a moment she was too surprised at hearing Eddies phrase one to a customer coming from Rolands mouth to realize hed made a joke Lame yes but a bona fide joke Then she managed a token laugh Very funny Roland You know what I meant Roland nodded Well sleep one at a time and stand a watch yes I think that would be best Time and repetition had done its work shed now seen too many tumbling guts to feel squeamish about a few brains They cracked heads used Rolands knife its edge now dull to pry open skulls and removed the brains of their kill These they put carefully aside like a clutch of large gray eggs By the time the last deer was debrained Susannahs fingers were so sore and swollen she could hardly bend them Lie over Roland said Sleep Ill take the first watch She didnt argue Given her full belly and the heat of the fire she knew sleep would come quickly She also knew that when she woke up tomorrow she was going to be so stiff that even sitting up would be difficult and painful Now though she didnt care A feeling of vast contentment filled her Some of it was having eaten hot food but by no means all The greater part of her wellbeing stemmed from a day of hard work no more or less than that The sense that they were not just floating along but doing for themselves fesus she thought think Im becoming a Republican in my old age Something else occurred to her then how quiet it was No sounds but the sough of the wind the whispering sleet now starting to abate and the crackle of the blessed fire Roland He looked at her from his place by the fire eyebrows raised Youve stopped coughing He smiled and nodded She took his smile down into sleep but it was Eddie she dreamed of NINE They stayed three days in the camp by the stream and during that time Susannah learned more about making hide garments than she would ever have believed and much more than she really wanted to know By casting a mile or so in either direction along the stream they found a couple of logs one for each of them While they looked they used their makeshift pot to soak their hides in a dark soup of ash and water They set their logs at an angle against the trunks of two willow trees close so they could work side by side and used chert scrapers to dehair the hides This took one day When it was done they bailed out the pot turned the hide liner over and filled it up again this time with a mixture of water and mashed brains This coldweather hiding was new to her They put the hides in this slurry to soak overnight and while Susannah began to make thread from strings of gristle and sinew Roland resharpened his knife then used it to whittle half a dozen bone needles When he was done all of his fingers were bleeding from dozens of shallow cuts He coated them with woodash soak and slept with them that way his hands looking as if they were covered with large and clumsy grayblack gloves When he washed them off in a stream the following day Susannah was amazed to see the cuts already well on their way to healing She tried dabbing some of the woodash stuff on the persistent sore beside her mouth but it stung horribly and she washed it away in a hurry I want you to whop this goddam thing off she said Roland shook his head Well give it a little longer to heal on its own Why Cutting on a sores a bad idea unless you absolutely have to do it Especially out here in what Jake would have called the boondogs She agreed without bothering to correct his pronunciation but unpleasant images crept into her head when she lay down visions of the pimple beginning to spread erasing her face inch by inch turning her entire head into a black crusted bleeding tumor In the dark such visions had a horrible persuasiveness but luckily she was too tired for them to keep her awake long On dieir second day in what Susannah was coming to think of as the Hide Camp Roland built a large and rickety frame over a new fire one that was low and slow They smoked the hides two by two and then laid them aside The smell of the finished product was surprisingly pleasant It smells like leather she thought holding one to her face and then had to laugh That was after all exactly what it was The third day they spent making and here Susannah finally outdid the gunslinger Roland sewed a wide and barely serviceable stitch She thought that the vests and leggings he made would hold together for a month two at the most then begin to pull apart She was far more adept Sewing was a skill shed learned from her mother and both grandmothers At first she found Rolands bone needles maddeningly clumsy and she paused long enough to cover both the thumb and forefinger of her right hand with litde deerskin caps which she tied in place After that it went faster and by midafternoon of makingday she was taking garments from Rolands pile and oversewing his stitches with her own which were finer and closer She thought he might object to thismen were proudbut he didnt which was probably wise It quite likely would have been Detta who replied to any whines and queasies By the time their third night in Hide Camp had come they each had a vest a pair of leggings and a coat They also had a pair of mittens each These were large and laughable but would keep their hands warm And speaking of hands Susannah was once more barely able to bend hers She looked doubtfully at the remaining hides and asked Roland if they would spend another makingday here He considered the idea then shook his head Well load the ones that are left into the Ho Fat Tacksee I think along with some of the meat and chunks of ice from the stream to keep it cool and good The Taxi wont be any good when we come to the snow will it No he admitted but by then the rest of the hides will be clothing and the meat will be eaten You just cant stay here any longer thats what it comes down to isnt it You hear it calling The Tower Roland looked into the snapping fire and said nothing Nor had to Whatll we do about hauling our gunna when we come to the white lands Make a travois And therell be plenty of game She nodded and started to lie down He took her shoulders and turned her toward the fire instead His face came close to hers and for a moment Susannah thought he meant to kiss her goodnight He looked long and hard at die crusted sore beside her mouth instead Well she finally asked She could have said more but he would have heard die tremor in her voice I think its a little smaller Once we leave the Badlands behind it may heal on its own Do you really say so The gunslinger shook his head at once I say may Now lie over Susannah Take your rest All right but dont you let me sleep late this time I want to watch my share Yes Now lie over She did as he said and was asleep even before her eyes closed TEN Shes in Central Park and its cold enough to see her breath The sky overhead is white from side to side a snowsky but shes not cold No not in her new deerskin coat leggings vest and funny deerskin mittens Theres something on her head too pulled down over her ears and keeping them as toasty as the rest of her She takes the cap off curious and sees its not deerskin like the rest of her new clothing but a redandgreen stocking cap Written across the front is MERRY CHRISTMAS She looks at it startled Can you have deja vu in a dream Apparently so She looks around and there ave Eddie and Jake grinning at hen Their heads are bare and she realizes she has in her hands a combination of the caps they were wearing in some other dream She feels a great soaring burst of joy as if she has just solved some supposedly insoluble problem squaring the circle let us say or finding the Ultimate Prime Number take that Blaine may it bust ya brain ya crazy choochoo train Eddie is wearing a sweatshirt that says IDRINK NOZZALA Jake is wearing one that says I DRIVE THE TAKURO SPIRIT Both have cups of hot chocolate the perfect kind mit schlag on top and little sprinkles of nutmeg dotting the cream What world is this she asks them and realizes that somewhere nearby carolers are singing What Child Is This You must let him go his course alone says Eddie Yar and you must beware ofDandelo says Jake I dont understand Susannah says and holds out her stocking cap to them Wasnt this yours Didnt you share it It could be your hat if you want it says Eddie and then holds out his cup Here I brought you hot chocolate No more twins says Jake Theres only one hat doya not see Before she can reply a voice speaks out of the air and the dream begins to unravel NINETEEN says the voice This is NINETEEN this is CHASSIT With each word the world becomes mow unreal She can see through Eddie and Jake The good smell of hot chocolate is fading being replaced by the smell of ash Wednesday and leather She sees Eddies lips moving and she thinks hes saying a name and then ELEVEN Time to get up Susannah Roland said Its your watch She sat up looking around The campfire had burned low I heard him moving out there Roland said but that was some time ago Susannah are you all right Were you dreaming Yes she said There was only one hat in this dream and I was wearing it I dont understand you Nor did she understand herself The dream was already fading as dreams do All she knew for sure was that the name on Eddies lips just before he faded away for good had been that of Patrick Danville ONE Three weeks after the dream of one hat three figures two large one small emerged from a tract of upland forest and began to move slowly across a great open field toward more woods below One of the large figures was pulling the other on a contraption that was more sled than travois Oy raced back and forth between Roland and Susannah as if keeping a constant watch His fur was thick and sleek from cold weather and a constant diet of deermeat The land the three of them were currently covering might have been a meadow in die warmer seasons but now the ground was buried under five feet of snow The pulling was easier because their way was finally leading downward Roland actually dared hope the worst was over And crossing the White Lands had not been too badat least not yet There was plenty of game there was plenty of wood for their nightly fire and on the four occasions when the weather turned nasty and blizzards blew they had simply laid up and waited for the storms to wear themselves out on the wooded ridges that marched southeast Eventually they did although the angriest of these blizzards lasted two full days and when they once more took to the Path of the Beam they found another three feet of new snow on the ground In the open places where the shrieking noreast wind had been able to rage fully there were drifts like ocean waves Some of these had buried tall pines almost to their tops After their first day in the White Lands with Roland struggling to pull her and then the snow had been less than a foot deep Susannah saw that they were apt to spend months crossing those high forested ridges unless Roland had a pair of snowshoes so that first night shed set out to make him a pair It was a trialanderror process By guess and by gosh was how Susannah put it but the gunslinger pronounced her third effort a success The frames were made of limber birch branches the centers of woven overlapping deerskin strips To Roland they looked like teardrops How did you know to do this he asked her after his first day of wearing them The increase in distance covered was nothing short of amazing especially once he had learned to walk with a kind of rolling shipboard stride that kept the snow from accumulating on the latticed surfaces Television Susannah said There used to be this program I watched when I was a kid Sergeant Preston of the Yukon Sergeant Preston didnt have a billybumbler to keep him company but he did have his faithful dog King Anyway I closed my eyes and tried to remember what the guys snowshoes looked like She pointed to the ones Roland was wearing Thats the best I could do You did fine he said and the sincerity she heard in his simple compliment made her tingle all over This was not necessarily the way she wanted Roland or any other man for that matter to make her feel but she seemed stuck with it She wondered if that was nature or nurture and wasnt sure she wanted to know Theyll be all right as long as they dont fall apart she allowed Her first effort had done just that I dont feel the strips loosening he told her Stretching a litde maybe but thats all Now as they crossed the great open space that third pair of snowshoes was still holding together and because she felt as though shed made some sort of contribution Susannah was able to let Roland pull her along without too much guilt She did wonder about Mordred from time to time and one night about ten days after they had crossed the snowboundary she came out and asked Roland to tell her what he knew What prompted her was his declaration that there was no need to set a watch at least for awhile they could both get a full ten hours worth of sleep if thats what their bodies could use Oy would wake them if they needed waking Roland had sighed and looked into the fire for nearly a full minute his arms around his knees and his hands clasped loosely between them She had just about decided he wasnt going to answer at all when he said Still following but falling further and further behind Struggling to eat struggling to catch up struggling most of all to stay warm To stay warm To Susannah this seemed hard to believe There were trees all around them He has no matches and none of the Sterno stuff either I believe that one nightearly on this would have beenhe came upon one of our fires with live coals still under the ash and he was able to carry some with him for a few days after that and so have a fire at night Its how the ancient rockdwellers used to carry fire on their journeys or so I was told Susannah nodded She had been taught roughly the same thing in a high school science class although the teacher had admitted a lot of what they knew about how Stone Age people got along wasnt true knowledge at all but only informed guesswork She wondered how much of what Roland had just told her was also guesswork and so she asked him Its not guessing but I cant explain it If its the touch Susannah its not such as Jake had Not seeing and hearing or even dreaming Although do you believe we have dreams sometimes we dont remember after we awaken Yes She thought of telling him about rapid eye movement and the REM sleep experiments shed read about in Look magazine then decided it would be too complex She contented herself with saying that she was sure folks had dreams every single night that they didnt remember Mayhap I see him and hear him in those Roland said All I know is that hes struggling to keep up He knows so litde about the world that its really a wonder hes still alive at all Do you feel sorry for him No I cant afford pity and neither can you But his eyes had left hers when he said that and she thought he was lying Maybe he didnt want to feel sorry for Mordred but she was sure he did at least a little Maybe he wanted to hope that Mordred would die on their trailcertainly there were plenty of chances it would happen with hypothermia being the most likely causebut Susannah didnt think he was quite able to do it They might have outrun ka but she reckoned that blood was still thicker than water There was something else however more powerful than even the blood of relation She knew because she could now feel it beating in her own head bodi sleeping and waking It was the Dark Tower She thought that they were very close to it now She had no idea what they were going to do about its mad guardian when and if they got there but she found she no longer cared For the present all she wanted was to see it The idea of entering it was still more than her imagination could deal with but seeing it Yes she could imagine that And she thought that seeing it would be enough TWO They made their way slowly down the wide white downslope with Oy first hurrying at Rolands heel then dropping behind to check on Susannah then bounding back to Roland again Bright blue holes sometimes opened above them Roland knew that was the Beam at work constantly pulling the cloudcover southeast Otherwise the sky was white from horizon to horizon and had a low full look both of them now recognized More snow was on the come and the gunslinger had an idea this storm might be the worst theyd seen The wind was getting up and the moisture in it was enough to numb all his exposed skin after three weeks of diligent needlework that amounted to not much more than his forehead and the tip of his nose The gusts lifted long diaphanous scarves of white These raced past them and then on down the slope like fantastical shapechanging balletdancers Theyre beautiful arent they Susannah asked from behind him almost wistfully Roland of Gilead no judge of beauty except once in the ntland of Mejis grunted He knew what would be beautiful to him decent cover when the storm overtook them something more than just a thick grove of trees So he almost doubted what he saw when the latest gust of wind blew itself out and the snow settled He dropped the towband stepped out of it went back to Susannah their gunna now on the increase again was strapped to the sledge behind her and dropped on one knee next to her Dressed in hides from top to toe he looked more like a mangy bigfoot than a man What do you make of that he asked her The wind kicked up again harder than ever at first obscuring what he had seen When it dropped a hole opened above them and the sun shone briefly through lighting the snowfield with billions of diamondchip sparkles Susannah shaded her eyes with one hand and looked long downhill What she saw was an inverted T carved in the snow The cross arm closest to them but still at least two miles away was relatively short perhaps two hundred feet on either side The long arm however was very long going all the way to the horizon and then disappearing over it Those are roads she said Someones plowed a couple of roads down there Roland He nodded I thought so but I wanted to hear you say it I see something else as well What Your eyes are sharper than mine and by a lot When we get a little closer youll see for yourself He tried to rise and she tugged impatiently at his arm Dont you play that game with me What is it Roofs he said giving in to her I think there are cottages down there Mayhap even a town People Are you saying people Well it looks like theres smoke coming from one of the houses Although its hard to tell for sure with the sky so white She didnt know if she wanted to see people or not Certainly such would complicate things Roland well have to be careful Yes he said and went back to the towband again Before he picked it up he paused to readjust his gunbelt dropping the holster a bit so it lay more comfortably near his left hand An hour later they came to the intersection of the lane and the road It was marked by a snowbank easily eleven feet high one that had been built by some sort of plow Susannah could see treadmarks like those made by a bulldozer pressed into the packed snow Rising out of this hardpack was a pole The street sign on top was no different from those shed seen in all sorts of towns at intersections in New York City for that matter The one indicating the short road said ODDS LANE It was the other that thrilled her heart however TOWER ROAD it read THREE All but one of the cottages clustered around the intersection were deserted and many lay in halfburied heaps broken beneath the weight of accumulating snow One howeverit was about threequarters of the way down the lefthand arm of Odds Lanewas clearly different from the others The roof had been mostly cleared of its potentially crushing weight of snow and a path had been shoveled from the lane to the front door It was from the chimney of this quaint treesurrounded cottage that the smoke was issuing featherwhite One window was lit a wholesome butteryellow too but it was the smoke diat captured Susannahs eye As far as she was concerned it was the final touch The only question in her mind was who would answer the door when they knocked Would it be Hansel or his sister Gretel And were those two twins Had anyone ever searched the matter Perhaps it would be Little Red Riding Hood or Goldilocks wearing a guilty goatee of porridge Maybe we should just pass it by she said aware that she had dropped her voice to a nearwhisper even though they were still on the high snowbank created by the plow Give it a miss and say thank ya She gestured to the sign reading TOWER ROAD Weve got a clear way Rolandmaybe we ought to take it And if we should do you think that Mordred will Roland asked Do you think hell simply pass by and leave whoever lives there in peace Here was a question that hadnt even occurred to her and of course the answer was no If Mordred decided he could kill whoever was in the cottage hed do it For food if the inhabitants were edible but food would only be a secondary consideration The woods behind them had been teeming with game and even if Mordred hadnt been able to catch his own supper and in his spider form Susannah was sure he would have been perfectly capable of doing that diey had left the remains of their own meals at a good many camps No he would come out of the snowy uplands fed but not happy Not happy at all And so woe to whoever happened to be in his path On the other hand she thought only there was no other hand and all at once it was too late anyway The front door of the cottage opened and an old man came out onto the stoop He was wearing boots jeans and a heavy parka with a furlined hood To Susannah this latter garment looked like something that might have been purchased at the ArmyNavy Surplus Store in Greenwich Village The old man was rosycheeked the picture of wintry good health but he limped heavily depending on the stout stick in his left hand From behind his quaint little cottage with its fairytale plume of smoke came the piercing whinny of a horse Sure Lippy I see em the old man cried turning in that direction I got aleast one good eye left aint I Then he turned back to where Roland stood on the snowbank with Susannah and Oy flanking him He raised his stick in a salute that seemed both merry and unafraid Roland raised his own hand in return Looks like were in for some palaver whether we want it or not said Roland I know she replied Then to the bumbler Oy mind your manners now you hear Oy looked at her and then back at the old man without making a sound On the subject of minding his manners hed keep his own counsel awhile it seemed The old mans bad leg was clearly very badNext door to nuthin Daddy Mose Carver would have saidbut he got on well enough with his stick moving in a sideways hopping gait that Susannah found both amusing and admirable Spry as a cricket was another of Daddy Moses many sayings and perhaps this one fit yonder old man better Certainly she saw no harm or danger in a whitehaired fellow the hair was long and babyfine hanging to the shoulders of his anorak who had to hop along on a stick And as he drew closer she saw that one of his eyes was filmed white with a cataract The pupil which was faintly visible seemed to look dully off to their left The other however regarded the newcomers with lively interest as the inhabitant of the cottage hopped down Odds Lane toward them The horse whinnied again and the old man waved his stick wildly against the white lowlying sky Shut up ya haybox ya turdfactory yold clapcunt gammergurt aint you ever seen cumpny before Was ya born in a barn heehee For if ywasnt Im a blueeyed baboon which there aint no such thing Roland snorted with genuine laughter and the last of Susannahs watchful apprehension departed The horse whinnied again from the outbuilding behind the cottageit was nowhere near grand enough to be called a barnand the old man waved his stick at it once more almost falling to the snowpack in the process His awkward but nonetheless rapid gait had now brought him halfway to their location He saved himself from what would have been a nasty tumble took a large sidlehop using the stick for a prop then waved it cheerily in their direction Hile gunslingers the old man shouted His lungs at least were admirable Gunslingers on pilgrimage to the Dark Tower so yare so ya must be for dont I see the big irons with the yaller grips And the Beam be back fair and strong for I feel it and Lippy do too Spry as a colt shes been ever since Christmas or what I call Christmas not having a calendar nor seen Sainty Claus which I wouldnt expect for have I been a good boy Never Never Good boys go to heaven and all my friends be in tother place toastin marshmallows and drinkin Nozzy spiked with whiskey in the devils den Arrr nemine my tongues caught in the middle and runs on both ends Hile to one hile to tother and hile to the little furry gobbins in between Billybumbler as I live and breathe Yow aint it good to see ya Joe Collins is my name Joe Collins of Odds Lane plenty odd mself oneeyed and lame I am but otherwise at your service He had now reached the snowbank marking the spot where Tower Road ended or where it began depending on your point of view and the direction you were traveling Susannah supposed He looked up at them one eye bright as a birds the other looking off into the white wastes with dull fascination Long days and pleasant nights yar so say I and anyone whod say different they aint here anyway so who gives a good goddam what they say From his pocket he took what could only be a gumdrop and tossed it up Oy grabbed it out of the air easily Snapand gone At this both Roland and Susannah laughed It felt strange to laugh but it was a good feeling like finding something of value long after you were sure it was lost forever Even Oy appeared to be grinning and if the horse bothered him it trumpeted again as they looked down on sai Collins from their snowbank perch it didnt show I got a million questions for yer Collins said but Ill start with just one how in the hell are yers gonna get down offa that snowbank FOUR As it turned out Susannah slid down using their travois as a sled She chose the place where die northwestern end of Odds Lane disappeared beneath the snow because die embankment was a litde shallower there Her trip was short but not smooth She hit a large and crusted snowboulder three quarters of the way down fell off the travois and made the rest of her descent in a pair of gaudy somersaults laughing wildly as she fell The travois turned overturned turde may it do yaand spilled their gunna every whichway and hell to breakfast Roland and Oy came leaping down behind Roland bent over her at once clearly concerned and Oy sniffed anxiously at her face but Susannah was still laughing So was the codger Daddy Mose would have called his laughter gay as old Dads hatband Im fine Rolandtook worse tumbles off my Flexible Flyer when I was a kid tell ya true Alls well diat ends well Joe Collins agreed He gave her a look with his good eye to make sure she was indeed all right then began to pick up some of the scattered goods leaning laboriously over on his stick his fine white hair blowing around his rosy face Nah nah Roland said reaching out to grasp his arm Ill do that theell fall on thy thiddles At this the old man roared with laughter and Roland joined him willingly enough From behind the cottage the horse gave another loud whinny as if protesting all this good humor Fall on thy thiddles Man thats a good one I dont have the veriest clue under heaven what my diiddles are yet its a good one Aint it just He brushed the snow off Susannahs hide coat while Roland quickly picked up the spilled goods and stacked them back on dieir makeshift sled Oy helped bringing several wrapped packages of meat in his jaws and dropping them on the back of the travois Thats a smart little beastie Joe Collins said admiringly Hes been a good trailmate Susannah agreed She was now very glad they had stopped would not have deprived herself of this goodnatured old mans acquaintance for worlds She offered him her clumsily clad right hand Im Susannah DeanSusannah of New York Daughter of Dan He took her hand and shook it His own hand was ungloved and although the fingers were gnarled with arthritis his grip was strong New York is it Why I once hailed from there myself Also Akron Omaha and San Francisco Son of Henry and Flora if it matters to you Youre from Americaside Susannah asked Oh God yes but long ago and long he said Whatchee might call delah His good eye sparkled his bad eye went on regarding the snowy wastes with that same dead lack of interest He turned to Roland And who might you be my friend For Ill call you my friend same as I would anyone unless they prove different in which case Id belt em with Bessie which is what I call my stick Roland was grinning Was helpless not to Susannah thought Roland Deschain of Gilead Son of Steven Gilead Gilead Collinss good eye went round with amazement Theres a name out of the past aint it One for the books Holy Pete you must be oldern God Some would say so Roland agreed now only smiling but warmly And the little fella he asked bending forward From his pocket Collins produced two more gumdrops one red and one green Christmas colors and Susannah felt a faint touch of deja vu It brushed her mind like a wing and then was gone Whats your name little fella What do they holler when they want you to come home He doesnt Ctalk anymore although he did once was how Susannah meant to finish but before she could the bum bier said Oy And he said it as brightly and firmly as ever in his time with Jake Good fella Collins said and tumbled the gumdrops into Oys mouth Then he reached out with that same gnarled hand and Oy raised his paw to meet it They shook wellmet near the intersection of Odds Lane and Tower Road Ill be damned Roland said mildly So wont we all in the end I reckon Beam or no Beam Joe Collins remarked letting go of Oys paw But not today Now what I say is that we ort to get in where its warm and we can palaver over a cup of coffeefor I have some so I door a pot of ale I even have sumpin I call eggnog if it does ya It does me pretty fine especially with a teensy piss o rum in it but who knows I aint really tasted nuf ampnk in five years or more Air outta the Discordias done for my tastebuds and for my nose too Anyro what do you say He regarded them brightly Id say that sounds pretty damned fine Susannah told him Rarely had she said anything she meant more He slapped her companionably on the shoulder A good woman is a pearl beyond price Dont know if thats Shakespeare the Bible or a combination of the t Arrr Lippy goddam what used to be yer eyes where do you think youre going Did yer want to meet these folks was that it His voice had fallen into the outrageous croon that seems the exclusive property of people who live alone except for a pet or two His horse had blundered its way to them and Collins grabbed her around the neck petting her with rough affection but Susannah thought the beast was the ugliest quadruped shed seen in her whole life Some of her good cheer melted away at the sight of the thing Lippy was blindnot in one eye but in bothand scrawny as a scarecrow As she walked the rack of her bones shifted back and forth so clearly beneath her mangy coat that Susannah almost expected some of them to poke through For a moment she remembered the black corridor under Castle Discordia with a kind of nightmarish total recall the slithering sound of the thing that had followed them and the bones All those bones Collins might have seen some of this on her face for when he spoke again he sounded almost defensive Her an ugly old thing I know but when you get as old as she is I dont reckon youll be winnin many beauty contests yourself He patted the horses chafed and sorelooking neck then seized her scant mane as if to pull the hair out by the roots although Lippy showed no pain and turned her in the road so she was facing the cottage again As he did this the first flakes of the coming storm skirled down Come on Lippy yold kibox and gammergurt ye swayback nag and lost fourlegged leper Cant ye smell the snow in the air Because I can and my nose went south years ago He turned back to Roland and Susannah and said I hope yprove partial to my cookin so I do because I think this is gonna be a threeday blow Aye three at least before Demon Moon shows er face again But were wellmet so we are and I set my watch and warrant on it Ye just dont want to judge my hospitality by my horsepitaity Hee I should hope not Susannah thought and gave a little shiver The old man had turned away but Roland gave her a curious look She smiled and shook her head as if to say Its nothingwhich of course it was She wasnt about to tell the gunslinger that a spavined nag with cataracts on her eyes and her ribs showing had given her a case of the whimwhams Roland had never called her a silly goose and by God she didnt mean to give him cause to do so n As if hearing her thoughts the old nag looked back and bared her few remaining teeth at Susannah The eyes in Lippys bony wedge of a head were pusrimmed plugs of blindness above her somehow gruesome grin She whinnied at Susannah as if to say Think what you will blackbird Ill be here long after thees gone thy course and died thy death At the same time the wind gusted swirling snow in their faces soughing in the snowladen firs and hooting beneadi the eaves of Collinss little house It began to die away and then strengthened again for a moment making a brief grieving cry that sounded almost human FIVE The outbuilding consisted of a chickencoop on one side Lippys stall on the other and a little loft stuffed with hay I can get up there and fork it down Collins said but I take my life in my hands ever time I do thanks to this bust hip of mine Now I cant make you help an old man sai Deschain but if you would Roland climbed the ladder resting atilt against the edge of the loft floor and tossed down hay until Collins told him it was good plenty enough to last Lippy through even four days worth of blow For she dont eat worth whatchee might call a Polish fuck as you can see lookin at her he said Then the gunslinger came back down and Collins led them along the short back walk to his cottage The snow piled on either side was as high as Rolands head Be it ever so humble et cetra Joe said and ushered them into his kitchen It was paneled in knotty pine which was actually plastic Susannah saw when she got closer And it was delightfully warm The name on the electric stove was Rossco a brand shed never heard of The fridge was an Amana and had a special little door set into the front above the handle She leaned closer and saw the words MAGIC ICE This thing makes ice cubes she asked delighted Well no not exactly Joe said Its the freezer that makes em beauty that thing on the front just drops em into your drink This struck her funny and she laughed She looked down saw Oy looking up at her with his old fiendish grin and that made her laugh harder than ever Mod cons aside the smell of the kitchen was wonderfully nostalgic sugar and spice and everything nice Roland was looking up at the fluorescent lights and Collins nodded Yar yar I got all the lectric he said Hotair furnace too aint it nice And nobody ever sends me a bill The gennys in a shed round to tother side Its a Honda and quiet as Sunday morning Even when you get right up on top of its little shed you dont hear nuffink but mmmmmm Stuttering Bill changes the propane tank and does the maintenance when it needs maintaining which hasnt been but twice in all the time Ive been here Nawp Joeys lyin hell soon be dyin Three times its been Three in all Whos Stuttering Bill Susannah asked just as Roland was asking How long have you been here Joe Collins laughed One at a time me foine new friends one at a time He had set his stick aside to struggle out of his coat put his weight on his bad leg made a low snarling sound and nearly fell over Would have fallen over had Roland not steadied him Thankee thankee thankee Joe said Although I tell you what it wouldnt have been the first time I wound up with my nose on that lernoleum But as you saved me a tumble its your question Ill answer first Ive been here Odd Joe of Odds Lane just about sebnteen years The only reason I cant tell you bangon is that for awhile there time got pretty goddam funny if you know what I mean We do Susannah said Believe me we do Collins was now divesting himself of a sweater and beneath it was another Susannahs first impression had been of a stout old man who stopped just short of fat Now she saw that a lot of what shed taken for fat was nothing but padding He wasnt as desperately scrawny as his old horse but he was a long shout from stout Now Stuttering Bill the old man continued removing the second sweater he be a robot Cleans the house as well as keepin my generator runnin and acourse hes the one that does the plowin When I first come here he only stuttered once in awhile now its every second or third word What Ill do when he finally runs down I dunno To Susannahs ear he sounded singularly unworried about it Maybe hell get better now that the Beams working right again she said He might last a little longer but I doubt like hell that hell get any better Joe said Machines dont heal the way living things do Hed finally reached his thermal undershirt and here die stripdown stopped Susannah was grateful Looking at the somehow ghasdy barrel of the horses ribs so close beneath die short gray fur had been enough She had no wish to see die masters as well Off with yer coats and your leggings Joe said Ill get yez eggnog or whatever else yed like in a minute or two but first Id show yer my livin room for its my pride so it is SIX There was a rag rug on the living room floor that would have looked at home in Gramma Holmess house and a LaZBoy recliner with a table beside it The table was heaped with magazines paperback books a pair of spectacles and a brown bottle containing God knew what sort of medicine There was a television although Susannah couldnt imagine what old Joe might possibly watch on it Eddie and Jake would have recognized the VCR sitting on the shelf beneath But what took all of Susannahs attentionand Rolands as wellwas the photograph on one of die walls It had been thumbtacked there slighdy askew in a casual fashion that seemed to Susannah at least almost sacrilegious It was a photograph of the Dark Tower Her breatii deserted her She worked her way over to it barely feeling the knots and nubbles of die rag rug beneadi her palms then raised her arms Roland pick me up He did and she saw diat his face had gone dead pale except for two hard balls of color burning in his thin cheeks His eyes were blazing The Tower stood against the darkening sky with sunset painting the hills behind it orange the slitted windows rising in their eternal spiral From some of those windows there spilled a dim and eldritch glow She could see balconies jutting out from the dark stone sides at every two or three stories and the squat doors that opened onto them all shut Locked as well she had no doubt Before the Tower was the field of roses CanKa No Rey dim but still lovely in the shadows Most of the roses were closed against the coming dark but a few still peeped out like sleepy eyes Joe she said Her voice was little more than a whisper She felt faint and it seemed she could hear singing voices far and wee Oh Joe This picture Aye mum he said clearly pleased by her reaction Its a good un aint it Which is why I pinned it up Ive got others but this is the best Right at sunset so the shadow seems to lie forever back along the Path of the Beam Which in a way it does as Im sure ye both must know Rolands breathing in her right ear was rapid and ragged as if hed just run a race but Susannah barely noticed For it was not just the subject of the picture that had filled her with awe This is a Polaroid Well yar he said sounding puzzled at the level of her excitement I suppose Stuttering Bill could have brung me a Kodak if Id ast for one but how would I ever have gotten the fillum developed And by the time I thought of a video camerafor the gadget under the TVd play such thingsI was too old to go back and yonder nag uz too old to carry me Yet I would if I could for its lovely there a place of warmhearted ghosts I heard the singing voices of friends long gone my Ma and Pa too I allus A paralysis had seized Roland She felt it in the stillness of his muscles Then it broke and he turned from the picture so fast that it made Susannah dizzy Youve been there he asked Youve been to the Dark Tower Indeed I have said the old man For who else do ye think took that pitcher Ansel Fuckin Adams When did you take it Thats from my last trip he said Two year ago in the summeralthough thats lower land ye must know and if the snow ever comes to it Ive never seen it How long from here Joe closed his bad eye and calculated It didnt take him long but to Roland and Susannah it seemed long very long indeed Outside the wind gusted The old horse whinnied as if in protest at the sound Beyond the frostrimmed window the falling snow was beginning to twist and dance Well he said yere on the downslope now and Stuttering Bill keeps Tower Road plowed for as far as yed go what else does the old whatchamacallit have to do with his time O course yell want to wait here until this new noreast jeezer blows itself out How long once were on the move Roland asked Rarin tgo aintcha Aye hot n rarin and why not for if youve come from InWorld ye must have been many long years gettin this far Hate to think how many so I do Im gonna say itd take you six days to get out of the White Lands maybe seven Do you call these lands Empathica Susannah asked He blinked then gave her a puzzled look Why no maamIve never heard this part of creation called anything but the White Lands The puzzled look was bogus She was almost sure of it Old Joe Collins cheery as Father Christmas in a childrens play had just lied to her She wasnt sure why and before she could pursue it Roland asked sharply Would you let that go for now Would you for your fathers sake Yes Roland she said meekly Of course Roland turned back to Joe still holding Susannah on his hip Might take you as long as nine days I guess Joe said scratching his chin for that road can be plenty slippery especially after Bill packs down the snow but you cant get him to stop Hes got his orders to follow His programmin he calls it The old man saw Roland getting ready to speak and raised his hand Nay nay Im not drawrin it out to irritate cher sir or sai or whichever you preferits just that Im not much used to cumpny Once you get down blow the snowline it must be another ten or twelve days awalkin but aint no need in the world to walk unless you fancy it Theres another one of those Positronics huts down there with any number a wheelie vehicles parked inside Like golfcarts they are The battries are all dead natcherlyflat as yer hatbut theres a gennie there too Honda just like mine and it was aworkin the last time I was down there for Bill keeps things in trim as much as he can If you could charge up one of those wheelies why thatd cut your time down to four days at most So heres what I think if you had to hoof it the whole way it might take you as long as nineteen days If you can go the last leg in one OThem hummersthats what I call em hummers for thats the sound they make when theyre runninI should say ten days Maybe eleven The room fell silent The wind gusted throwing snow against the side of the cottage and Susannah once more marked how it sounded almost like a human cry A trick of the angles and eaves no doubt Less than three weeks even if we had to walk Roland said He reached out toward the Polaroid photograph of the dusky stone tower standing against the sunset sky but did not quite touch it It was as if Susannah thought he were afraid to touch it After all the years and all the miles Not to mention the gallons of spilled blood Susannah thought but she would not have said this even if the two of them had been alone There was no need to he knew how much blood had been spilled as well as she did Bvit there was something offkey here Offkey or downright wrong And the gunslinger did not seem to know that Sympathy was to respect the feelings of another Empathy was to actually share those feelings Why would folks call any land Empathica And why would this pleasant old man lie about it Tell me something Joe Collins Roland said Aye gunslinger if I can Have you been right up to it Laid your hand on the stone of it The old man looked at first to see if Roland was joshing him When he was sure that wasnt the case he looked shocked No he said and for the first time sounded as American as Susannah herself That pitchers as close as I dared go The edge of the rosefield Im gonna say two two hundred and fifty yards away What the robotd call five hundred arcs OThe wheel Roland nodded And why not Because I thought to go closer might kill me but I wouldnt be able to stop The voices would draw me on So I thought then and so I do think even today SEVEN After dinnersurely the finest meal Susannah had had since being hijacked into this other world and possibly the best in her entire lifethe sore on her face burst wide open It was Joe Collinss fault in a way but even later when they had much to hold against the only inhabitant of Odds Lane she did not blame him for that It was the last thing he would have wanted surely He served chicken roasted to a turn and especially tasty after all the venison With it Joe brought to table mashed potatoes with gravy cranberry jelly sliced into thick red discs green peas Only canned say sorry he told them and a dish of little boiled onions bathing in sweet canned milk There was also eggnog Roland and Susannah drank it with childish greed although both passed on the teensy piss o rum Oy had his own dinner Joe fixed a plate of chicken and potatoes for him and then set it on the floor by die stove Oy made quick work of it and then lay in the doorway between the kitchen and the combination living roomdining room licking his chops to get every taste of giblet gravy out of his whiskers while watching the humes with his ears up I couldnt eat dessert so dont ask me Susannah said when shed finished cleaning her plate for the second time sopping up the remains of the gravy with a piece of bread Im not sure I can even get down from this chair Well thats all right Joe said looking disappointed maybe later Ive got a chocolate pudding and a butterscotch one Roland raised his napkin to muffle a belch and then said I could eat a dab of both I think Well come to that maybe I could too Susannah allowed How many eons since shed tasted butterscotch When they were done with the pudding Susannah offered to help with the cleaningup but Joe waved her away saying hed just put the pots and plates in the dishwasher to rinse and then run the whole happy bunch of em later He seemed spryer to her as he and Roland went back and forth into the kitchen less dependent on the stick Susannah guessed that the little piss o rum or maybe several of them adding up to one large piss by the end of the meal might have had something to do with it He poured coffee and the three of them four counting Oy sat down in the living room Outside it was growing dark and the wind was screaming louder than ever Mordreds out there someplace hunkered down in a snowhollow or a grove of trees she thought and once again had to stifle pity for him It would have been easier if she hadnt known that murderous or not he must still be a child Tell us how you came to be here Joe Roland invited Joe grinned Thats a hairraising story he said but if you really want to hear it I guess I dont mind tellin it The grin mellowed to a wistful smile Its nice havin folks to talk to for a little bit Lippy does all right at listenin but she never says nuffink back Hed started off trying to be a teacher Joe said but quickly discovered that life wasnt for him He liked the kidsloved them in factbut hated all the administrative bullshit and the way the system seemed set up to make sure no square pegs escaped the relentless rounding process He quit teaching after only three years and went into show business Did you sing or dance Roland wanted to know Neither one Joe replied I gave em the old standup Standup He means he was a comedian Susannah said He told jokes Correct Joe said brighdy Some folks actually thought they were funny too Course they were the minority He got an agent whose previous enterprise a discount mens clothing store had gone bankrupt One thing led to another he said and one gigled to another too Eventually he found himself working second and thirdrate nightclubs from coast to coast driving a battered but reliable old Ford pickup truck and going where Shantz his agent sent him He almost never worked the weekends on die weekends even the thirdrate clubs wanted to book rockandroll bands This was in the late sixties and early seventies and thered been no shortage of what Joe called current events material hippies and yippies braburners and Black Panthers moviestars and as always politicsbut he said he had been more of a traditional jokeoriented comedian Let Mort Sahl and George Carlin do the currentevents shtick if they wanted it hed stick to Speaking of my motherinlaw and They say our Polish friends are dumb but let me tell you about this Irish girl I met During his recitation an odd andto Susannah at leastrather poignant thing happened Joe Collinss MidWorld accent with its yers and yars and ifitdoesyas began to crossfade into an accent she could only identify as Wiseguy American She kept expecting to hear bird come out of his mouth as boid heardAS hoid but she guessed that was only because shed spent so much time with Eddie She thought Joe Collins was one of those odd natural mimics whose voices are the auditory equivalent of Silly Putty taking impressions that fade as quickly as diey rise to the surface Doing a club in Brooklyn it probably was boid and hoid in Pittsburgh it would be burrd and hurrd the Giant Eagle supermarket would become Jaunt Iggle Roland stopped him early on to ask if a comic was like a court jester and the old man laughed heartily You got it Just think of a bunch of people sitting around in a smoky room with drinks in their hands instead of the king and his courtiers Roland nodded smiling There are advantages to being a funnyman doing onenighters in the Midwest though he said If you tank in Dubuque all that happens is you end up doing twenty minutes instead of fortyfive and then its on to the next town There are probably places in MidWorld where theyd cut off your damn head for stinking up the joint At this the gunslinger burst out laughing a sound that still had the power to startle Susannah although she was laughing herself You say true Joe In the summer of Joe had been playing a nightclub called Jangos in Cleveland not far from the ghetto Roland interrupted again this time wanting to know what a ghetto was In the case of Hauck Susannah said it means a part of the city where most of the people are black and poor and the cops have a habit of swinging their billyclubs first and asking questions later BingJoe exclaimed and rapped his knuckles on the top of his head Couldnt have said it better myself Again there came that odd babyish crying sound from the front of the house but this time the wind was in a relative lull Susannah glanced at Roland but if the gunslinger heard he gave no sign It was the wind Susannah told herself What else could it be Mordred her mind whispered back Mordred out there freezing Mordred out there dying while we sit in here with our hot coffee But she said nothing There had been trouble in Hauck for a couple of weeks Joe said but hed been drinking pretty heavily Hitting it hard was how he put it and hardly realized that the crowd at his second show was about a fifth the size of the one at the first Hell I was on a roll he said I dont know about anyone else but I was knocking myself dead rolling me in the aisles Then someone had thrown a Molotov cocktail through the clubs front window Molotov cocktailnd amp a term Roland understood  and before you could say Take my motherinlaw please the place was on fire Joe had boogied out the back through the stage door Hed almost made it to the street when three men all very black all roughly the size of NBA centers grabbed him Two held the third punched Then someone swung a botde Boomboom out go the lights He had awakened on a grassy hillside near a deserted town called Stones Warp according to the signs in the empty buildings along Main Street To Joe Collins it had looked like the set of a Western movie after all the actors had gone home It was around this time that Susannah decided she did not believe much of sai Collinss story It was undoubtedly entertaining and given Jakes first entry into MidWorld after being run over in die street and killed while on his way to school it was not totally implausible But she still didnt believe much of it The question was did it matter You couldnt call it heaven because there were no clouds and no choirs of angels Joe said but I decided it was some sort of an afterlife just the same He had wandered about He found food he found a horse Lippy and moved on He had met various roving bands of people some friendly some not some truethreaded some mutie Enough so hed picked up some of the lingo and a little MidWorld history certainly he knew about the Beams and the Tower At one point hed tried to cross the Badlands he said but hed gotten scared and turned back when his skin began to break out in all sorts of sores and weird blemishes I got a boil on my ass and that was the final touch he said Six or eight years ago this might have been Me n Lippy said the hell with going any further That was when I found this place which is called Westring and when Stuttering Bill found me Hes got a litde doctorin and he lanced the boil on my bottom Roland wanted to know if Joe had witnessed the passage of the Crimson King as that mad creature made his final pilgrimage to the Dark Tower Joe said he had not but that six months ago there had been a terrible storm a real boilermaker that drove him down into his cellar While he was there the electric lights had failed genny or no genny and as he cowered in the dark a sense had come to him that some terrible creature was close by and that it might at any moment touch Joes mind and follow his thoughts to where he was hiding You know what I felt like he asked them Roland and Susannah shook their heads Oy did the same in perfect imitation Snackfood Joe said Potential snackfood This part of his storys true Susannah thought He may have changed it around a little but basically its true And if she had any reason to think that it was only because the idea of the Crimson King traveling in his own portable storm seemed horribly plausible What did you do Roland asked Went to sleep he said Its a talent Ive always had like doing impressionsalthough I dont do famous voices in my act because they never go over out in the sticks Not unless youre Rich Little at least Strange but true I can sleep pretty much on command so thats what I did down in the cellar When I woke up again the lights were back on and the the whateveritwas was gone I know about the Crimson King of course I see folks from time to time stillnomads like you three for the most partand they talk about him Usually they fork the sign of the evil eye and spit between their fingers when they do You think that was him huh You think the Crimson King actually passed by Odds Lane on his way to the Tower Then before they had a chance to answer Well why not Tower Roads the main throughfare after all It goes all the way there You know it was him Susannah thought What game are you playing Joe The thin cry that was most definitely not the wind came again She no longer thought it was Mordred though She thought that maybe it was coming from the cellar where Joe had gone to hide from the Crimson King or so hed said Who was down there now And was he hiding as Joe had done or was he a prisoner It hasnt been a bad life Joe was saying Not the life I expected not by any manner or means but I got a theorythe folks who end up living the lives they expected are more often than not the ones who end up takin sleepin pills or stickin the barrel of a gun in their mouths and pullin the trigger Roland seemed still to be a few turns back because he said You were a court jester and the customers in these inns were your court Joe smiled showing a lot of white teeth Susannah frowned Had she seen his teeth before They had been doing a lot of laughing and she should have seen them but she couldnt remember that she actually had Certainly he didnt have the mushmouth sound of someone whose teeth are mosdy gone such people had consulted with her father on many occasions most of them in search of artificial replacements If shed had to guess earlier on she would have said he had teeth but they were down to nothing but pegs and nubbins and And whats the matter with you girl He might be lying about a few things but he surely didnt grow afresh set of teeth since you sat down to dinner Youre letting your imagination run away with you Was she Well it was possible And maybe that thin cry was nothing but the sound of the wind in the eaves at the front of the house after all Id hear some of your jokes and stories Roland said As you told them on the road if it does ya Susannah looked at him closely wondering if the gunslinger had some ulterior motive for this request but he seemed genuinely interested Even before seeing the Polaroid of the Dark Tower tacked to the living room wall his eyes returned to it constandy as Joe told his story Roland had been invested by a kind of hectic good cheer that was really not much like him at all It was almost as if he were ill edging in and out of delirium Joe Collins seemed surprised by the gunslingers request but not at all displeased Good God he said I havent done any standup in what seems like a thousand years and considering the way time stretched there for awhile maybe it has been a thousand Im not sure Id know how to begin Susannah surprised herself by saying Try EIGHT Joe thought about it and then stood up brushing a few errant crumbs from his shirt He limped to the center of the room leaving his crutch leaning against his chair Oy looked up at him with his ears cocked and his old grin on his chops as if anticipating the entertainment to come For a moment Joe looked uncertain Then he took a deep breath let it out and gave them a smile Promise you wont throw no tomatoes if I stink up the joint he said Remember its been a long time Not after you took us in and fed us Susannah said Never in life Roland always literal said We have no tomatoes in any case Right right Although there are some canned ones in the pantry forget I said that Susannah smiled So did Roland Encouraged Joe said Okay lets go back to that magical place called Jangos in that magical city some folks call the mistake on the lake Cleveland Ohio in other words Second show The one I never got to finish and I was on a roll take my word for it Give me just a second He closed his eyes Seemed to gather himself When he opened them again he somehow looked ten years younger It was astounding And he didnt just sound American when he began to speak he looked American Susannah couldnt have explained that in words but she knew it was true here was one Joe Collins Made in USA Hey ladies and gentlemen welcome to Jangos Im Joe Collins and youre not Roland chuckled and Susannah smiled mostly to be politethat was a pretty old one The management has asked me to remind you that this is twobeersforabuck night Got it Good With them the motive is profit with me its selfinterest Because the more you drink the funnier I get Susannahs smile widened There was a rhythm to comedy even sheknew that although she couldnt have done even five minutes of standup in front of a noisy nightclub crowd not if her life had depended on it There was a rhythm and after an uncertain beginning Joe was finding his His eyes were halflidded and she guessed he was seeing the mixed colors of the gels over the stageso like the colors of the Wizards Rainbow now that she thought of itand smelling the smoke of fifty smoldering cigarettes One hand on the chrome pole of the mike the other free to make any gesture it liked Joe Collins playing Jangos on a Friday night No not a Friday He said all the clubs book rockandroll bands on the weekends Nemine all that mistakeonthelake stuff Clevelands a beautiful city Joe said He was picking up the pace a little now Starting to rap Eddie might have said My folks are from Cleveland but when they were seventy they moved to Florida They didnt want to but shitfire its the law BingJoe rapped his knuckles against his head and crossed his eyes Roland chuckled again even though he couldnt have the slightest idea where or even what Florida was Susannahs smile was wider than ever Floridas a helluva place Joe said Helluva place Home of the newly wed and the nearly dead My grandfather retired to Florida God rest his soul When I die I want to go peacefully in my sleep like Grampa Fred Not screaming like the passengers in his car Roland roared with laughter at that one and Susannah did too Oys grin was wider than ever My grandma she was great too She said she learned how to swim when someone took her out on the Cuyahoga River and threw her off the boat I said Hey Nana they werent trying to teach you how to swim Roland snorted wiped his nose then snorted again His cheeks had bloomed with color Laughter elevated the entire metabolism put it almost on a fightorflight basis Susannah had read that somewhere Which meant her own must be rising because she was laughing too It was as if all the horror and sorrow were gushing out of an open wound gushing out like Well like blood She heard a faint alarmbell start to ring far back in her mind and ignored it What was there to be alarmed about They were laughing for goodness sake Having a good time Can I be serious a minute No Well fuck you and the nag you rode in ontomorrow when I wake up Ill be sober but youll still be ugly And bald Roland roared Im gonna be serious okay If you dont like it stick it where you keep your changepurse My Nana was a great lady Women in general are great you know it But they have their flaws just like men If a woman has to choose between catching a fly ball and saving a babys life for instance shell save the baby without even considering how many men are on base Bing He rapped his head with his knuckles and popped his eyes in a way that made them both laugh Roland tried to put his coffee cup down and spilled it He was holding his stomach Hearing him laugh so hardto surrender to laughter so completelywas funny in itself and Susannah burst out in a fresh gale Men are one thing women are another Put em together and youve got a whole new taste treat Like Oreos Like Peanut Butter Cups Like raisin cake with snot sauce Show me a man and a woman and Ill show you the Peculiar Institutionnot slavery marriage But I repeat myself Bing He rapped his head Popped his eyes This time they seemed to come kasproing halfway out of their sockets how does he do that and Susannah had to clutch her stomach which was beginning to ache with the force of her laughter And her temples were beginning to pound It hurt but it was a good hurt Marriage is having a wife or a husband Yeah Check Websters Bigamy is having a wife or husband too many Of course thats also monogamy Bing If Roland laughed any harder Susannah thought he would go sliding right out of his chair and into the puddle of spilled coffee Then theres divorce a Latin term meaning to rip a mans genitals out through the wallet But I was talking about Cleveland remember You know how Cleveland got started A bunch of people in New York said Gee Im starting to enjoy the crime and die poverty but its not quite cold enough Lets go west Laughter Susannah would reflect later is like a hurricane once it reaches a certain point it becomes selffeeding selfsupporting You laugh not because the jokes are funny but because your own condition is funny Joe Collins took them to this point with his next sally Hey remember in elementary school you were told that in case of fire you have to line up quiedy with the smallest people in front and the tallest people at die end of the line Whats the logic in that Do tall people burn slower Susannah shrieked wiui laughter and slapped die side of her face This produced a sudden and unexpected burst of pain that drove all the laughter out of her in a moment The sore beside her mouth had been growing again but hadnt bled in two or three days When she inadvertently struck it wiui her flailing hand she knocked away the blackishred crust covering it The sore did not just bleed it gushed For a moment she was unaware of what had just happened She only knew that slapping the side of her face hurt much more than it should have done Joe also seemed unaware his eyes were mosdy closed again must have been unaware because he rapped faster than ever Hey and what about that seafood restaurant they have at Sea World I got halfway through my fishburger and wondered if I was eating a slow learner Bing And speaking offish Oy barked in alarm Susannah felt sudden wet warmth run down the side of her neck and onto her shoulder Stop Joe Roland said He sounded out of breath Weak With laughter Susannah supposed Oh but the side of her face hurt and Joe opened his eyes looking annoyed What Jesus Christ you wanted it and I was givingit to ya Susannahs hurt herself The gunslinger was up and looking at her laughter lost in concern Im not hurt Roland I just slapped myself upside the head a litde harder than I m Then she looked at her hand and was dismayed to see it was wearing a red glove NINE Oy barked again Roland snatched the napkin from beside his overturned cup One end was brown and soaking with coffee but the other was dry He pressed it against the gushing sore and Susannah winced away from his touch at first her eyes filling with tears Nay let me stop the bleeding at least Roland murmured and grasped her head working his fingers gently into the tight cap of her curls Hold steady And for him she managed to do it Through her watering eyes Susannah thought Joe still looked pissed that she had interrupted his comedy routine in such drastic not to mention messy fashion and in a way she didnt blame him Hed been doing a really good job shed gone and spoiled it Aside from the pain which was abating a little now she was horribly embarrassed remembering the time she had started her period in gym class and a little trickle of blood had run down her thigh for the whole world to seethat part of it with whom she had thirdperiod PE at any rate Some of the girls had begun chanting Plug it UP as if it were the funniest thing in the world Mixed with this memory was fear concerning the sore itself What if it was cancer Before shed always been able to thrust this idea away before it was fully articulated in her mind This time she couldnt What if shed caught her stupid self a cancer on her trek through the Badlands Her stomach knotted then heaved She kept her fine dinner in its place but perhaps only for the time being Suddenly she wanted to be alone needed to be alone If she was going to vomit she didnt want to do it in front of Roland and this stranger Even if she wasnt she wanted some time to get herself back under control A gust of wind strong enough to shake the entire cottage roared past like a hotenj in full flight the lights flickered and her stomach knotted again at the seasick motion of the shadows on the wall Ive got to go the bathroom she managed to say For a moment the world wavered but then it steadied down again In the fireplace a knot of wood exploded shooting a flurry of crimson sparks up the chimney You sure Joe asked He was no longer angry if he had been but he was looking at her doubtfully Let her go Roland said She needs to settle herself down I think Susannah began to give him a grateful smile but it hurt the sore place and started it bleeding again too She didnt know what else might change in the immediate future thanks to the dumb unhealing sore but she did know she was done listening to jokes for awhile Shed need a transfusion if she did much more laughing Ill be back she said Dont you boys go and eat all the rest of that pudding on me The very thought of food made her feel ill but it was something to say On the subject of pudding I make no promise Roland said Then as she began to turn away If thee feels lightheaded in there call me I will she said Thank you Roland TEN Although Joe Collins lived alone his bathroom had a pleasantly feminine feel to it Susannah had noticed that the first time shed used it The wallpaper was pink with green leaves andwhat elsewild roses The John looked perfectly modern except for the ring which was wood instead of plastic Had he carved it himself She didnt think it was out of the question although probably the robot had brought it from some forgotten store of stuff Stuttering Carl Was that what Joe called the robot No Bill Stuttering Bill On one side of the John there was a stool on the other a clawfoot tub with a shower attachment that made her think of Hitchcocks Psycho but every shower made her think of that damned movie since shed seen it in Times Square There was also a porcelain washstand set in a waisthigh wooden cabinetgood old plainoak rather than ironwood she judged There was a mirror above it She presumed you swung it out and there were your pills and potions All the comforts of home She removed the napkin with a wince and a litde hissing cry It had stuck in the drying blood and pulling it away hurt She was dismayed by the amount of blood on her cheeks lips and chinnot to mention her neck and the shoulder of her shirt She told herself not to let it make her crazy you ripped the top off something and it was going to bleed that was all Especially if it was on your stupid face In the other room she heard Joe say something she couldnt tell what and Rolands response a few words with a chuckle tacked on at the end So weird to hear him do that she thought Almost like hes drunk Had she ever seen Roland drunk She realized she had not Never fallingdown drunk never mothernaked never fully caught by laughter until now Tenyo business woman Detta told her All right she muttered All right all right Thinking drunk Thinking naked Thinking lost in laughter Thinking they were all so close to being the same thing Maybe they were the same thing Then she got up on the stool and turned on the water It came in a gush blotting out the sounds from the other room She setded for cold splashing it gendy on her face then using a faceclotheven more gendyto clean die skin around the sore When that was done she patted the sore itself Doing it didnt hurt as much as shed been afraid it might Susannah was a litde encouraged When she was done she rinsed out Joes facecloth before the bloodstains could set and leaned close to the mirror What she saw made her breathe a sigh of relief Slapping her hand incautiously to her face like that had torn the entire top off the sore but maybe in the end that would turn out to be for the best One thing was for sure if Joe had a bottle of hydrogen peroxide or some kind of antibiotic cream in his medicine cabinet she intended to give the damned mess a good cleaningout while it was open And nemine how much it might sting Such a cleansing was due and overdue Once it was finished shed bandage it over and then just hope for the best She spread the facecloth on the side of the basin to dry then plucked a towel it was the same shade of pink as the wallpaper from a fluffy stack on a nearby shelf She got it halfway to her face then froze There was a piece of notepaper lying on the next towel in the stack It was headed with a flowerdecked bench being lowered by a pair of happy cartoon angels Beneath was this printed boldface line RELAX tee OOM ampS rue And in faded fountain pen ink Odds Odd O amp Frowning Susannah plucked the sheet of notepaper from the stack of towels Who had left it here Joe She doubted it like hell She turned the paper over Here the same hand had written s Tvc left fo Soncliig  ife JnediciJte but fit In the other room Joe continued to speak and this time Roland burst out laughing instead of just chuckling It sounded to Susannah as if Joe had resumed his monologue In a way she could understand thathed been doing something he loved something he hadnt had a chance to do in a good long stretch of yearsbut part of her didnt like the idea at all That Joe would resume while she was in the bathroom tending to herself that Roland would let him resume Would listen and laugh while she was shedding blood It seemed like a rotten boysclubby kind of thing to do She supposed she had gotten used to better from Eddie Why dont you forget the boys for the time being and concentrate on whats right in front of you What does it mean One thing seemed obvious someone had expected her to come in here and find that note Not Roland not Joe Her What a bad girl it said Girl But who could have known Who could have been sure It wasnt as if she made a habit of slapping her face or her chest or her knee when she laughed she couldnt remember a single other instance when But she could Once At a Dean MartinJerry Lewis movie Dopes at Sea or something like that Shed been caught up in the same fashion then laughing simply because the laughter had reached some point of critical mass and become selffeeding The whole audienceat the Clark in Times Square for all she knewdoing the same rocking and rolling swinging and swaying spraying popcorn from mouths that were no longer their own Mouths that belonged at least for a few minutes to Martin and Lewis those dopes at sea But it had only happened that once Comedy plus tragedy equals makebelieve But theres no tragedy here is there She didnt expect an answer to this but she got one It came in the cold voice of intuition Not yet there isnt For no reason whatsoever she found herself thinking of Lippy Grinning gruesome Lippy Did the folken laugh in hell Susannah was somehow sure they did They grinned like Lippy the WonderNag when Satan began his take my horse please routine and then they laughed Helplessly Hopelessly For all of eternity may it please ya not at all What in the hells wrong with you woman In the other room Roland laughed again Oy barked and that also sounded like laughter Odds Lane Odd Lane think about it What was there to think about One was the name of the street the other was the same thing only without the Whoaback wait a minute she said in a low voice Little more than a whisper really and who did she think would hear her Joe was talkingpretty much nonstop it sounded likeand Roland was laughing So who did she think might be listening The cellardweller if there really was one Whoaon a minute just wait She closed her eyes and once more saw the two streetsigns on their pole signs that were actually a little below die pilgrims because the newcomers had been standing on a snowbank nine feet high TOWER ROAD one of the signs had readthat one pointing to the plowed road that disappeared over the horizon The other the one indicating the short lane with the cottages on it had said ODDs LANE only Only it didnt she murmured clenching the hand that wasnt holding the note into a fist It didnt She could see it clearly enough in her minds eye ODDS LANE with the apostrophe and the S added and why would somebody do that Was the signchanger maybe a compulsive neatnik who couldnt stand What Couldnt stand what Beyond the closed bathroom door Roland roared louder than ever Something fell over and broke Hes not used to laughing like that Susannah thought You best look out Roland or you ll do yourself damage Laugh yourself into a hernia or something Think about it her unknown correspondent had advised and she was trying Was there something about the words odd and lane that someone didnt want them to see If so that person had no need to worry because she sure wasnt seeing it She wished Eddie was here Eddie was the one who was good at the funky stuff jokes and riddles and an Her breath stopped An expression of wideeyed comprehension started to dawn her face and on the face of her twin in the mirror She had no pencil and was terrible at the sort of mental rearrangements that she now had to Balanced on the stool Susannah leaned over the waisthigh washstand and blew on the mirror fogging it She printed W IANELooked at it with growing understanding and dismay In the other room Roland laughed harder than ever and now she recognized what she should have seen thirty valuable seconds ago that laughter wasnt merry It was jagged and out of control the laughter of a man struggling for breath Roland was laughing the way the folken laughed when comedy turned to tragedy The way folken laughed in hell Below W AA she used the tip of her finger to print tNltLO the anagram Eddie might have seen right away and surely once he realized the apostropheS on the sign had been added to distract them In the other room the laughter dropped and changed becoming a sound that was alarming instead of amusing Oy was barking crazily and Roland Roland was choking ONE She wasnt wearing her gun Joe had insisted she take the LaZBoy recliner when theyd returned to the living room after dinner and shed put the revolver on the magazinelittered endtable beside it after rolling the cylinder and drawing the shells The shells were in her pocket Susannah tore open the bathroom door and scrambled back into the living room Roland was lying on the floor between the couch and the television his face a terrible purple color He was scratching at his swollen throat and still laughing Their host was standing over him and the first thing she saw was that his hairthat babyfine shoulderlength white hairwas now almost entirely black The lines around his eyes and mouth had been erased Instead often years younger Joe Collins now looked twenty or even thirty years younger The son of a bitch The vampire son of a bitch Oy leaped at him and seized Joes left leg just above the knee Twennyfive sissyfour nineteen hiker Joe cried merrily and kicked out now as agile as Fred Astaire Oy flew through the air and hit the wall hard enough to knock a plaque reading GOfJSJseS ampOaRtiOMe to the floor Joe turned back to Roland What I think he said is that women need a reason to have sex Joe put one foot on Rolands chestlike a biggame hunter with his trophy Susannah thought Men on the other hand only need a place Bing He popped his eyes The thing about sex is that God gives men a brain and a dick but only enough blood to operate one at a He never heard her approach or lift herself into the LaZBoy in order to gain the necessary height he was concentrating too completely on what he was doing Susannah laced her hands together into a single fist raised them to the height of her right shoulder then brought them down and sideways with all the force she could manage The fist struck the side of Joes head hard enough to knock him away She had connected with solid bone however and the pain in her hands was excruciating Joe staggered waving his arms for balance and looking around at her His upper lip rose exposing his teethperfectly ordinary teeth and why not He wasnt the sort of vampire who survived on blood This was Empathica after all And the face around those teeth was changing darkening contracting turning into somediing that was no longer human It was die face of a psychotic clown You he said but before he could say anydiing else Oy had raced forward again There was no need for the bumbler to use his teeth this time because their host was still staggering Oy crouched behind the things ankle and Dandelo simply fell over him his curses ceasing abrupdy when he struck his head The blow might have put him out if not for the homey rag rug covering the hardwood As it was he forced himself to a sitting position almost at once looking around groggily Susannah knelt by Roland who was also trying to sit up but not doing as well She seized his gun in its holster but he closed a hand around her wrist before she could pull it out Instinct of course and to be expected but Susannah felt close to panic as Dandelos shadow fell over them You bitch Ill teach you to interrupt a man when hes on a Roland let it go she screamed and he did Dandelo dropped meaning to land on her and crush the gun between them but she was an instant too quick She rolled aside and he landed on Roland instead Susannah heard the tortured Owuff as the gunslinger lost whatever breath he had managed to regain She raised herself on one arm panting and pointed the gun at the one on top the one undergoing some horridly busy change inside his clothes Dandelo raised his hands which were empty Of course they were it wasnt his hands he used to kill with As he did so his features began to pull together becoming more and more surface thingsnot features at all but markings on some animals hide or an insects carapace Stop he cried in a voice that was dropping in pitch and becoming something like a cicadas buzz I want to tell you the one about the archbishop and the chorus girl Heard it she said and shot him twice one bullet following another into his brain from just above what had been his right eye TWO Roland floundered to his feet His hair was matted to the sides of his swollen face When she tried to take his hand he waved her away and staggered to the front door of the little cottage which now looked dingy and illlit to Susannah She saw there were foodstains on the rug and a large waterblemish on one wall Had those things been there before And dear Lord in heaven what exactly had they eaten for supper She decided she didnt want to know as long as it didnt make her sick As long as it wasnt poisonous Roland of Gilead pulled open the door The wind ripped it from his grasp and threw it against the wall with a bang He staggered two steps into the screaming blizzard bent forward with his hands placed on his lower thighs and vomited She saw the jet of egested material and how the wind whipped it away into the dark When Roland came back in his shirt and the side of his face were rimed with snow It was fiercely hot in the cottage that was something else Dandelos glammer had hidden from them until now She saw that the thermostata plain old Honeywell not much different from the one in her New York apartnientwas still on the wall She went to it and examined it It was twisted as far as it would go beyond the eightyfivedegree mark She pushed it back to seventy with the tip of a finger then turned to survey the room The fireplace was actually twice the size it had appeared to them and rilled with enough logs to make it roar like a steelfurnace There was nothing she could do about that for the time being but it would eventually die down The dead thing on the rug had mostly burst out of its clothes To Susannah it now looked like some sort of bug with misshapen appendagesalmost arms and legssticking out of the sleeves of its shirt and the legs of its jeans The back of the shirt had split down the middle and what she saw in the gap was a kind of shell on which rudimentary human features were printed She would not have believed anything could be worse dian Mordred in his spiderform but this thing was Thank God it was dead The tidy welllit cottagelike something out of a fairytale and hadnt she seen that from the firstwas now a dim and smoky peasants hut There were still electric lights but they looked old and longused like the kind of fixtures one might find in a flophouse hotel The rag rug was dark with dirt as well as splotched with spilled food and unraveling in places Roland are you all right Roland looked at her and then slowly went to his knees before her For a moment she thought he was fainting and she was alarmed When she realized only a second later what was really happening she was more alarmed still Gunslinger I was mazed Roland said in a husky trembling voice I was taken in like a child and I cry your pardon Roland no Git up That was Detta who always seemed to come out when Susannah was under great strain She thought Its a wonder I didnt say Git up honky and had to choke back a cry of hysterical laughter He would not have understood Give me pardon first Roland said not looking at her She fumbled for the formula and found it which was a relief She couldnt stand to see him on his knees like diat Rise gunslinger I give you pardon in good heart She paused then added If I save your life another nine times well be somewhere close to even He said Your kind heart makes me ashamed of my own and rose to his feet The terrible color was fading from his cheeks He looked at the thing on the rug casting its grotesquely misshapen shadow up the wall in the firelight Looked around at the close litde hut with its ancient fixtures and flickering electric bulbs What he fed us was all right he said It was as if hed read her mind and seen the worst fear that it held Hed never poison what he meant to eat She was holding his gun out to him butt first He took it and reloaded the two empty chambers before dropping it back into the holster The huts door was still open and snow came blowing in It had already created a white delta in the litde entryway where their makeshift hide coats hung The room was a little cooler now a litde less like a sauna How did you know he asked She thought back to die hotel where Mia had left Black Thirteen Later on after theyd left Jake and Callahan had been able to get into Room because someone had left them a note and dadachee a key Jakes name and This is the truth had been written on the envelope in a hybrid of cursive script and printing She was sure that if she had that envelope with its brief message and compared it to the message shed found in the bathroom she would find the same hand made both According to Jake the deskclerk at the New York PlazaPark Hotel had told them the message had been left by a man named Stephen King Come with me she said Into the bathroom THREE Like the rest of the hut the bathroom was smaller now not much more than a closet The tub was old and rusty with a thin layer of dirt in the bottom It looked like it had last been used Well the truth was that it looked to Susannah like it had never been used The showerhead was clotted with rust The pink wallpaper was dull and dirty peeling in places There were no roses The mirror was still there but a crack ran down the middle of it and she thought it was sort of a wonder that she hadnt cut the pad of her finger writing on it The vapor of her breath had faded but the words were still there visible in the grime W lAtB and below that ampWfcO Its an anagram she said Do you see He studied the writing then shook his head looking a bit ashamed Not your fault Roland Theyre our letters not the ones you know Take my word for it its an anagram Eddie would have seen it right away I bet I dont know if it was Dandelos idea of a joke or if there are some sort of rules glammer things like him have to follow but the thing is we figured it out in time with a little help from Stephen King You figured it out he said I was busy laughing myself to death We both would have done that she said You were just a litde more vulnerable because your sense of humor forgive me Roland but as a rule its pretty lame I know tfiat he said bleakly Then he suddenly turned and left the room A horrid idea came to Susannah and it seemed a very long time before the gunslinger came back Roland is he still He nodded smiling a litde Still as dead as ever was You shot true Susannah but all at once I needed to be sure Im glad she said simply Oys standing guard If anything were to happen Im sure hed let us know He picked the note up from the floor and carefully puzzled out what was written on the back The only term she had to help him with was medicine cabinet Ive left you something Do you know what She shook her head I didnt have time to look Where is this medicine cabinet She pointed at the mirror and he swung it out It squalled on its hinges There were indeed shelves behind it but instead of the neat rows of pills and potions she had imagined there were only two more brown bottles like the one on the table beside the LaZBoy and what looked to Susannah like the worlds oldest box of Smith Brothers Wild Cherry Cough Drops There was also an envelope however and Roland handed it to her Written on the front in that same distinctive halfwriting halfprinting was this  ampe Childe she asked Does that mean anything to you He nodded Its a term that describes a knightor a gunslingeron a quest A formal term and ancient We never used it among ourselves you must ken for it means holy chosen by ka We never liked to think of ourselves in such terms and I havent thought of myself so in many years Yet you are Childe Roland Perhaps once I was Were beyond such things now Beyond ka But still on the Path of the Beam Aye He traced the last line on the envelope All debts are paid Open it Susannah for Id see whats inside She did FOUR It was a photocopy of a poem by Robert Browning King had written the poets name in his halfscript halfprinting above the title Susannah had read some of Brownings dramatic monologues in college but she wasnt familiar with this poem She was however extremely familiar with its subject the title of the poem was Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came It was narrative in structure the rhymescheme balladic abbaab and thirtyfour stanzas long Each stanza was headed with a Roman numeral SomeoneKing presumablyhad circled stanzas I II XIII XIV and XVI Read the marked ones he said hoarsely because I can only make out a word here and there and I would know what they say would know it very well Stanza the First she said then had to clear her throat It was dry Outside the wind howled and the naked overhead bulb flickered in its flyspecked fixture My first thought was he lied in every word That hoary cripple with malicious eye Askance to watch the working of his lie On mine and mouth scarce able to afford Suppression of the glee that pursed and scored Its edge at one more victim gained thereby Collins Roland said Whoever wrote that spoke of Collins as sure as King ever spoke of our katet in his stories He lied in every word Aye so he did Not Collins she said Dandelo Roland nodded Dandelo say true Go on Okay Stanza the Second What else should he be set for with his staff What save to waylay with his lies ensnare all travellers who might find him posted there and ask the road I guessed what skulllike laugh Would break what crutch gin write my epitaph For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare Does thee remember his stick and how he waved it Roland asked her Of course she did And the thoroughfare had been snowy instead of dusty but otherwise it was the same Otherwise it was a description of what had just happened to them The idea made her shiver Was this poet of your time Roland asked Your when She shook her head Not even of my country He died at least sixty years before my when Yet he must have seen what just passed A version of it anyway Yes And Stephen King knew the poem She had a sudden intuition one that blazed too bright to be anything but the truth She looked at Roland with wild startled eyes It was this poem that got King going It was his inspiration Do you say so Susannah v Yes Yet this Browning must have seen us She didnt know It was too confusing Like trying to figure out which came first the chicken or the egg Or being lost in a hall of mirrors Her head was swimming Read the next one marked Susannah Read exeyeeyeeye Thats Stanza Thirteen she said As for the grass it grew as scant as hair In leprosy thin dry blades pricked the mud Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood One stiff blind horse his every bone astare Stood stupefied however he came there Thrust out past service from the devils stud Now Stanza the Fourteenth I read thee Alive He might be dead for aught I know With that red gaunt and colloped neck astrain And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe I never saw a brute I hated so He must be wicked to deserve such pain Lippy the gunslinger said and jerked a thumb back over his shoulder Yonders pluggit colloped neck and all only female instead of male She made no replyneeded to make none Of course it was Lippy blind and bony her neck rubbed right down to the raw pink in places Her an ugly old thing I know the old man had said the thing that had looked like an old man Ye old kibox and gammergurt ye lost fourlegged leper And here it was in black and white a poem written long before sai King was even born perhaps eighty or even a hundred years before as scant as hairIn leprosy Thrust out past service from the devils stud Roland said smiling grimly And while shell never stud nor ever did well see shes back with the devil before we leave No she said We wont Her voice sounded drier than ever She wanted a drink but was now afraid to take anything flowing from the taps in this vile place In a little bit she would get some snow and melt it Then she would have her drink and not before Why do you say so Because shes gone She went out into the storm when we got the best of her master How does thee know it Susannah shook her head I just do She shuffled to the next page in the poem which ran to over two hundred lines Stanza the Sixteenth Not it I fancied She ceased Susannah Why do you Then his eyes fixed on the next word which he could read even in English letters Go on he said His voice was low the words little more than a whisper Are you positive Read for I would hear She cleared her throat Stanza the Sixteenth Not it I fancied Cuthberts reddening face Beneath its garniture of curly gold Dear fellow till I almost felt him fold An arm in mine to fix me to the place That way he used Alas one nights disgrace Out went my hearts new fire and left it cold He writes of Mejis Roland said His fists were clenched although she doubted that he knew it He writes of how we fell out over Susan Delgado for after that it was never the same between us We mended our friendship as best we could but no it was never quite the same After the woman comes to the man or the man to the woman I dont think it ever is she said and handed him the photocopied sheets Take this Ive read all the ones he mentioned If theres stuff in the rest about coming to the Dark Toweror notpuzzle it out by yourself You can do it if you try hard enough I reckon As for me I dont want to know Roland it seemed did He shuffled through the pages looking for the last one The pages werent numbered but he found the end easily enough by the white space beneath that stanza marked XXXIV Before he could read however that thin cry came again This time the wind was in a complete lull and there was no doubt about where it came from Thats someone below us in the basement Roland said I know And I think I know who it is He nodded She was looking at him steadily It all fits doesnt it Its like ajigsaw puzzle and weve put in all but the last few pieces The cry came again thin and lost The cry of someone who was next door to dead They left the bathroom drawing their guns Susannah didnt think theyd need them this time FIVE The bug that had made itself look like a jolly old joker named Joe Collins lay where it had lain but Oy had backed off a step or two Susannah didnt blame him Dandelo was beginning to stink and little trickles of white stuff were beginning to ooze through its decaying carapace Nevertheless Roland bade the bumbler remain where he was and keep watch The cry came again when they reached the kitchen and it was louder but at first they saw no way down to the cellar Susannah moved slowly across the cracked and dirty linoleum looking for a hidden trapdoor She was about to tell Roland there was nothing when he said Here Behind the coldbox The refrigerator was no longer a topoftheline Amana with an icemaker in the door but a squat and dirty thing with the cooling machinery on top in a drumshaped casing Her mother had had one like it when Susannah had been a little girl who answered to the name of Odetta but her mother would have died before ever allowing her own to be even a tenth as dirty A hundredth Roland moved it aside easily for Dandelo sly monster that hed been had put it on a little wheeled platform She doubted that he got many visitors not way out here in EndWorld but he had been prepared to keep his secrets if someone did drop by As she was sure folken did every once and again She imagined that few if any got any further along their way than the little hut on Odd Lane The stairs leading down were narrow and steep Roland felt around inside the door and found a switch It lit two bare bulbs one halfway down the stairs and one below As if in response to the light the cry came again It was full of pain and fear but there were no words in it The sound made her shiver Come to the foot of the stairs whoever you are Roland called No response from below Outside the wind gusted and whooped driving snow against the side of the house so hard that it sounded like sand Come to where we can see you or well leave you where you are Roland called The inhabitant of the cellar didnt come into the scant light but cried ovit again a sound that was loaded with woe and terror andSusannah feared itmadness He looked at her She nodded and spoke in a whisper Go first Ill back your play if you have to make one Ware the steps that you dont take a tumble he said in the same low voice She nodded again and made his own impatient twirling gesture with one hand Go on go on That raised a ghost of a smile on the gunslingers lips He went down the stairs with the barrel of his gun laid into the hollow of his right shoulder and for a moment he looked so like Jake Chambers that she could have wept SIX The cellar was a maze of boxes and barrels and shrouded things hanging from hooks Susannah had no wish to know what the dangling things were The cry came again a sound like sobbing and screaming mingled together Above them dim and muffled now came the whoop and gasp of the wind Roland turned to his left and threaded his way down a zigzag aisle with crates stacked headhigh on either side Susannah followed keeping a good distance between them looking constantly back over her shoulder She was also alert for the sound of Oy raising the alarm from above She saw one stack of crates that was labeled TEXAS INSTRUMENTS and another stack with HO FAT CHINESE FORTUNE COOKIE co stenciled on the side She was not surprised to see the joke name of their longabandoned taxi she was far beyond surprise Ahead of her Roland stopped Tears of my mother he said in a low voice She had heard him use this phrase once before when they had come upon a deer that had fallen into a ravine and lay there with both back legs and one front one broken starving and looking up at them sightlessly for the flies had eaten the unfortunate animals living eyes out of their sockets She stayed where she was until he gestured for her to join him and then moved quickly up to his right side boosting herself along on the palms of her hands In the stonewalled far corner of Dandelos cellarthe southeast corner if she had her directions rightthere was a makeshift prison cell Its door was made of crisscrossing steel bars Nearby was the welding rig Dandelo must have used to construct i t but long ago judging from the thick layer of dust on die acetylene tank Hanging from an Sshaped hook pounded into the stone wall just out of the prisoners reachleft close by to mock him Susannah had no doubtwas a large and oldfashioned dadachum dadachee silver key The prisoner in question stood at the bars of his detainment holding his filthy hands out to them He was so scrawny that he reminded Susannah of certain terrible concentration camp photos she had seen images of those who had survived Auschwitz and BergenBelsen and Buchenwald living if barely indictments of mankind as a whole with their striped uniforms hanging off them and their ghastly bellboys pillbox hats still on their heads and their terrible bright eyes so full of awareness We wish we did not know what we have become those eyes said but unfortunately we do Something like that was in Patrick Danvilles eyes as he held out his hands and made his inarticulate pleading noises Close up they sounded to her like the mocking cries of some jungle bird on a movie soundtrack Iyeee Iyeee Iyowk Iyowk Roland took the key from its hook and went to the door One of Danvilles hands clutched at his shirt and the gunslinger pushed it off It was a gesture entirely without anger she thought but the scrawny thing in the cell backed away with his eyes bulging in their sockets His hair was longit hung all the way to his shouldersbut there was only the faintest haze of beard on his cheeks It was a little thicker on his chin and upper lip Susannah thought he might be seventeen but surely not much older No offense Patrick Roland said in a purely conversational voice He put the key in the lock Is thee Patrick Is thee Patrick Danville The scrawny thing in the dirtyjeans and billowing gray shirt it hung nearly to his knees backed into the corner of his triangular cell without replying When his back was against the stone he slid slowly to a sitting position beside what Susannah assumed was his slopbucket the front of his shirt first bunching together and then flowing into his crotch like water as his knees rose to nearly frame his emaciated terrified face When Roland opened the cell door and pulled it outward as far as it would go there were no hinges Patrick Danville began to make the birdsound again only this time louder IYEEE IYOWK IYEEEEEE Susannah gritted her teeth When Roland made as if to enter the cell the boy uttered an even louder shriek and began to beat the back of his head against the stones Roland stepped back out of the cell The awful headbanging ceased but Danville looked at the stranger with fear and mistrust Then he held out his filthy longfingered hands again as if for succor Roland looked to Susannah She swung herself on her hands so she was in the door of the cell The emaciated boything in the corner uttered its weird birdshriek again and pulled the supplicating hands back crossing them at the wrists turning their gesture into one of pathetic defense No honey This was a Detta Walker Susannah had never heard before nor suspected No honey Ah ain goan hurt you if Ah meant tdo dat Ahd just put two in yo haid like Ah did that mahfah upstairs She saw something in his eyesperhaps just a minute widening that revealed more of the bloodshot whites She smiled and nodded Dass ri Mistuh Collins he daid He ain nev goan come down he no mo an whuh Whut he do to you Patrick Above them muffled by the stone the wind gusted The lights flickered the house creaked and groaned in protest Whuh he do tyou boy It was no good He didnt understand She had just made up her mind to this when Patrick Danville put his hands to his stomach and held it He twisted his face into a cramp that she realized was supposed to indicate laughter He make you laugh Patrick crouched in his corner nodded His face twisted even more Now his hands became fists that rose to his face He rubbed his cheeks with them then screwed them into his eyes then looked at her Susannah noticed there was a little scar on the bridge of his nose He make you cry too Patrick nodded He did the laughing mime again holding the stomach and going hohoho he did the crying mime wiping tears from his fuzzy cheeks this time he added a third bit of mummery scooping his hands toward his mouth and making smacksmack sounds with his lips From above and slightly behind her Roland said He made you laugh he made you cry he made you eat Patrick shook his head so violently it struck the stone walls that were the boundaries of his corner He ate Detta said Dass whut you trine tsay aint it Dandeloate Patrick nodded eagerly He made you laugh he made you cry and den he ate whut came out Cause dass what he do Patrick nodded again bursting into tears He made inarticulate wailing sounds Susannah worked her way slowly into the cell pushing herself along on her palms ready to retreat if the headbanging started again It didnt When she reached die boy in the corner he put his face against her bosom and wept Susannah turned looked at Roland and told him with her eyes i that he could come in now When Patrick looked up at her it was with dumb doglike adoration Dont you worry Susannah saidDetta was gone again probably worn out from all that nice Hes not going to get you Patrick hes dead as a doornail dead as a stone in the river Now I want you to do something for me I want you to open your mouth Patrick shook his head at once There was fear in his eyes again but something else she hated to see even more It was shame Yes Patrick yes Open your mouth He shook his head violently his greasy long hair whipping from side to side like the head of a mop Roland said What Hush she told him Open your mouth Patrick and show us Then well take you out of here and youll never have to be down here again Never have to be Dandelos dinner again Patrick looked at her pleading but Susannah only looked back at him At last he closed his eyes and slowly opened his mouth His teeth were there but his tongue was not At some point Dandelo must have tired of his prisoners voiceor the words it articulated anywayand had pulled it out SEVEN Twenty minutes later the two of them stood in the kitchen doorway watching Patrick Danville eat a bowl of soup At least half of it was going down the boys gray shirt but Susannah reckoned that was all right there was plenty of soup and there were more shirts in the huts only bedroom Not to mention Joe Collinss heavy parka hung on the hook in the entry which she expected Patrick would wear hence from here As for the remains of DandeloJoe Collins that wasthey had wrapped them in three blankets and tossed them unceremoniously out into the snow She said Dandelo was a vampire that fed on emotions instead of blood Patrick there Patrick was his cow Theres two ways you can take nourishment from a cow meat or milk The trouble with meat is that once you eat the prime cuts the notsoprime cuts and then the stew its gone If youjust take the milk though you can go on forever always assuming you give the cow something to eat every now and then How long do you suppose he had him penned up down there Roland asked I dont know But she remembered the dust on the acetylene tank remembered it all too well A fairly long time anyway What must have seemed like forever to him And it hurt Plenty Much as it must have hurt when Dandelo pulled the poor kids tongue out I bet the emotional bloodsucking hurt more You see how he is Roland saw all right He saw something else as well We cant take him out in this storm Even if we dressed him up in three layers of clothes Im sure it would kill him Susannah nodded She was sure too Of that and something else she could not stay in the house That might kill her Roland agreed when she said so Well camp out in yonder barn until the storm finishes Itll be cold but I see a pair of possible gains Mordred may come and Lippy may come back Youd kill them both Aye if I could Doee have a problem with that She considered it then shook her head All right Lets put together what wed take out there for well have no fire for the next two days at least Maybe as long as four EIGHT It turned out to be three nights and two days before the blizzard choked on its own fury and blew itself out Near dusk of the second day Lippy came limping out of the storm and Roland put a bullet in the blind shovel that was her head Mordred never showed himself although she had a sense of him lurking close on the second night Perhaps Oy did too for he stood at the mouth of the barn barking hard into the blowing snow During that time Susannah found out a good deal more bout Patrick Danville than she had expected His mind had been badly damaged by his period of captivity and that did not surprise her What did was his capacity for recovery limited though it might be She wondered if she herself could have come back at all after such an ordeal Perhaps his talent had something to do with it She had seen his talent for herself in Sayres office Dandelo had given his captive the bare minimum of food necessary to keep him alive and had stolen emotions from him on a regular basis two times a week sometimes three once in awhile even four Each time Patrick became convinced that the next time would kill him someone would happen by Just lately Patrick had been spared the worst of Dandelos depredations because company had been more frequent than ever before Roland told her later that night after theyd bedded down in the hayloft that he believed many of Dandelos most recent victims must have been exiles fleeing either from Le Casse Roi Russe or the town around it Susannah could certainly sympathize with the thinking of such refugees The King is gone so lets get the hell out of here while the gettings good After all Big Red might take it into his head to come back and hes off his chump round the bend possessed of an elevator that no longer goes to the top floor On some occasions Joe had assumed his true Dandelo form in front of his prisoner then had eaten the boys resulting terror But he had wanted much more than terror from his captive cow Susannah guessed that different emotions must produce different flavors like having pork one day chicken the next and fish the day after that Patrick couldnt talk but he could gesture And he could do more than that once Roland showed them a queer find hed come upon in the pantry On one of the highest shelves was a stack of oversized drawing pads marked MICHELANGELO FINE FOR CHARCOAL They had no charcoal but near the pads was a clutch of brandnew EberhardFaber  pencils held together by a rubber band What qualified the find as especially queer was the fact that someone presumably Dandelo had carefully cut the eraser off the top of each pencil These were stored in a canningjar next to the pencils along with a few paper clips and a pencilsharpener diat looked like the whistles on the undersides of the few remaining Oriza plates from Calla Bryn Sturgis When Patrick saw the pads his ordinarily dull eyes lit up and he stretched both hands longingly toward them making urgent hooting sounds Roland looked at Susannah who shrugged and said Lets see what he can do I have a pretty good idea already dont you It turned out that he could do a lot Patrick Danvilles drawing ability was nothing short of amazing And his pictures gave him all the voice he needed He produced them rapidly and with clear pleasure he did not seem disturbed at all by their harrowing clarity One showed Joe Collins chopping into the back of an unsuspecting visitors head with a hatchet his lips pulled back in a snarling grin of pleasure Beside the point of impact the boy had printed CHUNT And SPLOOSH in big comicbook letters Above Collinss head Patrick drew a thoughtballoon with the words Take that ya lunker in it Another picture showed Patrick himself lying on the floor reduced to helplessness by laughter that was depicted with terrible accuracy no need of die Ha Ha Ha scrawled above his head while Collins stood over him with his hands on his hips watching Patrick then tossed back the sheet of paper with that drawing on it and quickly produced another picture which showed Collins on his knees widi one hand twined in Patricks hair while his pursed lips hovered in front of Patricks laughing agonized mouth Quickly in a single practiced movement the tip of the pencil never left die paper the boy made another comicstrip thoughtballoon over the old mans head and then put seven letters and two exclamation points inside What does it say Roland asked fascinated YUM Good Susannah answered Her voice was small and sickened Subject matter aside she could have watched him draw for hours in fact she did The speed of the pencil was eerie and neither of them ever thought to give him one of the amputated erasers for there seemed to be no need So far as Susannah could see the boy either never made a mistake or incorporated the mistakes into his drawings in a way that made themwell why stick at the words if they were the right wordslittle acts of genius And the resulting pictures werent sketches not really but finished works of art in themselves She knew what Patrickthis one or another Patrick from another world along the path of the Beamwould later be capable of with oil paints and such knowledge made her feel cold and hot at the same time What did they have here A tongueless Rembrandt It occurred to her that this was their second idiotsavant Their third if you counted Oy as well as Sheemie Only once did his lack of interest in the erasers cross Susannahs mind and she put it down to the arrogance of genius Not a single time did it occur to heror to Rolandthat this young version of Patrick Danville might not yet know that such things as erasers even existed NINE Near the end of the third night Susannah awoke in the loft looked at Patrick lying asleep beside her and descended die ladder Roland was standing in the doorway of the barn smoking a cigarette and looking out The snow had stopped A late moon had made its appearance turning the fresh snow on Tower Road into a sparkling land of silent beauty The air was still and so cold she felt the moisture in her nose crackle Far in the distance she heard the sound of a motor As she listened it seemed to her that it was drawing closer She asked Roland if he had any idea what it was or what it might mean to them I think its likely the robot he called Stuttering Bill out doing his afterstorm plowing he said He may have one of those antennathings on his head like the Wolves You remember She remembered very well and said so It may be that he holds some special allegiance to Dandelo Roland said I dont think thats likely but it wouldnt be the strangest thing I ever ran across Be ready with one of your plates if he shows red And Ill be ready with my gun But you dont think so She wanted to be a hundred per cent clear on this point No Roland said He could give us a ride perhaps all the way to the Tower itself Even if not he might take us to the far edge of the White Lands That would be good for the boys still weak This raised a question in her mind We call him the boy because he looks like a boy she said How old do you think he is Roland shook his head Surely no younger than sixteen or seventeen but he might be as old as thirty Time was strange when the Beams were under attack and it took strange hops and twists I can attest to that Did Stephen King put him in our way I cant say only that he knew of him sure He paused The Tower is so close Do you feel it She did and all the time Sometimes it was a pulsing sometimes it was singing quite often it was both And the Polaroid still hung in Dandelos hut That at least had not been part of the glammer Each night in her dreams at least once she saw the Tower in that photograph standing at the end of its field of roses sooty grayblack stone against a troubled sky where the clouds streamed out in four directions along the two Beams that still held She knew what the voices sangcommala commala commalacomecomebut she did not think that they sang to her or for her No say no say never in life this was Rolands song and Rolands alone But she had begun to hope that that didnt necessarily mean she was going to die between here and the end of her quest She had been having her own dreams TEN Less than an hour after the sun rose firmly in the east and we all say thankya an orange vehiclecombination truck and bulldozerappeared over the horizon and came slowly but steadily toward them pushing a big wing of fresh snow to its right making the high bank even higher on that side Susannah guessed that when it reached the intersection of Tower Road and Odd Lane Stuttering Bill almost surely the plows operator would swing it around and plow back the other way Maybe he stopped here as a rule not for coffee but for a fresh squirt of oil or something She smiled at the idea and at something else as well There was a loudspeaker mounted on the cabs roof and a rock and roll song she actually knew was issuing forth Susannah laughed delighted California Sun The Rivieras Oh doesnt it sound finel If you say so Roland agreed Just keep hold of thy plate You can count on that she said Patrick had joined them As always since Roland had found them in the pantry he had a pad and a pencil Now he wrote a single word in capital letters and held it out to Susannah knowing that Roland could read very little of what he wrote even if it was printed in letters that were bigbig The word in the lower quadrant of the sketchpad was BILL This was below an amazing drawing of Oy with a comicstrip speechballoon over his head reading YARW YARK All this he had casually crossed out so she wouldnt think it was what he wanted her to look at The slashed X sort of broke her heart because the picture beneath its crossed lines was Oy to the life ELEVEN The plow pulled up in front of Dandelos hut and although the engine continued to run the music cut off Down from the drivers seat there galumphed a tall eight feet at the very least shinyheaded robot who looked quite a lot like Nigel from the Arc  Experimental Station and Andy from Calla Bryn Sturgis He cocked his metal arms and put his metal hands on his hips in a way that would likely have reminded Eddie of George Lucass CP had Eddie been there The robot spoke in an amplified voice that rolled away across the snowfields HELLO JJOE WHAT DO YOU NUHNUHKNOW HOW ABE TRICKS INKUHKUHKOKOMO Roland stepped out of the late Lippys quarters Hile Bill he said mildly Long days and pleasant nights The robot turned His eyes flashed bright blue That looked like surprise to Susannah He showed no alarm that she could see however and didnt appear to be armed but she had already marked the antenna rising from the center of his headtwirling and twirling in the bright morning lightand she felt confident she could clip it with an Oriza if she needed to Easypeasyjapaneezy Eddie would have said Ah said the robot A guddagah gunnagah ggg He raised an arm that had not one elbowjoint but two and smacked his head with it From inside came a litde whisding noiseWheeepand then he finished A gunslinger Susannah laughed She couldnt help it They had come all this way to meet an oversized electronic version of Porky Pig Tbeyatbeyatbeya thats all folks I had heard rumors of such on the land the robot said ignoring her laughter Are you RuhRuhRoland of GGilead So I am Roland said And you William DM Maintenance Robot Many Other Functions Joe Collins calls me Stuhhuttering BBill Ive got a fffried sirhirkit somewhere inside I could fix it but he fuhfuhforbade me And since hes the only hhuman around or was He stopped Susannah could quite clearly hear die clitter clack of relays somewhere inside and what she thought of wasnt CP who shed of course never seen but Robby the Robot from Forbidden Planet Then Stuttering Bill quite touched her heart by putting one metal hand to his forehead and bowing but not to either her or to Roland He said Hile Patrick DDanville son of SSSonia Its good to see you out and in the ccclear so it is And Susannah could hear the emotion in Stuttering Bills voice It was genuine gladness and she felt more than okay about lowering her plate TWELVE They palavered in the yard Bill would have been quite willing to go into the hut for he had but rudimentary olfactory equipment The humes were better equipped and knew that the hut stank and had not even warmth to recommend it for the furnace and the fire were both out In any case the palaver didnt take long William the Maintenance Robot Many Other Functions had counted the being that sometimes called itself Joe Collins as his master for there was no longer anyone else to lay claim to the job Besides CollinsDandelo had the necessary codewords I wwas nuhnot able to ggive him the ccode wuhwuhhurds when he aasked said Stuttering Bill but my pprogramming did not pruhprohibit bringing him cerhertain mmanuals that had the ihinformation he needed Bureaucracy is so wonderful Susannah said Bill said he had stayed away from JJJoe as often and as long as he could although he had to come when Tower Road needed plowingthat was also in his programmingand once a month to bring provisions canned goods mostly from what he called the Federal He also liked to see Patrick who had once given Bill a wonderful picture of himself that he looked at often and of which he had made many copies Yet every time he came he confided he was sure he would find Patrick gonekilled and thrown casually into the woods somewhere back toward what Bill called the BuhBuhBads like an old piece of trash But now here he was alive and free and Bill was delighted For I do have rrrudimentary emmmotions he said sounding to Susannah like someone owning up to a bad habit Do you need the codewords from us in order to accept our orders Roland asked Yes sai Stuttering Bill said Shit Susannah muttered They had had similar problems with Andy back in Calla Bryn Sturgis HHHowever said Stuttering Bill if you were to cccouch your orders as suhhuhhugestions Im sure Id be huhhuh huhhuh He raised his arm and smacked his head again The Wheep sound came once more not from his mouth but from the region of his chest Susannah thought happy to oblige he finished My first suggestion is that you fix that fucking stutter Roland said and then turned around amazed Patrick had collapsed to the snow holding his belly and voicing great blurry cries of laughter Oy danced around him barking but Oy was harmless this time there was no one to steal Patricks joy It belonged only to him And to those lucky enough to hear it THIRTEEN In the woods beyond the plowed intersection back toward what Bill would have called the Bads a shivering adolescent boy wrapped in stinking halfscraped hides watched the quartet standing in front of Dandelos hut Die he thought at them Die why dontyou all do me a favor and just die But they didnt die and the cheerful sound of their laughter cut him like knives Later after they had all piled into the cab of Bills plow and driven away Mordred crept down to the hut There he would stay for at least two days eating his fill from the cans in Dandelos pantryand eating something else as well something he would live to regret He spent those days regaining his strength for the big storm had come close to killing him He believed it was his hate that had kept him alive that and no more Or perhaps it was the Tower For he felt it toothat pulse that singing But what Roland and Susannah and Patrick heard in a major key Mordred heard in a minor And where they heard many voices he heard only one It was the voice of his Red Father telling him to come Telling him to kill the mute boy and the blackbird bitch and especially the gunslinger out of Gilead the uncaring White Daddy who had left him behind Of course his Red Daddy had also left him behind but this never crossed Mordreds mind And when the killing was done the whispering voice promised they would destroy the Dark Tower and rule todash together for eternity So Mordred ate for Mordred was ahungry And Mordred slept for Mordred was aweary And when Mordred dressed himself in Dandelos warm clothes and set out along the freshly plowed Tower Road pulling a rich sack of gunna on a sled behind himcanned goods mostlyhe had become a young man who looked to be perhaps twenty years old tall and straight and as fair as a summer sunrise his human form marked only by the scar on his side where Susannahs bullet had winged him and the bloodmark on his heel That heel he had promised himself would rest on Rolands throat and soon ONE In the final days of their long journey after Billjust Bill now no longer Stuttering Billdropped them off at the Federal on the edge of the White Lands Susannah Dean began to suffer frequent bouts of weeping She would feel these impending cloudbursts and would excuse herself from the others saying she had to go into the bushes and do her necessary And there she would sit on a fallen tree or perhaps just the cold ground put her hands over her face and let her tears flow If Roland knew this was happeningand surely he must have noted her red eyes when she returned to the roadhe made no comment She supposed he knew what she did Her time in MidWorldand EndWorldwas almost at an end TWO Bill took them in his fine orange plow to a lonely Quonset hut with a faded sign out front reading FEDERAL OUTPOST amp TOWER WATCH TRAVEL BEYOND THIS POINT IS FORBIDDEN She supposed Federal Outpost was still technically in the White Lands of Empathica but the air had warmed considerably as Tower Road descended and the snow on the ground was little more than a scrim Groves of trees dotted the ground ahead but Susannah thought the land would soon be almost entirely open like the prairies of the American Midwest There were bushes that probably supported berries in warm weatherperhaps even pokeberriesbut now they were bare and clattering in the nearly constant wind Mostly what they saw on either side of Tower Roadwhich had once been paved but had now been reduced to little more than a pair of broken rutswere tall grasses poking out of the thin snowcover They whispered in the wind and Susannah knew their song Commalacomecome journeys almost done I may go no furdier Bill said shutting down the plow and cutting off Little Richard in midrave Tell ya sorry as they say in the Arc OThe Borderlands Their trip had taken one full day and half of another and during that time he had entertained them with a constant stream of what he called golden oldies Some of these were not old at all to Susannah songs like Sugar Shack and Heat Wave had been current hits on the radio when shed returned from her little vacation in Mississippi Others she had never heard at all The music was stored not on records or tapes but on beautiful silver discs Bill called ceedees He pushed them into a slot in the plows instrumentcluttered dashboard and the music played from at least eight different speakers Any music would have sounded fine to her she supposed but she was especially taken by two songs she had never heard before One was a deliriously happy little rocker called She Loves You The other sad and reflective was called Heyjude Roland actually seemed to know the latter one he sang along with it although the words he knew were different from the ones coming out of the plows multiple speakers When she asked Bill told her the group was called The Beetles Funny name for a rockandroll band Susannah said Patrick sitting with Oy in the plows tiny rear seat tapped her on the shoulder She turned and he held up the pad through which he was currendy working his way Beneath a picture of Roland in profile he had printed BEATLES not Beetles Its a funny name for a rockandroll band no matter which way you spell it Susannah said and that gave her an idea Patrick do you have the touch When he frowned and raised his handsI dont understand die gesture saidshe rephrased the question Can you read my mind He shrugged and smiled This gesture said I dont know but she thought Patrick did know She thought he knew very well THREE They reached the Federal near noon and there Bill served them a fine meal Patrick wolfed his and then sat off to one side with Oy curled at his feet sketching the others as they sat around the table in what had once been the common room The walls of this room were covered with TV screensSusannah guessed there were diree hundred or more They must have been built to last too because some were still operating A few showed the rolling hills surrounding the Quonset but most broadcast only snow and one showed a series of rolling lines that made her feel queasy in her stomach if she looked at it too long The snowscreens Bill said had once shown pictures from satellites in orbit around the Earth but the cameras in those had gone dead long ago The one with the rolling lines was more interesting Bill told them that until only a few months ago that one had shown the Dark Tower Then suddenly the picture had dissolved into nothing but those lines I dont think die Red King liked being on television Bill told them Especially if he knew company might be coming Wont you have another sandwich There are plenty I assure you No Soup then What about you Patrick Youre too thin you knowfar jar too thin Patrick turned his pad around and showed them a picture of Bill bowing in front of Susannah a tray of neatiy cut sandwiches in one metal hand a carafe of iced tea in the other Like all of Patricks pictures it went far beyond caricature yet had been produced with a speed of hand that was eerie Susannah applauded Roland smiled and nodded Patrick grinned holding his teeth together so that the others wouldnt have to look at the empty hole behind them Then he tossed the sheet back and began something new Theres a fleet of vehicles out back Bill said and while many of them no longer run some still do I can give you a truck with fourwheel drive and while I cannot assure you it will run smoothly I believe you can count on it to take you as far as the Dark Tower which is no more than one hundred and twenty wheels from here Susannah felt a great and fluttery liftdrop in her stomach One hundred and twenty wheels was a hundred miles perhaps even a bit less They were close So close it was scary You would not want to come upon the Tower after dark Bill said At least I shouldnt think so considering the new resident But whats one more night camped at the side of the road to such great travelers as yourselves Not much I should say But even with one last night on the road and barring breakdowns which the gods know are always possible youd have your goal in sight by midmorning of tomorrowday Roland considered this long and carefully Susannah had to tell herself to breathe while he did so because part of her didnt want to Im not ready that part thought And there was a deeper parta part that remembered every nuance of what had become a recurring and evolving dreamthat thought something else Im not meant to go at all Not all the way At last Roland said I thank you Billwe all say thank you Im surebut I think well pass on your kind offer Were you to ask me why I couldnt say Only that part of me thinks that tomorrowdays too soon That part of me thinks we should go the rest of the way on foot just as weve already traveled so far He took a deep breath let it out Im not ready to be there yet Not quite ready You too Susannah marveled You too I need a little more time to prepare my mind and my heart Mayhap even my soul He reached into his back pocket and brought out the photocopy of the Robert Browning poem that had been left for them in Dandelos medicine chest Theres something writ in here about remembering the old times before coming to the last battle or the last stand Its wellsaid And perhaps really all I need is what this poet speaks ofa draught of earlier happier sights I dont know But unless Susannah objects I believe well go on foot Susannah doesnt object she said quietly Susannah thinks its just what the doctor ordered Susannah only objects to being dragged along behind like a busted tailpipe Roland gave her a grateful if distracted smilehe seemed to have gone away from her somehow during these last few daysand then turned back to Bill I wonder if you have a cart I could pull For well have to take at least some gunna and theres Patrick Hell have to ride part of the time Patrick looked indignant He cocked an arm in front of him made a fist and flexed his muscle The resulta tiny gooseegg rising on the biceps of his drawingarmseemed to shame him for he dropped it quickly Susannah smiled and reached out to pat his knee Dont look like that sugar Its not your fault that you spent God knows how long caged up like Hansel and Gretel in die witchs house Im sure I have such a thing Bill said and a batterypowered version for Susannah What I dont have I can make It would take an hour or two at most Roland was calculating If we leave here with five hours of daylight ahead of us we might be able to make twelve wheels by sunset What Susannah would call nine or ten miles Another five days at that rather leisurely speed would bring us to the Tower Ive spent my life searching for Id come to it around sunset if possible for thats when Ive always seen it in my dreams Susannah And the voice insidethat deep voicewhispered Four nights Four nights to dream That should be enough Maybe more than enough Of course ka would have to intervene If they had indeed outrun its influence that wouldntcouldnthappen But Susannah now thought ka reached everywhere even to die Dark Tower Was perhaps embodied by the Dark Tower Thats fine she told him in a faint voice Patrick Roland asked What do you say Patrick shrugged and flipped a hand in their direction hardly looking up from his pad Whatever they wanted that gesture said Susannah guessed that Patrick understood little about die Dark Tower and cared less And why would he care He was free of the monster and his belly was full Those things were enough for him He had lost his tongue but he could sketch to his hearts content She was sure that to Patrick that seemed like more than an even trade And yet and yet Hes not meant to go either Not him not Oy not me But what is to become of us then She didnt know but she was queerly unworried about it Ka would tell Ka and her dreams FOUR An hour later the three humes die bumbler and Bill the robot stood clustered around a cutdown wagon diat looked like a slighdy larger version of Ho Fats Luxury Taxi The wheels were tall but thin and spun like a dream Even when it was full Susannah thought it would be like pulling a feadier At least while Roland was fresh Pulling it uphill would undoubtedly rob him of his energy after awhile but as they ate the food they were carrying Ho Fat II would grow lighter still and she diought diere wouldnt be many hills anyway They had come to the open lands the prairielands all the snow and treecovered ridges were behind them Bill had provided her widi an electric runabout that was more scooter than golfcart Her days of being dragged along behind like a busted tailpipe were done If youll give me another half an hour I can smooth this off Bill said running a threefingered steel hand along the edge where he had cut off the front half of the small wagon that was now Ho Fat II We say thankya but it wont be necessary Roland said Well lay a couple of hides over it just so Hes impatient to be off Susannah thought and after all this time why wouldnt be be Im anxious to be off myself Well if you say so let it be so Bill said sounding unhappy about it I suppose I just hate to see you go When will I see humes again None of them answered that They didnt know Theres a mighty loud horn on the roof Bill said pointing at the Federal I dont know what sort of trouble it was meant to signalradiation leaks mayhap or some sort of attackbut I do know the sound of it will carry across a hundred wheels at least More if the winds blowing in the right direction If I should see the fellow you think is following you or if such motionsensors as still work pick him up Ill set it off Perhaps youll hear Thank you Roland said Were you to drive you could outrun him easily Bill pointed out Youd reach the Tower and never have to see him Thats true enough Roland said but he showed absolutely no sign of changing his mind and Susannah was glad What will you do about the one you call his Red Father if he really does command CanKa No Rey Roland shook his head although he had discussed this probability with Susannah He thought they might be able to circle the Tower from a distance and come then to its base from a direction that was blind to the balcony on which the Crimson King was trapped Then they could work their way around to the door beneath him They wouldnt know if that was possible until they could actually see the Tower and the lay of the land of course Well therell be water if God wills it said the robot formerly known as Stuttering Bill or so the old people did say And mayhap Ill see you again in the clearing at the end of the path if nowhere else If robots are allowed to go there I hope its so for theres many Ive known that Id see again He sounded so forlorn that Susannah went to him and raised her arms to be picked up not thinking about the absurdity of wanting to hug a robot But he did and she didquite fervendy too Bill made up for the malicious Andy back in Calla Bryn Sturgis and was worth hugging for diat if nothing else As his arms closed around her it occurred to Susannah that Bill could break her in two with those titaniumsteel arms if he wanted to But he didnt He was gentle Long days and pleasant nights Bill she said May you do well and we all say so Thank you madam he said and put her down I say thuddathank diummathank thukka Wheep And he struck his head producing a bright clang I say thank ya kindly He paused I did fix the stutter say true but as I may have told you I am not entirely without emotions FIVE Patrick surprised them both by walking for almost four hours beside Susannahs electric scooter before tiring and climbing into Ho Fat II They listened for the horn warning them that Bill had seen Mordred or that the instruments in the Federal had detected him but did not hear i t and the wind was blowing their way By sunset they had left the last of the snow The land continued to flatten out casting their shadows long before them When they finally stopped for the night Roland gathered enough brush for a fire and Patrick who had dozed off woke up long enough to eat an enormous meal of Vienna sausage and baked beans Susannah watching the beans disappear into Patricks tongueless mouth reminded herself to spread her hides upwind of him when she finally laid down her weary head She and Oy also ate heartily but Roland hardly touched his own food When dinner was done Patrick took up his pad to draw frowned at his pencil and then held out a hand to Susannah She knew what he wanted and took the glass canning jar from the litde bag of personals she kept slung over her shoulder She held onto this because there was only the one pencil sharpener and she was afraid that Patrick might lose it Of course Roland could sharpen the EberhardFabers with his knife but it would change the quality of the points somewhat She tipped the jar spilling erasers and paperclips and the required object into her cupped palm Then she handed it to Patrick who sharpened his pencil with a few quick twists handed it back and immediately fell to his work For a moment Susannah looked at the pink erasers and wondered again why Dandelo had bothered to cut them off As a way of teasing the boy If so it hadnt worked Later in life perhaps when die sublime connections between his brain and his fingers rusted a little when the small but undeniably brilliant world of his talent had moved on he might require erasers For now even his mistakes continued to be inspirations He didnt draw long When Susannah saw him nodding over his pad in the orange glare of the fading sunset she took it from his unprotesting fingers bedded him down in the back of the cart propped level with the front end on a convenient boulder jutting from the ground covered him with hides and kissed his cheek Sleepily Patrick reached up and touched the sore below her own cheek She winced then held steady at his gende touch The sore had clotted over again but it throbbed painfully Even smiling hurt her these days The hand fell away and Patrick slept The stars had come out Roland was looking raptly up at them What do you see she asked him What do you see he asked in turn She looked at the brightening celestial landscape Well she said theres Old Star and Old Mother but they seem to have moved west And that thereoh my goodness She placed her hands on his stubbly cheeks he never seemed to grow an actual beard only a bristly scruff and turned it That wasnt there back when we left from the Western Sea I know it wasnt That ones in our world Rolandwe call it the Big Dipper He nodded And once according to the oldest books in my fathers library it was in the sky of our world as well Lydias Dipper it was called And now here it is again He turned to her smiling Another sign of life and renewal How the Crimson King must hate to look up from his entrapment and see it riding the sky again SIX Not long after Susannah slept And dreamed SEVEN Shes in Central Park again under a bright gray sky from which the first few snowflakes are once more drifting carolers nearby are singing not Silent Night or What Child Is This but the Rice Song Rice be a greeno See what we seeno Seeno the greeno Comecomecommala She takes off her cap afraid it will have changed somehow but it still says MERRY CHRISTMAS and no twins here she is comforted She looks around and there stand Eddie and Jake grinning at her Their heads are bare she has gotten their hats She has combined their hats Eddie is wearing a sweatshirt that says I DRINK NOZZALA Jake is wearing one that says I DRIVE THE TAKURO SPIRIT None of this is precisely new What she sees behind them standing near a carriagepath leading back to Fifth Avenue most certainly is Its a door about six and a half feet high and made of solid ironwood from the look of it The doorknobs of solid gold andfiligtved with a shape the lady gunslinger finally recognizes two crossed pencils EberhardFabers she has no doubt And the erasers have been cut off Eddie holds out a cup of hot chocolate Its the perfect kind mit schlag on top and a little sprinkling of nutmeg dotting the cream Here he says I brought you hot chocolate She ignores the outstretched cup Shes fascinated by the door Its like the ones along the beach isnt it she asks Yes Eddie says No Jake says at the same time Youllfigure it out they say together and grin at each other delighted She walks past them Writ upon the doors through which Roland dreiu them were THE PRISONER and THE LADY OF SHADOWS and THE PUSHER Writ upon this one is js  S  And below that THE ARTIST She turns back to them and they are gone Central Park is gone She is looking at the ruination of Lud gazing upon the waste lands On a cold and bitter breeze she hears four whispered words Times almost up hurry EIGHT She woke in a kind of panic thinking I have to leave him and best I do it before I can s much as see his Dark Tower on the horizon But where do I go And how can I leave him to face both Mordred and the Crimson King with only Patrick to help him This idea caused her to reflect on a bitter certainty come a showdown Oy would almost certainly be more valuable to Roland than Patrick The bumbler had proved his mettle on more than one occasion and would have been worthy of the title gunslinger had he but a gun to sling and a hand to sling it with Patrick though Patrick was a well a pencilslinger Faster than blue blazes but you couldnt kill much with an Eberhard Faber unless it was very sharp Shed sat up Roland leaning against the far side of her little scooter and keeping the watch hadnt noticed And she didnt wanthxm to notice That would lead to questions She lay back down pulling her hides around her and thinking of their first hunt She remembered how the yearling buck had swerved and run right at her and how shed decapitated it with the Oriza She remembered the whisding sound in the chilly air the one that resulted when the wind blew through the little attachment on die bottom of die plate the attachment diat looked so much like Patricks pencil sharpener She diought her mind was trying to make some sort of connection here but she was too tired to know what it might be And maybe she was trying too hard as well If so what was she to do about that There was at least one thing she did know from her time in Calla Bryn Sturgis The meaning of die symbols writ upon the door was UNFOUND Times almost up Hurry The next day her tears began NINE There were still plenty of bushes behind which she could go to do her necessary and cry her tears when she could no longer hold them back but the land continued to flatten and open Around noon of their second full day on the road Susannah saw what she at first thought was a cloudshadow moving across the land far up ahead only the sky above was solid blue from horizon to horizon Then die great dark patch began to veer in a very uncloudlike way She caught her breadi and brought her little electric scooter to a stop Roland she said Yonders a herd of buffalo or maybe theyre bison Sure as death n taxes Aye do you say so Roland asked with only passing interest We called em bannock in the long ago Its a goodsized herd Patrick was standing in the back of Ho Fat II sketching madly He switched his grip on the pencil he was using now holding die yellow barrel against his palm and shading widi die tip She could almost smell die dust boiling up from die herd as he shaded it with his pencil Akhough it seemed to her that hed taken the liberty of moving the herd five or even ten miles closer unless his vision was a good deal sharper than her own That she supposed was entirely possible In any case her eyes had adjusted and she could see them better herself Their great shaggy heads Even their black eyes There hasnt been a herd of buffalo that size in America for almost a hundred years she said Aye Still only polite interest But theyre in plenty here I should say If a litde tet of em comes within pistolshot range lets take a couple Id like to taste some fresh meat that isnt deer Would you She let her smile answer for her Roland smiled back And it occurred to her again that soon she would see him no more this man shed believed was either a mirage or a daemon before she had come to know him both antet and dandinh Eddie was dead Jake was dead and soon she would see Roland of Gilead no more Would he be dead as well Would she She looked up into the glare of the sun wanting him to mistake the reason for her tears if he saw them And they moved on into the southeast of that great and empty land into the everstrengthening beatbeatbeat that was the Tower at the axis of all worlds and time itself Beatbeatbeat Commalacomecome journeys almost done That night she stood the first watch then awakened Roland at midnight I think hes out there someplace she said pointing into the northwest There was no need to be more specific it could only be Mordred Everyone else was gone Watch well I will he said And if you hear a gunshot wake well And fast You can count on it said she and lay down in the dry winter grass behind Ho Fat II At first she wasnt sure shed be able to sleep she was still jazzed from the sense of an unfriendly other in the vicinity But she did sleep TEN The dream of the second night is both like and unlike the dream of the first The main elements are exactly the same Central Park gray sky spits of snow choral voices this time harmonizing Come Go With Me the old DelVikings hit Jake i DRIVE THE TAKURO SPIRIT and Eddie this time wearing a sweatshirt reading CLICK ITs A SHINNARO CAMERA Eddie has hot chocolate but doesnt offer it to her She can see the anxiety not only in their faces but in the tensedup set of their bodies That is the main difference in this dream there is something to see or something to do or perhaps its both Whatever it is they expected her to see it or do it by now and she is being backward A rather terrible question occurs to her is she being purposely backward Is there something here she doesnt want to confront Could it even be possible that the Dark Tower is fucking up communications Surely thats a stupid ideathese people she sees are but figments of her longing imagination after all they are dead Eddie killed by a bullet Jake as a result of being run over by a carone slain in this world one in the Keystone World where fun is fun and done is done must be done for there time always runs in one direction and Stephen King is their poet laureate Yet she cannot deny that look on their faces that look of panic that seems to tell her You have it Suzeyou have what we want to show you you have what you need to know Are you going to let it slip away Its the fourth quarter Its the fourth quarter and the clock is ticking and will continue to tick must continue to tick because all your timeouts are gone You have to hurry hurry ELEVEN She snapped awake with a gasp It was almost dawn She wiped a hand across her brow and it came away wet with sweat What do you want me to know Eddie What is it youd have me know To this question there was no answer How could there be Mistuh Dean he daid she thought and lay back down She lay that way for another hour but couldnt get back to sleep TWELVE Like Ho Fat I Ho Fat II was equipped with handles Unlike those on Ho Fat I these handles were adjustable When Patrick felt like walking the handles could be moved apart so he could pull one and Roland the other When Patrick felt like riding Roland moved the handles together so he could pull on his own They stopped at noon for a meal When it was done Patrick crawled into the back of Ho Fat II for a snooze Roland waited until he heard the boy for so they continued to think of him no matter what his age snoring then turned to her What fashes thee Susannah Id have you tell me Id have you tell me dandinh even though theres no longer a tet and Im your dinh no more He smiled The sadness in that smile broke her heart and she could hold her tears back no more Nor the trvith If Im still with you when we see your Tower Roland things have gone all wrong How wrong he asked her She shook her head beginning to weep harder Theres supposed to be a door Its the Unfound Door But I dont know how to find it Eddie and Jake come to me in my dreams and tell me I knowthey tell me with their eyesbut I dont I swear I dont He took her in his arms and held her and kissed the hollow of her temple At the corner of her mouth the sore throbbed and burned It wasnt bleeding but it had begun to grow again Let be what will be said the gunslinger as his own mother had once told him Let be what will be and hush and let ka Work You said wed outrun it He rocked her in his arms rocked her and it was good It was soothing I was wrong he said As thee knows THIRTEEN It was her turn to watch early on the third night and she was looking back behind them northwest along the Tower Road when a hand grasped her shoulder Terror sprang up in her mind like a jackinthebox and she whirled hes behind me oh dear God Mordred s got around behind me and its the spider with her hand going to the gun in her belt and yanking it free Patrick recoiled from her his own face long with terror raising his hands in front of him If hed cried out he would surely have awakened Roland and then everything might have been different But he was too frightened to cry out He made a low sound in his throat and that was all She put the gun back showed him her empty hands then pulled him to her and hugged him At first he was stiff against herstill afraidbut after a little he relaxed What is it darling she asked him sotto voce Then using Rolands phrase without even realizing it What fashes thee He pulled away from her and pointed dead north For a moment she still didnt understand and then she saw the orange lights dancing and darting She judged they were at least five miles away and she could hardly believe she hadnt seen them before Still speaking low so as not to wake Roland she said Theyre nothing but foolights sugarthey cant hurt you Roland calls em hobs Theyre like St Elmos fire or something But he had no idea of what St Elmos fire was she could see that in his uncertain gaze She setded again for telling him they couldnt hurt him and indeed this was the closest the hobs had ever come Even as she looked back at them they began to dance away and soon most of them were gone Perhaps she had thought them away Once she would have scoffed at such an idea but no longer Patrick began to relax Why dont you go back to sleep honey You need to take your rest And she needed to take hers but she dreaded it Soon she would wake Roland and sleep and the dream would come The ghosts of Jake and Eddie would look at her more frantic than ever Wanting her to know something she didnt couldnt know Patrick shook his head Not sleepy yet  He shook his head again Well then why dont you draw awhile Drawing always relaxed him Patrick smiled and nodded and went at once to Ho Fat for his current pad walking in big exaggerated sneaksteps so as not to wake Roland It made her smile Patrick was always willing to draw she guessed that one of the things that kept him alive in the basement of Dandelos hut had been knowing that every now and then the rotten old fuck would give him a pad and one of the pencils He was as much an addict as Eddie had been at his worst she reflected only Patricks dope was a narrow line of graphite He sat down and began to draw Susannah resumed her watch but soon felt a queer tingling all over her body as if she were the one being watched She thought of Mordred again and then smiled which hurt with the sore growing fat again it always did now Not Mordred Patrick Patrick was watching her Patrick was drawing her She sat still for nearly twenty minutes and then curiosity overcame her For Patrick twenty minutes would be long enough to do the Mona Lisa and maybe St Pauls Basilica in the background for good measure That tingling sense was so queer almost not a mental thing at all but something physical She went to him but Patrick at first held the pad against his chest with unaccustomed shyness But he wanted her to look that was in his eyes It was almost a lovelook but she thought it was the drawn Susannah hed fallen in love with Come on honeybunch she said and put a hand on the pad But she would not tug it away from him not even if he wanted her to He was the artist let it be wholly his decision whether or not to show his work Please He held the pad against him a moment longer Thenshyly not looking at herhe held it out She took it and looked down at herself For a moment she could hardly breathe it was that good The wide eyes The high cheekbones which her father had called those jewels of Ethiopia The full lips which Eddie had so loved to kiss It was her it was her to the very life but it was also more than her She would never have thought love could shine with such perfect nakedness from the lines made with a pencil but here that love was oh say true say so true love of the boy for the woman who had saved him who had pulled him from the dark hole where he otherwise would surely have died Love for her as a mother love for her as a woman Patrick its wonderful she said He looked at her anxiously Doubtfully Really his eyes asked her and she realized that only hethe poor needy Patrick inside who had lived with this ability all his life and so took it for grantedcould doubt the simple beauty of what he had done Drawing made him happy this much hed always known That his pictures could make others happy that idea would take some getting used to She wondered again how long Dandelo had had him and how the mean old thing had come by Patrick in the first place She supposed shed never know Meantime it seemed very important to convince him of his own worth Yes she said Yes it is wonderful Youre a fine artist Patrick Looking at this makes me feel good This time he forgot to hold his teeth together And that smile tongueless or not was so wonderful she could have eaten it up It made her fears and anxieties seem small and silly May I keep it Patrick nodded eagerly He made a tearing motion with one hand then pointed at her Yes Tear it off Take it Keep it She started to do so then paused His love and his pencil had made her beautiful The only thing to spoil that beauty was the black splotch beside her mouth She turned the drawing toward him tapped the sore on it then touched it on her own face And winced Even the lightest touch hurt This is the only damned thing she said He shrugged raising his open hands to his shoulders and she had to laugh She did it softly so as not to wake Roland but yes she did have to laugh A line from some old movie had occurred to her I paint what I see Only this wasnt paint and it suddenly occurred to her that he could take care of the rotten ugly painful thing As it existed on paper at least Then shell be my twin she thought affectionately My better half my pretty twin sis And suddenly she understood Everything Understood everything Yes she would think much later Not in any coherent fashion that could be written downif a  b  c then c  b a and c  a  bbut yes she understood everything Intuited everything No wonder the dreamEddie and dreamJake had been impatient with her it was so obvious Patrick drawing her Nor was this the first time she had been drawn Roland had drawn her to his world with magic Eddie had drawn her to himself with love As had Jake Dear God had she been here so long and been through so much without knowing what katet was what it meant Katet was family Katet was love To draw is to make a picture with a pencil or maybe charcoal To draw is also to fascinate to compel and to bring forward To bring one out of ones self The drawers were where Detta went to fulfill herself Patrick that tongueless boy genius pent up in the wilderness Pent up in the drawers And now Now Now he my forspecial thought SusannaOdettaDetta and reached into her pocket for the glass jar knowing exacdy what she was going to do and why she was going to do it When she handed back the pad without tearing off the sheet that now held her image Patrick looked badly disappointed Nar nar said she and in the voice of many Only theres something Id have you do before I take it for my pretty for my precious for my ever to keep and know how I was at this where at this when She held out one of the pink rubber pieces understanding now why Dandelo had cut them off For hed had his reasons Patrick took what she offered and turned it over between his fingers frowning as if he had never seen such a thing before Susannah was sure he had but how many years ago How close might he have come to disposing of his tormentor once and for all And why hadnt Dandelo just killed him then Because once he took away the erasers he thought he was safe she thought Patrick was looking at her puzzled Beginning to be upset Susannah sat down beside him and pointed at the blemish on the drawing Then she put her fingers delicately around Patricks wrist and drew it toward the paper At first he resisted then let his hand with the pink nubbin in it be tugged forward She thought of the shadow on the land that hadnt been a shadow at all but a herd of great shaggy beasts Roland called bannock She thought of how shed been able to smell the dust when Patrick began to draw the dust And she thought of how when Patrick had drawn the herd closer than it actually was artistic license and we all say thankya it had actually looked closer She remembered thinking that her eyes had adjusted and now marveled at her own stupidity As if eyes could adjust to distance the way they could adjust to the dark No Patrick had moved them closer Had moved them closer by drawing them closer When the hand holding the eraser was almost touching the paper she took her own hand awaythis had to be all Patrick she was somehow sure of it She moved her fingers back and forth miming what she wanted He didnt get it She did it again then pointed to the sore beside the full lower lip Make it gone Patrick she said surprised by the steadiness of her own voice Its ugly make it gone Again she made that rubbing gesture in the air Erase it This time he got it She saw the light in his eyes He held the pink nubbin up to her Perfectly pink it wasnot a smudge of graphite on it He looked at her eyebrows raised as if to ask if she was sure She nodded Patrick lowered the eraser to the sore and began to rub it on the paper tentatively at first Then as he saw what was happening he worked with more spirit FOURTEEN She felt the same queer tingling sensation but when hed been drawing it had been all over her Now it was in only one place to the right side of her mouth As Patrick got the hang of the eraser and bore down with it the tingling became a deep and monstrous itch She had to clutch her hands deep into the dirt on either side of her to keep from reaching up and clawing at the sore scratching it furiously and never mind if she tore it wide open and sent a pint of blood gushing down her deerskin shirt It be over in a few more seconds it have to be it have to be oh dear God please LET IT END Patrick meanwhile seemed to have forgotten all about her He was looking down at his picture his hair hanging to either side of his face and obscuring most of it completely absorbed by this wonderful new toy He erased delicately then a little harder the itch intensified then more softly again Susannah felt like shrieking That itch was suddenly everywhere It burned in her forebrain buzzed across the wet surfaces of her eyes like twin clouds of gnats it shivered at the very tips of her nipples making them hopelessly hard Ill scream I cant help it I have to scream She was drawing in her breath to do just that when suddenly the itch was gone The pain was gone as well She reached toward the side of her mouth then hesitated I dont dare You better dare Detta responded indignantly After all you been throughallvue been throughyou must have enough backbone left to touch yo own damn face you yella bitch She brought her fingers down to the skin The smooth skin The sore which had so troubled her since Thunderclap was gone She knew that when she looked in a mirror or a still pool of water she would not even see a scar FIFTEEN Patrick worked a little longerfirst with the eraser then with the pencil then with the eraser againbut Susannah felt no itch and not even a faint tingle It was as though once he had passed some critical point the sensations just ceased She wondered how old Patrick had been when Dandelo snipped all the erasers off the pencils Four Six Young anyway She was sure that his original look of puzzlement when she showed him one of the erasers had been unfeigned and yet once he began he used it like an old pro Maybe its like riding a bicycle she thought Once you learn how you never forget She waited as patiently as she could and after five very long minutes her patience was rewarded Smiling Patrick turned the pad around and showed her the picture He had erased the blemish completely and then faintly shaded the area so that it looked like the rest of her skin He had been careful to brush away every single crumb of rubber Very nice she said but that was a fairly shitty compliment to offer genius wasnt it So she leaned forward put her arms around him and kissed him firmly on the mouth Patrick its beautiful The blood rushed so quickly and so strongly into his face that she was alarmed at first wondering if he might not have stroke in spite of his youth But he was smiling as he held out the pad to her with one hand making tearing gestures again with the other Wanting her to take it Wanting her to have it Susannah tore it off very carefully wondering in a dark back corner of her mind what would happen if she tore ittore herright down the middle She noted as she did that there was no amazement in his face no astonishment no fear He had to have seen the sore beside her mouth because the nasty thing had pretty much dominated her face for all the time hed known her and he had drawn it in nearphotographic detail Now it was goneher exploring fingers told her soyet Patrick wasnt registering any emotion at least in regard to that The conclusion seemed clear enough When hed erased it from his drawing hed also erased it from his own mind and memory Patrick He looked at her smiling Happy that she was happy And Susannah was very happy The fact that she was also scared to death didnt change that in the slightest Will you draw something else for me He nodded Made a mark on his pad then turned it around so she could see She looked at the questionmark for a moment then at him She saw he was clutching the eraser his wonderful new tool very tightly Susannah said I want you to draw me something that isnt there He cocked his head quizzically to the side She had to smile a little in spite of her rapidly thumping heartOy looked that way sometimes when he wasnt a hundred per cent sure what you meant Dont worry Ill tell you And she did very carefully Patrick listened At some point Roland heard Susannahs voice and awoke He came over looked at her in the dim red light of the embering campfire started to look away then snapped back eyes widening Until that moment she hadnt been sure Roland would see what was no longer there either She thought it at least possible that Patricks magic would have been strong enough to erase it from the gunslingers memory too Susannah thy face Whats happened to thy Hush Roland if you love me The gunslinger hushed Susannah returned her attention to Patrick and began to speak again quietly but urgently Patrick listened and as he did she saw the light of understanding begin to enter his gaze Roland replenished the fire without having to be asked and soon their litde camp was bright under the stars Patrick wrote a question putting it thriftily to the left of the questionmark he had already drawn How tall Susannah took Roland by the elbow and positioned him in front of Patrick The gunslinger stood about sixfootthree She had him pick her up then held a hand roughly three inches over his head Patrick nodded smiling And look you at something that has to be on it she said and took a branch from their litde pile of brush She broke it over her knee creating a point of her own She could remember the symbols but it would be best if she didnt think about them overmuch She sensed they had to be absolutely right or die door she wanted him to make for her would either open on some place she didnt want to go or would not open at all Therefore once she began to draw in the mixed dirt and ash by the campfire she did it as rapidly as Patrick himself might have done not pausing long enough to cast her eye back upon a single symbol For if she looked back at one she would surely look back at all and she would see something that looked wrong to her and uncertainty would set in like a sickness Dettabrash foulmouthed Detta who had turned out on more than one occasion to be her saviormight step in and take over finish for her but she couldnt count on that On her hearts deepest level she still did not entirely trust Detta not to send everything to blazes at a crucial moment and for no other reason than the black joy of the thing Nor did she fully trust Roland who might want to keep her for reasons he did not fully understand himself So she drew quickly in the dirt and ashes not looking back and these were the symbols that flowed away beneath the flying tip of her makeshift implement Unfound Roland breathed Susannah whathow Hush she repeated Patrick bent over his pad and began to draw SIXTEEN She kept looking around for the door but the circle of light thrown by their fire was very small even after Roland had set it to blazing Small compared to the vast darkness of the prairie at least She saw nothing When she turned to Roland she could see the unspoken question in his eyes and so while Patrick kept working she showed him the picture of her the young man had drawn She indicated the place where the blemish had been Holding the page close to his face Roland at last saw the erasers marks Patrick had concealed what few traces hed left behind with great cunning and Roland had found them only with the closest scrutiny it was like casting for an old trail after many days of rain No wonder the old man cut off his erasers he said giving the picture back to her Thats what I thought From there she skipped ahead to her single true intuitive leap that if Patrick could in this world at least uncreate by erasing he might be able to create by drawing When she mentioned the herd of bannock that had seemed mysteriously closer Roland rubbed his forehead like a man who has a nasty headache I should have seen that Should have realized what it meant too Susannah Im getting old She ignored thatshed heard it beforeand told him about the dreams of Eddie and Jake being sure to mention the productnames on the sweatshirts the choral voices the offer of hot chocolate and the growing panic in their eyes as the nights passed and still she did not see what the dream had been sent to show her Why didnt you tell me this dream before now Roland asked Why didnt you ask for help in interpreting it She looked at him steadily thinking she had been right not to ask for his help Yesno matter how much that might hurt him Youve lost two How eager would you have been to lose me as well He flushed Even in the firelight she could see it Thee speaks ill of me Susannah and have thought worse Perhaps I have she said If so I say sorry I wasnt sure of what I wanted myself Part of me wants to see the Tower you know Part of me wants that very badly And even if Patrick can draw the Unfound Door into existence and I can open it its not the real world it opens on Thats what the names on the shirts mean Im sure of it You mustnt think that Roland said Reality is seldom a thing of black and white I think of is and isnt be and not be Patrick made a hooting sound and they both looked He was holding his pad up turned toward them so they could see what he had drawn It was a perfect representation of the Unfound Door she thought THE ARTIST wasnt printed on it and the doorknob was plain shiny metalno crossed pencils adorned itbut that was all right She hadnt bothered to tell him about those things which had been for her benefit and understanding They did everything but draw me a map she thought She wondered why everything had to be so damn hard so damn riddkdedum mysterious and knew that was a question to which she would never find a satisfactory answer except it was the human condition wasnt it The answers that mattered never came easily Patrick made another of those hooting noises This time it had an interrogative quality She suddenly realized that the poor kid was practically dying of anxiety and why not He had just executed his first commission and wanted to know what his patrono darte thought of it Its great Patrickterrific Yes Roland agreed taking the pad The door looked to him exactly like those hed found as he staggered along the beach of the Western Sea delirious and dying of the lobstrositys poisoned bite It was as if the poor tongueless creature had looked into his head and seen an actual picture of that doora fottergraff Susannah meanwhile was looking around desperately And when she began to swing along on her hands toward the edge of the firelight Roland had to call her back sharply reminding her that Mordred might be out there anywhere and the darkness was Mordreds friend Impatient as she was she retreated from the edge of the light remembering all too well what had happened to Mordreds bodymother and how quickly it had happened Yet it hurt to pull back almost physically Roland had told her that he expected to catch his first glimpse of the Dark Tower toward the end of the coming day If she was still with him if she saw it with him she thought its power might prove too strong for her Its glammer Now given a choice between the door and the Tower she knew she could still choose the door But as they drew closer and the power of the Tower grew stronger its pulse deeper and more compelling in her mind the singing voices ever sweeter choosing the door would be harder to do I dont see it she said despairingly Maybe I was wrong Maybe there is no damn door Oh Roland I dont think you were wrong Roland told her He spoke ih obvious reluctance but as a man will when he has ajob to do or a debt to repay And he did owe this woman a debt he reckoned for had he not pretty much seized her by the scruff of the neck and hauled her into this world where shed learned the art of murder and fallen in love and been left bereaved Had he not kidnapped her into this present sorrow If he could make that right he had an obligation to do so His desire to keep her with himand at the risk of her own lifewas pure selfishness and unworthy of his training More important than that it was unworthy of how much he had come to love and respect her It broke what remained of his heart to think of bidding her goodbye the last of his strange and wonderful katet but if it was what she wanted what she needed then he must do it And he thought he could do it for he had seen something about the young mans drawing that Susannah had missed Not something that was there something that wasnt Look thee he said gently showing her the picture Do you see how hard hes tried to please thee Susannah Yes she said Yes of course I do but It took him ten minutes to do this I should judge and most of his drawings good as they are are the work of three or four at most wouldnt you say I dont understand you She nearly screamed this Patrick drew Oy to him and wrapped an arm around the bumbler all the while looking at Susannah and Roland with wide unhappy eyes He worked so hard to give you what you want that theres only the Door It stands by itself all alone on the paper It has no no He searched for the right word Vannays ghost whispered it dryly into his ear It has no context For a moment Susannah continued to look puzzled and then the light of understanding began to break in her eyes Roland didnt wait he simply dropped his good left hand on Patricks shoulder and told him to put the door behind Susannahs little electric golfcart which she had taken to calling Ho Fat III Patrick was happy to oblige For one thing putting Ho Fat III in front of the door gave him a reason to use his eraser He worked much more quickly this timealmost carelessly an observer might have saidbut the gunslinger was sitting right next to him and didnt think Patrick missed a single stroke in his depiction of the little cart He finished by drawing its single front wheel and putting a reflected gleam of firelight in the hubcap Then he put his pencil down and as he did there was a disturbance in the air Roland felt it push against his face The flames of the fire which had been burning straight up in the windless dark streamed briefly sideways Then the feeling was gone The flames once more burned straight up And standing not ten feet from that fire behind the electric cart was a door Roland had last encountered in Calla Bryn Sturgis in the Cave of the Voices SEVENTEEN Susannah waited until dawn at first passing the time by gathering up her gunna then putting it aside againwhat would her few possessions not to mention the little hide bag in which they were stored avail her in New York City People would laugh They would probably laugh anyway or scream and run at the very sight of her The Susannah Dean who suddenly appeared in Central Park would look to most folks not like a college graduate or an heiress to a large fortune not even like Sheena Queen of the Jungle say sorry No to civilized city people shed probably look like some kind of freakshow escapee And once she went through this door would there be any going back Never Never in life So she put her gunna aside and simply waited As dawn began to show its first faint white light on the horizon she called Patrick over and asked him if he wanted to go along with her Back to the world you came from or one very much like it she told him although she knew he didnt remember that world at aUeither hed been taken from it too young or the trauma of being snatched away had erased his memory Patrick looked at her then at Roland who was squatted on his hunkers looking at him Either way son the gunslinger said You can draw in either world tell ya true Although where shes going therell be more to appreciate it He wants him to stay she thought and was angry Then Roland looked at her and gave his head a minute shake She wasnt sure but she thought that meant And no she didnt just think She knew what it meant Roland wanted her to know he was hiding his thoughts from Patrick His desires And while shed known the gunslinger to lie most spectacularly at the meeting on the Calla Bryn Sturgis commonground before the coming of the Wolves she had never known him to lie to her To Detta maybe but not to her Or Eddie Or Jake There had been times when he hadnt told them all he knew but outright lie No Theyd been katet and Roland had played them straight Give the devil his due Patrick suddenly took up his pad and wrote quickly on the clean sheet Then he showed it to them I will stay Scared to go sumplace new As if to emphasize exacdy what he meant he opened his lips and pointed into his tongueless mouth And did she see relief on Rolands face If so she hated him for it All right Patrick she said trying to show none of her feelings in her voice She even reached over and patted his hand I understand how you feel And while its true that people can be cruel cruel and mean theres plenty who are kind Listen thee Im not going until dawn If you change your mind the offer is open He nodded quickly Grateful Iaint goan try nohardert change his mine Detta thought angrily Ole white man probably grateful too Shut up Susannah told her and for a wonder Detta did EIGHTEEN Bvit as the day brightened revealing a mediumsized herd of grazing bannock not two miles away she let Detta back into her mind More she let Detta take over It was easier that way less painful It was Detta who took one more stroll around the campsite briskly breathing the last of this world for both of them and storing away the memory It was Detta who went around the door rocking first one way and then the other on the toughened pads of her palms and saw the nothing at all on the other side Patrick walked on one side of her Roland on the other Patrick hooted with surprise when he saw the door was gone Roland said nothing Oy walked up to the place where the door had been sniffed at the air and then walked through the place where it was if you were looking from the other side If we was over there Detta thought wed see him walk right through it like a magic trick She returned to Ho Fat III which she had decided to ride through the door Always assuming it would open that was This whole business would be quite a joke if it turned out it wouldnt Roland made to help her up into the seat she brushed him brusquely away and mounted on her own She pushed the red button beside the wheel and the carts electric motor started with a faint hum The needle marked CHG still swung well over into the green She turned the throttle on the right handlebar and rolled slowly toward the closed door with the symbols meaning UNFOUND marching across the front She stopped with the carts little bullet nose almost touching it She turned to the gunslinger with a fixed makebelieve smile All ri RolandAhll say gbye to you then Long days n pleasant nights May you reach ydamn Tower and No he said She looked at him Detta looked at him with her eyes both blazing and laughing Challenging him to turn this into something she didnt want it to be Challenging him to turn her out now that she was in Cmon honky white boy lessee you do it What she asked Whats on yo mine big boy Id not say goodbye to you like this after all this time he said What do you mean Only in Dettas angry burlesque it came out Whatchu mean You know She shook her head defiantly Doan For one thing he said taking her trailtoughened left hand gendy in his mutilated right one theres another who should have the choice to go or stay and Im not speaking of Patrick For a moment she didnt understand Then she looked down at a certain pair of goldringed eyes a certain pair of cocked ears and did She had forgotten about Oy If Detta asks him hell surely stay for shes never been to his liking If Susannah asks him why then I dont know Just like that Detta was gone She would be backSusannah understood now that she would never be entirely free of Detta Walker and that was all right because she no longer wanted to bebut for now she was gone Oy she said gendy Will you come with me honey It may be well find Jake again Maybe not quite the same but still Oy who had been almost completely silent during their trek across the Badlands and the White Lands of Empathica and the open rangelands now spoke Ake he said But he spoke doubtfully as one who barely remembers and her heart broke She had promised herself she wouldnt cry and Detta all but guaranteed she wouldnt cry but now Detta was gone and the tears were here again Jake she said You remember Jake honeybunch I know you do Jake and Eddie Ake Ed With a little more certainty now He did remember Come with me she urged and Oy started forward as if he would jump up in the cart beside her Then with no idea at all why she should say it she added There are other worlds than these Oy stopped as soon as the words were out of her mouth He sat down Then he got up again and she felt a moment of hope perhaps there could still be some little katet a dantetetet in some version of New York where folks drove Takuro Spirits and took pictures of each other drinking NozzALa with their Shinnaro cameras Instead Oy trotted back to the gunslinger and sat beside one battered boot They had walked far those boots far Miles and wheels wheels and miles But now their walking was almost done Olan said Oy and the finality in his strange little voice rolled a stone against her heart She turned bitterly to the old man with the big iron on his hip There she said You have your own glammer dont you Always did You drew Eddie on to one death and Jake to a pair of em Now Patrick and even the bumbler Are you happy No said he and she saw he truly was not She believed she had never seen such sadness and such loneliness on a human face Never was I farther from happy Susannah of New York Will you change your mind and stay Will thee come the last little while with me That would make me happy For a wild moment she thought she would That she would simply turn the litde electric cart from the doorwhich was onesided and made no promisesand go with him to the Dark Tower Another day would do it they could camp at midafternoon and thus arrive tomorrow at sunset as he wanted Then she remembered the dream The singing voices The young man holding out the cup of hot chocolatethe good kind mit schlag No she said softly Ill take my chance and go For a moment she thought he would make it easy on her just agree and let her go Then his angerno his despairbroke in a painful burst But you cant be sure Susannah what if the dream itself is a trick and a glammer What if the things you see even when the doors open are nothing but tricks and glammers What if you roll right through and into todash space Then Ill light the darkness with thoughts of those I love And that might work said he speaking in the bitterest voice she had ever heard For the first ten years or twenty or even a hundred And then What about the rest of eternity Think of Oy Do you think hes forgotten Jake Never Never Never in your life Never in his He senses something wrong Susannah dont I beg you dont go Ill get on my knees if that will help And to her horror he began to do exactly that It wont she said And if this is to be my last sight of youmy heart says it isthen dont let it be of you on your knees Youre not a kneeling man Roland son of Steven never were and I dont want to remember you that way I want to see you on your feet as you were in Calla Bryn Sturgis As you were with your friends at Jericho Hill He got up and came to her For a moment she thought he meant to restrain her by force and she was afraid But he only put his hand on her arm for a moment and then took it away Let me ask you again Susannah Are you sureT She conned her heart and saw that she was She understood the risks but yesshe was And why Because Rolands way was the way of the gun Rolands way was death for those who rode or walked beside him He had proved it over and over again since the earliest days of his questno even before since overhearing Hax the cook plotting treachery and thus assuring his death by the rope It was all for the good for what he called the White she had no doubt of it but Eddie still lay in his grave in one world and Jake in another She had no doubt that much the same fate was waiting for Oy and for poor Patrick Nor would their deaths be long in coming Im sure said she All right Will you give me a kiss She took him by the arm and pulled him down and put her lips on his When she inhaled she took in the breath of a thousand years and ten thousand miles And yes she tasted death But not for you gunslinger she thought For others but never for you May I escape your glammer and may I do fine She was the one who broke their kiss Can you open the door for me she asked Roland went to it and took the knob in his hand and the knob turned easily within his grip Cold air puffed out strong enough to blow Patricks long hair back and with it came a few flakes of snow She could see grass that was still green beneath light frost and a path and an iron fence Voices were singing What Child Is This just as in her dream It could be Central Park Yes it could be Central Park of some other world along the axis perhaps and not the one she came from but close enough so that in time she would know no difference Or perhaps it was as he said a glammer Perhaps it was the todash darkness It could be a trick he said most certainly reading her mind Life is a trick love a glammer she replied Perhaps well meet again in the clearing at the end of the path As you say so let it be so he told her He put out one leg the rundown heel of his boot planted in the earth and bowed to her Oy had begun to weep but he sat firmly beside the gunslingers left boot Goodbye my dear Goodbye Roland Then she faced ahead took in a deep breath and twisted the little carts throttle It rolled smoothly forward Wait Roland cried but she never turned nor looked at him again She rolled through the door It slammed shut behind her at once with a flat declamatory clap he knew all too well one hed dreamed of ever since his long and feverish walk along the edge of the Western Sea The sound of the singing was gone and now there was only the lonely sound of the prairie wind Roland of Gilead sat in front of the door which already looked tired and unimportant It would never open again He put his face in his hands It occurred to him that if he had never loved them he would never have felt so alone as this Yet of all his many regrets the reopening of his heart was not among them even now NINETEEN Laterbecause theres always a later isnt therehe made breakfast and forced himself to eat his share Patrick ate heartily then withdrew to do his necessary while Roland packed up There was a third plate and it was still full Oy Roland asked tipping it toward the billybumbler Willee not have at least a bite Oy looked at the plate then backed away two firm steps Roland nodded and tossed away the uneaten food scattering it into the grass Mayhap Mordred would come along in good time and find something to his liking At midmorning they moved on Roland pulling Ho Fat II and Patrick walking along beside with his head hung low And soon the beat of the Tower filled the gunslingers head again Very close now That steady pulsing power drove out all thoughts of Susannah and he was glad He gave himself to the steady beating and let it sweep away all his thoughts and all his sorrow Commalacomecome sang the Dark Tower now just over the horizon Commalacomecome gunslinger may ya come CommalacomeRoland the journeys nearly done ONE The dantete was watching when the longhaired fellow they were now traveling with grabbed Susannahs shoulder to point out the dancing orange hobs in the distance Mordred watched as she whirled pulling one of the White Daddys big revolvers For a moment the farseeing glass eyes hed found in the house on Odds Lane trembled in Mordreds hand that was how hard he was rooting for his Blackbird Mommy to shoot the Artist How the guilt would have bitten into her Like the blade of a dull hatchet yar It was even possible that overcome by the horror of what she had done shedve put the barrel of the gun to her own head and pulled the trigger a second time and how would Old White Daddy like waking up to that All children are such dreamers It didnt happen of course but there had been much more to watch Some of it was hard to see though Because it wasnt just excitement that made the binoculars tremble He was dressed warmly now in layers of Dandelos hume clothes but he was still cold Except when he was hot And either way hot or cold he trembled like a toothless old gaffer in a chimney corner This state of affairs had been growing gradually worse since he left Joe Collinss house behind Fever roared in his bones like a blizzard wind Mordred was no longer ahungry for Mordred no longer had an appetite but Mordred was asick asick asick In truth he was afraid Mordred might be adying Nonetheless he watched Rolands party with great interest and once the fire was replenished he saw even better Saw the door come into being although he could not read the symbols there writ upon He understood that the Artist had somehow drawn it into beingwhat a godlike talent that was Mordred longed to eat him just on the chance such a talent might be transmittable He doubted it the spiritual side of cannibalism was greatly overrated but what harm in seeing for ones self He watched their palaver He sawand also understoodher plea to the Artist and the Mutt her whining entreaties come with me so I dont have to go alone come on be a sport in fact be a couple of sports oh boohoo and rejoiced in her sorrow and fury when the plea was rejected by both boy and beast Mordred rejoiced even though he knew it would make his own job harder A little harder anyway how much trouble could a mute young man and a billybumbler really give him once he changed his shape and made his move For a moment he thought that in her anger she might shoot Old White Daddy with his own gun and that Mordred did mtf want Old White Daddy was meant to be his The voice from the Dark Tower had told him so Asick he surely was adying he might be but Old White Daddy was still meant to be his meal not the Blackbird Mommys Why shed leave the meat to rot without taking a single bite But she didnt shoot him Instead she kissedhim Mordred didnt want to see that it made him feel sicker than ever and so he put the binoculars aside He lay in the grass amid a little clump of alders trembling hot and cold trying not to puke he had spent the entire previous day puking and shitting it seemed until the muscles of his midsection ached with the strain of sending such heavy traffic in two directions at once and nothing came up his throat but thick mucusy strings and nothing out of his backside but brown stew and great hollow farts and when he looked through the binoculars again it was just in time to see the back end of the little electric cart disappear as the Blackbird Mommy drove it through the door Something swirled out around it Dust maybe but he thought snow There was also singing The sound of it made him feel almost as sick as seeing her kiss Old White Gunslinger Daddy Then the door slammed shut behind her and the singing was gone and the gunslinger just sat there near it with his face in his hands boohoo sobsob The bumbler went to him and put its long snout on one of his boots as if to offer comfort how sweet how puking sweet By then it was dawn and Mordred dozed a little When he woke up it was to the sound of Old White Daddys voice Mordreds hiding place was downwind and the words came to him clearly Oy Willee not have at least a bite The bumbler would not however and the gunslinger had scattered the food that had been meant for the little fvirry houken Later after they moved on Old White Gunslinger Daddy pulling the cart the robot had made for them plodding slowly along the ruts of Tower Road with his head down and his shoulders all aslump Mordred crept to the campsite He did indeed eat some of the scattered foodsurely it had not been poisoned if Roland had hoped it would go down the bumblers gulletbut he stopped after only three or four chunks of meat knowing that if he went on eating his guts would spew everything back out both north and south He couldnt have that If he didnt hold onto at least some nourishment he would be too weak to follow them And he must follow had to stay close a little while longer It would have to be tonight It would have to be because tomorrow Old White Daddy would reach the Dark Tower and then it would almost certainly be too late His heart told him so Mordred plodded as Roland had but even more slowly Every now and then he would double over as cramps seized him and his human shape wavered that blackness rising and receding under his skin his heavy coat bulging restlessly as the other legs tried to burst free then hanging slack again as he willed them back inside gritting his teeth and groaning with effort Once he shit a pint or so of stinky brown fluid in his pants and once he managed to get his trousers down and he cared little either way No one had invited him to the Reap Ball haha Invitation lost in the mail no doubt Later when it came time to attack he would let the little Red King free But if it happened now he was almost positive he wouldnt be able to change back again He wouldnt have the strength The spiders faster metabolism would fan the sickness the way a strong wind fans a low groundfire into a forestgobbling blaze What was killing him slowly would kill him rapidly instead So he fought it and by afternoon he felt a little better The pulse from the Tower was growing rapidly now growing in strength and urgency So was his Red Daddys voice urging him on urging him to stay within striking distance Old White Gunslinger Daddy had gotten no more than four hours sleep a night for weeks now because he had been standing watchandwatch with the nowdeparted Blackbird Mommy But Blackbird Mommy hadnt ever had to pull that cart had she No just rode in it like Queen Shit OTurd Hill did she hee Which meant Old White Gunslinger Daddy was plenty tired even with the pulse of the Dark Tower to buoy him up and pull him onward Tonight Old White Daddy would either have to depend on the Artist and die Mutt to stand the first watch or try to do the whole thing on his own Mordred thought he could stand one more wakeful night himself simply because he knew hed never have to have another He would creep close as he had the previous night He would watch their camp with the old manmonsters glass eyes for farseeing And when they were all asleep he would change for the last time and rush down upon them Scrabblededee comes me hee Old White Daddy might never even wake up but Mordred hoped he would At the very end Just long enough to realize what was happening to him Just long enough to know that his son was snatching him into the land of death only hours before he would have reached his precious Dark Tower Mordred clenched his fists and watched the fingers turn black He felt the terrible but pleasurable itching up the sides of his body as the spiderlegs tried to burst throughseven instead of eight thanks to the terriblenastyawful Blackbird Mommy who had been both preg and notpreg at the same time and might she rot screaming in todash space forever or at least until one of the Great Ones who lurked there found her He fought and encouraged the change with equal ferocity At last he only fought it and the urge to change subsided He gave out a victoryfart but although this one was long and smelly it was silent His asshole was now a broken squeezebox that could no longer make music but only gasp His fingers returned to their normal pinkishwhite shade and the itching up and down the sides of his body disappeared His head swam and slithered with fever his thin arms little more than sticks ached with chills The voice of his Red Daddy was sometimes loud and sometimes faint but it was always there Come to me Run to me Hie thy doubleton self Comecommala you good son of mine Well bring the Tower down well destroy all the light there is and then rule the darkness together Come to me Come TWO Surely those three who remained four counting himself had outrun kas umbrella Not since the Prim receded had there been such a creature as Mordred Deschain who was part hume and part of that rich and potent soup Surely such a creature could never have been meant by ka to die such a mundane death as the one that now threatened fever brought on by foodpoisoning Roland could have told him that eating what he found in the snow around to the side of Dandelos barn was a bad idea so could Robert Browning for that matter Wicked or not actual horse or not Lippy probably named after another and betterknown Browning poem called Fra Lippo Lippi had been a sick animal herself when Roland ended her life with a bullet to the head But Mordred had been in his spiderform when hed come upon the thing which at least looked like a horse and almost nothing would have stopped him from eating the meat It wasnt until hed resumed his human form again that he wondered uneasily how there could be so much meat on Dandelos bony old nag and why it had been so soft and warm so full of uncoagulated blood It had been in a snowdrift after all and had been lying there for some days The mares remains should have been frozen stiff Then the vomiting began The fever came next and with it the struggle not to change until he was close enough to his Old White Daddy to rip him limb from limb The being whose coming had been prophesied for thousands of years mostly by the Mannifolk and usually in frightened whispers the being who would grow to be halfhuman and halfgod the being who would oversee the end of humanity and the return of the Prim that being had finally arrived as a naive and badhearted child who was now dying from a bellyful of poisoned horsemeat Ka could have had no part in this THREE Roland and his two companions didnt make much progress on the day Susannah left them Even had he not planned to travel short miles so that they could come to the Tower at sunset of the day following Roland wouldnt have been able to go far He was disheartened lonely and tired almost to death Patrick was also tired but he at least could ride if he chose to and for most of that day he did so choose sometimes napping sometimes sketching sometimes walking a little while before climbing back into Ho Fat II and napping some more The pulse from the Tower was strong in Rolands head and heart and its song was powerful and lovely now seemingly composed of a thousand voices but not even these things could take the lead from his bones Then as he was looking for a shady spot where they could stop and eat a little midday meal by now it was actually midafternoon he saw something that momentarily made him forget both his weariness and his sorrow Growing by the side of the road was a wild rose seemingly the exact twin of the one in the vacant lot It bloomed in defiance of the season which Roland put as very early spring It was a light pink shade on the outside and darkened to a fierce red on the inside the exact color he thought of hearts desire He fell on his knees before it tipped his ear toward that coral cup and listened The rose was singing The weariness stayed as weariness will on this side of the grave at least but the loneliness and the sadness departed at least for a little while He peered into the heart of the rose and saw a yellow center so bright he couldnt look directly at it Gan s gateivay he thought not sure exactly what that was but positive that he was right Aye Gans gateway so it is This was unlike the rose in the vacant lot in one crucial way the feeling of sickness and the faint voices of discord were gone This one was rich with health as well as full of light and love It and all the others they they must They feed the Beams dont they With their songs and their perfume As the Beams feed them Its a living forcefield a giving and taking all spinning out from the Tower And this is only the first the farthest outrider In CanKa No Rey there are tens of thousands just like this The thought made him faint with amazement Then came another that filled him with anger and fear the only one with a view of that great red blanket was insane Would blight them all in an instant if allowed free rein to do so There was a hesitant tap on his shoulder It was Patrick with Oy at his heel Patrick pointed to the grassy area beside the rose then made eating gestures Pointed at the rose and made drawing motions Roland wasnt very hungry but the boys other idea pleased him a great deal Yes he said Well have a bite here then maybe Ill take me a little siesta while you draw the rose Will you make two pictures of it Patrick He showed the two remaining fingers on his right hand to make sure Patrick understood The young man frowned and cocked his head still not understanding His hair hung to one shoulder in a bright sheaf Roland thought of how Susannah had washed that hair in a stream in spite of Patricks hooted protests It was the sort of thing Roland himself would never have thought to do but it made the young fellow look a lot better Looking at that sheaf of shining hair made him miss Susannah in spite of the roses song She had brought grace to his life It wasnt a word that had occurred to him until she was gone Meanwhile here was Patrick wildly talented but awfully slow on the uptake Roland gestured to his pad then to the rose Patrick noddedthat part he got Then Roland raised two of the fingers on his good hand and pointed to the pad again This time the light broke on Patricks face He pointed to the rose to the pad to Roland and then to himself Thats right big boy Roland said A picture of the rose for you and one for me Its nice isnt it Patrick nodded enthusiastically setting to work while Roland rusded the grub Once again Roland fixed three plates and once again Oy refused his share When Roland looked into the bumblers goldringed eyes he saw an emptiness therea kind of lossthat hurt him deep inside And Oy couldnt stand to miss many meals he was far too thin already Trailfrayed Cuthbert would have said probably smiling In need of some hot sassafras and salts But the gunslinger had no sassy here Why doee look so Roland asked the bumbler crossly If ee wanted to go witfi her thee should have gone when thee had the chance Why willee cast thy sad houkens eyes on me now Oy looked at him a moment longer and Roland saw that he had hurt the little fellows feelings ridiculous but true Oy walked away little squiggle of tail drooping Roland felt like calling him back but that would have been more ridiculous yet would it not What plan did he have To apologize to a billybumbler He felt angry and ill at ease with himself feelings he had never suffered before hauling Eddie Susannah and Jake from Americaside into his life Before theyd come hed felt almost nothing and while that was a narrow way to live in some ways it wasnt so bad at least you didnt waste time wondering if you should apologize to animals for taking a high tone to them by the gods Roland hunkered by the rose leaning into the soothing power of its song and the blaze of lighthealthy lightfrom its center Then Patrick hooted at him gesturing for Roland to move away so he could see it and draw it This added to Rolands sense of dislocation and annoyance but he moved back without a word of protest He had after all asked Patrick to draw it hadnt he He thought of how if Susannah had been here their eyes would have met with amused understanding as the eyes of parents do over the antics of a small child But she wasnt here of course shed been the last of them and now she was gone too All right canee see howgit rosengaff a tweakit better he asked striving to sound comic and only sounding crosscross and tired Patrick at least didnt react to the harshness in the gunslingers tone probably didnt even ken what I said Roland thought The mute boy sat with his ankles crossed and his pad balanced on his thighs his halffinished plate of food set off to one side Dont get so busy you forget to eat that Roland said You mind me now He got another distracted nod for his pains and gave up Im going to snooze Patrick Itll be a long afternoon And an even longer night he added to himself and yet he had the same consolation as Mordred tonight would likely be the last He didnt know for sure what waited for him in the Dark Tower at the end of the field of roses but even if he managed to put paid to the Crimson King he felt quite sure that this was his last march He didnt believe he would ever leave CanKa No Rey and that was all right He was very tired And despite the power of the rose sad Roland of Gilead put an arm over his eyes and was asleep at once FOUR He didnt sleep for long before Patrick woke him with a childs enthusiasm to show him the first picture of the rose hed drawnthe sun suggested no more than ten minutes had passed fifteen at most Like all of his drawings this one had a queer power Patrick had captured the rose almost to the life even though he had nothing but a pencil to work with Still Roland would much have preferred another hours sleep to this exercise in art appreciation He nodded his approval thoughno more grouch and grump in the presence of such a lovely thing he promised himselfand Patrick smiled happy even with so little He tossed back the sheet and began drawing die rose again One picture for each of them just as Roland had asked Roland could have slept again but what was the point The mute boy would be done with the second picture in a matter of minutes and would only wake him again He went to Oy instead and stroked die bumblers dense fur something he rarely did Im sorry I spoke rough toee fella Roland said Will you not set me on with a word But Oy would not Fifteen minutes later Roland repacked the few things hed taken out of the cart spat into his palms and hoisted the handles again The cart was lighter now had to be but it felt heavier Of course its heavier he thought Its got my grief in it I pull it along with me everywhere I go so I do Soon Ho Fat II had Patrick Danville in it as well He crawled up made himself a litde nest and fell asleep almost at once Roland plodded on head down shadow growing longer at his heels Oy walked beside him One more night the gunslinger thought One more night one more day to follow and then its done One way or t other He let the pulse of the Tower and its many singing voices fill his head and lighten his heels at least a little There were more roses now dozens scattered on either side of the road and brightening the otherwise dull countryside A few were growing in the road itself and he was careful to detour around them Tired though he might be he would not crush a single one or roll a wheel over a single fallen petal FIVE He stopped for the night while the sun was still well above the horizon too weary to go farther even though there would be at least another two hours of daylight Here was a stream that had gone dry but in its bed grew a riot of those beautiful wild roses Their songs didnt diminish his weariness but they revived his spirit to some extent He thought this was true for Patrick and Oy as well and that was good When Patrick had awakened hed looked around eagerly at first Then his face had darkened and Roland knew he was realizing all over again that Susannah was gone The boy had cried a little then but perhaps there would be no crying here There was a grove of cottonwood trees on the bankat least the gunslinger thought they were cottonwoodsbut they had died when the stream from which their roots drank had disappeared Now their branches were only bony leafless snarls against the sky In their silhouettes he could make out the number nineteen over and over again in both the figures of Susannahs world and those of his own In one place the branches seemed to clearly spell the word CHASSTT against the deepening sky Before making a fire and cooking them an early suppercanned goods from Dandelos pantry would do well enough tonight he reckonedRoland went into the dry streambed and smelled the roses strolling slowly among the dead trees and listening to their song Both the smell and the sound were refreshing Feeling a little better he gathered wood from beneath the trees snapping off a few of the lower branches for good measure leaving dry splintered stumps that reminded him a little of Patricks pencils and piled kindling in the center Then he struck a light speaking the old catechism almost without hearing it Sparkadark whos my sire Will I lay me Will I stay me Bless this camp with fire While he waited for the fire to first grow and then die down to a bed of rosy embers Roland took out the watch he had been given in New York Yesterday it had stopped although he had been assured the battery that ran it would last for fifty years Now as late afternoon faded to evening die hands had very slowly begun to move backward He looked at this for a little while fascinated then closed the cover and looked at the siguls inscribed there key and rose and Tower A faint and eldritch blue light had begun to gleam from the windows that spiraled upward They didnt know it would do that he thought and then put the watch carefully back in his lefthand front pocket checking first as he always did that there was no hole for it to fall through Then he cooked He and Patrick ate well Oy would touch not a single bite SIX Other than the night he had spent in palaver with the man in blackthe night during which Walter had read a bleak fortune from an undoubtedly stacked deckthose twelve hours of dark by the dry stream were the longest of Rolands life The weariness settled over him ever deeper and darker until it felt like a cloak of stones Old faces and old places marched in front of his heavy eyes Susan riding hellbent across the Drop with her blond hair flying out behind Cuthbert running down the side of Jericho Hill in much the same fashion screaming and laughing Alain Johns raising a glass in a toast Eddie and Jake wrestiing in the grass yelling while Oy danced around them barking Mordred was somewhere out there and close yet again and again Roland found himself drifting toward sleep Each time he jerked himself awake staring around wildly into the dark he knew he had come nearer to the edge of unconsciousness Each time he expected to see the spider with the red mark on its belly bearing down on him and saw nothing but the hobs dancing orange in the distance Heard nothing but the sough of die wind But he waits He bides And if I sleepwhen I sleephell be on us Around three in the morning he roused himself by willpower alone from a doze that was on the very verge of tumbling him into deeper sleep He looked around desperately rubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms hard enough to make mirks and fouders and sankofites explode across his field of vision The fire had burned very low Patrick lay about twenty feet from it at the twisted base of a cottonwood tree From where Roland sat the boy was no more than a hidecovered hump Of Oy there was no immediate sign Roland called to the bumbler and got no response The gunslinger was about to try his feet when he saw Jakes old friend a little beyond the edge of the failing firelightor at least the gleam of his goldringed eyes Those eyes looked at Roland for a moment then disappeared probably when Oy put his snout back down on his paws Hes tired too Roland thought and why not The question of what would become of Oy after tomorrow tried to rise to the surface of the gunslingers troubled tired mind and Roland pushed it away He got up in his weariness his hands slipped down to his formerly troublesome hip as if expecting to find the pain still there went to Patrick and shook him awake It took some doing but at last the boys eyes opened That wasnt good enough for Roland He grasped Patricks shoulders and pulled him up to a sitting position When the boy tried to slump back down again Roland shook him Hard He looked at Roland with dazed incomprehension Help me build up the fire Patrick Doing that should wake him up at least a little And once the fire was burning bright again Patrick would have to stand a brief watch Roland didnt like the idea knew full well that leaving Patrick in charge of the night would be dangerous but trying to watch the rest of it on his own would be even more dangerous He needed sleep An hour or two would be enough and surely Patrick could stay awake that long Patrick was willing enough to gather up some sticks and put them on the fire although he moved like a bougiea reanimated corpse And when the fire was blazing he slumped back down in his former place with his arms between his bony knees already more asleep than awake Roland thought he might actually have to slap the boy to bring him around and would later wishbitterlythat he had done just that Patrick listen to me He shook Patrick by the shoulders hard enough to make his long hair fly but some of it flopped back into his eyes Roland brushed it away I need you to stay awake and watch Just for an hourjust until look up Patrick Look Gods dont you dare go to sleep on me again Do you see that The brightest star of all those close to us It was Old Mother Roland was pointing to and Patrick nodded at once There was a gleam of interest in his eye now and the gunslinger thought that was encouraging It was Patricks I want to draw look And if he sat drawing Old Mother as she shone in the widest fork of the biggest dead cottonwood then the chances were good that hed stay awake Maybe until dawn if he got fully involved Here Patrick He made the boy sit against the base of the tree It was bony and knobby andRoland hopeduncomfortable enough to prohibit sleep All these movements felt to Roland like the sort you made underwater Oh he was tired So tired Do you still see the star Patrick nodded eagerly He seemed to have thrown off his sleepiness and the gunslinger thanked the gods for this favor When it goes behind that thick branch and you cant see it or draw it anymore without getting up you call me Wake me up no matter how hard it is Do you understand Patrick nodded at once but Roland had now traveled with him long enough to know that such a nod meant little or nothing Eager to please thats what he was If you asked him if nine and nine made nineteen he would nod with the same instant enthusiasm When you cant see it anymore from where youre sitting His own words seemed to be coming from far away now Hed just have to hope that Patrick understood The tongueless boy had taken out his pad at least and a freshly sharpened pencil Thats my best protection Rolands mind muttered as he stumbled back to his little pile of hides between the campfire and Ho Fat II He ivontfall asleep while hes drawing will he He hoped not but supposed he didnt really know And it didnt matter because he Roland of Gilead was going to sleep in any case Hed done the best he could and it would have to be enough An hour he muttered and his voice was far and wee in his own ears Wake me in an hour when the star when Old Mother goes behind But Roland was unable to finish He didnt even know what he was saying anymore Exhaustion grabbed him and bore him swifdy away into dreamless sleep SEVEN Mordred saw it all through the farseeing glass eyes His fever had soared and in its bright flame his own exhaustion had at least temporarily departed He watched with avid interest as the gunslinger woke the mute boythe Artistand bullied him into helping him build up the fire He watched rooting for the mute to finish this chore and then go back to sleep before the gunslinger could stop him That didnt happen unfortunately They had camped near a grove of dead cottonwoods and Roland led the Artist to the biggest tree Here he pointed up at the sky It was strewn with stars but Mordred reckoned Old White Gunslinger Daddy was pointing to Old Mother because she was the brightest At last the Artist who didnt seem to be rolling a full barrow at least not in the brains department seemed to understand He got out his pad and had already set to sketching as Old White Daddy stumbled a little way off still muttering instructions and orders to which the Artist was pretty clearly paying absolutely no attention at all Old White Daddy collapsed so suddenly that for a moment Mordred feared that perhaps the strip of jerky that served the son of a bitch as a heart had finally given up beating Then Roland stirred in the grass resetding himself and Mordred lying on a knoll about ninety yards west of the dry streambed felt his own heartbeat slow And deep though the Old White Gunslinger Daddys exhaustion might be his training and his long lineage going all the way back to the Eld himself would be enough to wake him with his gun in his hand the second the Artist gave one of his wordless but devilishly loud cries Cramps seized Mordred the deepest yet He doubled over fighting to hold his human shape fighting not to scream fighting not to die He heard another of those long flabbering noises from below and felt more of the lumpy brown stew begin coursing down his legs But his preternaturally keen nose smelled more than excreta in this new mess this time he smelled blood as well as shit He thought the pain would never end that it would go on deepening until it tore him in two but at last it began to let up His looked at his left hand and was not entirely surprised to see that the fingers had blackened and fused together They would never come back to human again those fingers he believed he had but only one more change left in him Mordred wiped sweat from his brow with his right hand and raised the bindoculars to his eyes again praying to his Red Daddy that the stupid mutie boy would be asleep But he was not He was leaning against the cottonwood tree and looking up between the branches and drawing Old Mother That was the moment when Mordred Deschain came closest to despair like Roland he thought drawing was the one thing that would likely keep the idiot boy awake Therefore why not give in to the change while he had the heat of this latest feverspike to fuel him with its destructive energy Why not take his chance It was Roland he wanted after all not the boy surely he could in his spider form sweep down on the gunslinger rapidly enough to grab him and pull him against the spiders craving mouth Old White Daddy might get off one shot possibly even two but Mordred thought he could take one or two if the flying bits of lead didnt find the white node on the spiders back his dual bodys brain And once I pull him in Ill never let him go until hes sucked dry nothing but a dustmummy like the other one Mia He relaxed ready to let the change sweep over him and then another voice spoke from the center of his mind It was the voice of his Red Daddy the one who was imprisoned on the side of the Dark Tower and needed Mordred alive at least one more day in order to set him free Wait a little longer this voice counseled Wait a little more I might have another trick up my sleeve Wait wait just a little longer Mordred waited And after a moment or two he felt the pulse from the Dark Tower change EIGHT Patrick felt that change too The pulse became soothing And there were words in it ones that blunted his eagerness to draw He made another line paused then put his pencil aside and only looked up at Old Mother who seemed to pulse in time with the words he heard in his head words Roland would have recognized Only these were sung in an old mans voice quavering but sweet Babybunting darling one Now another day is done May your dreams be sweet and merry May you dream of fields and berries Babybunting babydear Baby bring your berries here Oh chussit chissit chassit Bring enough to fill your basket Patricks head nodded His eyes closed opened slipped closed again Enough to fill my basket he thought and slept in the firelight NINE Now my good son whispered the cold voice in the middle of Mordreds hot and melting brains Now Go to him and make sure he never rises from his sleep Murder him among the mses and well rule together Mordred came from hiding the binoculars tumbling from a hand that was no longer a hand at all As he changed a feeling of huge confidence swept through him In another minute it would be done They both slept and diere was no way he could fail He rushed down on the camp and the sleeping men a black nightmare on seven legs his mouth opening and closing TEN Somewhere a thousand miles away Roland heard barking loud and urgent furious and savage His exhausted mind tried to turn away from it to blot it out and go deeper Then there was a horrible scream of agony that awoke him in a flash He knew that voice even as distorted by pain as it was Oy he cried leaping up Oy where are you To me To m There he was twisting in the spiders grip Bodi of them were clearly visible in the light of the fire Beyond them sitting propped against the cottonwood tree Patrick gazed stupidly through a curtain of hair that would soon be dirty again now that Susannah was gone The bumbler wriggled furiously to and fro snapping at the spiders body with foam flying from his jaws even as Mordred bent him in a direction his back was never meant to go If hed not rushed out of the tall grass Roland thought that would be me in Mordreds grip Oy sent his teeth deep into one of the spiders legs In the firelight Roland could see the coinsized dimples of the bumblers jawmuscles as he chewed deeper still The thing squalled and its grip loosened At that moment Oy might have gotten free had he chosen to do so He did not Instead of jumping down and leaping away in the momentary freedom granted him before Mordred was able to reset his grip Oy used the time to extend his long neck and seize the place where one of the things legs joined its bloated body He bit deep bringing a flood of blackishred liquor that ran freely from the sides of his muzzle In the firelight it gleamed with orange sparks Mordred squalled louder still He had left Oy out of his calculations and was now paying the price In the firelight the two writhing forms were figures out of a nightmare Somewhere nearby Patrick was hooting in terror Worthless whoreson fell asleep after all Roland thought bitterly But who had set him to watch in the first place Put him down Mordred he shouted Put him down and Ill let you live another day I swear it on my fathers name Red eyes full of insanity and malevolence peered at him over Oys contorted body Above them high on the curve of the spiders back were tiny blue eyes hardly more than pinholes They stared at the gunslinger with a hate that was all too human My own eyes Roland thovight with dismay and then there was a bitter crack It was Oys spine but in spite of this mortal injury he never loosened his grip on the joint where Mordreds legjoined his body although the steely brisdes had torn away much of his muzzle baring sharp teeth that had sometimes closed on Jakes wrist with gentle affection tugging him toward something Oy wanted the boy to see Akehe would cry on such occasions AkeAke Rolands right hand dropped to his holster and found it empty It was only then hours after she had taken her leave that he realized Susannah had taken one of his guns with her into the other world Good he thought Good If it is the darkness she found there would have been five for the things in it and one for herself Good But this thought was also dim and distant He pulled the other revolver as Mordred crouched on his hindquarters and used his remaining middle leg curling it around Oys midsection and pulling the animal still snarling away from his torn and bleeding leg The spider twirled the furry body upward in a terrible spiral For a moment it blotted out the bright beacon that was Old Mother Then he hurled Oy away from him and Roland had a moment of deja vu realizing he had seen this long ago in the Wizards Glass Oy arced across the fireshot dark and was impaled on one of the cottonwood branches the gunslinger himself had broken off for firewood He gave an awful hurt crya deathcryand then hung suspended and limp above Patricks head Mordred came at Roland without a pause but his charge was a slow shambling thing one of his legs had been shot away only minutes after his birth and now another hung limp and broken its pincers jerking spasmodically as they dragged on the grass Rolands eye had never been clearer the chill that surrounded him at moments like this never deeper He saw the white node and the blue bombardiers eyes that were his eyes He saw the face of his only son peering over the back of the abomination and then it was gone in a spray of blood as his first bullet tore it off The spider reared up legs clashing at the black and starshot sky Rolands next two bullets went into its revealed belly and exited through the back pulling dark sprays of liquid with it The spider slewed to one side perhaps trying to run away but its remaining legs would not support it Mordred Deschain fell into the fire casting up a flume of red and orange sparks It writhed in the embers the bristles on its belly beginning to burn and Roland grinning bitterly shot it again The dying spider rolled out of the now scattered fire on its back its remaining legs twitching together in a knot and then spreading apart One fell back into the fire and began to burn The smell was atrocious Roland started forward meaning to stamp out the litde fires the scattered embers had started in the grass and then a howl of outraged fury rose in his head My son My only son You ve murdered him He was mine too Roland said looking at die smoldering monstrosity He could own the truth Yes he could do that much Come then Come sonkiller and look at your Tower but know ihisyoull die of old age at the edge of the CanKa before you ever so much as touch its door I will never let you pass Todash space itself will pass away before I let you pass Murderer Murderer of your mother murderer of your friendsaye every one for Susannah lies dead with her throat cut on the other side of the door you sent her throughand now murderer of your own son Who sent him to me Roland asked the voice in his head Who sent yonder childfor thats what he is inside that black skinto his death ye red boggart To this there was no answer so Roland reholstered his gun and put out the patches of fire before they could spread He thought of what the voice had said about Susannah decided he didnt believe it She might be dead aye might be but he thought Mordreds Red Father knew for sure no more than Roland himself did The gunslinger let that thought go and went to the tree where the last of his katet hung impaled but still alive The goldringed eyes looked at Roland with what might almost have been weary amusement Oy Roland said stretching out his hand knowing it might be bitten and not caring in the least He supposed that part of himand not a small one eitherwanted to be bitten Oy we all say thank you say thank you Oy The bumbler did not bite and spoke but one word Olan said he Then he sighed licked the gunslingers hand a single time hung his head down and died ELEVEN As dawn strengthened into the clear light of morning Patrick came hesitantly to where the gunslinger sat in the dry streambed amid the roses with Oys body spread across his lap like a stole The young man made a soft interrogative hooting sound Not now Patrick Roland said absently stroking Oys fur It was dense but smooth to the touch He found it hard to believe that the creature beneath it had gone in spite of the stiffening muscles and the tangled places where the blood had now clotted He combed these smooth with his fingers as best he could Not now We have all the livelong day to get there and well do fine No there was no need to hurry no reason why he should not leisurely mourn the last of his dead There had been no doubt in the old Kings voice when he had promised that Roland should die of old age before he so much as touched the door in the Towers base They would go of course and Roland would study the terrain but he knew even now that his idea of coming to the Tower on the old monsters blind side and then working his way around was not an idea at all but a fools hope There had been no doubt in the old villains voice no doubt hiding behind it either And for the time being none of that mattered Here was another one he had killed and if there was consolation to be had it was this Oy would be the last Now he was alone again except for Patrick and Roland had an idea Patrick was immune to the terrible germ the gunslinger carried for he had never been katet to begin with I only kill my family Roland thought stroking the dead billybumbler What hurt most was remembering how unpleasantly he had spoken to Oy the day before Ifee wanted to go with her thee should have gone when thee had thy chance Had he stayed because he knew that Roland would need him That when push came down to shove it was Eddies phrase of course Patrick would fail Why willee cast thy sad houken s eyes on me now Because he had known it was to be his last day and his dying would be hard I think you knew both things Roland said and closed his eyes so he could feel the fur beneath his hands better Im so sorry I spoke toee sowould give the fingers on my good left hand if I could take the words back So I would every one say true But here as in the Keystone World time only ran one way Done was done There would be no taking back Roland would have said there was no anger left that every bit of it had been burned away but when he felt the tingling all over his skin and understood what it meant he felt fresh fury rise in his heart And he felt the coldness settle into his tired but still talented hands Patrick was drawing him Sitting beneath the cottonwoodjust as if a brave little creature worth ten of himno a hundredhadnt died in that very tree and for both of them Its his way Susannah spoke up calmly and gently from deep in his mind Its all he has everything else has been taken from himhis home world as well as his mother and his tongue and whatever brains he might once have had Hes mourning too Roland Hes frightened too This is the only way he has of soothing himself Undoubtedly all true But the truth of it actually fed his rage instead of damping it down He put his remaining gun aside it lay gleaming between two of the singing roses because having it close to hand wouldnt do no not in his current mood Then he rose to his feet meaning to give Patrick the scolding of his life if for no other reason than it would make Roland feel a little bit better himself He could already hear the first words Do you enjoy drawing those who saved your mostly worthless life stupid boy Does it cheer your heart He was opening his mouth to begin when Patrick put his pencil down and seized his new toy instead The eraser was halfgone now and there were no others as well as Rolands gun Susannah had taken the little pink nubbins with her probably for no other reason than that shed been carrying the jar in her pocket and her mind had been studying other more important matters Patrick poised the eraser over his drawing then looked upperhaps to make sure he really wanted to erase at alland saw the gunslinger standing in the streambed and frowning at him Patrick knew immediately that Roland was angry although he probably had no idea under heaven as to why and his face cramped with fear and unhappiness Roland saw him now as Dandelo must have seen him time and time again and his anger collapsed at the thought He would not have Patrick fear himfor Susannahs sake if not his own he would not have Patrick fear him And discovered that it was for his own sake after all Why not kill him then asked the sly pulsing voice in his head Kill him and put him out of his misery if thee feels so tender toward him He and the bumbler can enter the clearing together They can make a place there for you gunslinger Roland shook his head and tried to smile Nay Patrick son of Sonia he said for that was how Bill the robot had called the boy Nay I was wrongagainand will not scold thee But He walked to where Patrick was sitting Patrick cringed away from him with a doglike placatory smile that made Roland angry all over again but he quashed the emotion easily enough this time Patrick had loved Oy too and this was the only way he had of dealing with his sorrow Little that mattered to Roland now He reached down and gently plucked the eraser out of the boys fingers Patrick looked at him questioningly then reached out his empty hand asking with his eyes that the wonderful and useful new toy be given back Nay Roland said as gently as he could You made do for the gods only know how many years without ever knowing such things existed you can make do the rest of this one day I think Mayhap therell be something for you to drawand then undrawlater on Doee ken Patrick Patrick did not but once the eraser was safely deposited in Rolands pocket along with the watch he seemed to forget about it and just went back to his drawing Put thy picture aside for a little too Roland told him Patrick did so without argument He pointed first to the cart then to the Tower Road and made his interrogative hooting sound Aye Roland said but first we should see what Mordred had for gunnathere may be something useful thereand bury our friend Willee help me see Oy into the ground Patrick Patrick was willing and the burial didnt take long the body was far smaller than the heart it had held By midmorning they had begun to cover the last few miles on the long road which led to the Dark Tower ONE The road and the tale have both been long would you not say so The trip has been long and the cost has been high but no great thing was ever attained easily A long tale like a tall Tower must be built a stone at a time Now however as the end draws closer you must mark yon two travelers walking toward us with great care The older manhe with the tanned lined face and the gun on his hipis pulling the cart they call Ho Fat II The younger onehe with the oversized drawing pad tucked under his arm that makes him look like a student in days of oldis walking along beside it They are climbing a long gently upsloping hill not much different from hundreds of others they have climbed The overgrown road they follow is lined on either side with the remains of rock walls wild roses grow in amiable profusion amid die tumbles of fieldstone In the open brushdotted land beyond these fallen walls are strange stone edifices Some look like the ruins of castles others have the appearance of Egyptian obelisks a few are clearly Speaking Rings of the sort where demons may be summoned one ancient ruin of stone pillars and plinths has the look of Stonehenge One almost expects to see hooded Druids gathered in the center of that great circle perhaps casting die runes but the keepers of these monuments these precursors of the Great Monument are all gone Only small herds of bannock graze where once they worshipped Never mind Its not old ruins weve come to observe near the end of our long journey but the old gunslinger pulling the handles of the cart We stand at the crest of the hill and wait as he comes toward us He comes And comes Relendess as ever a man who always learns to speak the language of the land at least some of it and die customs of the country he is still a man who would straighten pictures in strange hotel rooms Much about him has changed but not that He crests the hill so close to us now that we can smell the sour tang of his sweat He looks up a quick and automatic glance he shoots first ahead and then to either side as he tops any hillAlways conyer vantagewas Corts rule and the last of his pupils has still not forgotten it He looks up without interest looks down and stops After a moment of staring at the broken weedinfested paving of the road he looks up again more slowly this time Much more slowly As if in dread of what he thinks he has seen And its here we mustjoin himsink into himalthough how we will ever con the vantage of Rolands heart at such a moment as this when the singleminded goal of his lifetime at last comes in sight is more than this poor excuse for a storyman can ever tell Some moments are beyond imagination Roland glanced up quickly as he topped the hill not because he expected trouble but because the habit was too deeply ingrained to break Always con yer vantage Cort had told them drilling it into their heads from the time when they had been litde more than babbies He looked back down at the roadit was becoming more and more difficult to swerve among the roses without crushing any although he had managed the trick so farand then belatedly realized what he had just seen What you thought you saw Roland told himself still looking down at the road Its probably just another of the strange ruins weve been passing ever since we started moving again But even then Roland knew it wasnt so What hed seen was not to either side of the Tower Road but dead ahead He looked up again hearing his neck creak like hinges in an old door and there still miles ahead but now visible on the horizon real as roses was the top of the Dark Tower That which he had seen in a thousand dreams he now saw with his living eyes Sixty or eighty yards ahead the road rose to a higher hill with an ancient Speaking Ring moldering in the ivy and honeysuckle on one side and a grove of ironwood trees on the other At the center of this near horizon the black shape rose in the near distance blotting out a tiny portion of the blue sky Patrick came to a stop beside Roland and made one of his hooting sounds Do you see it Roland asked His voice was dusty cracked with amazement Then before Patrick could answer the gunslinger pointed to what the boy wore around his neck In the end the binoculars had been the only item in Mordreds little bit of gunna worth taking Give them over Pat Patrick did willingly enough Roland raised them to his eyes made a minute adjustment to the knurled focus knob and then caught his breath as the top of the Tower sprang into view seemingly close enough to touch How much was visible over the horizon How much was he looking at Twenty feet Perhaps as much as fifty He didnt know but he could see at least three of the narrow slitwindows which ascended the Towers barrel in a spiral and he could see the oriel window at the top its many colors blazing in the spring sunshine the black center seeming to peer back down the binoculars at him like the very Eye of Todash Patrick hooted and held out a hand for the binoculars He wanted his own look and Roland handed the glasses over without a murmur He felt lightheaded not really there It occurred to him that he had sometimes felt like that in the weeks before his battle with Cort as though he were a dream or a moonbeam He had sensed something coming some vast change and that was what he felt now Yonder it is he thought Yonder is my destiny the end of my lifes road And yet my heart still beats a little faster than before tis true my blood still courses and no doubt when I bend over to grasp the handies of this becurst cart my back will groan and I may pass a little gas Nothing at all has changed He waited for the disappointment this thought surely presagedthe letdown It didnt come What he felt instead was a queer soaring brightness that seemed to begin in his mind and then spread to his muscles For the first time since setting out at midmorning thoughts of Oy and Susannah left his mind He felt free Patrick lowered the binoculars When he turned to Roland his face was excited He pointed to the black thumb jutting above the horizon and hooted Yes Roland said Someday in some world some version of you will paint it along with Llamrei Arthur Elds horse That I know for Ive seen the proof As for now its where we must go Patrick hooted again then pulled a long face He put his hands to his temples and swayed his head back and forth like someone who has a terrible headache Yes Roland said Im afraid too But theres no help for it I have to go there Would you stay here Patrick Stay and wait for me If you would I give you leave to do so Patrick shook his head at once And just in case Roland didnt take the point the mute boy seized his arm in a hard grip The right hand the one with which he drew was like iron Roland nodded Even tried to smile Yes he said thats fine Stay with me as long as you like As long as you understand that in the end Ill have to go on alone THREE Now as they rose from each dip and topped each hill the Dark Tower seemed to spring closer More of the spiraling windows which ran around its great circumference became visible Roland could see two steel posts jutting from the top The clouds which followed the Paths of the two working Beams seemed to flow away from the tips making a great Xshape in the sky The voices grew louder and Roland realized they were singing the names of the world Of all the worlds He didnt know how he could know that but he was sure of it That lightness of being continued to fill him up Finally as they crested a hill with great stone men marching away to the north on their left the remains of their faces painted in some bloodred stuff glared down upon them Roland told Patrick to climb up into the cart Patrick looked surprised He made a series of hooting noises Roland took to mean But arentyou tired Yes but I need an anchor even so Without one Im apt to start running toward yonder Tower even though part of me knows better And if plain old exhaustion doesnt burst my heart the Red Kings apt to take my head off with one of his toys Get in Patrick Patrick did so He rode sitting hunched forward with the binoculars pressed against his eyes FOUR Three hours later they came to the foot of a much steeper hill It was Rolands heart told him the last hill CanKa No Rey was beyond At the top on the right was a cairn of boulders that had once been a small pyramid What remained stood about thirty feet high Roses grew around its base in a rough crimson ring Roland set this in his sights and took the hill slowly pulling the cart by its handles As he climbed the top of the Dark Tower once more appeared Each step brought a greater length of it into view Now he could see the balconies with their waisthigh railings There was no need of the binoculars the air was preternaturally clear He put the distance remaining at no more than five miles Perhaps only three Level after level rose before his notquitedisbelieving eye Just shy of this hills top with the crumbling rock pyramid twenty paces ahead of them on the right Roland stopped bent and set the handles of the cart on the road for the last time Every nerve in his body spoke of danger Patrick Hop down Patrick did so looking anxiously into Rolands face and hooting The gunslinger shook his head I cant say why just yet Only its not safe The voices sang in a great chorus but the air around them was still Not a bird soared overhead or sang in the distance The wandering herds of bannock had all been left behind A breeze soughed around them and the grasses rippled The roses nodded their wild heads The two of them walked on together and as they did Roland felt a timid touch against the side of his twofingered right hand He looked at Patrick The mute boy looked anxiously back trying to smile Roland took his hand and they crested the hill in that fashion Below them was a great blanket of red that stretched to the horizon in every direction The road cut through it a dusty white line perfectly straight and perhaps twelve feet wide In the middle of the rosefield stood the sooty dark gray Tower just as it had stood in his dreams its windows gleamed in the sun Here the road split and made a perfect white circle around the Towers base to continue on the other side in a direction Roland believed was now dead east instead of southbyeast Another road ran off at right angles to the Tower Road to the north and south if he was right in believing that the points of the compass had been reestablished From above the Dark Tower would look like the center of a bloodfilled gunsight Its Roland began and then a great crazed shriek floated to them on the breeze weirdly undiminished by the distance of miles It comes on the Beam Roland thought And its carried by the roses GUNSLINGERscreamed the Crimson King NOW YOU DIE There was a whisding sound thin at first and then growing cutting through the combined song of the Tower and die roses like the keenest blade ever ground on a wheel dusted with diamonds Patrick stood transfixed peering dumbly at the Tower he would have been blown out of his boots if not for Roland whose reflexes were as quick as ever He pulled the mute boy behind die heaped stone of the pyramid by their joined hands There were other stones hidden in the high grass of dock and jimson they stumbled over these and went sprawling Roland felt the corner of one digging painfully into his ribs The whistle continued to rise becoming an earsplitting whine Roland saw a golden something flash past in the airone of the sneetches It struck the cart and it blew up scattering their gunna every which way Most of the stuff settled back to the road cans rattling and bouncing some of them burst Then came high chattering laughter that set Rolands teeth on edge beside him Patrick covered his ears The lunacy in that laughter was almost unbearable COME OUT urged that distant mad laughing voice COME OUT AND PLAY ROLAND COME TO ME COME TO YOUR TOWR AFTER ALL THE LONG YEARS WILL YOU NOT Patrick looked at him his eyes desperate and frightened He was holding his drawing pad against his chest like a shield Roland peered carefully around the edge of the pyramid and there on a balcony two levels up from the Towers base he saw exactly what he had seen in sai Sayres painting one blob of red and three blobs of white a face and two upraised hands But this was no painting and one of the hands moved rapidly forward in a throwing gesture and there came another hellish rising whine Roland rolled back against the tumble of the pyramid There was a pause that seemed endless and then the sneetch struck the pyramids other side and exploded The concussion threw them forward onto their faces Patrick screamed in terror Rocks flew to either side in a spray Some of them rattled down on the road but Roland saw not a single piece of shrapnel strike so much as a single rose The boy scrambled to his knees and would have runlikely back into the roadbut Roland grabbed him by the collar of his hide coat and yanked him down again Were safe enough here he murmured to Patrick Look He reached into a hole revealed by the falling rock knocked on the interior with his knuckles produced a dull ringing noise and showed his teeth in a strained grin Steel Yar He can hit this thing with a dozen of his flying fireballs and not knock it down All he can do is blast away the rocks and blocks and expose what lies beneadi Kennit And I dont think hell waste his ammunition He cant have much more than a donkeys carry Before Patrick could reply Roland peered around the pyramids ragged edge once more He cupped his hands around his mouth and screamed TRYAGAIN SAI WERE STILL HERE BUT PERHAPS YOUR NEXT THROW WILL BE LUCKY There was a moment of silence then an insane scream FFFFFFFFFFF YOU DONT DARE MOCK ME YOU DONT DARE FFFFFFFFFFF Now came another of tiiose rising whisdes Roland grabbed Patrick and fell on top of him behind the pyramid but not against it He was afraid it might vibrate hard enough when the sneetch struck to give them concussion injuries or turn their soft insides to jelly Only this time the sneetch didnt strike the pyramid It flew past it instead soaring above the road Roland rolled off Patrick and onto his back His eyes picked up the golden blur and marked the place where it buttonhooked back toward its targets He shot it out of the air like a clay plate There was a blinding flash and then it was gone OH DEAR STILL HERERoland called striving to put just the right note of mocking amusement into his voice It wasnt easy when you were screaming at the top of your lungs Another crazed scream in responseEEEEEEEEERoland was amazed that the Red King didnt split his own head wide open with such cries He reloaded the chamber hed emptiedhe intended to keep a full gun just as long as he couldand this time there was a double whine Patrick moaned rolled over onto his belly and plunged his face into the rockstrewn grass covering his head with his hands Roland sat with his back against the pyramid of rock and steel the long barrel of his sixgun lying on his thigh relaxed and waiting At the same time he bent all of his willpower toward one object His eyes wanted water in response to that high approaching whisde and he must not let them If he ever needed the preternaturally keen eyesight for which hed been famous in his time this was it Those blue eyes were still clear when the sneetches bolted past above the road This time one buttonhooked left and the other right They took evasive action jigging crazily first one way and then another It made no difference Roland waited sitting with his legs outstretched and his old broken boots cocked into a relaxed V his heart beating slow and steady his eye filled with all the worlds clarity and color had he seen better on that last day he believed he would have been able to see the wind Then he snapped his gun up blew both sneetches out of the air and was once more reloading the empty chambers while the afterimages still pulsed with his heartbeat in front of his eyes He leaned to the corner of the pyramid plucked up the binoculars braced them on a convenient spur of rock and looked through them for his enemy The Crimson King almost jumped at him and for once in his life Roland saw exactly what he had imagined an old man with an enormous nose hooked and waxy red lips that bloomed in the snow of a luxuriant beard snowy hair that spilled down the Crimson Kings back almost all the way to his scrawny bottom His pinkflushed face peered toward the pilgrims The King wore a robe of brilliant red dotted here and about with lightning strokes and cabalistic symbols To Susannah Eddie and Jake he would have looked like Father Christmas To Roland he looked like what he was Hell incarnate HOW SLOW YOU ARE the gunslinger cried in a tone of mock amazement TRY THREE PERHAPS THREE AT ONCE WILL DO YA Looking into the binoculars was like looking into a magic hourglass tipped on its side Roland watched the Big Red King leaping up and down shaking his hands beside his face in a way that was almost comic Roland thought he could see a crate at that robed figures feet but wasnt entirely sure the scrolled iron staves between the balconys floor and its railing obscured it Must be his ammunition supply he thought Must be How many can he have in a crate that size Twenty Fifty It didnt matter Unless the Red King could throw more than twelve at a time Roland was confident he could shoot anything out of the air the old daemon sent his way This was after all what hed been made for Unfortunately the Crimson King knew it as well as Roland did The thing on the balcony gave another gruesome earsplitting cry Patrick plugged his dirty ears with his dirty fingers and made as if to dip down for fresh ammunition Then however he stopped himself Roland watched him advance to the balconys railing and then peer directly into the gunslingers eyes That glare was red and burning Roland lowered the binoculars at once lest he be fascinated The Kings call drifted to him WAIT THEN A BITAND MEDITATE ON WHAT YOUD GAIN ROLAND THINK HOW CLOSE IT IS AND LISTEN HEAR THE SONG YOUR DARLING SINGS He fell silent then No more whistling no more whines no more oncoming sneetches What Roland heard instead was the sough of the wind and what the King wanted him to hear The call of the Tower Come Roland sang the voices They came from the roses of CanKa No Rey they came from the strengthening Beams overhead they came most of all from the Tower itself that for which he had searched all his life that which was now in reach that which was being held away from him now at the last If he went to it he would be killed in the open Yet the call was like a fishhook in his mind drawing him The Crimson King knew it would do his work if he only waited And as the time passed Roland came to know it too Because the calling voices werent constant At their current level he could withstand them Was withstanding them But as the afternoon wore on die level of the call grew stronger He began to understandand with growing horrorwhy in his dreams and visions he had always seen himself coming to the Dark Tower at sunset when the light in the western sky seemed to reflect the field of roses turning the whole world into a bucket of blood held up by one single stanchion black as midnight against the burning horizon He had seen himself coming at sunset because that was when the Towers strengthening call would finally overcome his willpower He would go No power on Earth would be able to stop him Come come became COME COME and then COME COME His head ached with it And for it Again and again he found himself getting to his knees and forced himself to sit down once more with his back against the pyramid Patrick was staring at him with growing fright He was partly or completely immune to that callRoland understood thisbut he knew what was happening FIVE They had been pinned down for what Roland judged to be an hour when the King tried another pair of sneetches This time they flew on either side of the pyramid and hooked back almost at once coming at him in perfect formation but twenty feet apart Roland took the one on the right snapped his wrist to the left and blew the other one out of the sky The explosion of the second one was close enough to buffet his face with warm air but at least there was no shrapnel when they blew they blew completely it seemed TRYAGAINhe called His throat was rough and dry now but he knew the words were carryingthe air in this place was made for such communication And he knew each one was a dagger pricking the old lunatics flesh But he had his own problems The call of the Tower was growing steadily stronger COME GUNSLJNGER the madmans voice coaxed PERHAPS Ill LET THEE COME AFTER ALL WE COULD AT LEAST PALAVER ON THE SUBJECT COULD WE NOT To his horror Roland thought he sensed a certain sincerity in that voice Yes he thought grimly And well have coffee Perhaps even a little fryup He fumbled the watch out of his pocket and snapped it open The hands were running briskly backward He leaned against the pyramid and closed his eyes but that was worse The call of the Tower come Roland come gunslinger commalacomecome now the journeys done was louder more insistent than ever He opened them again and looked up at the unforgiving blue sky and the clouds that raced across it in columns to the Tower at the end of the rosefield And the torture continued SIX He hung on for another hour while the shadows of the bushes and the roses growing near the pyramid lengthened hoping against hope that someuiing would occur to him some brilliant idea that would save him from having to put his life and his fate in the hands of the talented but softminded boy by his side But as the sun began to slide down the western arc of the sky and the blue overhead began to darken he knew there was nothing else The hands of the pocketwatch were turning backward ever faster Soon they would be spinning And when they began to spin he would go Sneetches or no sneetches and what else might the madman be holding in reserve he would go He would run he would zigzag he would fall to the ground and crawl if he had to and no matter what he did he knew he would be lucky to make it even half the distance to the Dark Tower before he was blown out of his boots He would die among the roses Patrick he said His voice was husky Patrick looked up at him with desperate intensity Roland stared at the boys handsdirty scabbed but in their way as incredibly talented as his ownand gave in It occurred to him that hed only held out as long as this from pride he had wanted to kill the Crimson King not merely send him into some null zone And of course there was no guarantee that Patrick could do to the King what hed done to the sore on Susannahs face But the pull of the Tower would soon be too strong to resist and all his other choices were gone Change places with me Patrick Patrick did scrambling carefully over Roland He was now at the edge of the pyramid nearest the road Look through the farseeing instrument Lay it in that notchyes just soand look Patrick did and for what seemed to Roland a very long time The voice of the Tower meanwhile sang and chimed and cajoled At long last Patrick looked back at him Now take thy pad Patrick Draw yonder man Not that he luas a man but at least he looked like one At first however Patrick only continued to gaze at Roland biting his lip Then at last he took the sides of the gunslingers head in his hands and brought it forward until they were brow to brow Very hard whispered a voice deep in Rolands mind It was not the voice of a boy at all but of a grown man A powerful man Hes not entirely there He darkles He tincts Where had Roland heard those words before No time to think about it now Are you saying you cant Roland asked injecting with an effort a note of disappointed incredulity into his voice That you cant That Patrick cant The Artist cant Patricks eyes changed For a moment Roland saw in them the expression that would be there permanently if he grew to be a man and the paintings in Sayres office said that he would do that at least on some track of time in some world Old enough at least to paint what he had seen this day That expression would be hauteur if he grew to be an old man with a little wisdom to match his talent now it was only arrogance The look of a kid who knows hes faster than blue blazes the best and cares to know nothing else Roland knew that look for had he not seen it gazing back at him from a hundred mirrors and still pools of water when he had been as young as Patrick Danville was now I can came the voice in Rolands head I only say it wont be easy Ill need the eraser Roland shook his head at once In his pocket his hand closed around what remained of the pink nubbin and held it tight No he said Thee must draw cold Patrick Every line right the first time The erasing comes later For a moment the look of arrogance faltered but only for a moment When it returned what came with it pleased the gunslinger mightily and eased him a litde as well It was a look of hot excitement It was die look the talented wear when after years of just moving sleepily along from pillar to post they are finally challenged to do something that will tax their abilities stretch them to their limits Perhaps even beyond them Patrick rolled to the binoculars again which hed left propped aslant just below the notch He looked long while the voices sang their growing imperative in Rolands head And at last he rolled away took up his pad and began to draw the most important picture of his life SEVEN It was slow work compared to Patricks usual methodrapid strokes diat produced a completed and compelling drawing in only minutes Roland again and again had to restrain himself from shouting at the boy Hurry up For the sake of all the gods hurry up Cant you see that Im in agony here But Patrick didnt see and wouldnt have cared in any case He was totally absorbed in his work caught up in the unknowing greed of it pausing only to go back to the binoculars now and then for another long look at his redrobed subject Sometimes he slanted die pencil to shade a litde dien rubbed with his thumb to produce a shadow Sometimes he rolled his eyes back in his head showing the world nothing but the waxy gleam of the whites It was as if he were conning some version of the Red King that stood aglow in his brain And really how did Roland know that was not possible I dont care what it is Just let him finish before I go mad and sprint to what the Old Red King so rightly called my darling Half an hour at least three days long passed in this fashion Once the Crimson King called more coaxingly than ever to Roland asking if he would not come to the Tower and palaver after all Perhaps he said if Roland were to free him from his balcony prison they might bury an arrow together and then climb to the top room of the Tower in that same spirit of friendliness It was not impossible after all A hard rain made for queer bedfellows at the inn had Roland never heard that saying The gunslinger knew the saying well He also knew that the Red Kings offer was essentially the same false request as before only this time dressed up in morning coat and cravat And this time Roland heard worry lurking in the old monsters voice He wasted no energy on reply Realizing his coaxing had failed the Crimson King threw another sneetch This one flew so high over the pyramid it was only a spark then dove down upon them with the scream of a falling bomb Roland took care of it with a single shot and reloaded from a plentitude of shells He wished in fact that the King would send more of the flying grenados against him because they took his mind temporarily off the dreadful call of the Tower Its been waiting for me he thought with dismay Thats what makes it so hard to resist I thinkits calling me in particular Not to Roland exactly but to the entire line of Eld and of that line only I am left EIGHT At last as the descending sun began to take on its first hues of orange and Roland felt he could stand it no longer Patrick put his pencil aside and held the pad out to Roland frowning The look made Roland afraid He had never seen that particular expression in the mute boys repertoire Patricks former arrogance was gone Roland took the pad however and for a moment was so amazed by what he saw there that he looked away as if even the eyes in Patricks drawing might have the power to fascinate him might perhaps compel him to put his gun to his temple and blow out his aching brains It was that good The greedy and questioning face was long the cheeks and forehead marked by creases so deep they might have been bottomless The lips within the foaming beard were full and cruel It was the mouth of a man who would turn a kiss into a bite if the spirit took him and the spirit often would WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUre DOING came that screaming lunatic voice IT WONT DO YOU ANY GOOD WHATEVER IT IS I HOLD THE TOWEREEEEEEEEIM LIKE THE DOG WITH THE GRAPES ROLAND ITs MINE EVEN IF I CANT CLIMB IT AND YOUll COME EEEEE SAY TRUE BEFORE THE SHADOW OF THE TOWER REACHES YOUR PALTRY HIDINGPLACE YOUll COME FFFFFFFFJ FFFFFFFFJ EEEEEEEE Patrick covered his ears wincing Now that he had finished drawing he registered those terrible screams again That the picture was the greatest work of Patricks life Roland had absolutely no doubt Challenged the boy had done more than rise above himself he had soared above himself and committed genius The image of the Crimson King was haunting in its clarity The farseeing instrument cant explain this or not all of it Roland thought Its as if he has a third eye one that looks out from his imagination and sees everything Its that eye he looks through when he rolls the other two up To own such an ability as this and to express it with something as humble as a pencil Ye gods He almost expected to see the pulse begin to beat in the hollows of the old mans temples where clocksprings of veins had been delineated with only a few gende feathered shadings At the corner of the full and sensuous lips the gunslinger could see the wink of a single sharp t U S k tooth and he thought the lips of the drawing might come to life and part as he looked revealing a mouthful of fangs one mere wink of white which was only a bit of unmarked paper after all made the imagination see all the rest and even to smell the reek of meat that would accompany each outflow of breath Patrick had perfectly captured a tuft of hair curling from one of the Kings nostrils and a tiny thread of scar that wove in and out of the Kings right eyebrow like a bit of string It was a marvelous piece of work better by far than the portrait the mute boy had done of Susannah Surely if Patrick had been able to erase the sore from that one then he could erase the Crimson King from this one leaving nothing but the balcony railing before him and the closed door to the Towers barrel behind Roland almost expected the Crimson King to breathe and move and so surely it was done Surely But it was not It was not and wanting would not make it so Not even needing would make it so Its his eyes Roland thought They were wide and terrible the eyes of a dragon in human form They were dreadfully good but they werent right Roland felt a kind of desperate miserable certainty and shuddered from head to toe hard enough to make his teeth chatter They re not quite r Patrick took hold of Rolands elbow The gunslinger had been concentrating so fiercely on the drawing that he nearly screamed He looked up Patrick nodded at him then touched his fingers to the corners of his own eyes Yes His eyes I know that But whats wrong with them Patrick was still touching the corners of his eyes Overhead a flock of rusties flew through a sky that would soon be more purple than blue squalling the harsh cries that had given them their name It was toward the Dark Tower that they flew Roland arose to follow them so they should not have what he could not Patrick grabbed him by his hide coat and pulled him back The boy shook his head violently and this time pointed toward the road I SAW THAT ROLAND came the cry YOU THINK THAT WHATs GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE BIRDS IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU DO YOU NOT EEEEEEEEE AND ITs TRUE SURE SURE AS SUGAR SURE AS SALT SURE AS RUBIES IN KING DANDO s VA ULTEEEEEEEE HA I COULD HAVE HAD YOU JUST NOW BUT WHY BOTHER I THINK Id RATHER SEE YOU COME PISSING AND SHAKING AND UNABLE TO STOP YOURSELF As I will Roland thought wont be able to help myself I may be able to hold here another ten minutes perhaps even another twenty but in the end Patrick interrupted his thoughts once more pointing at the road Pointing back the way they had come Roland shook his head wearily Even if I could fight the pull of the thingand I couldnt its all I can do to bide hereretreat would do us no good Once were no longer in cover hell use whatever else he has He has something Im sure of it And whatever it is the bullets of my revolver arent likely to stop it Patrick shook his head hard enough to make his long hair fly from side to side The grip on Rolands arm tightened until the boys fingernails bit into the gunslingers flesh even through three layers of hide clothing His eyes always gentle and usually puzzled now peered at Roland with a look close to fury He pointed again with his free hand three quickjabbing gestures with the grimy forefinger Not at the road however Patrick was pointing at the roses What about them Roland asked Patrick what about them This time Patrick pointed first to the roses then to the eyes in his picture And this time Roland understood NINE Patrick didnt want to get them When Roland gestured to him to go the boy shook his head at once whipping his hair once more from side to side his eyes wide He made a whistling noise between his teeth that was a remarkably good imitation of an oncoming sneetch Ill shoot anything he sends Roland said Youve seen me do it If there was one close enough so that I could pick it myself I would But theres not So it has to be you who picks the rose and me who gives you cover But Patrick only cringed back against the ragged side of the pyramid Patrick would not His fear might not have been as great as his talent but it was surely a close thing Roland calculated the distance to the nearest rose It was beyond their scant cover but perhaps not by too much He looked at his diminished right hand which would have to do the plucking and asked himself how hard it could be The fact of course was that he didnt know These were not ordinary roses For all he knew the thorns growing up the green stem might have a poison in them that would drop him paralyzed into the tall grass an easy target And Patrick would not Patrick knew that Roland had once had friends and that now all his friends were dead and Patrick would not If Roland had had two hours to work on the boypossibly even onehe might have broken through his terror But he didnt have that time Sunset had almost come Besides its close I can do it if I have to and I must The weather had warmed enough so there was no need for the clumsy deerskin gloves Susannah had made them but Roland had been wearing his that morning and they were still tucked in his belt He took one of them and cut off die end so his two remaining fingers would poke dirough What remained would at least protect his palm from the thorns He put it on then rested on one knee witfi his remaining gun in his other hand looking at the nearest rose Would one be enough It would have to be he decided The next was fully six feet further away Patrick clutched his shoulder shaking his head frantically I have to Roland said and of course he did This was his job not Patricks and he had been wrong to try and make the boy do it in the first place If he succeeded fine and well If he failed and was blown apart here at the edge of CanKa No Rey at least that dreadful pulling would cease The gunslinger took a deep breath then leaped from cover and at the rose At the same moment Patrick clutched at him again trying to hold him back He grabbed a fold of Rolands coat and twisted him offtrue Roland landed clumsily on his side The gun flew out of his hand and fell in the tall grass The Crimson King screamed the gunslinger heard both triumph and fury in that voice and then came the approaching whine of another sneetch Roland closed his mittened right hand around the stem of the rose The thorns bit through the tough deerskin as if it were no more than a coating of cobwebs Then into his hand The pain was enormous but the song of the rose was sweet He could see the blaze of yellow deep in its cup like the blaze of a sun Or a million of them He could feel the warmth of blood filling the hollow of his palm and running between the remaining fingers It soaked the deerskin blooming another rose on its scuffed brown surface And here came the sneetch that would kill him blotting out the roses song filling his head and threatening to split his skull The stem never did break In the end the rose tore free of the ground roots and all Roland rolled to his left grabbed his gun and fired without looking His heart told him there was no longer time to look There was a shattering explosion and the warm air that buffeted his face this time was like a hurricane Close Very close that time The Crimson King screamed his frustration EEEEEEEEEEEand the cry was followed by multiple approaching whisdes Patrick pressed himself against the pyramid facefirst Roland clutching the rose in his bleeding right hand rolled onto his back raised his gun and waited for the sneetches to make their turn When they did he took care of them one and two and three STILL HEREhe cried at the old Red King STILL HERE YOU OLD COCKSUCKER MAY IT DO YA FINE The Crimson King gave another of his terrible howls but sent no more sneetches SO NOW YOU HAVE A ROSE he screamed LISTEN TO IT ROLAND LISTEN WELL FOR IT SINGS THE SAME SONG LISTEN AND COMMALACOMECOME Now that song was all but imperative in Rolands head It burned furiously along his nerves He grasped Patrick and turned him around Now he said For my life Patrick For the lives of every man and woman who ever died in my place so I could go on And child he thought seeing Jake in the eye of his memory Jake first hanging over darkness then falling into it He stared into the mute boys terrified eyes Finish it Show me that you can TEN Now Roland witnessed an amazing thing when Patrick took the rose he wasnt cut Not so much as scratched Roland pulled his own lacerated glove off with his teeth and saw that not only was his palm badly slashed but one of his remaining fingers now hung by a single bloody tendon It drooped like something that wants to go to sleep But Patrick was not cut The thorns did not pierce him And the terror had gone out of his eyes He was looking from the rose to his drawing back and forth with tender calculation ROLAND WHAT ARE YOU DOING COME GUNSUNGER FOR SUNSETs ALMOST NIGH And yes he would come One way or the other Knowing it was so eased him somewhat enabled him to remain where he was without trembling too badly His right hand was numb to the wrist and Roland suspected he would never feel it again That was all right it hadnt been much of a shake since the lobstrosities had gotten at it And the rose sang Yes Roland yesyoull have it again Youll be whole again There will be renewal Only come Patrick plucked a petal from the rose judged it then plucked another to go with it He put them in his mouth For a moment his face went slack with a peculiar sort of ecstasy and Roland wondered what the petals might taste like Overhead the sky was growing dark The shadow of the pyramid that had been hidden by the rocks stretched nearly to the road When the point of that shadow touched the way that had brought him here Roland supposed he would go whether the Crimson King still held the Tower approach or not WHATs THEE DOING EEEEEEEEE WHAT DEVILTRY WORKS IN THY MIND AND THY HEART You re a great one to speak of deviltry Roland thought He took out his watch and snapped back the cover Beneath the crystal the hands now sped backward five oclock to four four to three three to two two to one and one to midnight Patrick hurry he said Quick as you can I beg for my time is almost up Patrick cupped a hand beneath his mouth and spat out a red paste the color of fresh blood The color of the Crimson Kings robe And the exact color of his lunatics eyes Patrick on the verge of using color for the first time in his life as an artist made to dip the tip of his right forefinger into this paste and then hesitated An odd certainty came to Roland then die thorns of diese roses only pricked when their roots still tied the plant to Mim or Mother Earth Had he gotten his way with Patrick Mim would have cut those talented hands to ribbons and rendered them useless Its still ka the gunslinger thought Even out here in EndW Before he could finish the thought Patrick took the gunslingers right hand and peered into it witfi the intensity of a fortuneteller He scooped up some of the blood diat flowed there and mixed it with his rosepaste Then carefully he took a tiny bit of this mixture upon the second finger of his right hand He lowered it to his painting hesitated looked at Roland Roland nodded to him and Patrick nodded in return as gravely as a surgeon about to make the first cut in a dangerous operation then applied his finger to the paper The tip touched down as delicately as the beak of a hummingbird dipping into a flower It colored the Crimson Kings left eye and uien lifted away Patrick cocked his head looking at what he had done with a fascination Roland had never seen on a human face in all his long and wandering time It was as if the boy were some Manni prophet finally granted a glimpse of Gans face after twenty years of waiting in the desert Then he broke into an enormous sunny grin The response from the Dark Tower was more immediate andto Roland at leastimmensely gratifying The old creature pent on the balcony howled in pain WHATs THEE DOING FFFFFFF FFFFFFFFi STOP IT BURNS BURRRRNS EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Now finish the other Roland said Quickly For your life and mine Patrick colored the other eye with the same delicate dip of the finger Now two brilliant crimson eyes looked out of Patricks blackandwhite drawing eyes that had been colored with attar of rose and the blood of Eld eyes that burned with Hells own fire It was done Roland produced the eraser at last and held it out to Patrick Make him gone he said Make yonder foul hob gone from this world and every world Make him gone at last ELEVEN There was no question it would work From the moment Patrick first touched the eraser to his drawingto that curl of nostrilhair as it happenedthe Crimson King began to scream in fresh pain and horror from his balcony redoubt And in understanding Patrick hesitated looking at Roland for confirmation and Roland nodded Aye Patrick His time has come and youre to be his executioner Go on with it The Old King threw four more sneetches and Roland took care of them all with calm ease After that he threw no more for he had no hands with which to throw His shrieks rose to gibbering whines that Roland thought would surely never leave his ears The mute boy erased the full sensuous mouth from within its foam of beard and as he did it the screams first grew muffled and then ceased In the end Patrick erased everything but the eyes and these the remaining bit of rubber would not even blur They remained until the piece of pink gum originally part of a PencilPak bought in a Norwich Connecticut Woolworths during a backtoschool sale in August of  had been reduced to a shred the boy could not even hold between his long dirty nails And so he cast it away and showed the gunslinger what remained two malevolent bloodred orbs floating threequarters of the way up the page All the rest of him was gone TWELVE The shadow of the pyramids tip had come to touch the road now the sky in the west changed from the orange of a reaptide bonfire to that cauldron of blood Roland had seen in his dreams ever since childhood When it did the call of the Tower doubled then trebled Roland felt it reach out and grasp him with invisible hands The time of his destiny was come Yet there was this boy This friendless boy Roland would not leave him to die here at the end of EndWorld if he could help it He had no interest in atonement and yet Patrick had come to stand for all the murders and betrayals that had finally brought him to the Dark Tower Rolands family was dead his misbegotten son had been the last Now would Eld and Tower bejoined First thoughor lastthis Patrick listen to me he said taking the boys shoulder with his whole left hand and his mutilated right If youd live to make all the pictures ka has stored away in your future ask me not a single question nor ask me to repeat a single thing The boy looked at him largeeyed and silent in the red and dying light And the Song of the Tower rose around them to a mighty shout that was nothing but commala Go back to the road Pick up all the cans that are whole That should be enough to feed you Go back the way we came Never leave the road Youll do fine Patrick nodded with perfect understanding Roland saw he believed and that was good Belief would protect him even more surely than a revolver even one with the sandalwood grips Go back to the Federal Go back to the robot Stuttering Bill that was Tell him to take you to a door that swings open on Americaside If it wont open to your hand draiu it open with thy pencil Doee understand Patrick nodded again Of course he understood If ka should eventually lead you to Susannah in any where or when tell her Roland loves her still and with all his heart He drew Patrick to him and kissed the boys mouth Give her that Doee understand Patrick nodded All right I go Long days and pleasant nights May we meet in the clearing at the end of the path when all worlds end Yet even then he knew this would not happen for the worlds would never end not now and for him there would be no clearing For Roland Deschain of Gilead last of Elds line the path ended at the Dark Tower And that did him fine He rose to his feet The boy looked up at him with wide wondering eyes clutching his pad Roland turned He drew in breath to the bottom of his lungs and let it out in a great cry NOW COMES ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER I HAVE BEEN TRUE AND I STILL CARRY THE GUN OF MY FATHER AND YOU WILL OPEN TO MY HAND Patrick watched him stride to where the road ended a black silhouette against that bloody burning sky He watched as Roland walked among the roses and sat shivering in the shadows as Roland began to cry the names of his friends and loved ones and kamates those names carried clear in that strange air as if they would echo forever I come in the name of Steven Deschain he of Gilead I come in the name of Gabrielle Deschain she of Gilead I come in the name of Cortland Andrus he of Gilead I come in the name of Cuthbert Allgood he of Gilead I come in the name of Alain Johns he of Gilead I come in the name of Jamie DeCurry he of Gilead I come in the name of Vannay the Wise he of Gilead I come in the name of Hax the Cook he of Gilead I come in the name of David the hawk he of Gilead and the sky I come in the name of Susan Delgado she of Mejis I come in the name of Sheemie Ruiz he of Mejis I come in the name of Pere Callahan he of Jerusalems Lot and the roads I come in the name of Ted Brautigan he of America I come in the name of Dinky Earnshaw he of America I come in the name of Aunt Talidia she of River Crossing and will lay her cross here as I was bid I come in the name of Stephen King he of Maine I come in the name of Oy the brave he of MidWorld I come in the name of Eddie Dean he of New York I come in the name of Susannah Dean she of New York I come in the name of Jake Chambers he of New York whom I call my own true son I am Roland of Gilead and I come as myself you will open to me After that came the sound of a horn It simultaneously chilled Patricks blood and exalted him The echoes faded into silence Then perhaps a minute later came a great echoing boom the sound of a door swinging shut forever And after that came silence THIRTEEN Patrick sat where he was at the base of the pyramid shivering until Old Star and Old Mother rose in the sky The song of the roses and the Tower hadnt ceased but it had grown low and sleepy little more than a murmur At last he went back to the road gathered as many whole cans as he could there was a surprising number of them considering the force of the explosion that had demolished the cart and found a deerskin sack that would hold them He realized he had forgotten his pencil and went back to get it Beside the pencil gleaming in the starlight was Rolands watch The boy took it with a small and nervous hoot of glee He put it in his pocket Then he went back to the road and slung his little sack of gunna over his shoulder I can tell you that he walked until nearly midnight and that he looked at the watch before taking his rest I can tell you that the watch had stopped completely I can tell you that come noon of the following day he looked at it again and saw that it had begun to run in the correct direction once more albeit very slowly But of Patrick I can tell you no more not whether he made it back to the Federal not whether he found Stuttering Bill that was not whether he eventually came once more to Americaside I can tell you none of these things say sorry Here the darkness hides him from my storytellers eye and he must go on alone SUSANNAH IN NEW YORK EPILOGUE No one takes alarm as the little electric cart slides out of nowhere an inch at a time until its wholly here in Central Park no one sees it but us Most of those here are looking skyward as the first snowflakes of what will prove to be a great preChristmas snowstorm come skirling down from a white sky The Blizzard of  the newspapers will call it Visitors to the park who arent watching the snowfall begin are watching the carolers who are from public schools far uptown They are wearing either dark red blazers the boys or dark red jumpers the girls This is the Harlem School Choir sometimes called The Harlem Roses in the Post and its rival tabloid the New York Sun They sing an old hymn in gorgeous doowop harmony snapping their fingers as they make their way through the staves turning it into something that sounds almost like early Spurs Coasters or Dark Diamonds They are standing not too far from the environment where the polar bears live their city lives and the song theyre singing is What Child Is This One of those looking up into the snow is a man Susannah knows well and her heart leaps straight up to heaven at the sight of him In his left hand hes holding a large paper cup and shes sure it contains hot chocolate the good kind mit schlag For a moment shes unable to touch the controls of the little cart which came from another world Thoughts of Roland and Patrick have left her mind All she can think of is Eddie Eddie in front of her right here and now Eddie alive again And if this is not the Keystone World not quite what of that If CoOp City is in Brooklyn or even in Queens and Eddie drives a Takuro Spirit instead of a Buick Electra what of those things It doesnt matter Only one thing would and its that which keeps her hand from rising to the throttle and trundling the cart toward him What if he doesnt recognize her What if when he turns he sees nothing but a homeless black lady in an electric cart whose battery will soon be as flat as a saton hat a black lady with no money no clothes no address not in this where and when say thankee sai and no legs A homeless black lady with no connection to him Or what if he does know her somewhere far back in his mind yet still denies her as completely as Peter denied Jesus because remembering is just too hurtful Worse still what if he turns to her and she sees the burnedout fuckedup emptyeyed stare of the longtime junkie What if what if and here comes the snow that will soon turn the whole world white Stop thy grizzling and go to him Roland tells her You didnt face Blaine and the taheen of Blue Heaven and the thing under Castle Discordiajust to turn tail and run now did you Surely you ve got a moit more guts than that But she isnt sure she really does until she sees her hand rise to the throttle Before she can twist it however the gunslingers voice speaks to her again this time sounding wearily amused Perhaps theres something you want to get rid of first Susannah She looks down and sees Rolands weapon stuck through her crossbelt like a Mexican bandidds pis tola or a pirates cutlass She pulls it free amazed at how good it feels in her hand how brutally right Parting from this she thinks will be like parting from a lover And she doesnt have to does she The question is what does she love more The man or the gun All other choices will flow from this one On impulse she rolls the cylinder and sees that the rounds inside look old their casings dull Thesell never fire she thinks and without knowing why or precisely what it means These are wets She sights up the barrel and is queerly saddenedbut not surprisedto find that the barrel lets through no light Its plugged Has been for decades from the look of it This gun will never fire again There is no choice to be made after all This gun is over Susannah still holding the revolver with the sandalwood grips in one hand twists the throttle with the other The little electric cartthe one she named Ho Fat III although that is already fading in her mindrolls soundlessly forward It passes a green trash barrel with KEEP LITTER IN ITS PLACE stenciled on the side She tosses Rolands revolver into this litter barrel Doing it hurts her heart but she never hesitates Its heavy and sinks into the crumpled fastfood wrappers advertising circulars and discarded newspapers like a stone into water She is still enough of a gunslinger to bitterly regret throwing away such a storied weapon even if the final trip between worlds has spoiled it but shes already become enough of the woman whos waiting for her up ahead not to pause or look back once the job is done Before she can reach the man with the paper cup he turns He is indeed wearing a sweatshirt that says i DRINK NOZZALA but she barely registers that Its him thats what she registers Its Edward Cantor Dean And then even that becomes secondary because what she sees in his eyes is all she has feared Its total puzzlement He doesnt know her Then tentatively he smiles and it is the smile she remembers the one she always loved Also hes clean she knows it at once She sees it in his face Mostly in his eyes The carolers from Harlem sing and he holds out the cup of hot chocolate Thank God he says Id just about decided Id have to drink this myself That the voices were wrong and I was going crazy after all That well He trails off looking more than puzzled He looks afraid Listen you are here for me arent you Please tell me Im not making an utter ass of myself Because lady right now I feel as nervous as a longtailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs Youre not she says Making an ass of yourself I mean Shes remembering Takes story about the voices he heard arguing in his mind one yelling that he was dead the other that he was alive Both of them utterly convinced She has at least some idea of how terrible that must be because she knows a little about other voices Strange voices Thank God he says Your name is Susannah Yes she says My name is Susannah Her throat is terribly dry but the words come out at least She takes the cup from him and sips the hot chocolate through the cream It is sweet and good a taste of this world The sound of the honking cabs their drivers hurrying to make their day before the snow shuts them down is equally good Grinning he reaches out and wipes a tiny dab of the cream from the tip of her nose His touch is electric and she sees that he feels it too It occurs to her that he is going to kiss her again for the first time and sleep with her again for the first time and fall in love with her again for the first time He may know those diings because voices have told him but she knows them for a far better reason because those things have already happened Ka is a wheel Roland said and now she knows its true Her memories of MidWorld the gunslingers where and when are growing hazy but she thinks she will remember just enough to know its all happened before and there is something incredibly sad about this But at the same time its good Its a damn miracle is what it is Are you cold he asks No Im okay Why You shivered Its the sweetness of the cream Then looking at him as she does it she pokes her tongue out and licks a bit of the nutmegdusted foam If you arent cold now you will be he says WRKO says the temperatures gonna drop twenty degrees tonight So I bought you something From his back pocket he takes a knitted cap the kind you can pull down over your ears She looks at the front of it and sees the words there printed in red MERRY CHRISTMAS Bought it in Brendios on Fifth Avenue he says Susannah has never heard of Brendios Brentanos maybethe bookstorebut not Brendios But of course in the America where she grew up she never heard of NozzALa or Takuro Spirit automobiles either Did your voices tell you to buy it Teasing him a little now He blushes Actually you know they sort of did Try it on Its a perfect fit Tell me something she says Whos the President Youre not going to tell me its Ronald Reagan are you He looks at her incredulously for a moment and then smiles What That old actor who used to host Death Valley Days on TV Youre kidding right Nope I always thought you were the one who was kidding about Ronnie Reagan Eddie I dont know what you mean Thats okay just tell me who the President is Gary Hart he says as if speaking to a child From Colorado He almost dropped out of the race in as Im sure you knowover that Monkey Business business Then he said Fuck em if they cant take a joke and hung on in there Ended up winning in a landslide His smile fades a little as he studies her Youre not kidding me are you Are you kidding me about the voices The ones you hear in our head The ones that wake you up at two in the morning Eddie looks almost shocked How can you know that Its a long story Maybe someday Ill tell you If I can still remember she thinks Its not just the voices No No Ive been dreaming of you For months now Ive been waiting for you Listen we dont know each other this is crazy but do you have a place to stay You dont do you She shakes her head Doing a passable John Wayne or maybe its Blaine the train shes imitating she says Ahm a stranger here in Dodge pilgrim Her heart is pounding slowly and heavily in her chest but she feels a rising joy This is going to be all right She doesnt know how it can be but yes its going to be just fine This time ka is working in her favor and the force of ka is enormous This she knows from experience If I asked how I know you or where you come from He pauses looking at her levelly and then says the rest of it Or how I can possibly love you already She smiles It feels good to smile and it no longer hurts die side of her face because whatever was there some sort of scar maybeshe cant quite remember is gone Sugar she tells him its what I said a long story Youll get some of it in time though what I remember of it And it could be that we still have some work to do For an outfit called the Tet Corporation She looks around and then says What year is this  he says And do you live in Brooklyn Or maybe the Bronx The young man whose dreams and squabbling voices have led him herewith a cup of hot chocolate in his hand and a MERRY CHRISTMAS hat in his back pocketbursts out laughing God no Im from White Plains I came in on the train with my brother Hes right over there He wanted a closer look at the polar bears The brother Henry The great sage and eminent junkie Her heart sinks Let me introduce you he says No really I Hey if were gonna be friends you gotta be friends with my kid brother Were tight Jake Hey Jake She hasnt noticed the boy standing down by the railing which guards the sunken polar bears environment from the rest of the park but now he turns and her heart takes a great giddy leap in her chest Jake waves and ambles toward them Jakes been dreaming about you too Eddie tells her Its the only reason I know Im not going crazy Any crazier than usual at least She takes Eddies handthat familiar wellloved hand And when the fingers close over hers she thinks she will die of joy She will have many questionsso will theybut for the time being she has only one that feels important As the snow begins to fall more thickly around them landing in his hair and in his lashes and on the shoulders of his sweatshirt she asks it You and Jakewhats your last name Toren he says Its German Before either of them can say anything else Jake joins them And will I tell you that these three lived happily ever after I will not for no one ever does But there was happiness And they didlive Beneath the flowing and sometimes glimpsed glammer of the Beam that connects Shardik the Bear and Maturin the Turtle by way of the Dark Tower they did live Thats all Thats enough Say thankya FOUND CODA ONE Ive told my tale all the way to the end and am satisfied It was I set my watch and warrant on it the kind only a good God would save for last full of monsters and marvels and voyaging here and there I can stop now put my pen down and rest my weary hand although perhaps not forever the hand that tells the tales has a mind of its own and a way of growing restless I can close my eyes to MidWorld and all that lies beyond Mid World Yet some of you who have provided the ears without which no tale can survive a single day are likely not so willing You are the grim goaloriented ones who will not believe that the joy is in the journey rather than the destination no matter how many times it has been proven to you You are the unfortunate ones who still get the lovemaking all confused with the paltry squirt that comes to end the lovemaking the orgasm is after all Gods way of telling us weve finished at least for the time being and should go to sleep You are the cruel ones who deny the Grey Havens where tired characters go to rest You say you want to know how it all comes out You say you want to follow Roland into the Tower you say that is what you paid your money for the show you came to see I hope most of you know better Want better I hope you came to hear the tale and not just munch your way through die pages to the ending For an ending you only have to turn to the last page and see what is there writ upon But endings are heartless An ending is a closed door no man or Manni can open Ive written many but most only for the same reason that I pull on my pants in the morning before leaving the bedroombecause it is the custom of the country And so my dear Constant Reader I tell you this You can stop here You can let your last memory be of seeing Eddie Susannah and Jake in Central Park together again for the first time listening to the childrens choir sing What Child Is This You can be content in the knowledge that sooner or later Oy probably a canine version with a long neck odd goldringed eyes and a bark that sometimes sounds eerily like speech will also enter the picture Thats a pretty picture isnt it think so And pretty close to happily ever after too Close enough for government work as Eddie would say Should you go on you will surely be disappointed perhaps even heartbroken I have one key left on my belt but all it opens is that final door the one marked bi Wj Whats behind it wont improve your lovelife grow hair on your bald spot or add five years to your natural span not even five minutes There is no such thing as a happy ending I never met a single one to equal Once upon a time Endings are heartless Ending is just another word for goodbye TWO Would you still Very well then come Do you hear me sigh Here is the Dark Tower at the end of EndWorld See it I beg See it very well Here is the Dark Tower at sunset THREE He came to it with the oddest feeling of remembrance what Susannah and Eddie called deja vu The roses of CanKa No Rey opened before him in a path to the Dark Tower the yellow suns deep in their cups seeming to regard him like eyes And as he walked toward that grayblack column Roland felt himself begin to slip from the world as he had always known it He called the names of his friends and loved ones as he had always promised himself he would called them in the gloaming and with perfect force for no longer was there any need to reserve energy with which to fight the Towers pull To give infinallywas the greatest relief of his life He called the names of his compadres and amoras and although each came from deeper in his heart each seemed to have less business with the rest of him His voice rolled away to the darkening red horizon name upon name He called Eddies and Susannahs He called Jakes and last of all he called his own When the sound of it had died out the blast of a great horn replied not from the Tower itself but from the roses that lay in a carpet all around it That horn was the voice of the roses and cried him welcome with a kingly blast In my dreams the horn was always mine he thought  should have known better for mine was lost with Cuthbert at Jericho Hill A voice whispered from above him It would have been the work of three seconds to bend and pick it up Even in the smoke and the death Three seconds Time Rolandit ahoays comes back to that That was he thought the voice of the Beamthe one they had saved If it spoke out of gratitude it could have saved its breath for what good were such words to him now He remembered a line from Brownings poem One taste of the old times sets all to rights Such had never been his experience In his own memories brought only sadness They were the food of poets and fools sweets that left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth and throat Roland stopped for a moment still ten paces from the ghostwood door in the Towers base letting the voice of the rosesthat welcoming hornecho away to nothing The feeling of deja vu was still strong almost as though he had been here after all And of course he had been in ten thousand premonitory dreams He looked up at the balcony where the Crimson King had stood trying to defy ka and bar his way There about six feet above the cartons that held the few remaining sneetches the old lunatic had had no other weapons after all it seemed he saw two red eyes floating in the darkening air looking down at him witfi eternal hatred From their backs the thin silver of the optic nerves now tinted redorange with the light of the leaving sun trailed away to nothing The gunslinger supposed the Crimson Kings eyes would remain up there forever watching CanKa No Rey while their owner wandered the world to which Patricks eraser and enchanted Artists eye had sent him Or more likely to the space between the worlds Roland walked on to where the path ended at the steelbanded slab of black ghostwood Upon it a sigul that he now knew well was engraved threequarters of the way up Here he laid two things the last of his gunna Aunt Talithas cross and his remaining sixgun When he stood up he saw the first two hieroglyphics had faded away UNFOUND had become FOUND He raised his hand as if to knock but the door swung open of its own accord before he could touch it revealing the bottom steps of an ascending spiral stairway There was a sighing voiceWelcome Roland thee of Eld It was the Towers voice This edifice was not stone at all although it might look like stone this was a living thing Gan himself likely and the pulse hed felt deep in his head even thousands of miles from here had always been Gans beating lifeforce Commala gunslinger Commalacomecome And wafting out came the smell of alkali bitter as tears The smell of what What exactly Before he could place it the odor was gone leaving Roland to surmise he had imagined it He stepped inside and the Song of the Tower which he had always heardeven in Gilead where it had hidden in his mothers voice as she sang him her cradle songsfinally ceased There was another sigh The door swung shut with a boom but he was not left in blackness The light that remained was that of the shining spiral windows mixed with the glow of sunset Stone stairs a passage just wide enough for one person ascended Now comes Roland he called and the words seemed to spiral up into infinity Thee at the top hear and make me welcome if you would If youre my enemy know that I come unarmed and mean no ill He began to climb Nineteen steps brought him to the first landing and to each one thereafter A door stood open here and beyond it was a small round room The stones of its wall were carved with thousands of overlapping faces Many he knew one was the face of Calvin Tower peeping slyly over the top of an open book The faces looked at him and he heard their murmuring Welcome Roland you of the many miles and many worlds welcome thee ofGilead thee of Eld On the far side of the room was a door flanked by dark red swags traced with gold About six feet up from the doorat the exact height of his eyeswas a small round window little bigger than an outlaws peekhole There was a sweet smell and this one he could identify the bag of pine sachet his mother had placed first in his cradle then later in his first real bed It brought back those days with great clarity as aromas always do if any sense serves us as a time machine its that of smell Then like the bitter call of the alkali it was gone The room was unfurnished but a single item lay on the floor He advanced to it and picked it up It was a small cedar clip its bow wrapped in a bit of blue silk ribbon He had seen such things long ago in Gilead must once have worn one himself When the sawbones cut a newly arrived babys umbilical cord separating mother from child such a clip was put on above the babys navel where it would stay until the remainder of the cord fell off and the clip with it The navel itself was called tetka can Gan The bit of silk on this one told that it had belonged to a boy A girls clip would have been wrapped with pink ribbon Twos my own he thought He regarded it a moment longer fascinated then put it carefully back where it had been Where it belonged When he stood up again he saw a babys face Can this be my darling bahbo If you say so let it be so among the multitude of odiers It was contorted as if its first breath of air outside the womb had not been to its liking already fouled with death Soon it would pronounce judgment on its new situation with a squall that would echo throughout the apartments of Steven and Gabrielle causing those friends and servants who heard it to smile with relief Only Marten Broadcloak would scowl The birthing was done and it had been a livebirth tell Gan and all the gods thankya There was an heir to the Line of Eld and thus there was still the barest outside chance that the worlds rueful shuffle toward ruin might be reversed Roland left that room his sense of dejd vu stronger than ever So was the sense that he had entered the body of Gan himself He turned to the stairs and once more began to climb FOUR Anouier nineteen steps took him to the second landing and the second room Here bits of cloth were scattered across the circular floor Roland had no question that diey had once been an infants clout torn to shreds by a certain petulant interloper who had then gone out onto the balcony for a look back at the field of roses and found himself betaken He was a creature of monumental slyness full of evil wisdom but in the end he had slipped and now he would pay forever and ever If it was only a look he wanted why did he bring his ammunition with him when he stepped out Because it was his only gunna and slung over his back whispered one of the faces carved into the curve of the wall This was the face of Mordred Roland saw no hatefulness there now but only the lonely sadness of an abandoned child That face was as lonesome as a trainwhistle on a moonless night There had been no clip for Mordreds navel when he came into the world only the mother he had taken for his first meal No clip never in life for Mordred had never been part of Gans tet No not he My Red Father would never go unarmed whispered the stone boy Not once he was away from his castle He was mad but never that mad In this room was the smell of talc put on by his mother while he lay naked on a towel fresh from his bath and playing with his newly discovered toes She had soothed his skin with it singing as she caressed him Babybunting baby dear baby bring your basket here This smell too was gone as quickly as it had come Roland crossed to the little window walking among the shredded bits of diaper and looked out The disembodied eyes sensed him and rolled over giddily to regard him That gaze was poisonous with fury and loss Come out Roland Come out and face me one to one Man to man An eye for an eye may it do ya I think not Roland said for I have more work to do A little more even yet It was his last word to the Crimson King Although the lunatic screamed thoughts after him he screamed in vain for Roland never looked back He had more stairs to climb and more rooms to investigate on his way to the top FIVE On the third landing he looked through the door and saw a corduroy dress that had no doubt been his when hed been only a year old Among the faces on this wall he saw that of his father but as a much younger man Later on that face had become cruelevents and responsibilities had turned it so But not here Here Steven Deschains eyes were those of a man looking on something that pleases him more than anything else ever has or ever could Here Roland smelled a sweet and husky aroma he knew for the scent of his fathers shaving soap A phantom voice whispered Look Gabby look you Hes smiling Smiling at me And hes got a new tooth On the floor of the fourth room was the collar of his first dog RingALevio Ringo for short Hed died when Roland was three which was something of a gift A boy of three was still allowed to weep for a lost pet even a boy with the blood of Eld in his veins Here the gunslinger that was smelled an odor that was wonderful but had no name and knew it for the smell of the Full Earth sun in Ringos fur Perhaps two dozen floors above Ringos Room was a scattering of breadcrumbs and a limp bundle of feathers that had once belonged to a hawk named Davidno pet he but certainly a friend The first of Rolands many sacrifices to the Dark Tower On one section of the wall Roland saw David carved in flight his stubby wings spread above all the gathered court of Gilead Marten die Enchanter not least among them And to the left of the door leading onto the balcony David was carved again Here his wings were folded as he fell upon Cort like a blind bullet heedless of Corts upraised stick Old times Old times and old crimes Not far from Cort was the laughing face of the whore with whom the boy had sported that night The smell in Davids Room was her perfume cheap and sweet As the gunslinger drew it in he remembered touching the whores pubic curls and was shocked to remember now what he had remembered then as his fingers slid toward her slickysweet cleft being fresh out of his babys bath with his mothers hands upon him He began to grow hard and Roland fled that room in fear SIX There was no more red to light his way now only the eldritch blue glow of the windowsglass eyes that were alive glass eyes that looked upon the gunless intruder Outside the Dark Tower the roses of CanKa No Rey had closed for another day Part of his mind marveled that he should be here at all that he had one by one surmounted the obstacles placed in his path as dreadfully singleminded as ever Im like one of the old peoples robots he thought One that will either accomplish the task for which it has been made or beat itself to death trying Another part of him was not surprised at all however This was the part that dreamed as the Beams themselves must and this darker self thought again of the horn that had fallen from Cuthberts fingersCvithbert who had gone to his death laughing The horn that might to this very day lie where it had fallen on the rocky slope of Jericho Hill And of course Ive seen these rooms before Theyre telling my life after all Indeed they were Floor by floor and tale by tale not to mention death by death the rising rooms of the Dark Tower recounted Roland Deschains life and quest Each held its memento each its signature aroma Many times there was more than a single floor devoted to a single year but there was always at least one And after the thirtyeighth room which is nineteen doubled do ya not see it he wished to look no more This one contained the charred stake to which Susan Delgado had been bound He did not enter but looked at the face upon the wall That much he owed her Roland I love theel Susan Delgado had screamed and he knew it was the truth for it was only her love that rendered her recognizable And love or no love in the end she had still burned This is a place of death he thought and not just here All these rooms Every floor Yes gunslinger whispered the Voice of the Tower But only because your life has made it so After the thirtyeighth floor Roland climbed faster SEVEN Standing outside Roland had judged the Tower to be roughly six hundred feet high But as he peered into the hundredth room and then the two hundredth he felt sure he must have climbed eight times six hundred Soon he would be closing in on the mark of distance his friends from Americaside had called a mile That was more floors than there possibly could beno Tower could be a mile highbut still he climbed climbed until he was nearly running yet never did he tire It once crossed his mind that hed never reach the top that the Dark Tower was infinite in height as it was eternal in time But after a moments consideration he rejected the idea for it was his life the Tower was telling and while that life had been long it had by no means been eternal And as it had had a beginning marked by the cedar clip and the bit of blue silk ribbon so it would have an ending Soon now quite likely The light he sensed behind his eyes was brighter now and did not seem so blue He passed a room containing Zoltan the bird from the weedeaters hut He passed a room containing the atomic pump from the Way Station He climbed more stairs paused outside a room containing a dead lobstrosity and by now the light he sensed was much brighter and no longer blue It was He was quite sure it was It was sunlight Past twilight it might be with Old Star and Old Mother shining from above the Dark Tower but Roland was quite sure he was seeingor sensingsunlight He climbed on without looking into any more of the rooms without bothering to smell their aromas of the past The stairwell narrowed until his shoulders nearly touched its curved stone sides No songs now unless the wind was a song for he heard it soughing He passed one final open door Lying on the floor of the tiny room beyond it was a pad from which the face had been erased All that remained were two red eyes glaring up I have reached the present I have reached now Yes and there was sunlight commala sunlight inside his eyes and waiting for him It was hot and harsh upon his skin The sound of the wind was louder and that sound was also harsh Unforgiving Roland looked at the stairs curving upward now his shoulders would touch the walls for the passage was no wider than the sides of a coffin Nineteen more stairs and then the room at the top of the Dark Tower would be his I come he called Ifee hear me hear me well I come He took the stairs one by one walking with his back straight and his head held up The other rooms had been open to his eye The final one was closed off his way blocked by a ghostwood door with a single word carved upon it That word was ROLAND He grasped the knob It was engraved with a wild rose wound around a revolver one of those great old guns from his father and now lost forever Yet it will be yours again whispered the voice of the Tower and the voice of the rosesthese voices were now one What do you mean To this there was no answer but the knob turned beneath his hand and perhaps that was an answer Roland opened the door at the top of the Dark Tower He saw and understood at once the knowledge falling upon him in a hammerblow hot as the sun of the desert that was the apotheosis of all deserts How many times had he climbed these stairs only to find himself peeled back curved back turned back Not to the beginning when things might have been changed and times curse lifted but to that moment in the Mohaine Desert when he had finally understood that his thoughtless questionless quest would ultimately succeed How many times had he traveled a loop like the one in the clip that had once pinched off his navel his own tetka can Gan How many times would he travel it Oh no he screamed Please not again Have pity Have mercy The hands pulled him forward regardless The hands of the Tower knew no mercy They were the hands of Gan the hands of ka and they knew no mercy He smelled alkali bitter as tears The desert beyond the door was white blinding waterless without feature save for the faint cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon The smell beneath the alkali was that of the devilgrass which brought sweet dreams nightmares death But not for you gunslinger Never for you You darkle You tinct May I be brutally frankfYou go on And each time you forget the last time For you each time is the first time He made one final effort to draw back hopeless Ka was stronger Roland of Gilead walked through the last door the one he always sought the one he always found It closed gently behind him EIGHT The gunslinger paused for a moment swaying on his feet He thought hed almost passed out It was the heat of course the damned heat There was a wind but it was dry and brought no relief He took his waterskin judged how much was left by the heft of it knew he shouldnt drinkit wasnt time to drinkand had a swallow anyway For a moment he had felt he was somewhere else In the Tower itself mayhap But of course the desert was tricky and full of mirages The Dark Tower still lay thousands of wheels ahead That sense of having climbed many stairs and looked into many rooms where many faces had looked back at him was already fading I will reach it he thought squinting up at the pitiless sun I swear on the name of my father that I will And perhaps this time if you get there it will be different a voice whisperedsurely the voice of desert delirium for what other time had there ever been He was what he was and where he was just that no more than that no more He had no sense of humor and little imagination but he was steadfast He was gunslinger And in his heart wellhidden he still felt the bitter romance of the quest You re the one who never changes Cort had told him once and in his voice Roland could have sworn he heard fear although why Cort should have been afraid of hima boyRoland couldnt tell Itll be your damnation boy Youll wear out a hundred pairs of boots on your xoalk to hell And Vannay Those who do not learn from the past are condemned to repeat it And his mother Roland must you always be so serious Can you never rest Yet the voice whispered it again different this time mayhap different and Roland did seem to smell something other than alkali and devilgrass He thought it might be flowers He thought it might be roses He shifted his gunna from one shoulder to the other then touched the horn that rode on his belt behind the gun on his right hip The ancient brass horn had once been blown by Arthur Eld himself or so the story did say Roland had given it to Cuthbert Allgood at Jericho Hill and when Cuthbert fell Roland had paused just long enough to pick it up again knocking the deathdust of that place from its throat This is your sigul whispered the fading voice that bore with it the dusksweet scent of roses the scent of home on a summer eveningO losta stone a rose an unfound door a stone a rose a door This is your promise that things may be different Rolandthat there may yet be rest Even salvation A pause and then If you stand If you are true He shook his head to clear it thought of taking another sip of water and dismissed the idea Tonight When he built his campfire over the bones of Walters fire Then he would drink As for now As for now he would resume his journey Somewhere ahead CODA  was the Dark Tower Closer however much closer was the man was he a man was he really who could perhaps tell him how to get there Roland would catch him and when he did that man would talkaye yes yar tell it on the mountain as youd hear it in the valley Walter would be caught and Walter would talk Roland touched the horn again and its reality was oddly comforting as if he had never touched it before Time to get moving The man in black fled across die desert and the gunslinger followed June  April   Tell God thankya CHILDE ROLAND TO THE DARK TOWER CAME I My first thought was he lied in every word That hoary cripple with malicious eye Askance to watch the workings of his lie On mine and mouth scarce able to afford Suppression of the glee that pursed and scored Its edge at one more victim gained thereby II What else should he be set for with his staff What save to waylay with his lies ensnare All travellers who might find him posted there And ask the road I guessed what skulllike laugh Would break what crutch gin write my epitaph For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare III If at his counsel I should turn aside Into that ominous tract which all agree Hides the Dark Tower Yet acquiescingly I did turn as he pointed neither pride Nor hope rekindling at the end descried So much as gladness that some end might be IV For what with my whole worldwide wandering What with my search drawn out through years my hope Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope With that obstreperous joy success would bring I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring My heart made finding failure in its scope V As when a sick man very near to death Seems dead indeed and feels begin and end The tears and takes the farewell of each friend And hears one bid the other go draw breath Freelier outside since all is oer he saith And the blow fallen no grieving can amend VI When some discuss if near the other graves Be room enough for this and when a day Suits best for carrying the corpse away With care about the banners scarves and staves And still the man hears all and only craves He may not shame such tender love and stay VII Thus I had so long suffered in this quest Heard failure prophesied so oft been writ So many times among The Band to wit The knights who to the Dark Towers search addressed Their stepsthat just to fail as they seemed best And all the doubt was nowshould I befit VIII So quiet as despair I turned from him That hateful cripple out of his highway Into the path he pointed All the day Had been a dreary one at best and dim Was settling to its close yet shot one grim Red leer to see the plain catch its estray IX For mark No sooner was I fairly found Pledged to the plain after a pace or two Than pausing to throw backwards a last view Oer the safe road twas gone grey plain all round Nothing but plain to the horizons bound I might go on naught else remained to do X So on I went I think I never saw Such starved ignoble nature nothing throve For flowersas well expect a cedar grove But cockle spurge according to their law Might propagate their kind with none to awe You d think a burr had been a treasure trove XI No penury inertness and grimace In some strange sort were the lands portion see Or shut your eyes said Nature peevishly It nothing skills I cannot help my case Tis the Last Judgements fire must cure this place Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free XII If there pushed any ragged thistlestalk Above its mates the head was chopped the bents Were jealous else What made those holes and rents In the docks harsh swarth leaves bruised as to baulk All hope of greenness tis a brute must walk Pashing their life out with a brutes intents XIII As for the grass it grew as scant as hair In leprosy thin dry blades pricked the mud Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood One stiff blind horse his every bone astare Stood stupefied however he came there Thrust out past service from the devils stud XIV Alive he might be dead for aught I know With that red gaunt and colloped neck astrain And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe I never saw a brute I hated so He must be wicked to deserve such pain XV I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart As a man calls for wine before he fights I asked one draught of earlier happier sights Ere fitly I could hope to play my part Think first fight afterwards the soldiers art One taste of the old time sets all to rights XVI Not it I fancied Cuthberts reddening face Beneath its garniture of curly gold Dear fellow till I almost felt him fold An arm to mine to fix me to the place The way he used Alas one nights disgrace Out went my hearts new fire and left it cold XVII Giles then the soul of honourthere he stands Frank as ten years ago when knighted first What honest man should dare he said he durst Goodbut the scene shiftsfaugh what hangman hands Pin to his breast a parchment His own bands Read it Poor traitor spit upon and curst XVIII Better this present than a past like that Back therefore to my darkening path again No sound no sight as far as eye could strain Will the night send a howlet or a bat I asked when something on the dismal flat Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train XIX A sudden little river crossed my path As unexpected as a serpent comes No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms This as it frothed by might have been a bath For the fiends glowing hoofto see the wrath Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes XX So petty yet so spiteful All along Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit Of mute despair a suicidal throng The river which had done them all the wrong Whateer that was rolled by deterred no whit XXI Which while I fordedgood saints how I feared To set my foot upon a dead mans cheek Each step or feel the spear I thrust to seek For hollows tangled in his hair or beard CIt may have been a waterrat I speared But ugh it sounded like a babys shriek XXII Glad was I when I reached the other bank Now for a better country Vain presage Who were the strugglers what war did they wage Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank Soil to a plash Toads in a poisoned tank Or wild cats in a redhot iron cage XXIII The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque What penned them there with all the plain to choose No footprint leading to that horrid mews None out of it Mad brewage set to work Their brains no doubt like galleyslaves the Turk Pits for his pastime Christians against Jews XXIV And more than thata furlong onwhy there What bad use was that engine for that wheel Or brake not wheelthat harrow fit to reel Mens bodies out like silk With all the air Of Tophets tool on earth left unaware Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel XXV Then came a bit of stubbed ground once a wood Next a marsh it would seem and now mere earth Desperate and done with so a fool finds mirth Makes a thing and then mars it till his mood Changes and off he goes within a mod Bog clay and rubble sand and stark black dearth XXVI Now blotches rankling coloured gay and grim Now patches where some leanness of the soils Broke into moss or substances like boils Then came some palsied oak a cleft in him Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim Gaping at death and dies while it recoils XXVII And just as far as ever from the end Naught in the distance but the evening naught To point my footstep further At the thought A great black bird Apollyons bosom friend Sailed past not best his wide wing dragonpenned That brushed my capperchance the guide I sought XXVIII For looking up aware I somehow grew Spite of the dusk the plain had given place All round to mountainswith such name to grace Mere ugly heights and heaps noiu stolen in view How thus they had surprised mesolve it you How to get from them was no clearer case XXIX Yet half I seemed to recognise some trick Of mischief happened to me God knows when In a bad dream perhaps Here ended then Progress this way When in the very nick Of giving up one time more came a click As when a trap shutsyoure inside the den XXX Burningly it came on me all at once This was the place those two hills on the right Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight While to the left a tall scalped mountain Dunce Dotard adozing at the very nonce After a life spent training for the sight XXXI What in the midst lay but the Tower itself The round squat turret blind as the fools heart Built of brown stone without a counterpart In the whole world The tempests mocking elf Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf He strikes on only when the timbers start XXXII Not see because of night perhaps why day Came back again for that before it left The dying sunset kindled through a cleft The hills like giants at a hunting lay Chin upon hand to see the game at bay Now stab and end the creatureto the heft XXXIII Not hear When noise was everywhere it tolled Increasing like a bell Names in my ears Of all the lost adventurers my peers How such a one was strong and such was bold And such was fortunate yet each of old Lost lost one moment knelled the woe of years XXXIV There they stood ranged along the hillsides met To view the last of me a living frame For one more picture In a sheet of flame I saw them and I knew them all And yet Dauntless the slughorn to my lips I set And blew Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came Sometimes I think I have written more about the Dark Tower books than I have written about the Dark Tower itself These related writings include the evergrowing synopsis known by the quaint old word Argument at the beginning of each of the first five volumes and afterwords most totally unnecessary and some actually embarrassing in retrospect at the end of all the volumes Michael Wlielan the extraordinary artist who illustrated both the first volume and this last proved himself to be no slouch as a literary critic as well when after reading a draft of Volume Seven he suggestedin refreshingly blunt termsthat the rather lighthearted afterword Id put at the end was jarring and out of place I took another look at it and realized he was right The first half of that wellmeant but offkey essay can now be found as an introduction to the first four volumes of the series its called On Being Nineteen I thought of leaving Volume Seven without any afterword at all of letting Rolands discovery at the top of his Tower be my last word on the matter Then I realized that I had one more thing to say a thing that actually needed to be said It has to do with my presence in my own book Theres a smarmy academic term for thismetafiction I hate it I hate the pretentiousness of it Im in the story only because Ive known for some time now consciously since writing Insomnia in unconsciously since temporarily losing track of Father Donald Callahan near the end of salems Lot that many of my fictions refer back to Rolands world and Rolands story Since I was the one who wrote them it seemed logical that I was part of the gunslingers ka My idea was to use the Dark Tower stories as a kind of summation a way of unifying as many of my previous stories as possible beneath the arch of some iibertsde I never meant that to be pretentious and I hope it isnt but only as a way of showing how life influences art and viceversa I think that if you have read these last three Dark Towwvolumes youll see that my talk of retirement makes more sense in this context In a sense theres nothing left to say now that Roland has reached his goal and I hope the reader will see that by discovering the Horn of Eld the gunslinger may finally be on the way to his own resolution Possibly even to redemption It was all about reaching the Tower you seemine as well as Rolandsand that has finally been accomplished You may not like what Roland found at the top but thats a different matter entirely And dont write me any angry letters about it either because I wont answer them Theres nothing left to say on the subject I wasnt exactly crazy about the ending either if you want to know the truth but its the right ending The only ending in fact You have to remember that I dont make these things up not exactly I only write down what I see Readers will speculate on how real the Stephen King is who appears in these pages The answer is not very although the one Roland and Eddie meet in Bridgton Song of Susannah is very close to the Stephen King I remember being at that time As for the Stephen King who shows up in this final volume well lets put it this way my wife asked me if I would kindly not give fans of the series very precise directions to where we live or who we really are I agreed to do that Not because I wanted to exactlypart of what makes this story go I think is the sense of the fictional world bursting through into the real onebut because this happens to be my wifes life as well as mine and she should not be penalized for either loving me or living with me So I have fictionalized the geography of western Maine to a great extent trusting readers to grasp the intent of the fiction and to understand why I treated my own part in it as I did And if you feel a need to drop in and say hello please think again My family and I have a good deal less privacy than we used to and I have no wish to give up any more may it do ya fine My books are my way of knowing you Let them be your way of knowing me as well Its enough And on behalf of Roland and all his katetnow scattered say sorryI thank you for coming along and sharing this adventure with me I never worked harder on a project in my life and I knownone better alasthat it has not been entirely successful What work of makebelieve ever is And yet for all of that I would not give back a single minute of the time that I have lived in Rolands where and when Those days in MidWorld and EndWorld were quite extraordinary Those were days when my imagination was so clear I could smell the dust and hear the creak of leather Stephen King August
