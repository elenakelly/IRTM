This book is dedicated to Julie Eugley and Marsha DeFilippo They answer the mail and most of the mail for the last couple of years has been about Roland of Gilead the gunslingerBasically Julie and Marsha nagged me back to the word processor Julie you nagged the most effectively so your name comes first Rose All hail the crimson king Her arms and belly and breasts breaking out in gooseflesh Cuthbert meanwhile had already reloaded But he and his love were no longer children Smiling lips revealed cunning little teeth There they died togethero Of the three of them only Roland saw her It cut the old mans throat efficiently enough A flash as the bigbang exploded The dark tower rearing to the sky The wicked witch of the East ARGUEMENT Wizard and Glass is the fourth volume of a longer tale inspired by Robert Brownings narrative poem Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came The first volume The Gunslinger tells how Roland of Gilead pursues and at last catches Walter the man in black who pretended friendship with Rolands father but who actually served Marten a great sorcerer Catching the halfhuman Walter is not Rolands goal but only a means to an end Roland wants to reach the Dark Tower where he hopes the quickening destruction of MidWorld may be halted perhaps even reversed Roland is a kind of knight the last of his breed and the Tower is his obsession his only reason for living when first we meet him We learn of an early test of manhood forced upon him by Marten who has seduced Rolands mother Marten expects Roland to fail this test and to be sent west his fathers guns forever denied him Roland however lays Martens plans at nines passing the test   due mostly to his clever choice of weapon We discover that the gunslingers world is related to our own in some fundamental and terrible way This link is first revealed when Roland meets Jake a boy from the New York of  at a desert way station There are doors between Rolands world and our own one of them is death and that is how Jake first reaches MidWorld pushed into Fortythird Street and run over by a car The pusher was a man named Jack Mort    except the thing hiding inside of Morts head and guiding his murderous hands on this particular occasion was Rolands old enemy Walter Before Jake and Roland reach Walter Jake dies again  this time because the gunslinger faced with an agonizing choice between this symbolic son and the Dark Tower chooses the Tower Jakes last words before plunging into the abyss are Go then  there are other worlds than these The final confrontation between Roland and Walter occurs near the Western Sea In a long night of palaver the man in black tells Rolands future with a strange Tarot deck Three cards  The Prisoner The Lady of the Shadows and Death but not for you gunslinger  are especially called to Rolands attention The second volume The Drawing of the Three begins on the edge of the Western Sea not long after Roland awakens from his confrontation with his old nemesis and discovers Walter long dead only more bones in a place of bones The exhausted gunslinger is attacked by a horde of carnivorous lobstrosities and before he can escape them he has been seriously wounded losing the first two fingers of his right hand He is also poisoned by their bites and as he resumes his trek northward along the Western Sea Roland is sickening  perhaps dying On his walk he encounters three doors standing freely on the beach These open into our city of New York at three different whens From  Roland draws Eddie Dean a prisoner of heroin From  he draws Odetta Susannah Holmes a woman who has lost her lower legs in a subway mishap    one that was no accident She is indeed a lady of shadows with a vicious second personality hiding within the socially committed young black woman her friends know This hidden woman the violent and crafty Detta Walker is determined to kill both Roland and Eddie when the gunslinger draws her into MidWorld Between these two in time once again in  Roland enters the hellish mind of Jack Mort who has hurt OdettaDetta not once but twice Death the man in black told Roland but not for you gunslinger Nor is Mort the third of whom Walter foretold Roland prevents Mort from murdering Jake Chambers and shortly afterward Mort dies beneath the wheels of the same train which took Odettas legs in  Roland thus fails to draw the psychotic into MidWorld  but he thinks who would want such a being in any case Yet theres a price to be paid for rebellion against a foretold future isnt there always Ka maggot Rolands old teacher Cort might have said Such is the great wheel and always turns Be not in front of it when it does or you II be crushed under it and so make an end to your stupid brains and useless bags of guts and water Roland thinks that perhaps he has drawn three in just Eddie and Odetta since Odetta is a double personality yet when Odetta and Detta merge as one in Susannah thanks in large part to Eddie Deans love and courage the gunslinger knows its not so He knows something else as well he is being tormented by thoughts of Jake the boy who dying spoke of other worlds Half of the gunslingers mind in fact believes there never was a boy In preventing Jack Mort from pushing Jake in front of the car meant to kill him Roland has created a temporal paradox which is tearing him apart And in our world it is tearing Jake Chambers apart as well The Wastelands the third volume of the series begins with this paradox After killing a gigantic bear named either Mir by the old people who went in fear of it or Shardik by the Great Old Ones who built it for the bear turns out to be a cyborg Roland Eddie and Susannah backtrack the beast and discover Path of the Beam There are six of these beams running between the twelve portals which mark the edges of MidWorld At the point where the beams cross  at the center of Rolands world perhaps the center of all worlds  the gunslinger believes that he and his friends will at last find the Dark Tower By now Eddie and Susannah are no longer prisoners in Rolands world In love and well on the way to becoming gunslingers themselves they are full participants in the quest and follow him willingly along the Path of the Beam In a speaking ring not far from the Portal of the Bear time is mended paradox is ended and the real third is at last drawn Jake reenters MidWorld at the conclusion of a perilous rite where all four  Jake Eddie Susannah and Roland  remember the faces of their fathers and acquit themselves honorably Not long after the quartet becomes a quintet when Jake befriends a billybumbler Bumblers which look like a combination of badger raccoon and dog have a limited speaking ability Jake names his new friend Oy The way of the pilgrims leads them toward Lud an urban wasteland where the degenerate survivors of two old factions the Pubes and the Grays carry on the vestige of an old conflict Before reaching the city they come to a little town called River Crossing where a few antique residents still remain They recognize Roland as a remnant of the old days before the world moved on and honor him and his companions After the old people tell them of a monorail train which may still run from Lud and into the wastelands along the Path of the Beam and toward the Dark Tower Jake is frightened by this news but not really surprised before being drawn away from New York he obtained two books from a bookstore owned by a man with the thoughtprovoking name of Calvin Tower One is a book of riddles with the answers torn out The other Charlie the ChooChoo is a childrens book about a train An amusing little tale most might say    but to Jake theres something about Charlie that isnt amusing at all Something frightening Roland knows something else in the High Speech of his world the word char means death Aunt Talitha the matriarch of the River Crossing folk gives Roland a silver cross to wear and the travellers go their course Before reaching Lud they discover a downed plane from our world  a German fighter from the s Jammed into the cockpit is the mummified corpse of a giant almost certainly the halfmythical outlaw David Quick While crossing the dilapidated bridge which spans the River Send Jake and Oy are nearly lost in an accident While Roland Eddie and Susannah are distracted by this the party is ambushed by a dying and very dangerous outlaw named Gasher He abducts Jake and takes him underground to the TickTock Man the last leader of the Grays TickTocks real name is Andrew Quick he is the greatgrandson of the man who died trying to land an airplane from another world While Roland aided by Oy goes after Jake Eddie and Susannah find the Cradle of Lud where Blaine the Mono awakes Blaine is the last aboveground tool of the vast computersystem which lies beneath the city of Lud and it has only one remaining interest riddles It promises to take the travellers to the monorails final stop if they can solve a riddle it poses them Otherwise Blaine says the only trip theyll be taking will be to the place where the path ends in the clearing  to their deaths in other words In that case theyll have plenty of company for Blaine is planning to release stocks of nervegas which will kill everyone left in Lud Pubes Grays and gunslingers alike Roland rescues Jake leaving the TickTock Man for dead  but Andrew Quick is not dead Half blind hideously wounded about the face he is rescued by a man who calls himself Richard Fannin Fannin however also identifies himself as the Ageless Stranger a demon of whom Roland has been warned by Walter Roland and Jake are reunited with Eddie and Susannah in the Cradle of Lud and Susannah  with a little help from dat bitch Detta Walker  is able to solve Blaines riddle They gain access to the mono of necessity ignoring the horrified warnings of Blaines sane but fatally weak undermind Eddie calls this voice Little Blaine only to discover that Blaine means to commit suicide with them aboard The fact that the actual mind running the mono exists in computers falling farther and farther behind them running beneath a city which has become a slaughteringpen will make no difference when the pink bullet jumps the tracks somewhere along the line at a speed in excess of eight hundred miles an hour There is only one chance of survival Blaines love of riddles Roland of

fight afterwards  the soldiers art One taste of the old time sets all to rights  Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came Robert Browning ASK ME A RIDDLE Blaine invited Fuck you Roland said He did not raise his voice WHAT DO YOU SAY In its clear disbelief the voice of Big Blaine had become very close to the voice of its unsuspected twin I said fuck you Roland said calmly but if that puzzles you Blaine I can make it clearer No The answer is no There was no reply from Blaine for a long long time and when he did respond it was not with words Instead the walls floor and ceiling began to lose their color and solidity again In a space of ten seconds the Barony Coach once more ceased to exist They were now flying through the mountainrange they had seen on the horizon irongray peaks rushed toward them at suicidal speed then fell away to disclose sterile valleys where gigantic beetles crawled about like landlocked turtles Roland saw something that looked like a huge snake suddenly uncoil from the mouth of a cave It seized one of the beetles and yanked it back into its lair Roland had never in his life seen such animals or countryside and the sight made his skin want to crawl right off his flesh Blaine might have transported them to some other world PERHAPS I SHOULD DERAIL US HERE Blaine said His voice was meditative but beneath it the gunslinger heard a deep pulsing rage Perhaps you should the gunslinger said indifferently Eddies face was frantic He mouthed the words What are you DOING Roland ignored him he had his hands full with Blaine and he knew perfectly well what he was doing YOU ARE RUDE AND ARROGANT Blaine said THESE MAY SEEM LIKE INTERESTING TRAITS TO YOU BUT THEY ARE NOT TO ME Oh I can be much ruder than I have been Roland of Gilead unfolded his hands and got slowly to his feet He stood on what appeared to be nothing legs apart his right hand on his hip and his left on the sandalwood grip of his revolver He stood as he had so many times before in the dusty streets of a hundred forgotten towns in a score of rocky canyon killingzones in unnumbered dark saloons with their smells of bitter beer and old fried meals It was just another showdown in another empty street That was all and that was enough It was khef ka and katet That the showdown always came was the central fact of his life and the axle upon which his own ka revolved That the battle would be fought with words instead of bullets this time made no difference it would be a battle to the death just the same The stench of killing in the air was as clear and definite as the stench of exploded carrion in a swamp Then the battlerage descended as it always did and he was no longer really there to himself at all I can call you a nonsensical emptyheaded foolish machine I can call you a stupid unwise creature whose sense is no more than the sound of a winter wind in a hollow tree STOP IT Roland went on in the same serene tone ignoring Blaine completely Youre what Eddie calls a gadget Were you more I might be ruder yet I AM A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN JUST   I could call you a sucker of cocks for instance but you have no mouth I could say youre viler than the vilest beggar who ever crawled the lowest street in creation but even such a creature is better than you you have no knees on which to crawl and would not fall upon them even if you did for you have no conception of such a human flaw as mercy I could even say you fucked your mother had you one Roland paused for breath His three companions were holding theirs All around them suffocating was Blaine the Monos thunderstruck silence I can call you a faithless creature who let your only companion kill herself a coward who has delighted in the torture of the foolish and the slaughter of the innocent a lost and bleating mechanical goblin who   ICOMMAND YOU TO STOP IT OR ILL KILL YOU ALL RIGHTHERE Rolands eyes blazed with such wild blue fire that Eddie shrank away from him Dimly he heard Jake and Susannah gasp Kill if you will but command me nothing thegunslinger roared You have forgotten the faces of those who made you Now either kill us or be silent and listen to me Roland of Gilead son of Steven gunslinger and lord of ancient lands I have not come across all the miles and all the years to listen to your childish prating Do you understand Now you will listen to ME There was another moment of shocked silence No one breathed Roland stared sternly forward his head high his hand on the butt of his gun Susannah Dean raised her hand to her mouth and felt the small smile there as a woman might feel some strange new article of clothing  a hat perhaps  to make sure it is still on straight She was afraid this was the end of her life but the feeling which dominated her heart at that moment was not fear but pride She glanced to her left and saw Eddie regarding Roland with an amazed grin Jakes expression was even simpler pure adoration Tell him Jake breathed Kick his ass Right You better pay attention Eddie agreed He really doesnt give much of a fuck Blaine They dont call him The Mad Dog of Gilead for nothing After a long long moment Blaine asked DID THEY CALL YOU SO ROLAND SON OF STEVEN They may have Roland replied standing calmly on thin air above the sterile foothills WHAT GOOD ARE YOU TO ME IF YOU WONT TELL ME RIDDLES Blaine asked Now he sounded like a grumbling sulky child who has been allowed to stay up too long past his usual bedtime I didnt say we wouldnt Roland said NO Blaine sounded bewildered I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS INDICATES RATIONAL DISCOURSE PLEASE EXPLAIN You said you wanted them right now the gunslinger replied That was what I was refusing Your eagerness has made you unseemly I DONT UNDERSTAND It has made you rude Do you understand that There was a long thoughtful silence Centuries had passed since the computer had experienced any human responses other than ignorance neglect and superstitious subservience It had been eons since it had been exposed to simple human courage Finally IF WHAT I SAID STRUCK YOU AS RUDE I APOLOGIZE It is accepted Blaine But there is a larger problem EXPLAIN Close the carriage again and I will Roland sat down as if further argument  and the prospect of immediate death  was now unthinkable Blaine did as he was asked The walls filled with color and the nightmare landscape below was once more blotted out The blip on the routemap was now blinking close to the dot marked Candleton All right Roland said Rudeness is forgivable Blaine so I was taught in my youth But I was also taught that stupidity is not HOW HAVE I BEEN STUPID ROLAND OF GILEAD Blames voice was soft and ominous Susannah thought of a cat crouched outside a mousehole tail swishing back and forth green eyes shining with malevolence We have something you want Roland said but the only reward you offer if we give it to you is death Thats very stupid There was a long long pause as Blaine thought this over Then WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE ROLAND OF GILEAD BUT THE QUALITY OF YOUR RIDDLES IS NOT PROVEN I WILL NOT REWARD YOU WITH YOUR LIVES FOR BAD RIDDLES Roland nodded I understand Blaine Listen now and take understanding from me I have told some of this to my friends already When I was a boy in the Barony of Gilead there were seven FairDays each year  Winter Wide Earth Sowing MidSummer Full Earth Reaping and Years End Riddling was an important part of every FairDay but it was the most important event of the Fair of Wide Earth and that of Full Earth for the riddles told were supposed to augur well or ill for the success of the crops THAT IS SUPERSTITION WITH NO BASIS AT ALL IN FACT Blaine said I FIND IT ANNOYING AND UPSETTING Of course it was superstition Roland agreed but you might be surprised at how well the riddles foresaw the crops For instance riddle me this Blaine What is the difference between a grandmother and a granary THAT IS OLD AND NOT VERY INTERESTING Blaine said but he sounded happy to have something to solve just the same ONE IS ONES BORN KIN THE OTHER IS ONES CORNBIN A RIDDLE BASED ON PHONETIC COINCIDENCE ANOTHER OF THIS TYPE ONE TOLD ON THE LEVEL WHICH CONTAINS THE BARONY OF NEW YORK GOES LIKE THIS WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CAT AND A COMPLEX SENTENCE Jake spoke up I know A cat has claws at the end of its paws and a complex sentence has a pause at the end of its clause YES Blaine agreed A VERY SILLY OLD RIDDLE USEFUL ONLY AS A MNEMONIC DEVICE For once I agree with you Blaine old buddy Eddie said I AM NOT YOUR BUDDY EDDIE OF NEW YORK Well jeez Kiss my ass and go to heaven THERE IS NO HEAVEN Eddie had no comeback for that one I WOULD HEAR MORE OF FAIRDAY RIDDLING IN GILEAD ROLAND SON OF STEVEN At noon on Wide Earth and Full Earth somewhere between sixteen and thirty riddlers would gather in the Hall of the Grandfathers which was opened for the event Those were the only times of year when common folk  merchants and farmers and ranchers and such  were allowed into the Hall of the Grandfathers and on that day they all crowded in The gunslingers eyes were far away and dreamy it was the expression Jake had seen on his face in that misty other life when Roland had told him of how he and his friends Cuthbert and Jamie had once sneaked into the balcony of that same Hall to watch some sort of danceparty Jake and Roland had been climbing into the mountains when Roland had told him of that time close on the trail of Walter Marten sat next to my mother and father Roland had said Iknew them even from so high above  and once she and Marten danced slowly and revolvingly and the others cleared the floor for them and clapped when it was over But the gunslingers did not clap Jake looked curiously at Roland wondering again where this strange man had come from    and why A great barrel was placed in the center of the floor Roland went on and into this each riddler would toss a handful of bark scrolls with riddles writ upon them Many were old riddles they had gotten from the elders  even from books in some cases  but many others were new made up for the occasion Three judges one always a gunslinger would pass on these when they were told aloud and they were accepted only if the judges deemed them fair YES RIDDLES MUST BE FAIR Blaine agreed So they riddled the gunslinger said A faint smile touched his mouth as he thought of those days days when he had been the age of the bruised boy sitting across from him with the billybumbler in his lap For hours on end they riddled A line was formed down the center of the Hall of the Grandfathers Ones position in this line was determined by lot and since it was much better to be at the end of the line than at the head everyone hoped for a high draw although the winner had to answer at least one riddle correctly OF COURSE Each man or woman  for some of Gileads best riddlers were women  approached the barrel drew a riddle and if the riddle was still unanswered after the sands in a threeminute glass had run out that contestant had to leave the line AND WAS THE SAME RIDDLE ASKED OF THE NEXT PERSON IN THE LINE Yes SO THE NEXT PERSON HAD EXTRA TIME TO THINK Yes I SEE IT SOUNDS PRETTY SWELL Roland frowned Swell He means it sounds like fun Susannah said quietly Roland shrugged It was fun for the onlookers I suppose but the contestants took it very seriously Quite often there were arguments and fistfights after the contest was over and the prize awarded WHAT PRIZE WAS THAT ROLAND SON OF STEVEN The largest goose in Barony And year after year my teacher Cort carried that goose home I WISH HE WERE HERE Blaine said respectfully HE MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT RIDDLER Indeed he was Roland said Are you ready for my proposal Blaine OF COURSE I WILL LISTEN WITH GREAT INTEREST ROLAND OF GILEAD Let these next few hours be our FairDay You will not riddle us for you wish to hear new riddles not tell some of those millions you already know   CORRECT We couldnt solve most of them anyway Roland went on Im sure you know riddles that would have stumped even Cort had they been pulled out of the barrel He was not sure of it at all but the time to use the fist had passed and the time to use the feather had come OF COURSE Blaine agreed Instead of a goose our lives shall be the prize Roland said We will riddle you as we run Blaine If when we come to Topeka you have solved every one of our riddles you may carry out your original plan and kill us That is your goose But if we pose you  if there is a riddle in either Jakes book or one of our heads which you dont know and cant answer  you must take us to Topeka and then free us to pursue our quest That is our goose Silence Do you understand YES Do you agree More silence from Blaine the Mono Eddie sat stiffly with his arm around Susannah looking up at the ceiling of the Barony Coach Susannahs left hand slipped across her belly stroking the secret which might be hidden there Jake stroked Oys fur lightly avoiding the bloody tangles where the bumbler had been stabbed They waited while Blaine  the real Blaine now far behind them living his quasilife beneath a city where all the inhabitants lay dead by his hand  considered Rolands proposal YES Blaine said at last I AGREE IF I SOLVE ALL THE RIDDLES YOU ASK ME I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME TO THE PLACE WHERE THE PATH ENDS IN THE CLEARING IF ONE OF YOU TELLS A RIDDLE I CANNOT SOLVE I WILL SPARE YOUR LIVES AND LEAVE YOU IN TOPEKA FROM WHENCE YOU MAY CONTINUE YOUR QUEST FOR THE DARK TOWER IF YOU SO CHOOSE HAVE I UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS AND LIMITS OF YOUR PROPOSAL CORRECTLY ROLAND SON OF STEVEN Yes VERY WELL ROLAND OF GILEAD VERY WELL EDDIE OF NEW YORK VERY WELL SUSANNAH OF NEW YORK VERY WELL JAKE OF NEW YORK VERY WELL OY OF MIDWORLD Oy looked up briefly at the sound of his name YOU ARE KATET ONE MADE FROM MANY SO AM I WHOSE KATET IS THE STRONGER IS SOMETHING WE MUST NOW PROVE There was a moment of silence broken only by the hard steady throb of the slotrans turbines bearing them on across the waste lands bearing them along the Path of the Beam toward Topeka where MidWorld ended and EndWorld began SO cried the voice of Blaine CAST YOUR NETS WANDERERS TRY ME WITH YOUR QUESTIONS AND LET THE CONTEST BEGIN The town of Candleton was a poisoned and irradiated ruin but not dead after all the centuries it still twitched with tenebrous life  trundling beetles the size of turtles birds that looked like small misshapen dragonlets a few stumbling robots that passed in and out of the rotten buildings like stainless steel zombies their joints squalling their nuclear eyes flickering Show your pass pard cried the one that had been stuck in a corner of the lobby of the Candleton Travellers Hotel for the last two hundred and thirtyfour years Embossed on the rusty lozenge of its head was a sixpointed star It had over the years managed to dig a shallow concavity in the steelsheathed wall blocking its way but that was all Show your pass pard Elevated radiation levels possible south and east of town Show your pass pard Elevated radiation levels possible south and east of town A bloated rat blind and dragging its guts behind it in a sac like a rotten placenta struggled over the posse robots feet The posse robot took no notice just went on butting its steel head into the steel wall Show your pass pard Elevated radiation levels possible dad rattit and gods cuss it Behind it in the hotel bar the skulls of men and women who had come in here for one last drink before the cataclysm caught up with them grinned as if they had died laughing Perhaps some of them had When Blaine the Mono blammed overhead running up the night like a bullet running up the barrel of a gun windows broke dust sifted down and several of the skulls disintegrated like ancient pottery vases Outside a brief hurricane of radioactive dust blew up the street and the hitching post in front of the Elegant Beef and Pork Restaurant was sucked into the squally updraft like smoke In the town square the Candleton Fountain split in two spilling out not water but only dust snakes mutie scorpions and a few of the blindly trundling turtlebeetles Then the shape which had hurtled above the town was gone as if it had never been Candleton reverted to the mouldering activity which had been its substitute for life over the last two and a half centuries   and then the trailing sonic boom caught up slamming its thunderclap above the town for the first time in seven years causing enough vibration to tumble the mercantile store on the far side of the fountain The posse robot tried to voice one final warning Elevated rad   and then quit for good facing into its corner like a child that has been bad Two or three hundred wheels outside Candleton as one travelled along the Path of the Beam the radiation levels and concentrations of DEP in the soil fell rapidly Here the monos track swooped down to less than ten feet off the ground and here a doe that looked almost normal walked prettily from piney woods to drink from a stream in which the water had threequarters cleansed itself The doe was not normal  a stumpish fifth leg dangled down from the center of her lower belly like a teat waggling bonelessly to and fro when she walked and a blind third eye peered milkily from the left side of her muzzle Yet she was fertile and her DNA was in reasonably good order for a twelfthgeneration mutie In her six years of life she had given birth to three live young Two of these fawns had been not just viable but normal  threaded stock Aunt Talitha of River Crossing would have called them The third a skinless bawling horror had been killed quickly by its sire The world  this part of it at any rate  had begun to heal itself The deer slipped her mouth into the water began to drink then looked up eyes wide muzzle dripping Off in the distance she could hear a low humming sound A moment later it was joined by an eyelash of light Alarm flared in the does nerves but although her reflexes were fast and the light when first glimpsed was still many wheels away across the desolate countryside there was never a chance for her to escape Before she could even begin to fire her muscles the distant spark had swelled to a searing wolfs eye of light that flooded the stream and the clearing with its glare With the light came the maddening hum of Blaines slotrans engines running at full capacity There was a blur of pink above the concrete ridge which bore the rail a roostertail of dust stones small dismembered animals and whirling foliage followed along after The doe was killed instantly by the concussion of Blaines passage Too large to be sucked in the monos wake she was still yanked forward almost seventy yards with water dripping from her muzzle and hoofs Much of her hide and the boneless fifth leg was torn from her body and pulled after Blaine like a discarded garment There was brief silence thin as new skin or early ice on a Years End pond and then the sonic boom came rushing after like some noisy creature late for a weddingfeast tearing the silence apart knocking a single mutated bird  it might have been a raven  dead out of the air The bird fell like a stone and splashed into the stream In the distance a dwindling red eye Blaines taillight Overhead a full moon came out from behind a scrim of cloud painting the clearing and the stream in the tawdry hues of pawnshop jewelry There was a face in the moon but not one upon which lovers would wish to look It seemed the scant face of a skull like those in the Candleton Travellers Hotel a face which looked upon those few beings still alive and struggling below with the amusement of a lunatic In Gilead before the world had moved on the full moon of Years End had been called the Demon Moon and it was considered ill luck to look directly at it Now however such did not matter Now there were demons everywhere  Susannah looked at the routemap and saw that the green dot marking their present position was now almost halfway between Candleton and Rilea Blaines next stop Except whos stopping she thought From the routemap she turned to Eddie His gaze was still directed up at the ceiling of the Barony Coach She followed it and saw a square which could only be a trapdoor except when you were dealing with futuristic shit like a talking train she supposed you called it a hatch or something even cooler Stencilled on it was a simple red drawing which showed a man stepping through the opening Susannah tried to imagine following the implied instruction and popping up through that hatch at over eight hundred miles an hour She got a quick but clear image of a womans head being ripped from her neck like a flower from its stalk she saw the head flying backward along the length of the Barony Coach perhaps bouncing once and then disappearing into the dark eyes staring and hair rippling She pushed the picture away as fast as she could The hatch up there was almost certainly locked shut anyway Blaine the Mono had no intention of letting them go They might win their way out but Susannah didnt think that was a sure thing even if they managed to stump Blaine with a riddle Sorry to say this but you sound like just one more honky motherfuckerto me honey she thought in a mental voice that was not quite Detta Walkers I dont trust your mechanical ass You apt to be more dangerousbeaten than with the blue ribbon pinned to your memory banks Jake was holding his tattered book of riddles out to the gunslinger as if he no longer wanted the responsibility of carrying it Susannah knew how the kid must feel their lives might very well be in those grimy wellthumbed pages She wasnt sure she would want the responsibility of holding onto it either Roland Jake whispered Do you want this Ont Oy said giving the gunslinger a forbidding glance Olanontiss The bumbler fixed his teeth on the book took it from Jakes hand and stretched his disproportionately long neck toward Roland offering him RiddleDeDum BrainTwisters and Puzzles for Everyone Roland glanced at it for a moment his face distant and preoccupied then shook his head Not yet He looked forward at the routemap Blaine had no face so the map had to serve them as a fixingpoint The flashing green dot was closer to Rilea now Susannah wondered briefly what the countryside through which they were passing looked like and decided she didnt really want to know Not after what theyd seen as they left the city of Lud Blaine Roland called YES Can you leave the room We need to confer You nuts if you think hes gonna do that Susannah thought but Blaines reply was quick and eager YES GUNSLINGER I WILL TURN OFF ALL MY SENSORS IN THE BARONY COACH WHEN YOUR CONFERENCE IS DONE AND YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN THE RIDDLING I WILL RETURN Yeah you and General MacArthur Eddie muttered WHAT DID YOU SAY EDDIE OF NEW YORK Nothing Talking to myself thats all TO SUMMON ME SIMPLY TOUCH THE ROUTEMAP said Blaine AS LONG AS THE MAP IS RED MY SENSORS ARE OFF SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR AFTER AWHILE CROCODILE DONT FORGET TO WRITE A pause Then OLIVE OIL BUT NOT CASTORIA The routemap rectangle at the front of the cabin suddenly turned a red so bright Susannah couldnt look at it without squinting Olive oil but not castoria Jake asked What the heck does that mean It doesnt matter Roland said We dont have much time The mono travels just as fast toward its point of ending whether Blaines with us or not You dont really believe hes gone do you Eddie asked A slippery pup like him Come on get real Hes peeking I guarantee you I doubt it very much Roland said and Susannah decided she agreed with him For now at least You could hear how excited he was at the idea of riddling again after all these years And   And hes confident Susannah said Doesnt expect to have much trouble with the likes of us Will he Jake asked the gunslinger Will he have trouble with us I dont know Roland said I dont have a Watch Me hidden up my sleeve if thats what youre asking Its a straight game    but at least its a game Ive played before Weve all played it before at least to some extent And theres that He nodded toward the book which Jake had taken back from Oy There are forces at work here big ones and not all of them are working to keep us away from the Tower Susannah heard him but it was Blaine she was thinking of  Blaine who had gone away and left them alone like the kid whos been chosen it obediently covering his eyes while his playmates hide And wasnt that what they were Blaines playmates The thought was somehow worse than the image shed had of trying the escape hatch and having her head torn off So what do we do Eddie asked You must have an idea or you never would have sent him away His great intelligence  coupled with his long period of loneliness and forced inactivity  may have combined to make him more human than he knows Thats my hope anyway First we must establish a kind of geography We must tell if we can where he is weak and where he is strong where he is sure of the game and where not so sure Riddles are not just about the cleverness of the riddler never think it They are also about the blind spots of he who is riddled Does he have blind spots Eddie asked If he doesnt Roland said calmly were going to die on this train I like the way you kind of ease us over the rough spots Eddie said with a thin smile Its one of your many charms We will riddle him four times to begin with Roland said Easy not so easy quite hard very hard Hell answer all four of that I am confident but we will be listening for how he answers Eddie was nodding and Susannah felt a small almost reluctant glimmer of hope It sounded like the right approach all right Then well send him away again and hold palaver the gunslinger said Mayhap well get an idea of what direction to send our horses These first riddles can come from anywhere but  he nodded gravely toward the book  based on Jakes story of the bookstore the answer we really need should be in there not in any memories I have of FairDay riddlings Must be in there Question Susannah said Roland looked at her eyebrows raised over his faded dangerous eyes Its a question were looking for not an answer she said This time its the answers that are apt to get us killed The gunslinger nodded He looked puzzled  frustrated even  and this was not an expression Susannah liked seeing on his face But this time when Jake held out the book Roland took it He held it for a moment its faded but still gay red cover looked very strange in his big sunburned hands    especially in the right one with its essential reduction of two fingers then passed it on to Eddie Youre easy Roland said turning to Susannah Perhaps she replied with a trace of a smile but its still not a very polite thing to say to a lady Roland He turned to Jake Youll go second with one thats a little harder Ill go third Youll go last Eddie Pick one from the book that looks hard   The hard ones are toward the back Jake supplied    but none of your foolishness mind This is life and death The time for foolishness is past Eddie looked at him  old long tall and ugly whod done God knew how many ugly things in the name of reaching his Tower  and wondered if Roland had any idea at all of how much that hurt Just that casual admonition not to behave like a child grinning and cracking jokes now that their lives were at wager He opened his mouth to say something  an Eddie Dean Special something that would be both funny and stinging at the same time the kind of remark that always used to drive his brother Henry dogshit  and then closed it again Maybe long tall and ugly was right maybe it was time to put away the oneliners and dead baby jokes Maybe it was finally time to grow up  After three more minutes of murmured consultation and some quick flipping through RiddleDeDum on Eddies and Susannahs parts Jake already knew the one he wanted to try Blaine with first hed said Roland went to the front of the Barony Coach and laid his hand on the fiercely glowing rectangle there The routemap reappeared at once Although there was no sensation of movement now that the coach was closed the green dot was closer to Rilea than ever SO ROLAND SON OF STEVEN Blaine said To Eddie he sounded more than jovial he sounded next door to hilarious IS YOUR KATET READY TO BEGIN Yes Susannah of New York will begin the first round He turned to her lowered his voice a little not that she reckoned that would do much good if Blaine wanted to listen and said You wont have to step forward like the rest of us because of your legs but you must speak fair and address him by name each time you talk to him If  when  he answers your riddle correctly say Thankeesai Blaine you have answered true Then Jake will step into the aisle and have his turn All right And if he should get it wrong or not guess at all Roland smiled grimly I think thats one thing we dont have to worry about just yet He raised his voice again Blaine YES GUNSLINGER Roland took a deep breath It starts now EXCELLENT Roland nodded at Susannah Eddie squeezed one of her hands Jake patted the other Oy gazed at her raptly with his goldringed eyes Susannah smiled at them nervously then looked up at the routemap Hello Blame HOWDY SUSANNAH OF NEW YORK Her heart was pounding her armpits were damp and here was something she had first discovered way back in the first grade it was hard to begin It was hard to stand up in front of the class and be first with your song your joke your report on how you spent your summer vacation    or your riddle for that matter The one she had decided upon was one from Jake Chamberss crazed English essay which he had recited to them almost verbatim during their long palaver after leaving the old people of River Crossing The essay titled My Understanding of Truth had contained two riddles one of which Eddie had already used on Blaine SUSANNAH ARE YOU THERE LIL COWGIRL Teasing again but this time the teasing sounded light goodnatured Goodhumored Blaine could be charming when he got what he wanted Like certain spoiled children she had known Yes Blaine I am and here is my riddle What has four wheels and flies There was a peculiar click as if Blaine were mimicking the sound of a man popping his tongue against the roof of his mouth It was followed by a brief pause When Blaine replied most of the jocularity had gone out of his voice THE TOWN GARBAGE WAGON OF COURSE A CHILDS RIDDLE IF THE REST OF YOUR RIDDLES ARE NO BETTER I WILL BE EXTREMELY SORRY I SAVED YOUR LIVES FOR EVEN A SHORT WHILE The routemap flashed not red this time but pale pink Dont get him mad the voice of Little Blaine begged Each time it spoke Susannah found herself imagining a sweaty little bald man whose every movement was a kind of cringe The voice of Big Blaine came from everywhere like the voice of God in a Cecil B DeMille movie Susannah thought but Little Blaines from only one the speaker directly over their heads Please dont make him angry fellows hes already got the mono in the red speedwise and the track compensators can barely keep up The trackage has degenerated terribly since the last time we came out this way Susannah who had been on her share of humpy trolleys and subways in her time felt nothing the ride was as smooth now as it had been when they had first pulled out of the Cradle of Lud  but she believed Little Blaine anyway She guessed that if they did feel a bump it would be the last thing any of them would ever feel Roland poked an elbow into her side bringing her back to her current situation Thankeesai she said and then as an afterthought tapped her throat rapidly three times with the fingers of her right hand It was what Roland had done when speaking to Aunt Talitha for the first time THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURTESY Blaine said He sounded amused again and Susannah reckoned that was good even if his amusement was at her expense I AM NOT FEMALE HOWEVER INSOFAR AS I HAVE A SEX IT IS MALE Susannah looked at Roland bewildered Left hand for men he said On the breastbone He tapped to demonstrate Oh Roland turned to Jake The boy stood put Oy on his chair which did no good Oy immediately jumped down and followed after Jake when he stepped into the aisle to face the routemap and turned his attention to Blaine Hello Blaine this is Jake You know son of Elmer SPEAK YOUR RIDDLE What can run but never walks has a mouth but never talks has a bed but never sleeps has a head but never weeps NOT BAD ONE HOPES SUSANNAH WILL LEARN FROM YOUR EXAMPLE JAKE SON OF ELMER THE ANSWER MUST BE SELFEVIDENT TO ANYONE OF ANY INTELLIGENCE AT ALL BUT A DECENT EFFORT NEVERTHELESS A RIVER Thankeesai Blaine you have answered true He tapped the bunched fingers of his left hand three times against his breastbone and then sat down Susannah put her arm around him and gave him a brief squeeze Jake looked at her gratefully Now Roland stood up Hile Blaine he said HILE GUNSLINGER Once again Blaine sounded amused    possibly by the greeting which Susannah hadnt heard before Heil what she wondered Hitler came to mind and that made her think of the downed plane theyd found outside Lud A FockeWulf Jake had claimed She didnt know about that but she knew it had contained one seriously dead harrier too old even to stink SPEAK YOUR RIDDLE ROLAND AND LET IT BE HANDSOME Handsome is as handsome does Blaine In any case here it is What has four legs in the morning two legs in the afternoon and three legs at night THAT IS INDEED HANDSOME Blaine allowed SIMPLE BUT HANDSOME JUST THE SAME THE ANSWER IS A HUMAN BEING WHO CRAWLS ON HANDS AND KNEES IN BABYHOOD WALKS ON TWO LEGS DURING ADULTHOOD AND WHO GOES ABOUT WITH THE HELP OF A CANE IN OLD AGE Blaine sounded positively smug and Susannah suddenly discovered a mildly interesting fact she loathed the selfsatisfied murderous thing Machine or not it or he she loathed Blaine She had an idea she would have felt the same even if he hadnt made them wager their lives in a stupid riddling contest Roland however did not look the slightest put out of countenance Thankeesai Blaine you have answered true He sat down without tapping his breastbone and looked at Eddie Eddie stood up and stepped into the aisle Whats happening Blaine my man he asked Roland winced and shook his head putting his mutilated right hand up briefly to shade his eyes Silence from Blaine Blaine Are you there YES BUT IN NO MOOD FOR FRIVOLITY EDDIE OF NEW YORK SPEAK YOUR RIDDLE I SUSPECT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT IN SPITE OF YOUR FOOLISH POSES I LOOK FORWARD TO IT Eddie glanced at Roland who waved a hand at him  Go on for yourfathers sake go on  and then looked back at the routemap where the green dot had just passed the point marked Rilea Susannah saw that Eddie suspected what she herself all but knew Blaine understood they were trying to test his capabilities with a spectrum of riddles Blaine knew    and welcomed it Susannah felt her heart sink as any hopes they might find a quick and easy way out of this disappeared  Well Eddie said I dont know how hard itll seem to you but it struck me as a toughie Nor did he know the answer since that section ofRiddleDeDum had been torn out but he didnt think that made any difference their knowing the answers hadnt been part of the groundrules I SHALL HEAR AND ANSWER No sooner spoken than broken What is it SILENCE A THING YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT EDDIE OF NEW YORK Blaine said with no pause at all and Eddie felt his heart drop a little There was no need to consult with the others the answer was selfevident And having it come back at him so quickly was the real bummer Eddie never would have said so but he had harbored the hope  almost a secret surety  of bringing Blaine down with a single riddle kersmash all the Kings horses and all the Kings men couldnt put Blaine together again The same secret surety he supposed that he had harbored every time he picked up a pair of dice in some sharpies backbedroom crap game every time he called for a hit on seventeen while playing blackjack That feeling that you couldnt go wrong because you were you the best the one and only Yeah he said sighing Silence a thing I know little about Thankeesai Blaine you speak truth I HOPE YOU HAVE DISCOVERED SOMETHING WHICH WILL HELP YOU Blaine said and Eddie thought You fucking mechanical liar The complacent tone had returned to Blaines voice and Eddie found it of some passing interest that a machine could express such a range of emotion Had the Great Old Ones built them in or had Blaine created an emotional rainbow for himself at some point A little dipolar pretty with which to pass the long decades and centuries DO YOU WISH ME TO GO AWAY AGAIN SO YOU MAY CONSULT Yes Roland said The routemap flashed bright red Eddie turned toward the gunslinger Roland composed his face quickly but before he did Eddie saw a horrible thing a brief look of complete hopelessness Eddie had never seen such a look there before not when Roland had been dying of the lobstrosities bites not when Eddie had been pointing the gunslingers own revolver at him not even when the hideous Gasher had taken Jake prisoner and disappeared into Lud with him What do we do next Jake asked Do another round of the four of us I think that would serve little purpose Roland said Blame must know thousands of riddles  perhaps millions  and that is bad Worse far worse he understands the how of riddling  the place the mind has to go to in order to make them and solve them He turned to Eddie and Susannah sitting once more with their arms about one another Am I right about that he asked them Do you agree Yes Susannah said and Eddie nodded reluctantly He didnt want to agree    but he did So Jake asked What do we do Roland I mean there has to be a way out of this    doesnt there Lie to him you bastard Eddie sent fiercely in Rolands direction Roland perhaps hearing the thought did the best he could He touched Jakes hair with his diminished hand and ruffled through it I think theres always an answer Jake The real question is whether or not well have time to find the right riddle He said it took him a little under nine hours to run his route   Eight hours fortyfive minutes Jake put in    and thats not much time Weve already been running almost an hour   And if that maps right were almost halfway to Topeka Susannah said in a tight voice Could be our mechanical pals been lying to us about the length of the run Hedging his bets a little Could be Roland agreed So what do we do Jake repeated Roland drew in a deep breath held it let it out Let me riddle him alone for now Ill ask him the hardest ones I remember from the FairDays of my youth Then Jake if were approaching the point of if were approaching Topeka at this same speed with Blaine still unposed I think you should ask him the last few riddles in your book The hardest riddles He rubbed the side of his face distractedly and looked at the ice sculpture This chilly rendering of his own likeness had now melted to an unrecognizable hulk I still think the answer must be in the book Why else would you have been drawn to it before coming back to this world And us Susannah asked What do Eddie and I do Think  Roland said Think for your fathers sakes  I do not shoot with my hand  Eddie said He suddenly felt far away strange to himself It was the way hed felt when he had seen first the slingshot and then the key in pieces of wood just waiting for him to whittle them free  and at the same time this feeling was not like that at all Roland was looking at him oddly Yes Eddie you say true A gunslinger shoots with his mind What have you thought of Nothing He might have said more but all at once a strange image  a strange memory  intervened Roland hunkering by Jake at one of their stoppingpoints on the way to Lud Both of them in front of an unlit campfire Roland once more at his everlasting lessons Jakes turn this time Jake with the flint and steel trying to quicken the fire Spark after spark licking out and dying in the dark And Roland had said that he was being silly That he was just being    well   silly No Eddie said He didnt say that at all At least not to the kid he didnt Eddie Susannah Sounding concerned Almost frightened Well why dont you ask him what he said bro That was Henrys voice the voice of the Great Sage and Eminent Junkie First time in a long time Ask him hes practically sitting right next to you go on and ask him what he said Quit dancing around like a baby with a load in his diapers Except that was a bad idea because that wasnt the way things worked in Rolands world In Rolands world everything was riddles you didnt shoot with your hand but with your mind your motherfucking mind and what did you say to someone who wasnt getting the spark into the kindling Move your flint in closer of course and thats what Roland had said Move your flint in closer and hold it steady Except none of that was what this was about It was close yes but close only counts in horseshoes as Henry Dean had been wont to say before he became the Great Sage and Eminent Junkie Eddies memory was jinking a little because Roland had embarrassed him shamed him    made a joke at his expense    Probably not on purpose but something Something that had made him feel the way Henry always used to make him feel of course it was why else would Henry be here after such a long absence All of them looking at him now Even Oy Go on he told Roland sounding a little waspish You wanted us to think were thinking already He himself was thinking so hard Ishoot with my mind  that his goddam brains were almost on fire but he wasnt going to tell old long tall and ugly that Go on and ask Blaine some riddles Do your part As you will Eddie Roland rose from his seat went forward and laid his hand on the scarlet rectangle again The routemap reappeared at once The green dot had moved farther beyond Rilea but it was clear to Eddie that the mono had slowed down significantly either obeying some builtin program or because Blaine was having too much fun to hurry IS YOUR KATET READY TO CONTINUE OUR FAIRDAY RIDDLING ROLAND SON OF STEVEN Yes Blaine Roland said and to Eddie his voice sounded heavy I will riddle you alone for awhile now If you have no objection AS DINH AND FATHER OF YOUR KATET SUCH IS YOUR RIGHT WILL THESE BE FAIRDAY RIDDLES Yes GOOD Loathsome satisfaction in that voice I WOULD HEAR MORE OF THOSE All right Roland took a deep breath then began Feed me and I live Give me to drink and I die What am I FIRE No hesitation Only that insufferable smugness a tone which said That was old to me when your grandmother was young but try again This is more fun than Ive had in centuries so try again I pass before the sun Blaine yet make no shadow What am I WIND No hesitation You speak true sai Next This is as light as a feather yet no man can hold it for long ONES BREATH No hesitation Yet he did hesitate Eddie thought suddenly Jake and Susannah were watching Roland with agonized concentration fists clenched willing him to ask Blaine the right riddle the stumper the one with the Get the Fuck Out of Jail Free card hidden inside it Eddie couldnt look at them  Suze in particular  and keep his concentration He lowered his gaze to his own hands which were also clenched and forced them to open on his lap It was surprisingly hard to do From the aisle he heard Roland continuing to trot out the golden oldies of his youth Riddle me this Blaine If you break me Ill not stop working If you can touch me my work is done If you lose me you must find me with a ring soon after What am I Susannahs breath caught for a moment and although he was looking down Eddie knew she was thinking what he was thinking that was a good one a damned good one maybe  THE HUMAN HEART Blaine said Still with not a whit of hesitation THIS RIDDLE IS BASED IN LARGE PART UPON HUMAN POETIC CONCEITS SEE FOR INSTANCE JOHN AVERY SIRONIA HUNTZ ONDOLA WILLIAM BLAKE JAMES TATE VERONICA MAYS AND OTHERS IT IS REMARKABLE HOW HUMAN BEINGS PITCH THEIR MINDS ON LOVE YET IT IS CONSTANT FROM ONE LEVEL OF THE TOWER TO THE NEXT EVEN IN THESE DEGENERATE DAYS CONTINUE ROLAND OF GILEAD Susannahs breath resumed Eddies hands wanted to clench again but he wouldnt let them Move your flint in closer he thought in Rolands voice Move your flint in closer for your fathers sake And Blaine the Mono ran on southeast under the Demon Moon Jake didnt know how easy or difficult Blaine might find the last ten puzzlers in RiddleDeDum but they looked pretty tough to him Of course he reminded himself he wasnt a thinkingmachine with a citywide bank of computers to draw on All he could do was go for it God hates a coward as Eddie sometimes said If the last ten failed he would try Aaron Deepneaus Samson riddle Out of the eater came forth meat and so on If that one also failed hed probably    shit he didnt know what hed do or even how hed feel The truth is Jake thought Im fried And why not He had gone through an extraordinary swarm of emotions in the last eight hours or so First terror of being sure he and Oy were going to drop off the suspension bridge and to their deaths in the River Send of being driven through the crazed maze that was Lud by Gasher of having to look into the TickTock Mans terrible green eyes and try to answer his unanswerable questions about time Nazis and the nature of transitive circuits Being questioned by TickTock had been like having to take a final exam in hell Then the exhilaration of being rescued by Roland and Oy without Oy he would almost certainly be toast now the wonder of all they had seen beneath the city his awe at the way Susannah had solved Blaines gateriddle and the final mad rush to get aboard the mono before Blaine could release the stocks of nervegas stored under Lud After surviving all that a kind of blissedout surety had settled over him  of course Roland would stump Blaine who would then keep his part of the bargain and set them down safe and sound at his final stop whatever passed for Topeka in this world Then they would find the Dark Tower and do whatever they were supposed to do there right what needed righting fix what needed fixing And then They Lived Happily Ever After of course Like folk in a fairy tale Except They shared each others thoughts Roland had said sharing khef was part of what katet meant And what had been seeping into Jakes thoughts ever since Roland stepped into the aisle and began to try Blaine with riddles from his young days was a sense of doom It wasnt coming just from the gunslinger Susannah was sending out the same grim blueblack vibe Only Eddie wasnt sending it and that was because hed gone off somewhere was chasing his own thoughts That might be good but there were no guarantees and   and Jake began to be scared again Worse he felt desperate like a creature that is pressed deeper and deeper into its final comer by a relentless foe His fingers worked restlessly in Oys fur and when he looked down at them he realized an amazing thing the hand which Oy had bitten into to keep from falling off the bridge no longer hurt He could see the holes the bumblers teeth had made and blood was still crusted in his palm and on his wrist but the hand itself no longer hurt He flexed it cautiously There was some pain but it was low and distant hardly there at all Blaine what may go up a chimney down but cannot go down a chimney up A LADYS PARASOL Blaine replied in that tone of jolly complacency which Jake too was coming to loathe Thankeesai Blaine once again you have answered true Next   Roland The gunslinger looked around at Jake and his look of concentration lightened a bit It wasnt a smile but it went a little way in that direction at least and Jake was glad What is it Jake My hand It was hurting like crazy and now its stopped SHUCKS Blaine said in the drawling voice of John Wayne I COULDNT WATCH A HOUND SUFFER WITH A MASHEDUP FOREPAW LIKE THAT LET ALONE A FINE LITTLE TRAIL HAND LIKE YOURSELF SO I FIXED IT UP How Jake asked LOOK ON THE ARM OF YOUR SEAT Jake did and saw a faint gridwork of lines It looked a littlelike thespeaker of the transistor radio hed had when he was seven or eight ANOTHER BENEFIT OF TRAVELLING BARONY CLASS Blaine went on in his smug voice It crossed Jakes mind that Blaine would fit in perfectly at the Piper School The worlds first slotrans dipolar nerd THE HANDSCAN SPECTRUM MAGNIFIER IS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL ALSO CAPABLE OF ADMINISTERING MINOR FIRST AID SUCH AS I HAVE PERFORMED ON

CREATING VERY BELIEVABLE ILLUSIONS AND HALLUCINATIONS WOULD YOU CARE TO HAVE YOUR FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH A NOTED SEXGODDESS FROM YOUR LEVEL OF THE TOWER JAKE OF NEW YORK PERHAPS MARILYN MONROE RAQUEL WELCH OR EDITH BUNKER Jake laughed He guessed that laughing at Blaine might be risky but this time he just couldnt help it There is no Edith Bunker he said Shes just a character on a TV show The actresss name is um Jean Stapleton Also she looks like Mrs Shaw Shes our housekeeper Nice but not  you know  a babe A long silence from Blaine When the voice of the computer returned a certain coldness had replaced the jocose aintwehavingfun tone of voice I CRY YOUR PARDON JAKE OF NEW YORK I ALSO WITHDRAW MY OFFER OF A SEXUAL EXPERIENCE Thatll teach me Jake thought raising one hand to cover a smile Aloud and in what he hoped was a suitably humble tone of voice he said Thats okay Blaine I think Im still a little young for that anyway Susannah and Roland were looking at each other Susannah didnt know who Edith Bunker was  All in the Family hadnt been on the tube in her when But she grasped the essence of the situation just the same Jake saw her full lips form one soundless word and send it to the gunslinger like a message in a soap bubble Mistake Yes Blaine had made a mistake More Jake Chambers a boy of eleven had picked up on it And if Blaine had made one he could make another Maybe there was hope after all Jake decided he would treat that possibility as he had treated the graf of River Crossing and allow himself just a little  Roland nodded imperceptibly at Susannah then turned back to the front of the coach presumably to resume riddling Before he could open his mouth Jake felt his body pushed forward It was funny you couldnt feel a thing when the mono was running flatout but the minute it began to decelerate you knew HERE IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY OUGHT TO SEE Blaine said He sounded cheerful again but Jake didnt trust that tone he had sometimes heard his father start telephone conversations that way usually with some subordinate who had FUB Fucked Up Big and by the end Elmer Chambers would be up on his feet bent over the desk like a man with a stomach cramp and screaming at the top of his lungs his cheeks red as radishes and the circles of flesh under his eyes as purple as an eggplant I HAVE TO STOP HERE ANYWAY AS I MUST SWITCH TO BATTERY POWER AT THIS POINT AND THAT MEANS PRECHARGING The mono stopped with a barely perceptible jerk The walls around them once more drained of color and then became transparent Susannah gasped with fear and wonder Roland moved to his left felt for the side of the coach so he wouldnt bump his head then leaned forward with his hands on his knees and his eyes narrowed Oy began to bark again Only Eddie seemed unmoved by the breathtaking view which had been provided them by the Barony Coachs visual mode He glanced around once face preoccupied and somehow bleary with thought and then looked down at his hands again Jake glanced at him with brief curiosity then stared back out They were halfway across a vast chasm and seemed to be hovering on the moondusted air Beyond them Jake could see a wide boiling river Not the Send unless the rivers in Rolands world were somehow able to run in different directions at different points in their courses and Jake didnt know enough about MidWorld to entirely discount that possibility also this river was not placid but raging a torrent that came tumbling out of the mountains like something that was pissed off and wanted to brawl For a moment Jake looked at the trees which dressed the steep slopes along the sides of this river registering with relief that they looked pretty much all right  the sort of firs youd expect to see in the mountains of Colorado or Wyoming say  and then his eyes were dragged back to the lip of the chasm Here the torrent broke apart and dropped in a waterfall so wide and so deep that Jake thought it made Niagara where he had gone with his parents one of three family vacations he could remember two had been cut short by urgent calls from his fathers Network look like the kind you might see in a thirdrate themepark The air filling the enclosing semicircle of the falls was further thickened by an up rushing mist that looked like steam in it half a dozen moonbows gleamed like gaudy interlocking dreamjewelry To Jake they looked like the overlapping rings which symbolized the Olympics Jutting from the center of the falls perhaps two hundred feet below the point where the river actually went over the drop were two enormous stone protrusions Although Jake had no idea how a sculptor or a team of them could have gotten down to where they were he found it all but impossible to believe they had simply eroded that way They looked like the heads of enormous snarling dogs The Falls of the Hounds he thought There was one more stop beyond this  Dasherville  and then Topeka Last stop Everybody out ONE MOMENT Blaine said I MUST ADJUST THE VOLUME FOR YOU TO ENJOY THE FULL EFFECT There was a brief whispery hooting sound  a kind of mechanical throat clearing  and then they were assaulted by a vast roar It was water  a billion gallons a minute for all Jake knew  pouring over the lip of the chasm and falling perhaps two thousand feet into the deep stone basin at the base of the falls Streamers of mist floated past the blunt almostfaces of the jutting dogs like steam from the vents of hell The level of sound kept climbing Now Jakes whole head vibrated with it and as he clapped his hands over his ears he saw Roland Eddie and Susannah doing the same Oy was barking but Jake couldnt hear him Susannahs lips were moving again and again he could read the words  Stop it Blaine stop it  but he couldnt hear them any more than he could hear Oys barks although he was sure Susannah was screaming at the top of her lungs And still Blame increased the sound of the waterfall until Jake could feel his eyes shaking in their sockets and he was sure his ears were going to short out like overstressed stereo speakers Then it was over They still hung above the moonmisty drop the moonbows still made their slow and dreamlike revolutions before the curtain of endlessly falling water the wet and brutal stone faces of the dogguardians continued to jut out of the torrent but that worldending thunder was gone For a moment Jake thought what hed feared had happened that he had gone deaf Then he realized that he could hear Oy still barking and Susannah crying At first these sounds seemed distant and flat as if his ears had been packed with crackercrumbs but then they began to clarify Eddie put his arm around Susannahs shoulders and looked toward the routemap Nice guy Blaine I MERELY THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENJOY HEARING THE SOUND OF THE FALLS AT FULL VOLUME Blaine said His booming voice sounded laughing and injured at the same time I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HELP YOU TO FORGET MY REGRETTABLE MISTAKE IN THE MATTER OF EDITH BUNKER My fault Jake thought Blaine may just be a machine and a suicidal one at that but he still doesnt like to be laughed at He sat beside Susannah and put his own arm around her He could still hear the Falls of the Hounds but the sound was now distant What happens here Roland asked How do you charge your batteries YOU WILL SEE SHORTLY GUNSLINGER IN THE MEANTIME TRY ME WITH A RIDDLE All right Blaine Heres one of Corts own making and has posed many in its time I AWAIT IT WITH GREAT INTEREST Roland pausing perhaps to gather his thoughts looked up at the place where the roof of the coach had been and where there was now only a starry spill across a black sky Jake could pick out Aton and Lydia  Old Star and Old Mother  and was oddly comforted by the sight of them still glaring at each other from their accustomed places Then the gunslinger looked back at the lighted rectangle which served them as Blaines face  We are very little creatures all of us have different features One of us in glass is set one of us youll find in jet Another you may see in tin and a fourth is boxed within If the fifth you should pursue it can never fly from you What are we  A AND E AND I AND O AND U Blaine replied THE VOWELS OF THE HIGH SPEECH Still no hesitation not so much as a whit Only that voice mocking and just about two steps from laughter the voice of a cruel little boy watching bugs run around on top of a hot stove ALTHOUGH THAT PARTICULAR RIDDLE IS NOT FROM YOUR TEACHER ROLAND OF GILEAD I KNOW IT FROM JONATHAN SWIFT OF LONDON  A CITY IN THE WORLD YOUR FRIENDS COME FROM Thankeesai Roland said and his sai sounded like a sigh Your answer is true Blaine and undoubtedly what you believe of the riddles origins is true as well That Cort knew of other worlds is something I long suspected I think he may have held palaver with the manni who lived outside the city I CARE NOT ABOUT THE MANNI ROLAND OF GILEAD THEY WERE ALWAYS A FOOLISH SECT TRY ME WITH ANOTHER RIDDLE All right What has   HOLD HOLD THE FORCE OF THE BEAM GATHERS LOOK NOT DIRECTLY AT THE HOUNDS MY INTERESTING NEW FRIENDS AND SHIELD YOUR EYES Jake looked away from the colossal rock sculptures jutting from the falls but didnt get his hand up quite in time With his peripheral vision he saw those featureless heads suddenly develop eyes of a fiercely glowing blue Jagged tines of lightning leaped out of them and toward the mono Then Jake was lying on the carpeted floor of the Barony Coach with the heels of his hands pasted against his closed eyes and the sound of Oy whining in one faintly ringing ear Beyond Oy he heard the crackle of electricity as it stormed around the mono When Jake opened his eyes again the Falls of the Hounds were gone Blaine had opaqued the cabin He could still hear the sound though  a waterfall of electricity a force somehow drawn from the Beam and shot out through the eyes of the stone heads Blaine was feeding himself with it somehow When we go on Jake thought he II be running on batteries Then Lud really will be behind us For good Blaine Roland said How is the power of the Beam stored in that place What makes it come from the eyes of yon stone templedogs How do you use it Silence from Blaine And who carved them Eddie asked Was it the Great Old Ones It wasnt was it There were people even before them Or  were they people More silence from Blaine And maybe that was good Jake wasnt sure how much he wanted to know about the Falls of the Hounds or what went on beneath them He had been in the dark of Rolands world before and had seen enough to believe that most of what was growing there was neither good nor safe Better not to ask him the voice of Little Blaine drifted down from over their heads Safer Dont ask him silly questions he wont play silly games Eddie said That distant dreaming look had come onto his face again and when Susannah spoke his name he didnt seem to hear  Roland sat down across from Jake and scrubbed his right hand slowly up the stubble on his right cheek an unconscious gesture he seemed to make only when he was feeling tired or doubtful Im running out of riddles he said Jake looked back at him startled The gunslinger had posed fifty or more to the computer and Jake supposed that was a lot to just yank out of your head with no preparation but when you considered that riddling had been such a big deal in the place where Roland had grown up  He seemed to read some of this on Jakes face for a small smile lemonbitter touched the comers of his mouth and he nodded as if the boy had spoken out loud I dont understand either If youd asked me yesterday or the day before I would have told you that I had at least a thousand riddles stored up in the junkbin I keep at the back of my mind Perhaps two thousand But   He lifted one shoulder in a shrug shook his head rubbed his hand up his cheek again Its not like forgetting Its as if they were never there in the first place Whats happening to the rest of the world is happening to me I reckon Youre moving on Susannah said and looked at Roland with an expression of pity which Roland could look back at for only a second or two it was as if he felt burned by her regard Like everything else here Yes I fear so He looked at Jake lips tight eyes sharp Will you be ready with the riddles from your book when I call on you Yes Good And take heart Were not finished yet Outside the dim crackle of electricity ceased I HAVE FED MY BATTERIES AND ALL IS WELL Blaine announced Marvelous Susannah said dryly Luss Oy agreed catching Susannahs sarcastic tone exactly I HAVE A NUMBER OF SWITCHING FUNCTIONS TO PERFORM THESE WILL TAKE ABOUT FORTY MINUTES AND ARE LARGELY AUTOMATIC WHILE THIS SWITCHOVER TAKES PLACE AND THE ACCOMPANYING CHECKLIST IS RUNNING WE SHALL CONTINUE OUR CONTEST I AM ENJOYING IT VERY MUCH Its like when you have to switch over from electric to diesel on the train to Boston Eddie said He still sounded as if he wasnt quite with them At Hartford or New Haven or one of those other places where no one in their right fucking mind would want to live Eddie Susannah asked What are you   Roland touched her shoulder and shook his head NEVER MIND EDDIE OF NEW YORK Blaine said in his expansive goshbutthisisfun voice Thats right Eddie said Never mind Eddie of New York HE KNOWS NO GOOD RIDDLES BUT YOU KNOW MANY ROLAND OF GILEAD TRY ME WITH ANOTHER And as Roland did just that Jake thought of his Final Essay Blaine is a pain he had written there Blaine is a pain and that is the truth It was the truth all right The stone truth A little less than an hour later Blaine the Mono began to move again  Susannah watched with dreadful fascination as the flashing dot approached Dasherville passed it and made its final dogleg for home The dots movement said that Blaine was moving a bit more slowly now that it had switched over to batteries and she fancied the lights in the Barony Coach were a little dimmer but she didnt believe it would make much difference in the end Blaine might reach his terminus in Topeka doing six hundred miles an hour instead of eight hundred but his last load of passengers would be toothpaste either way Roland was also slowing down going deeper and deeper into that mental junkbin of his to find riddles Yet he did find them and he refused to give up As always Ever since he had begun teaching her to shoot Susannah had felt a reluctant love for Roland of Gilead a feeling that seemed a mixture of admiration fear and pity She thought she would never really like him and that the Detta Walker part of her might always hate him for the way he had seized hold of her and dragged her raving into the sun but her love was nonetheless strong He had after all saved Eddie Deans life and soul had rescued her beloved She must love him for that if for nothing else But she loved him even more she suspected for the way he would never never give up The word retreat didnt seem to be in his vocabulary even when he was discouraged  as he so clearly was now Blaine where may you find roads without carts forests without trees cities without houses ON A MAP You say true sai Next I have a hundred legs but cannot stand a long neck but no head I eat the maids life What am I A BROOM GUNSLINGER ANOTHER VARIATION ENDS I EASE THE MAIDS LIFE I LIKE YOURS BETTER Roland ignored this Cannot be seen cannot be felt cannot be heard cannot be smelt It lies behind the stars and beneath the hills Ends life and kills laughter What is it Blaine THE DARK Thankeesai you speak true The diminished right hand slid up the right cheek  the old fretful gesture  and the minute scratching sound produced by the callused pads of his fingers made Susannah shiver Jake sat crosslegged on the floor looking at the gunslinger with a kind of fierce intensity This thing runs but cannot walk sometimes sings but never talks Lacks arms has hands lacks a head but has a face What is it Blaine A CLOCK Shit Jake whispered lips compressing Susannah looked over at Eddie and felt a passing ripple of irritation He seemed to have lost interest in the whole thing  had zoned out in his weird s slang She thought to throw an elbow into his side wake him up a little then remembered Roland shaking his head at her and didnt You wouldnt know he was thinking not from that slack expression on his face but maybe he was If so you better hurry it up a little precious she thought The dot on the route map was still closer to Dasherville than Topeka but it would reach the halfway point within the next fifteen minutes or so And still the match went on Roland serving questions Blaine sending the answers whistling right back at him low over the net and out of reach What builds up castles tears down mountains makes some blind helps others to see SAND Thankeesai What lives in winter dies in summer and grows with its roots upward AN ICICLE Blaine you say true Man walks over man walks under in time of war he bums asunder A BRIDGE Thankeesai A seemingly endless parade of riddles marched past her one after the other until she lost all sense of their fun and playfulness Had it been so in the days of Rolands youth she wondered during the riddle contests of Wide Earth and Full Earth when he and his friends although she had an idea they hadnt all been his friends no not by a long chalk had vied for the FairDay goose She guessed that the answer was probably yes The winner had probably been the one who could stay fresh longest keep his poor bludgeoned brains aerated somehow The killer was the way Blaine came back with the answer so damned promptly each time No matter how hard the riddle might seem to her Blaine served it right back to their side of the court kaslam Blaine what has eyes yet cannot see THERE ARE FOUR ANSWERS Blaine replied NEEDLES STORMS POTATOES AND A TRUE LOVER Thankeesai Blaine you speak   LISTEN ROLAND OF GILEAD LISTEN KATET Roland fell silent at once his eyes narrowing his head slightly cocked YOU WILL SHORTLY HEAR MY ENGINES BEGIN TO CYCLE UP Blaine said WE ARE NOW EXACTLY SIXTY MINUTES OUT OF topeka at this point   If weve been riding for seven hours or more I grew up with the Brady Bunch Jake said Susannah looked around apprehensively expecting some new terror or small act of cruelty in response to Jakes sarcasm but Blaine only chuckled When he spoke again the voice of Humphrey Bogart had resurfaced TIMES DIFFERENT HERE SHWEETHEART YOU MUST KNOW THAT BY NOW BUT DONT WORRY THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS APPLY AS TIME GOES BY WOULD I LIE TO YOU Yes Jake muttered That apparently struck Blames funny bone because he began to laugh again  the mad mechanical laughter that made Susannah think of funhouses in sleazy amusement parks and roadside carnivals When the lights began to pulse in sync with the laughter she shut her eyes and put her hands over her ears Stop it Blaine Stop it BEG PARDON MAAM drawled the awshucks voice of Jimmy Stewart AHM RIGHT SORRY IF I RUINT YOUR EARS WITH MY RISABILITY Ruin this Jake said and hoisted his middle finger at the routemap Susannah expected Eddie to laugh  you could count on him to be amused by vulgarity at any time of the day or night she would have said  but Eddie only continued looking down at his lap his forehead creased his eyes vacant his mouth hung slightly agape He looked a little too much like the village idiot for comfort Susannah thought and again had to restrain herself from throwing an elbow into his side to get that doltish look off his face She wouldnt restrain herself for much longer if they were going to die at the end of Blaines run she wanted Eddies arms around her when it happened Eddies eyes on her Eddies mind with hers But for now better let him be AT THIS POINT Blaine resumed in his normal voice I INTEND TO BEGIN WHAT I LIKE TO THINK OF AS MY KAMIKAZE RUN THIS WILL QUICKLY DRAIN MY BATTERIES BUT I THINK THE TIME FOR CONSERVATION HAS PASSED DONT YOU WHEN I STRIKE THE TRANSTEEL PIERS AT THE END OF THE TRACK I SHOULD BE TRAVELLING AT BETTER THAN NINE HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR  FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY IN WHEELS THAT IS SEE YOU LATER ALLIGATOR AFTER AWHILE CROCODILE DONT FORGET TO WRITE I TELL YOU THIS IN THE SPIRIT OF FAIR PLAY MY INTERESTING NEW FRIENDS IF YOU HAVE BEEN SAVING YOUR BEST RIDDLES FOR LAST YOU MIGHT DO WELL TO POSE THEM TO ME NOW The unmistakable greed in Blaines voice  its naked desire to hear and solve their best riddles before it killed them  made Susannah feel tired and old I might not have time even so to pose you all my very best ones Roland said in a casual considering tone of voice That would be a shame wouldnt it A pause ensued  brief but more of a hesitation than the computer had accorded any of Rolands riddles  and then Blaine chuckled Susannah hated the sound of its mad laughter but there was a cynical weariness in this chuckle that chilled her even more deeply Perhaps because it was almost sane GOOD GUNSLINGER A VALIANT EFFORT BUT YOU ARE NOT SCHEHERAZADE NOR DO WE HAVE A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS IN WHICH TO HOLD PALAVER I dont understand you I know not this Scheherazade NO MATTER SUSANNAH CAN FILL YOU IN IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW PERHAPS EVEN EDDIE THE POINT ROLAND IS THAT ILL NOT BE DRAWN ON BY THE PROMISE OF MORE RIDDLES WE VIE FOR THE GOOSE COME TOPEKA IT SHALL BE AWARDED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT Once more the diminished hand went up Rolands cheek once more Susannah heard the minute rasp of his fingers against the wiry stubble of his beard We play for keeps No one cries off CORRECT NO ONE CRIES OFF All right Blaine we play for keeps and no one cries off Heres the next AS ALWAYS I AWAIT IT WITH PLEASURE Roland looked down at Jake Be ready with yours Jake Im almost at the end of mine Jake nodded Beneath them the monos slotrans engines continued to cycle upmat beatbeatbeat which Susannah did not so much hear as feel in the hinges of her jaw the hollows of her temples the pulsepoints of her wrists Its not going to happen unless theres a stumper in Jakes book she thought Roland cant pose Blame and I think he knows it I think he knew it an hour ago Blame I occur once in a minute twice in every moment but not once in a hundred thousand years What am I And so the contest would continue Susannah realized Roland asking and Blaine answering with his increasingly terrible lack of hesitation like an allseeing allknowing god Susannah sat with her cold hands clasped in her lap and watched the glowing dot draw nigh Topeka the place where all rail service ended the place where the path of their katet would end in the clearing She thought about the Hounds of the Falls how they had jutted from the thundering white billows below the dark and starshot sky she thought of their eyes Their electricblue eyes Eddie Dean  who did not know Roland sometimes thought of him as ka mai kas fool  heard all of it and heard none of it saw all of it and saw none of it The only thing to really make an impression on him once the riddling began in earnest was the fire flashing from the stone eyes of the Hounds as he raised his hand to shield his eyes from that chainlightning glare he thought of the Portal of the Beam in the Clearing of the Bear how he had pressed his ear against it and heard the distant dreamy rumble of machinery Watching the eyes of the Hounds light up listening as Blaine drew that current into his batteries powering up for his final plunge across MidWorld Eddie had thought Not all is silent in the halls of the dead and the rooms of ruin Even now some of the stuff the Old Ones left behind still works And thats really the horror of it wouldnt t you say Yes The exact horror of it Eddie had been with his friends for a short time after that mentally as well as physically but then he had fallen back into his thoughts again Eddies zonin Henry would have said Let im be It was the image of Jake striking flint and steel that kept recurring he would allow his mind to dwell on it for a second or two like a bee alighting on some sweet flower and then he would take off again Because that memory wasnt what he wanted it was just the way in to what he wanted another door like the ones on the beach of the Western Sea or the one he had scraped in the dirt of the speaking ring before they had drawn Jake  only this door was in his mind What he wanted was behind it what he was doing was kind of well diddling the lock Zoning in Henryspeak His brother had spent most of his time putting Eddie down  because Henry had been afraid of him and jealous of him Eddie had finally come to realize  but he remembered one day when Henry had stunned him by saying something that was nice Better than nice actually mindboggling A bunch of them had been sitting in the alley behind Dahlies some of them eating Popsicles and Hoodsie Rockets some of them smoking Kents from a pack Jimmie Polino  Jimmie Polio they had all called him because he had that fuckedup thing wrong with him that clubfoot  had hawked out of his mothers dresser drawer Henry predictably enough had been one of the ones smoking There were certain ways of referring to things in the gang Henry was a part of and which Eddie as his little brother was also a part of the argot of their miserable little katet In Henrys gang you never beat anyone else up you sent em home with a fuckin rupture You never made out with a girl you fucked that skag til she cried You never got stoned you went on a fuckin bombinrun And you never brawled with another gang you got in a fuckin pisser The discussion that day had been about who youd want with you if you got in a fuckin pisser Jimmie Polio he got to talk first because he had supplied the cigarettes which Henrys homeboys called the fuckin cancersticks opted for Skipper Brannigan because he said Skipper wasnt afraid of anyone One time Jimmie said Skipper got pissed off at this teacher  at the Friday night PAL dance this was  and beat the living shit out of him Sent THE FUCKIN CHAPERONE home with a fuckin rupture if you could dig it That was his homie Skipper Brannigan Everyone listened to this solemnly nodding their heads as they ate their Rockets sucked their Popsicles or smoked their Kents Everyone knew that Skipper Brannigan was a fuckin pussy and Jimmie was full of shit but no one said so Christ no If they didnt pretend to believe Jimmie Polios outrageous lies no one would pretend to believe theirs Tommy Fredericks opted for John Parelli Georgie Pratt went for Csaba Drabnik also known around the nabe as The Mad Fuckin Hungarian Frank Duganelli nominated Larry McCain even though Larry was in Juvenile Detention Larry fuckin ruled Frank said By then it was around to Henry Dean He gave the question the weighty consideration it deserved then put his arm around his surprised brothers shoulders Eddie he said My little bro Hes the man They all stared at him stunned  and none more stunned than Eddie His jaw had been almost down to his beltbuckle And then Jimmie Polio said Come on Henry stop fuckin around This a serious question Who d you want watching your hack if the shit was gonna come down I am being serious Henry had replied Why Eddie Georgie Pratt had asked echoing the question which had been in Eddies own mind He couldnt t fight his way out of a paper bag A wet one So why the fuck Henry thought some more  not Eddie was convinced because he didnt know why but because he had to think about how to articulate it Then he said Because when Eddies in that fuckin zone he could talk the devil into setting himself on fire The image of Jake returned one memory stepping on another Jake scraping steel on flint flashing sparks at the kindling of their campfire sparks that fell short and died before they lit He could talk the devil into setting himself on fire Move your flint in closer Roland said and now there was a third memory one of Roland at the door theyd come to at the end of the beach Roland burning with fever close to death shaking like a maraca coughing his blue bombardiers eyes fixed on Eddie Roland saying Come a little closer Eddie  come a little closer for your fathers sake Because he wanted to grab me Eddie thought Faintly almost as if it were coming through one of those magic doors from some other world he heard Blaine telling them that the endgame had commenced if they had been saving their best riddles now was the time to trot them out They had an hour An hour Only an hour His mind tried to fix on that and Eddie nudged it away Something was happening inside him at least he prayed it was some desperate game of association and he couldnt let his mind get fucked up with deadlines and consequences and all that crap if he did hed lose whatever chance he had It was in a way like seeing something in a piece of wood something you could carve out  a bow a slingshot perhaps a key to open some unimaginable door You couldnt look too long though at least to start with Youd lose it if you did It was almost as if you had to carve while your own back was turned He could feel Blaines engines powering up beneath him In his minds eye he saw the flint flash against the steel and in his minds ear he heard Roland telling Jake to move the flint in closer And dont hit it with the steel Jake scrape it Why am I here If this isnt what I want why does my mind keep coming hack to this place Because its as close as I can get and still stay out of the hurtzone Only a mediumsized hurt actually but it made me think of Henry Being put down by Henry Henry said you could talk the devil into setting himself on fire Yes I always loved him for that That was great And now Eddie saw Roland move Jakes hands one holding flint and the other steel closer to the kindling Jake was nervous Eddie could see it Roland had seen it too And in order to ease his nerves take his mind off the responsibility of lighting the fire Roland had  He asked the kid a riddle Eddie Dean blew breath into the keyhole of his memory And this time the tumblers turned  The green dot was closing in on Topeka and for the first time Jake felt vibration  as if the track beneath them had decayed to a point where Blaines compensators could no longer completely handle the problem With the sense of vibration there at last came a feeling of speed The walls and ceiling of the Barony Coach were still opaqued but Jake found he didnt need to see the countryside blurring past to imagine it Blaine was rolling full out now leading his last sonic boom across the waste lands to the place where MidWorld ended and Jake also found it easy to imagine the transteel piers at the end of the monorail They would be painted in diagonal stripes of yellow and black He didnt know how he knew that but he did TWENTYFIVE MINUTES Blaine said complacently WOULD YOU TRY ME AGAIN GUNSLINGER I think not Blaine Roland sounded exhausted Ive done with you youve beaten me Jake Jake got to his feet and faced the routemap In his chest his heartbeat seemed very slow but very hard each pulse like a fist slamming on a drumhead Oy crouched between his feet looking anxiously up into his face Hello Blaine Jake said and wet his lips HELLO JAKE OF NEW YORK The voice was kindly  the voice perhaps of a nice old fellow with a habit of molesting the children he from time to time leads into the bushes WOULD YOU TRY ME WITH RIDDLES FROM YOUR BOOK OUR TIME TOGETHER GROWS SHORT Yes Jake said I would try you with these riddles Give me your understanding of the truth concerning each Blaine IT IS FAIRLY SPOKEN JAKE OF NEW YORK I WILL DO AS YOU ASK Jake opened the book to the place he had been keeping with his finger Ten riddles Eleven counting Samsons riddle which he was saving for last If Blaine answered them all as Jake now believed he probably would Jake would sit down next to Roland take Oy onto his lap and wait for the end There were after all other worlds than these Listen Blaine In a tunnel of darkness lies a beast of iron It can only attack when pulled back What is it A BULLET No hesitation Walk on the living they dont even mumble Walk on the dead they mutter and grumble What are they FALLEN LEAVES No hesitation and if Jake really knew in his heart that the game was lost why did he feel such despair such bitterness such anger Because hes a pain thats why Blaine is a really BIG pain and Id like to push his face in it just once I think even making him stop is second to that on my wishlist Jake turned the page He was very close to RiddleDeDums tomout answer section now he could feel it under his finger a kind of jagged lump Very close to the end of the book He thought of Aaron Deepneau in the Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind Aaron Deepneau telling him to come back anytime play a little chess and oh just by the way old fatso made a pretty good cup of coffee A wave of homesickness so strong it was like dying swept over him He felt he would have sold his soul for a look at New York hell he would have sold it for one deep lungfilling breath of Fortysecond Street at rush hour He fought it off and went to the next riddle I am emeralds and diamonds lost by the moon I am found by the sun and picked up soon What am I DEW Still relentless Still unhesitating The green dot grew closer to Topeka closing the last of the distance on the routemap One after another Jake posed his riddles one after another Blaine answered them When Jake turned to the last page he saw a boxed message from the author or editor or whatever you called someone who put together books like this We hope youve enjoyed the unique combination of imagination and logic known as RIDDLING I havent Jake thought I havent enjoyed it one little bit and I hope you choke Yet when he looked at the question above the message he felt a thin thread of hope It seemed to him that in this case at least they really had saved the best for last On the routemap the green dot was now no more than a fingers width from Topeka Hurry up Jake Susannah murmured Blaine YES JAKE OF NEW YORK With no wings I fly With no eyes I see With no arms I climb More frightening than any beast stronger than any foe I am cunning ruthless and tall in the end I rule all What am I The gunslinger had looked up blue eyes gleaming Susannah began to turn her expectant face from Jake to the routemap Yet Blaines answer was as prompt as ever THE IMAGINATION OF MAN AND WOMAN Jake briefly considered arguing then thought Why waste our time As always the answer when it was right seemed almost selfevident Thankeesai Blaine you speak true AND THE FAIRDAY GOOSE IS ALMOST MINE I WOT NINETEEN MINUTES AND FIFTY SECONDS TO TERMINATION WOULD YOU SAY MORE JAKE OF NEW YORK VISUAL SENSORS INDICATE YOU HAVE COME TO THE END OF YOUR BOOK WHICH WAS NOT I MUST SAY AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED Everybodys a goddam critic Susannah said sotto voce She wiped a tear from the comer of one eye without looking directly at her the gunslinger took her free hand She clasped it tightly Yes Blaine I have one more Jake said EXCELLENT Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came sweetness THIS RIDDLE COMES FROM THE HOLY BOOK KNOWN AS OLD TESTAMENT BIBLE OF KING JAMES Blaine sounded amused and Jake felt the last of his hope slip away He thought he might cry  not so much out of fear as frustration IT WAS MADE BY SAMSON THE STRONG THE EATER IS A LION THE SWEETNESS IS HONEY MADE BY BEES WHICH HIVED IN THE LIONS SKULL NEXT YOU STILL HAVE OVER EIGHTEEN MINUTES JAKE Jake shook his head He let go of RiddleDeDum and smiled when Oy caught it neatly in his jaws and then stretched his long neck up to Jake holding it out again Ive told them all Im done SHUCKS LIL TRAILHAND THATS A PURED SHAME Blaine said Jake found this drawly John Wayne imitation all but unbearable in their current circumstances LOOKS LIKE I WIN THAT THAR GOOSE UNLESS SOMEBODY ELSE CARES TO SPEAK UP WHAT ABOUT YOU OY OF MIDWORLD GOT ANY RIDDLES MY LITTLE BUMBLER BUDDY Oy the billybumbler responded his voice muffled by the book Still smiling Jake took it and sat down next to Roland who put an arm around him SUSANNAHof NEWyork She shook her head not looking up She had turned Rolands hand over in her own and was gently tracing the healed stumps where his first two fingers had been ROLAND SON OF STEVEN HAVE YOU REMEMBERED ANY OTHERS FROM THE FAIRDAY RIDDLINGS OF GILEAD Roland also shook his head    and then Jake saw that Eddie Dean was raising his There was a peculiar smile on Eddies face a peculiar shine in Eddies eyes and Jake found that hope hadnt deserted him after all It suddenly flowered anew in his mind red and hot and vivid Like    well like a rose A rose in the full fever of its summer Blaine Eddie asked in a low tone To Jake his voice sounded queerly choked YES EDDIE OF NEW YORK Unmistakable disdain I have a couple of riddles Eddie said Just to pass the time between here and Topeka you understand No Jake realized Eddie didnt sound as if he were choking he sounded as if he were trying to hold back laughter SPEAK EDDIE OF NEW YORK  Sitting and listening to Jake run through the last of his riddles Eddie had mused on Rolands tale of the FairDay goose From there his mind had returned to Henry travelling from Point A to Point B through the magic of associative thinking Or if you wanted to get Zen about it via TransBird Airlines goose to turkey He and Henry had once had a discussion about getting off heroin Henry had claimed that going cold turkey wasnt the only way there was also he said such a thing as going cool turkey Eddie asked Henry what you called a hype who had just administered a hot shot to himself and without missing a beat Henry had said You call that baked turkey How they had laughed    but now all this long strange time later it looked very much as if the joke was going to be on the younger Dean brother not to mention the younger Dean brothers new friends Looked like they were all going to be baked turkey before much longer Unless you can yank it out of the zone Yes Then do it Eddie It was Henrys voice again that old resident of his head but now Henry sounded sober and clearminded Henry sounded like his friend instead of his enemy as if all the old conflicts were finally settled all the old hatchets buried Do it  make the devil set himself on fire It II hurt a little maybe but youve hurt worse Hell I hurt you worse myself and you survived Survived just fine And you know where to look Of course In their palaver around the campfire Jake had finally managed to light Roland had asked the kid a riddle to loosen him up Jake had struck a spark into the kindling and then they had all sat around the fire talking Talking and riddling Eddie knew something else too Blaine had answered hundreds of riddles as they ran southeast along the Path of the Beam and the others believed that he had answered every single one of them without hesitation Eddie had thought much the same    but now as he cast his mind back over the contest he realized an interesting thing Blaine had hesitated Once He was pissed too Like Roland was The gunslinger although often exasperated by Eddie had shown real anger toward him just a single time after the business of carving the key when Eddie had almost choked Roland had tried to cover the depth of that anger  make it seem like nothing but more exasperation  but Eddie had sensed what was underneath He had lived with Henry Dean for a long time and was still exquisitely attuned to all the negative emotions It had hurt him too  not Rolands anger itself exactly but the contempt with which it had been laced Contempt had always been one of Henrys favorite weapons Why did the dead baby cross the road Eddie had asked Because it was stapled to the chicken nyucknyucknyuck Later when Eddie had tried to defend his riddle arguing that it was tasteless but not pointless Rolands response had been strangely like Blaines  dont care about taste Its senseless and unsolvable and thats what makes it silly A good riddle is neither But as Jake finished riddling Blaine Eddie realized a wonderful liberating thing that word good was up for grabs Always had been always would be Even if the man using it was maybe a thousand years old and could shoot like Buffalo Bill that word was still up for grabs Roland himself had admitted he had never been very good at the riddling game His tutor claimed that Roland thought too deeply his father thought it was lack of imagination Whatever the reason Roland of Gilead had never won a FairDay riddling He had survived all his contemporaries and that was certainly a prize of sorts but he had never carried home a prize goose I could always haul a gun faster than any of my mates but Ive never been much good at thinking around corners Eddie remembered trying to tell Roland that jokes were riddles designed to help you build up that often overlooked talent but Roland had ignored him The way Eddie supposed a colorblind person would ignore someones description of a rainbow Eddie thought Blaine also might have trouble thinking around comers He realized he could hear Blaine asking the others if they had any more riddles  even asking Oy He could hear the mockery in Blaines voice could hear it very well Sure he could Because he was coming back Back from that fabled zone Back to see if he could talk the devil into setting himself on fire No gun would help this time but maybe that was all right Maybe that was all right because  Because I shoot with my mind My mind God help me to shoot this overblown calculator with my mind Help me shoot it from around the corner Blaine he said and then when the computer had acknowledged him I have a couple of riddles As he spoke he discovered a wonderful thing he was struggling to hold back laughter  SPEAK EDDIE OF NEW YORK No time to tell the others to be on their guard that anything might happen and from the look of them no need either Eddie forgot about them and turned his mil attention to Blaine What has four wheels and flies THE TOWN GARBAGE WAGON AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID Disapproval  and dislike Yeah probably  all but oozing out of that voice ARE YOU SO STUPID OR INATTENTIVE THAT YOU DO NOT REMEMBER IT WAS THE FIRST RIDDLE YOU ASKED ME Yes Eddie thought And what we all missed  because we were fixated on stumping you with some brainbuster out of Rolands past or Jakes book  is that the contest almost ended right there You didnt like that one did you Blaine I FOUND IT EXCEEDINGLY STUPID Blaine agreed PERHAPS THATS WHY YOU ASKED IT AGAIN LIKE CALLS TO LIKE EDDIE OF NEW YORK IS IT NOT SO A smile lit Eddies face he shook his finger at the routemap Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me Or as we used to say back in the neighborhood You can rank me to the dogs and back but Ill never lose the hardon I use to fuck your mother  Hurry up Jake whispered at him If you can do something do it It doesnt like silly questions Eddie said It doesnt like silly games And we knew that We knew it from Charlie the ChooChoo How stupid can you get Hell that was the book with the answers not RiddleDeDum but we never saw it Eddie searched for the other riddle that had been in Jakes Final Essay found it posed it Blaine when is a door not a door Once again for the first time since Susannah had asked Blaine what had four legs and flies there came a peculiar clicking sound like a man popping his tongue on the roof of his mouth The pause was briefer than the one which had followed Susannahs opening riddle but it was still there  Eddie heard it WHEN ITS A JAR OF COURSE Blaine said He sounded dour unhappy THIRTEEN MINUTES AND FIVE SECONDS REMAIN BEFORE TERMINATION EDDIE OF NEW YORKWOULD YOU DIE WITH SUCH STUPID RIDDLES IN YOUR MOUTH Eddie sat bolt upright staring at the routemap and although he could feel warm trickles of sweat running down his back that smile on his face widened Quit your whining pal If you want the privilege of smearing us all over the landscape youll just have to put up with a few riddles that arent quite up to your standards of logic YOU MUST NOT SPEAK TO ME IN SUCH A MANNER Or what Youll kill me Dont make me laugh Just play You agreed to the game now play it Thin pink light flashed briefly out of the routemap Youre making him angry Little Blaine mourned Oh youre making him so angry Get lost squirt Eddie said not unkindly and when the pink glow receded once again revealing a flashing green dot that was almost on top of Topeka Eddie said Answer this one Blaine the big moron and the little moron were standing on the bridge over the River Send The big moron fell off How come the little moron didnt fall off too THAT IS UNWORTHY OF OUR CONTEST I WILL NOT ANSWER On the last word Blaines voice actually dropped into a lower register making him sound like a fourteenyearold coping with a change of voice Rolands eyes were not just gleaming now but blazing What do you say Blaine I would understand you well Are you saying that you cry off NO OF COURSE NOT BUT   Then answer if you can Answer the riddle ITS NOT A RIDDLE Blaine almost bleated ITS A JOKE SOMETHING FOR STUPID CHILDREN TO CACKLE OVER IN THE PLAY YARD Answer now or I declare the contest over and our katet the winner Roland said He spoke in the dryly confident tone of authority Eddie had first heard in the town of River Crossing You must answer for it is stupidity you complain of not transgression of the rules which we agreed upon mutually Another of those clicking sounds but this time it was much louder  so loud in fact that Eddie winced Oy flattened his ears against his skull It was followed by the longest pause yet three seconds at least Then THE LITTLE MORON DID NOT FALL OFF BECAUSE HE WAS A LITTLE MORE ON Blaine sounded sulky MORE PHONETIC COINCIDENCE TO EVEN ANSWER SUCH AN UNWORTHY RIDDLE MAKES ME FEEL SOILED Eddie held up his right hand He rubbed the thumb and forefinger together WHAT DOES THAT SIGNIFY FOOLISH CREATURE Its the worlds smallest violin playing My Heart Pumps Purple Piss for You  Eddie said Jake fell into an uncontrollable fit of laughter But never mind the cheap New York humor back to the contest Why do police lieutenants wear belts The lights in the Barony Coach began to flicker An odd thing was happening to the walls as well they began to fade in and out of true lunging toward transparency perhaps and then opaquing again Seeing this phenomenon even out of the comer of his eye made Eddie feel a bit whoopsy Blaine Answer Answer Roland agreed Answer or I declare the contest at an end and hold you to your promise Something touched Eddies elbow He looked down and saw Susannahs small and shapely hand He took it squeezed it smiled at her He hoped the smile was more confident than the man making it felt They were going to win the contest  he was almost sure of that  but he had no idea what Blaine would do if and when they did TO  TO HOLD UP THEIR PANTS Blames voice firmed and repeated the question as a statement TO HOLD UP THEIR PANTS A RIDDLE BASED UPON THE EXAGGERATED SIMPLICITY OF   Right Good one Blaine but never mind trying to kill time  it wont work Next   I INSIST YOU STOP ASKING THESE SILLY   Then stop the mono Eddie said If youre that upset stop right here and I will NO Okay then on we go Whats Irish and stays out in back of the house even in the rain There was another of those clicks this time so loud it felt like having a blunt spike driven against his eardrum A pause of five seconds Now the flashing green dot on the routemap was so close to Topeka that it lit the word like neon each time it flashed Then PADDY OFURNITURE The correct answer to a jokeriddle Eddie had first heard in the alley behind Dahlies or at some similar gatheringpoint but Blaine had apparently paid a price for forcing his mind into a channel that could conceive it the Barony Coach lights were flashing more wildly than ever and Eddie could hear a low humming from inside the walls  the kind of sound your stereo amp made just before its shit blew up Pink light stuttered from the routemap Stop Little Blaine cried his voice so wavery it sounded like the voice of a character from an old Warner Bros cartoon Stop it youre killing him What do you think hes trying to do to us squirt Eddie thought He considered shooting Blaine one Jake had told while theyd been sitting around the campfire that night  Whats green weighs a hundred tons and lives at the bottom of the ocean Moby Snot  and then didnt He wanted to stick further inside the bounds of logic than that one allowed    and he could do it He didnt think he would have to get much more surreal than the level of say a thirdgrader with a fairtogood collection of Garbage Pail Kids cards in order to fuck Blaine up royally  and permanently Because no matter how many emotions his fancy dipolar circuits had allowed him to mimic he was still an it  a computer Even following Eddie this far into riddledoms Twilight Zone had caused Blaines sanity to totter Why do people go to bed Blaine BECAUSE  BECAUSE  GODS DAMN YOU BECAUSE  A low squalling started up from beneath them and suddenly the Barony Coach swayed violently from right to left Susannah screamed Jake was thrown into her lap The gunslinger grabbed them both BECAUSE THE BED WONT COME TO THEM GODS DAMN YOU NINE MINUTES AND FIFTY SECONDS Give up Blaine Eddie said Stop before I have to blow your mind completely If you dont quit its going to happen We both know it NO I got a million of these puppies Been hearing them my whole life They stick to my mind the way flies stick to flypaper Hey with some people its recipes So what do you say Want to give NO NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS Okay Blaine You asked for it Here comes the cruncher Why did the dead baby cross the road The mono took another of those gigantic lurches Eddie didnt understand how it could still stay on its track after that but somehow it did The screaming from beneath them grew louder the walls floor and ceiling of the car began to cycle madly between opacity and transparency At one moment they were enclosed at the next they were rushing over a gray daylight landscape that stretched flat and featureless to a horizon which ran across the world in a straight line The voice which came from the speakers was now that of a panicky child I KNOW IT JUST A MOMENT I KNOW IT RETRIEVAL IN PROGRESS ALL LOGIC CIRCUITS IN USE   Answer Roland said I NEED MORE TIME YOU MUST GIVE IT TO ME Now there was a kind of cracked triumph in that splintered voice NO TEMPORAL LIMITS FOR ANSWERING WERE SET ROLAND OF GILEAD HATEFUL GUNSLINGER OUT OF A PAST THAT SHOULD HAVE STAYED DEAD No Roland agreed no time limits were set you are quite right But you may not kill us with a riddle still unanswered Blaine and Topeka draws nigh Answer The Barony Coach cycled into invisibility again and Eddie saw what appeared to be a tall and rusty grain elevator go flashing past it was in his view barely long enough for him to identify it Now he fully appreciated the maniacal speed at which they were travelling perhaps three hundred miles faster than a commercial jet at cruising speed Let him alone moaned the voice of Little Blaine Youre killing him I say Killing him Isnt that bout what he wanted Susannah asked in the voice of Detta Walker To die Thats what he said We dont mind either You not so bad Little Blaine but even a world as fucked up as this one has to be better with your big brother gone Its just him takin us with him we been objectin to all this time Last chance Roland said Answer or give up the goose Blaine I  I  YOU    SIXTEEN LOG THIRTYTHREE    ALL COSINE SUBSCRIPTS  ANTI  ANTI  IN ALL THESE YEARS    BEAM    FLOOD    PYTHAGOREAN    CARTESIAN LOGIC    CAN I  DARE I  A PEACH    EAT A PEACH  ALLMAN BROTHERS    PATRICIA    CROCODILE AND

I  Blaine now screaming in the voice of an infant lapsed into some other language and began to sing Eddie thought it was French He knew none of the words but when the drums kicked in he knew the song perfectly well Velcro Fly by ZZ Top The glass over the routemap blew out A moment later the routemap itself exploded from its socket revealing twinkling lights and a maze of circuitboards behind it The lights pulsed in time to the drums Suddenly blue fire flashed out sizzling the surface around the hole in the wall where the map had been scorching it black From deeper within that wall toward Blaines blunt bulletshaped snout came a thick grinding noise It crossed the road because it was stapled to the chicken you dopey fuck Eddie yelled He got to his feet and started to walk toward the smoking hole where the routemap had been Susannah grabbed at the back of his shirt but Eddie barely felt it Barely knew where he was in fact The battlefire had dropped over him burning him everywhere with its righteous heat sizzling his sight frying his synapses and roasting his heart in its holy glow He had Blaine in his sights and although the thing behind the voice was already mortally wounded he was unable to stop squeezing the trigger I shoot with my mind Whats the difference between a truckload of bowling balls and a truckload of dead woodchucks Eddie raved You cant unload a truckload of bowling balls with a pitchfork A terrible shriek of mingled anger and agony issued from the hole where the routemap had been It was followed by a gust of blue fire as if somewhere forward of Barony Coach an electric dragon had exhaled violently Jake called a warning but Eddie didnt need it his reflexes had been replaced with razorblades He ducked and the burst of electricity went over his right shoulder making the hair on that side of his neck stand up He drew the gun he wore  a heavy  with a worn sandalwood grip one of two revolvers which Roland had brought out of MidWorlds ruin He kept walking as he bore down on the front of the coach   and of course he kept talking As Roland had said Eddie would die talking As his old friend Cuthbert had done Eddie could think of many worse ways to go and only one better Say Blaine you ugly sadistic fuck Since were talking riddles what is the greatest riddle of the Orient Many men smoke but Fu Manchu Get it No So solly Cholly How about this one Whyd the woman name her son Seven and a Half Because she drew his name out of a hat He had reached the pulsing square Now he lifted Rolands gun and the Barony Coach suddenly filled with its thunder He put all six rounds into the hole fanning the hammer with the flat of his hand in the way Roland had shown them knowing only that this was right this was proper    this was ka goddammit fucking ka it was the way you ended things if you were a gunslinger He was one of Rolands tribe all right his soul was probably damned to the deepest pit of hell and he wouldnt have changed it for all the heroin in Asia I HATE YOU Blaine cried in his childish voice The splinters were gone from it now it was growing soft mushy I HATE YOU FOREVER Its not dying that bothers you is it Eddie asked The lights in the hole where the routemap had been were fading More blue fire flashed but he hardly had to pull his head back to avoid it the flame was small and weak Soon Blaine would be as dead as all the Pubes and Grays in Lud Its losing that bothers you HATE    FORRRRrmr    The word degenerated into a hum The hum became a kind of stuttery thudding sound Then it was gone Eddie looked around Roland was there holding Susannah with one arm curved around her butt as one might hold a child Her thighs clasped his waist Jake stood on the gunslingers other side with Oy at his heel Drifting out of the hole where the routemap had been was a peculiar charred smell somehow not unpleasant To Eddie it smelled like burning leaves in October Otherwise the hole was as dead and dark as a corpses eye All the lights in there had gone out Your goose is cooked Blaine Eddie thought and your turkeys baked Happy fuckin Thanksgiving  The shrieking from beneath the mono stopped There was one final grinding thud from up front and then those sounds ceased too Roland felt his legs and hips sway gently forward and put out his free hand to steady himself His body knew what had happened before his head did Blaines engines had quit They were now simply gliding forward along the track But  Back he said All the way Were coasting If were close enough to Blaines termination point we may still crash He led them past the puddled remains of Blaines welcoming ice sculpture and to the back of the coach And stay away from that thing he said pointing at the instrument which looked like a cross between a piano and a harpsichord It stood on a small platform It may shift Gods I wish we could see where we are Lie down Wrap your arms over your heads They did as he told them Roland did the same He lay there with his chin pressing into the nap of the royal blue carpet eyes shut thinking about what had just happened I cry your pardon Eddie he said How the wheel of ka turns Once I had to ask the same of my friend Cuthbert    and for the same reason Theres a kind of blindness in me An arrogant blindness I hardly think theres any need of pardoncrying Eddie said He sounded uncomfortable There is I held your jokes in contempt Now they have saved our lives I cry your pardon I have forgotten the face of my father You dont need any pardon and you didnt forget anybodys face Eddie said You cant help your nature Roland The gunslinger considered this carefully and discovered something which was wonderful and awful at the same time that idea had never occurred to him Not once in his whole life That he was a captive of ka  this he had known since earliest childhood But his nature  his very nature  Thank you Eddie I think   Before Roland could say what he thought Blaine the Mono crashed to a final bitter halt All four of them were thrown violently up Barony Coachs central aisle Oy in Jakes arms and barking The cabins front wall buckled and Roland struck it shoulderfirst Even with the padding the wall was carpeted and from the feel undercoated with some resilient stuff the blow was hard enough to numb him The chandelier swung forward and tore loose from the ceiling pelting them with glass pendants Jake rolled aside vacating its landingzone just in time The harpsichordpiano flew off its podium struck one of the sofas and overturned coming to rest with a discordant brrrannnggg sound The mono tilted to the right and the gunslinger braced himself meaning to cover both Jake and Susannah with his own body if it overturned completely Then it settled back the floor still a little canted but at rest The trip was over The gunslinger raised himself up His shoulder was still numb but the arm below it supported him and that was a good sign On his left Jake was sitting up and picking glass beads out of his lap with a dazed expression On his right Susannah was dabbing a cut under Eddies left eye All right Roland said Whos hur   There was an explosion from above them a hollow Pow that reminded Roland of the bigbangers Cuthbert and Alain had sometimes lit and tossed down drains or into the privies behind the scullery for a prank And once Cuthbert had shot some bigbangers with his sling That had been no prank no childish folly That had been  Susannah uttered a short cry  more of surprise than fear the gunslinger thought  and then hazy daylight was shining down on his face It felt good The taste of the air coming in through the blown emergency exit was even better  sweet with the smell of rain and damp earth There was a bony rattle and a ladder  it appeared to be equipped with rungs made of twisted steel wire  dropped out of a slot up there First they throw the chandelier at you then they show you the door Eddie said He struggled to his feet then got Susannah up Okay I know when Im not wanted Lets make like bees and buzz off Sounds good to me She reached toward the cut on Eddies face again Eddie took her fingers kissed them and told her to stop poking the moichandise Jake the gunslinger asked Okay Yes Jake said What about you Oy Oy Guess he is Jake said He raised his wounded hand and looked at it ruefully Hurting again is it the gunslinger asked Yeah Whatever Blaine did to it is wearing off I dont care though  I m just glad to still be alive Yes Life is good So is astin Theres some of it left Aspirin you mean Roland nodded A pill of magical properties but one of the words from Jakes world he would never be able to say correctly Nine out of ten doctors recommend Anacin honey Susannah said and when Jake only looked at her quizzically Guess they dont use that one anymore in your when huh Doesnt matter Were here sugarpie right here and just fine and thats what matters She pulled Jake into her arms and gave him a kiss between the eyes on the nose and then flush on the mouth Jake laughed and blushed bright red Thats what matters and right now thats the only thing in the world that does  First aid can wait Eddie said He put his arm around Jakes shoulders and led the boy to the ladder Can you use that hand to climb with Yes But I cant bring Oy Roland will you Yes Roland picked Oy up and tucked him into his shirt as he had while descending a shaft under the city in pursuit of Jake and Gasher Oy peeked out at Jake with his bright goldringed eyes Up you go Jake climbed Roland followed close enough so that Oy could sniff the kids heels by stretching out his long neck Suze Eddie asked Need a boost And get your nasty hands all over my wellturned fanny Not likely white boy Then she dropped him a wink and began to climb pulling herself up easily with her muscular arms and balancing with the stumps of her legs She went fast but not too fast for Eddie he reached up and gave her a soft pinch where the pinching was good Oh my purity Susannah cried laughing and rolling her eyes Then she was gone Only Eddie was left standing by the foot of the ladder and looking around at the luxury coach which he had believed might well be their katets coffin You did it kiddo Henry said Made him set himself on fire I knew you could fuckinA Remember when I said that to those scagbags behind Dahlies Jimmie Polio and those guys And how they laughed But you did it Sent him home with a fuckin rupture Well it worked anyway Eddie thought and touched the butt of Rolands gun without even being aware of it Well enough for us to walk away one more time He climbed two rungs then looked back down The Barony Coach already felt dead Long dead in fact just another artifact of a world that had moved on Adios Blaine Eddie said So long partner And he followed his friends out through the emergency exit in the roof Jake stood on the slightly tilted roof of Blame the Mono looking southeast along the Path of the Beam The wind riffled his hair now quite long and decidedly unPiperish back from his temples and forehead in waves His eyes were wide with surprise He didnt know what he had expected to see  a smaller and more provincial version of Lud perhaps  but what he had not expected was what loomed above the trees of a nearby park It was a green roadsign against the dull gray autumn sky it almost screamed with color with a blue shield mounted on it Roland joined him lifted Oy gently out of his shirt and put him down The humbler sniffed the pink surface of Blaines roof then looked toward the front of the mono Here the trains smooth bullet shape was broken by crumpled metal which had peeled back in jagged wings Two dark slashes  they began at the monos tip and extended to a point about ten yards from where Jake and Roland stood  gored the roof in parallel lines At the end of each was a wide flat metal pole painted in stripes of yellow and black These seemed to jut from the top of the mono at a point just forward of the Barony Coach To Jake they looked a little like football goalposts Those are the piers he talked about hitting Susannah murmured Roland nodded We got off lucky big boy you know it If this thing had been going much faster  Ka  Eddie said from behind them He sounded as if he might be smiling Roland nodded Just so Ka Jake dismissed the transteel goalposts and turned back toward the sign He was half convinced it would be gone or that it would say something else midworld toll road perhaps or beware of demons but it was still there and still said the same thing Eddie Susannah Do you see that They looked along his pointing finger For a moment  one long enough for Jake to fear he was having a hallucination  neither of them said anything Then softly Eddie said Holy shit Are we back home If we are where are all the people And if something like Blaine has been stopping off in Topeka  our Topeka Topeka Kansas  how come I havent seen anything about it on Sixty Minutes Whats Sixty Minutes Susannah asked She was shading her eyes looking southeast toward the sign TV show Eddie said You missed it by five or ten years Old white guys in ties Doesnt matter That sign   Its Kansas all right Susannah said Our Kansas I guess She had spotted another sign just visible over the trees Now she pointed until Jake Eddie and Roland had all seen it There a Kansas in your world Roland No Roland replied looking at the signs were far beyond the boundaries of the world I knew I was far beyond most of the world I knew long before I met you three This place   He stopped and cocked his head to one side as if he was listening to some sound almost too distant to hear And the expression on his face  Jake didnt like it much Say kiddies Eddie said brightly Today were studying Wacky Geography in MidWorld You see boys and girls in MidWorld you start in New York travel southeast to Kansas and then continue along the Path of the Beam until you come to the Dark Tower   which happens to be smack in the middle of everything First fight the giant lobsters Next ride the psychotic train And then after a visit to our snackbar for a popkin or two   Do you hear anything Roland broke in Any of you Jake listened He heard the wind combing through the trees of the nearby park  their leaves had just begun to turn  and he heard the click of Oys toenails as he strolled back toward them along the roof of the Barony Coach Then Oy stopped so even that sound  A hand seized him by the arm making him jump It was Susannah Her head was tilted her eyes wide Eddie was also listening Oy too his ears were up and he was whining far down in his throat Jake felt his arms ripple with gooseflesh At the same time he felt his mouth tighten in a grimace The sound though very faint was the auditory version of biting a lemon And hed heard something like it before Back when he was only five or six there had been a crazy guy in Central Park who thought he was a musician    well there were lots of crazy guys in Central Park who thought they were musicians but this was the only one Jake had ever seen who played a workshop tool The guy had had a sign beside his upturned hat which read worlds greatest SAWPLAYER SOUNDS HAWAIIAN DOESNT IT PLEASE CONTRIBUTE TO MY WELFARE Greta Shaw had been with Jake the first time he encountered the sawplayer and Jake remembered how she had hurried past the guy Just sitting there like a cellist in a symphony orchestra hed been only with a rustspeckled handsaw spread across his open legs Jake remembered the expression of comic horror on Mrs Shaws face and the quiver of her pressedtogether lips as if  yes as if shed just bitten into a lemon This sound wasnt exactly like the one SOUNDS HAWAIIAN DOESNT IT the guy in the park had made by vibrating the blade of his saw but it was close a wavery trembly metallic sound that made you feel like your sinuses were filling up and your eyes would shortly begin to gush water Was it coming from ahead of them Jake couldnt tell It seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time it was so low he might have been tempted to believe the whole thing was just his imagination if the others hadnt  Watch out Eddie cried Help me you guys I think hes going to faint Jake wheeled toward the gunslinger and saw that his face had gone as white as cottage cheese above the dusty nocolor of his shirt His eyes were wide and blank One corner of his mouth twitched spastically as if an invisible fishhook were buried there Jonas and Reynolds and Depape he said The Big Coffin Hunters And her The Coos They were the ones They were the ones who   Standing on the roof of the mono in his dusty broken boots Roland tottered On his face was the greatest look of misery Jake had ever seen Oh Susan he said Oh my dear  They caught him they formed a protective ring around him and the gunslinger felt hot with guilt and selfloathing What had he done to deserve such enthusiastic protectors What besides tear them out of their known and ordinary lives as ruthlessly as a man might tear weeds out of his garden He tried to tell them he was all right they could stand back he was fine but no words would come out that terrible wavery sound had transported him back to the box canyon west of Hambry all those years ago Depape and Reynolds and old limping Jonas Yet most of all it was the woman from the hill he hated and from black depths of feeling only a very young man can reach Ah but how could he have done aught else but hate them His heart had been broken And now all these years later it seemed to him that the most horrible fact of human existence was that broken hearts mended My first thought was he lied in every wordThat hoary cripple with malicious eye  What words Whose poem He didnt know but he knew that women could lie too women who hopped and grinned and saw too much from the comers of their rheumy old eyes It didnt matter who had written the lines of poesy the words were true words and that was all that mattered Neither Eldred Jonas nor the crone on the hill had been of Martens stature  nor even of Walters  when it came to evil but they had been evil enough Then after in the box canyon west of town    that sound    that and the screams of wounded men and horses    for once in his life even the normally voluble Cuthbert had been struck silent But all that had been long ago in another when in the here and now the warbling sound was either gone or had temporarily fallen below the threshold of audibility They would hear it again though He knew that as well as he knew the fact that he walked a road leading to damnation He looked up at the others and managed a smile The trembling at the comer of his mouth had quit and that was something Im all right he said But hear me well this is very close to where MidWorld ends very close to where EndWorld begins The first great course of our quest is finished We have done well we have remembered the faces of our fathers we have stood together and been true to one another But now we have come to a thinny We must be very careful A thinny Jake asked looking around nervously Places where the fabric of existence is almost entirely worn away There are more since the force of the Dark Tower began to fail Do you remember what we saw below us when we left Lud They nodded solemnly remembering ground which had fused to black glass ancient pipes which gleamed with turquoise witchlight misshapen birdfreaks with wings like great leathern sails Roland suddenly could not bear to have them grouped around him as they were looking down on him as folk might look down on a rowdy who had fallen in a barroom brawl He lifted his hands to his friends  his new friends Eddie took them and helped him to his feet The gunslinger fixed his enormous will on not swaying and stood steady Who was Susan Susannah asked The crease down the center of her forehead suggested she was troubled and probably by more than a coincidental similarity of names Roland looked at her then at Eddie then at Jake who had dropped to one knee so he could scratch behind Oys ears Ill tell you he said but this isnt the place or time You keep sayin that Susannah said You wouldnt just be putting us off again would you Roland shook his head You shall hear my tale  this part of it at least  but not on top of this metal carcass Yeah Jake said Being up here is like playing on a dead dinosaur or something I keep thinking Blaines going to come back to life and start I dont know screwing around with our heads again That sound is gone Eddie said The thing that sounded like a wahwah pedal It reminded me of this old guy I used to see in Central Park Jake said The man with the saw Susannah asked Jake looked up at her his eyes round with surprise and she nodded Only he wasnt old when I used to see him Its not just the geography thats wacky here Times kind of funny too Eddie put an arm around her shoulders and gave her a brief squeeze Amen to that Susannah turned to Rolandher look was not accusing but there was a level and open measurement in her eyes that the gunslinger could not help but admire Im holding you to your promise Roland I want to know about this girl that got my name You shall hear Roland repeated For now though lets get off this monsters back  That was easier said than done Blaine had come to rest slightly askew in an outdoor version of the Cradle of Lud a littered trail of torn pink metal lay along one side of this marking the end of Blaines last journey and it was easily twentyfive feet from the roof of the Barony Coach to the cement If there was a descentladder like the one which had popped conveniently through the emergency hatch it had jammed when they crunched to a halt Roland unslung his purse rummaged and removed the deerskin harness they used for carrying Susannah when the going got too rough for her wheelchair The chair at least would not worry them anymore the gunslinger reflected they had left it behind in their mad scramble to board Blaine What you want that for Susannah asked truculently She always sounded truculent when the harness came into view I hate them honky mahfahs down in Missippi worsen I hate that harness she had once told Eddie in the voice of Detta Walker but sometimes it be a close thing sugar Soft Susannah Dean soft the gunslinger said smiling a little He unbraided the network of straps which made up the harness set the seatpiece aside then pigtailed the straps back together He wedded this to his last good hank of rope with an oldfashioned sheetbend knot As he worked he listened for the warbling of the thinny  as thefour of them had listened for the goddrums as he and Eddie had listened for the lobstrosities to begin asking their lawyerly questions Dadacham Didachee Dumachum as they came tumbling out of the waves each night Ka is a wheel he thought Or as Eddie liked to say whatever went around came around When the rope was finished he fashioned a loop at the bottom of the braided section Jake stepped a foot into it with perfect confidence gripped the rope with one hand and settled Oy into the crook of his other arm Oy looked around nervously whined stretched his neck licked Jakes face Youre not afraid are you Jake asked the humbler  Fraid Oy agreed but he was quiet enough as Roland and Eddie lowered Jake down the side of the Barony Coach The rope wasnt quite long enough to take him all the way down but Jake had no trouble twisting his foot free and dropping the last four feet He set Oy down The bumbler trotted off sniffing and lifted his leg against the side of the terminal building This was nowhere near as grand as the Cradle of Lud but it had an oldfashioned look that Roland liked  white boards overhanging eaves high narrow windows what looked like slate shingles It was a Western look Written in gold gilt on a sign which stretched above the terminals line of doors was this message ATCHISON TOPEKA AND SANTA FE Towns Roland supposed and that last one sounded familiar to him had there not been a Santa Fe in the Barony of Mejis But that led back toward Susan lovely Susan at the window with her hair unbraided and all down her back the smell of her like jasmine and rose and honeysuckle and old sweet hay smells of which the oracle in the mountains had been able to make only the palest mimicry Susan lying back and looking solemnly up at him then smiling and putting her hands behind her head so that her breasts rose as if aching for his hands If you love me Roland then love me    bird and bear and hare and fish    next He looked around at Eddie having to use all of his will to pull himself back from Susan Delgados when There were thinnies here in Topeka all right and of many sorts My mind was wandering Eddie Cry your pardon Susannah next Thats what I asked Roland shook his head You next then Susannah Ill go last Will you be okay With your hand and all Ill be fine Eddie nodded and stuck his foot into the loop When Eddie had first come into MidWorld Roland could have lowered him easily by himself two fingers short the full complement or no but Eddie had been without his drug for months now and had put on ten or fifteen pounds of muscle Roland accepted Susannahs help gladly enough and together they lowered him down Now you lady Roland said and smiled at her It felt more natural to smile these days Yes But for the nonce she only stood there biting her lower lip What is it Her hand went to her stomach and rubbed there as if it ached or griped her He thought she would speak but she shook her head and said Nothing I dont believe that Why do you rub your belly Are you hurt Were you hurt when we stopped She took her hand off her tunic as if the flesh just south of her navel had grown hot No Im fine Are you Susannah seemed to think this over very carefully Well talk she said at last Well palaver if you like that better But you were right before Roland  this isnt the place or time All four of us or just you and me and Eddie Just you and me Roland she said and poked the stump of her leg through the loop Just one hen and one rooster at least to start with Now lower away if you please He did frowning down at her hoping with all his heart that his first idea  the one that had come to mind as soon as he saw that restlessly rubbing hand  was wrong Because she had been in the speaking ring and the demon that denned there had had its way with her while Jake was trying to cross between the worlds Sometimes  often  demonic contact changed things Never for the better in Rolands experience He pulled his rope back up after Eddie had caught Susannah around the waist and helped her to the platform The gunslinger walked forward to one of the piers which had torn through the trains bullet snout fashioning the ropes end into a shakeloop as he went He tossed this over the pier snubbed it being careful not to twitch the rope to the left and then lowered himself to the platform himself bent at the waist and leaving boottracks on Blaines pink side Too bad to lose the rope and harness Eddie remarked when Roland was beside them I aint sorry about that harness Susannah said Id rather crawl along the pavement until I got chewingum all the way up my arms to the elbows We havent lost anything Roland said He snugged his hand into the rawhide footloop and snapped it hard to the left The rope slithered down from the pier Roland gathering it in almost as fast as it came down Neat trick Jake said Eat Rick Oy agreed Cort Eddie asked Cort Roland agreed smiling The drill instructor from hell Eddie said Better you than me Roland Better you than me  As they walked toward the doors leading into the station that low liquid warbling sound began again Roland was amused to see all three of his cohorts wrinkle their noses and pull down the comers of their mouths at the same time it made them look like blood family as well as katet Susannah pointed toward the park The signs looming over the trees were wavering slightly the way things did in a heathaze Is that from the thinny Jake asked Roland nodded Will we be able to get around it Yes Thinnies are dangerous in much the way that swamps full of quicksand and saligs are dangerousDo you know those things We know quicksand Jake said And if saligs are long green things with big teeth we know them too Thats what they are Susannah turned to look back at Blaine one last time No silly questions and no silly games The book was right about that From Blaine she turned her eyes to Roland What about Beryl Evans the woman who wrote Charlie the ChooChoo Do you think shes part of this That we might even meet her Id like to thank her Eddie figured it out but   Its possible I suppose Roland said but on measure I think not My world is like a huge ship that sank near enough shore for most of the wreckage to wash up on the beach Much of what we find is fascinating some of it may be useful if ka allows but all of it is still wreckage Senseless wreckage He looked around Like this place I think I wouldnt exactly call it wrecked Eddie said Look at the paint on the station  its a little rusty from the gutters up under the eaves but it hasnt peeled anywhere that I can see He stood in front of the doors and ran his fingers down one of the glass panels They left four clear tracks behind Dust and plenty of it but no cracks Id say that this building has been left unmaintained at most since   the start of the summer maybe He looked at Roland who shrugged and nodded He was listening with only half an ear and paying attention with only half a mind The rest of him was fixed upon two things the warble of the thinny and keeping away the memories that wanted to swamp him But Lud had been going to wrack and ruin for centuries Susannah said This place  it may or may not be Topeka but what it really looks like to me is one of those creepy little towns on The Twilight Zone You boys probably dont remember that one but   Yes I do Eddie and Jake said in perfect unison then looked at each other and laughed Eddie stuck out his hand and Jake slapped it They still show the reruns Jake said Yeah all the time Eddie added Usually sponsored by bankruptcy lawyers who look like shorthair terriers And youre right This place isnt like Lud Why would it be Its not in the same world as Lud I dont know where we crossed over but   He pointed again at the blue Interstate  shield as if that proved his case beyond a shadow of a doubt If its Topeka where are the people Susannah asked Eddie shrugged and raised his hands  who knows Jake put his forehead against the glass of the center door cupped his hands to the sides of his face and peered in He looked for several seconds then saw something that made him pull back fast Ohoh he said No wonder the towns so quiet Roland stepped up behind Jake and peered in over the boys head cupping his own hands to reduce his reflection The gunslinger drew two conclusions before even looking at what Jake had seen The first was that although this was most assuredly a train station it wasnt really a Blame station    not a cradle The other was that the station did indeed belong to Eddies Jakes and Susannahs world   but perhaps not to their where Its the thinny Well have to be careful Two corpses were leaning together on one of the long benches that filled most of the room but for their hanging wrinkled faces and black hands they might have been revellers who had fallen asleep in the station after an arduous party and missed the last train home On the wall behind them was a board marked departures with the names of cities and towns and baronies marching down it in a line denver read one wichita read another omaha read a third Roland had once known a oneeyed gambler named Omaha he had died with a knife in his throat at a Watch Me table He had stepped into the clearing at the end of the path with his head thrown back and his last breath had sprayed blood all the way up to the ceiling Hanging down from the ceiling of this room which Rolands stupid and laggard mind insisted on thinking of as a stage rest as if this were a stop along some halfforgotten road like the one that had brought him to Tull was a beautiful foursided clock Its hands had stopped at  and Roland supposed they would never move again It was a sad thought   but this was a sad world He could not see any other dead people but experience suggested that where there were two dead there were likely four more dead somewhere out of sight Or four dozen Should we go in Eddie asked Why the gunslinger countered We have no business here it doesnt lie along the Path of the Beam Youd make a great tourguide Eddie said sourly  Keep up everyone and please dont go wandering off into the    Jake interrupted with a request Roland didnt understand Do either of you guys have a quarter The boy was looking at Eddie and Susannah Beside him was a square metal box Written on it in blue was The Topeka CapitalJournal covers Kansas like no other Your hometown paper Read it every day Eddie shook his head amused Lost all my change at some point Probably climbing a tree just before you joined us in an allout effort to avoid becoming snackfood for a robot bear Sorry Wait a minute    wait a minute    Susannah had her purse open and was rummaging through it in a way that made Roland grin broadly in spite of all his preoccupations It was so damned womanly somehow She turned over crumpled Kleenex shook them to make sure there was nothing caught inside fished out a compact looked at it dropped it back came up with a comb dropped that back  She was too absorbed to look up as Roland strode past her drawing his gun from the dockers clutch he had built her as he went He fired a single time Susannah let out a little scream dropping her purse and slapping at the empty holster high up under her left breast Honky you scared the livin Jesus out of me Take better care of your gun Susannah or the next time someone takes it from you the hole may be between your eyes instead of in a  what is it Jake A newstelling device of some kind Or does it hold paper Both Jake looked startled Oy had withdrawn halfway down the platform and was looking at Roland mistrustfully Jake poked his finger at the bullethole in the center of the newspaper boxs locking device A little curl of smoke was drifting from it Go on Roland said Open it Jake pulled the handle It resisted for a moment then a piece of metal clunked down somewhere inside and the door opened The box itself was empty the sign on the back wall read when all papers are gone please take display copy Jake worked it out of its wire holder and they all gathered round What in Gods name     Susannahs whisper was both horrified and accusing What does it mean What in Gods name happened Below the newspapers name taking up most of the front pages top half were screaming black letters CAPTAIN TRIPS SUPERFLU RAGES UNCHECKED Govt Leaders May Have Fled Country Topeka Hospitals Jammed with Sick Dying Millions Pray for Cure Read it aloud Roland said The letters are in your speech I cannot make them all out and I would know this story very well Jake looked at Eddie who nodded impatiently Jake unfolded the newspaper revealing a dotpicture Roland had seen pictures of this type they were called fottergrafs which shocked them all it showed a lakeside city with its skyline in flames cleveland fires burn unchecked the caption beneath read Read kid Eddie told him Susannah said nothing she was already reading the story  the only one on the front page  over his shoulder Jake cleared his throat as if it were suddenly dry and began  The byline says John Corcoran plus staff and AP reports That means a lot of different people worked on it Roland Okay Here goes Americas greatest crisis  and the worlds perhaps  deepened overnight as the socalled superflu known as TubeNeck in the Midwest and Captain Trips in California continues to spread  Although the deathtoll can only be estimated medical experts say the total at this point is horrible beyond comprehension twenty to thirty million dead in the continental US alone is the estimate given by Dr Morris Hackford of Topekas St Francis Hospital and Medical Center Bodies are being burned from Los Angeles California to Boston Massachusetts in crematoria factory furnaces and at landfill sites  Here in Topeka the bereaved who are still well enough and strong enough to do so are urged to take their dead to one of three sites the disposal plant north of Oakland Billard Park the pit area at Heartland Park Race Track the landfill on Southeast Sixtyfirst Street east of Forbes Field Landfill users should approach by Berryton Road California has been blocked by car wrecks and at least one downed Air Force transport plane sources tell us  Jake glanced up at his friends with frightened eyes looked behind him at the silent railway station then looked back down at the newspaper  Dr April Montoya of the StormontVail Regional Medical Center points out that the deathtoll horrifying as it is constitutes only part of this terrible story For every person who has died so far as a result of this new flustrain Montoya said there are another six who are lying ill in their homes perhaps as many as a dozen And so far as we have been able to determine the recovery rate is zero Coughing she then told this reporter Speaking personally Im not making any plans for the weekend  In other local developments  All commercial flights out of Forbes and Phillip Billard have been cancelled  All Amtrak rail travel has been suspended not just in Topeka but across all of Kansas The Gage Boulevard Amtrak station has been closed until further notice  All Topeka schools have also been closed until further notice This includes Districts    Shawnee Heights  and  metro Topeka Topeka Lutheran and Topeka Technical College are also closed as is KU at Lawrence  Topekans must expect brownouts and perhaps blackouts in the days and weeks ahead Kansas Power and Light has announced a slow shutdown of the Kaw River Nuclear Plant in Wamego Although no one in KawNukes Office of Public Relations answered this newspapers calls a recorded announcement cautions that there is no plant emergency that this is a safety measure only KawNuke will return to online status the announcement concludes when the current crisis is past Any comfort afforded by this statement is in large part negated by the recorded statements final words which are not Goodbye or Thank you for calling but God will help us through our time of trial   Jake paused following the story to the next page where there were more pictures a burnedout panel truck overturned on the steps of the Kansas Museum of Natural History traffic on San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridge stalled bumper to bumper piles of corpses in Times Square One body Susannah saw had been hung from a lamppost and that brought back nightmarish memories of the run for the Cradle of Lud she and Eddie had made after parting from the gunslinger memories of Luster and Winston and Jeeves and Maud When the goddrums started up this time it was Spankers stone what came out of the hat Maud had said We set him to dance Except of course what shed meant was that they had set him to hang As they had hung some folks it seemed back home in little old New York When things got weird enough someone always found a lynchrope it seemed Echoes Everything echoed now They bounced back and forth from one world to the other not fading as ordinary echoes did but growing and becoming more terrible Like the goddrums Susannah thought and shuddered  In national developments  Jake read  conviction continues to grow that after denying the superflus existence during its early days when quarantine measures might still have had some effect national leaders have fled to underground retreats which were created as braintrust shelters in case of nuclear war VicePresident Bush and key members of the Reagan cabinet have not been seen during the last fortyeight hours Reagan himself has not been seen since Sunday morning when he attended prayer services at Green Valley Methodist Church in San Simeon   They have gone to the bunkers like Hitler and the rest of the Nazi sewerrats at the end of World War II said Rep Steve Sloan When asked if he had any objection to being quoted by name Kansass firstterm representative a Republican laughed and said Why should I Ive got a real fine case myself Ill be so much dust in the wind come this time next week  Fires most likely set continue to ravage Cleveland Indianapolis and Terre Haute  A gigantic explosion centered near Cincinnatis Riverfront Stadium was apparently not nuclear in nature as was first feared but occurred as the result of a natural gas buildup caused by unsupervised     Jake let the paper drop from his hands A gust of wind caught it and blew it the length of the platform the few folded sheets separating as they went Oy stretched his neck and snagged one of these as it went by He trotted toward Jake with it in his mouth as obedient as a dog with a stick No Oy I dont want it Jake said He sounded ill and very young At least we know where all the folks are Susannah said bending and taking the paper from Oy It was the last two pages They were crammed with obituaries printed in the tiniest type she had ever seen No pictures no causes of death no announcement of burial services Just this one died beloved of soandso that one died beloved of JillnJoe tother one died beloved of themandthose All in that tiny notquiteeven type It was the jaggedness of the type which convinced her it was all real But how hard they tried to honor their dead even at the end she thought and a lump rose in her throat How hard they tried She folded the quarto together and looked on the back  the last page of the CapitalJournal It showed a picture of Jesus Christ eyes sad hands outstretched forehead marked from his crown of thorns Below it three stark words in huge type PRAY FOR US She looked up at Eddie eyes accusing Then she handed him the newspaper one brown finger tapping the date at the top It was June   Eddie had been drawn into the gunslingers world a year later He held it for a long time fingers slipping back and forth across the date as if the passage of his finger would somehow cause it to change Then he looked up at them and shook his head No I cant explain this town this paper or the dead people in that station but I can set you straight about one thing  everything was fine in New York when I left Wasnt it Roland The gunslinger looked a trifle sour Nothing in your city seemed very fine to me but the people who lived there did not seem to be survivors of such a plague as this no There was something called Legionnaires disease Eddie said And AIDS of course   Thats the sex one right Susannah asked Transmitted by fruits and drug addicts Yes but calling gays fruits isnt the done thing in my when Eddie said He tried a smile but it felt stiff and unnatural on his face and he put it away again So this    this never happened Jake said tentatively touching the face of Christ on the back page of the paper But it did Roland said It happened in Junesowing of the year one thousand nine hundred and eightysix And here we are in the aftermath of that plague If Eddies right about the length of time that has gone by the plague of this superflu was this past Junesowing Were in Topeka Kansas in the Reap of eightysix Thats the when of it As to the where all we know is that its not Eddies It might be yours Susannah or yours Jake because you left your world before this arrived He tapped the date on the paper then looked at Jake You said something to me once I doubt if you remember but I do its one of the most important things anyone has ever said to me Go then there are other worlds than these  More riddles Eddie said scowling Is it not a fact that Jake Chambers died once and now stands before us alive and well Or do you doubt my story of his death under the mountains That you have doubted my honesty from time to time is something I know And I suppose you have your reasons Eddie thought it over then shook his head You lie when it suits your purpose but I think that when you told us about Jake you were too fucked up to manage anything but the truth Roland was startled to find himself hurt by what Eddie had said  You lie when it suits your purpose  but he went on After all it was essentially true We went back to times pool the gunslinger said and pulled him out before he could drown You pulled him out Eddie corrected You helped though Roland said if only by keeping me alive you helped but let that go for now Its beside the point Whats more to it is that there are many possible worlds and an infinity of doors leading into them This is one of those worlds the thinny we can hear is one of those doors    only one much bigger than the ones we found on the beach How big Eddie asked As big as a warehouse loading door or as big as the warehouse Roland shook his head and raised his hands palms to the sky  who knows This thinny Susannah said Were not just near it are we We came through it Thats how we got here to this version of Topeka We may have Roland admitted Did any of you feel something strange A sensation of vertigo or transient nausea They shook their heads Oy who had been watching Jake closely also shook his head this time No Roland said as if he had expected this But we were concentrating on the riddling   Concentrating on not getting killed Eddie grunted Yes So perhaps we passed through without being aware In any case thinnies arent natural  they are sores on the skin of existence able to exist because things are going wrong Things in all worlds Because things are wrong at the Dark Tower Eddie said Roland nodded And even if this place  this when this where  is not the ka of your world now it might become that ka This plague  or others even worse  could spread Just as the thinnies will continue to spread growing in size and number Ive seen perhaps half a dozen in my years of searching for the Tower and heard maybe two dozen more The first  the first one  ever saw was when I was still very young Near a town called Hambry He rubbed his hand up his cheek again and was not surprised to find sweat amid the bristles Love me Roland If you love me then love me Whatever happened to us it bumped us out of your world Roland Jake said Weve fallen off the Beam Look He pointed at the sky The clouds were moving slowly above them but no longer in the direction Blames smashed snout was pointing Southeast was still southeast but the signs of the Beam which they had grown so used to following were gone Does it matter Eddie asked I mean  the Beam may be gone but the Tower exists in all worlds doesnt it Yes Roland said but it may not be accessible from all worlds The year before beginning his wonderful and fulfilling career as a heroin addict Eddie had done a brief and notverysuccessful turn as a bicycle messenger Now he remembered certain officebuilding elevators hed been in while making deliveries buildings with banks or investment firms in them mostly There were some floors where you couldnt stop the car and get off unless you had a special card to swipe through the slot below the numbers When the elevator came to those lockedoff floors the number in the window was replaced by an X I think Roland said we need to find the Beam again Im convinced Eddie said Come on lets get going He took a couple of steps then turned back to Roland with one eyebrow raised Where The way we were going Roland said as if that should have been obvious and walked past Eddie in his dusty broken boots headed for the park across the way Roland walked to the end of the platform kicking bits of pink metal out of his way as he went At the stairs he paused and looked back at them somberly Mare dead Be ready Theyre not   um  runny are they Jake asked Roland frowned then his face cleared as he understood what Jake meant No Not runny Dry Thats all right then Jake said but he held his hand out to Susannah who was being carried by Eddie for the time being She gave him a smile and folded her fingers around his At the foot of the stairs leading down to the commuter parking lot at the side of the station half a dozen corpses lay together like a collapsed cornshock Two were women three were men The sixth was a child in a stroller A summer spent dead in the sun and rain and heat not to mention at the mercy of any stray cats coons or woodchucks that might be passing had given the toddler a look of ancient wisdom and mystery like a child mummy discovered in an Incan pyramid Jake supposed from the faded blue outfit it was wearing that it had been a boy but it was impossible to tell for sure Eyeless lipless its skin faded to dusky gray it made a joke of gender  why did the dead baby cross the road Because it was stapled to the superflu Even so the toddler seemed to have voyaged through Topekas empty postplague months better than the adults around it They were little more than skeletons with hair In a scrawny bunch of skinwrapped bones that had once been fingers one of the men clutched the handle of a suitcase that looked like the Samsonites Jakes parents owned As with the baby as with all of them his eyes were gone huge dark sockets stared at Jake Below them a ring of discolored teeth jutted in a pugnacious grin What took you so long kid the dead man who was still clutching his suitcase seemed to be asking Been waiting for you and its been a long hot summer Where were you guys hoping to go Jake wondered Just where in the crispy crap did you think might be safe enough Des Moines Sioux City Fargo The moon They went down the stairs Roland first the others behind him Jake still holding Susannahs hand with Oy at his heels The longbodied bumbler seemed to descend each step in two stages like a double trailer taking speedbumps Slow down Roland Eddie said I want to check the crip spaces before we go on We might get lucky Crip spaces Susannah said Whatre those Jake shrugged He didnt know Neither did Roland Susannah switched her attention to Eddie I only ask sugarpie because it sounds a little onpleasant You know like calling Negroes blacks or gay folks fruits I know Im just a poor ignorant pickaninny from the dark ages of  but   There Eddie pointed at a rank of signs marking the parkingrow closest to the station There were actually two signs to a post the top of each pair blue and white the bottom red and white When they drew a little closer Jake saw the one on top was a wheelchair symbol The one on the bottom was a warning  fine for improper use of handicapped PARKING SPACE strictly enforced by topeka pd See there Susannah said triumphantly They shoulda done that a long time ago Why back in my when youre lucky if you can get your damn wheelchair through the doors of anything smaller than the Shop n Save Hell lucky if you can get it up over the curbs And special parking Forget it sugar The lot was jammed almost to capacity but even with the end of the world at hand only two cars that didnt have little wheelchair symbols on their license plates were parked in the row Eddie had called the crip spaces Jake guessed that respecting the crip spaces was just one of those things that got a mysterious lifelong hold on people like putting zipcodes on letters parting your hair or brushing your teeth before breakfast And there it is Eddie cried Hold your cards folks but I think we have a Bingo Still carrying Susannah on his hip  a thing he wouldhave been incapable of doing for any extended period of time even a month ago  Eddie hurried over to a boat of a Lincoln Strapped on the roof was a complicatedlooking racing bicycle poking out of the halfopen trunk was a wheelchair Nor was this the only one scanning the row of crip spaces Jake saw at least four more wheelchairs most strapped to roofracks some stuffed into the backs of vans or station wagons one it looked ancient and fearsomely bulky thrown into the bed of a pickup truck Eddie set Susannah down and bent to examine the rig holding the chair in the trunk There were a lot of crisscrossing elastic cords plus some sort of locking bar Eddie drew the Ruger Jake had taken from his fathers desk drawer Fire in the hole he said cheerfully and before any of them could even think of covering their ears he pulled the trigger and blew the lock off the securitybar The sound went rolling into the silence then echoed back The warbling sound of the thinny returned with it as if the gunshot had snapped it awake Sounds Hawaiian doesnt it Jake thought and grimaced with distaste Half an hour ago he wouldnt have believed that a sound could be as physically upsetting as  well the smell of rotting meat say but he believed it now He looked up at the turnpike signs From this angle he could see only their tops but that was enough to confirm that they were shimmering again It throws some kind of field Jake thought The way mixers and vacuum cleaners make static on the radio or TV or the way that cyclotron gadget made the hair on my arms stand up when Mr Kingery brought it to class and then asked for volunteers to come up and stand next to it Eddie wrenched the locking bar aside and used Rolands knife to cut the elastic cords Then he drew the wheelchair out of the trunk examined it unfolded it and engaged the support which ran across the back at seatlevel Voila he said Susannah had propped herself on one hand  Jake thought she looked a little like the woman in this Andrew Wyeth painting he liked Christina s World  and was examining the chair with some wonder God almighty it looks so little n light Modem technology at its finest darlin Eddie said Its what we fought Vietnam for Hop in He bent to help her She didnt resist him but her face was set and frowning as he lowered her into the seat Like she expected the chair to collapse under her Jake thought As she ran her hands over the arms of her new ride her face gradually relaxed Jake wandered off a little walking down another row of cars running his fingers over their hoods leaving trails of dust Oy padded after him pausing once to lift his leg and squirt a tire as if he had been doing it all his life Make you homesick honey Susannah asked from behind Jake Probably thought youd never see an honesttoGod American automobile again am I right Jake considered this and decided she was not right It had never crossed his mind that he would remain in Rolands world forever that he might never see another car He didnt think that would bother him actually but he also didnt think it was in the cards Not yet anyway There was a certain vacant lot in the New York when he had come from It was on the comer of Second Avenue and Fortysixth Street Once there had been a deli there  Tom and Gerrys Party Platters Our Specialty  but now it was just rubble and weeds and broken glass and   and a rose Just a single wild rose growing in a vacant lot where a bunch of condos were scheduled to go up at some point but Jake had an idea that there was nothing quite like it growing anywhere else on Earth Maybe not on any of those other worlds Roland had mentioned either There were roses as one approached the Dark Tower roses by the billion according to Eddie great bloody acres of them He had seen them in a dream Still Jake suspected that his rose was different even from those    and that until its fate was decided one way or the other he was not done with the world of cars and TVs and policemen who wanted to know if you had any identification and what your parents names were And speaking of parents I may not be done with them either Jake thought The idea hurried his heartbeat with a mixture of hope and alarm They stopped halfway down the row of cars Jake staring blankly across a wide street Gage Boulevard he assumed as he considered these things Now Roland and Eddie caught up to them This babys gonna be great after a couple of months pushing the Iron Maiden Eddie said with a grin Bet you could damn near puff it along He blew a deep breath at the back of the wheelchair to demonstrate Jake thought of telling Eddie that there were probably others back there in the crip spaces with motors in them then realized what Eddie must have known right away their batteries would be dead Susannah ignored him for the time being it was Jake she was interested in You didnt answer me sug All these cars get you homesick Nah But I was curious about whether or not they were all cars I knew I thought maybe    if this version of  grew out of some other world than my  thered be a way to tell But I cant tell Because things change so dam fast Even in nine years   He shrugged then looked at Eddie You might be able to though I mean you actually lived in  Eddie grunted I lived through it but I didnt exactly observe it I was fucked to the sky most of the time Still I suppose   Eddie started pushing Susannah along the smooth macadam of the parking lot again pointing to cars as they passed them Ford Explorer  Chevrolet Caprice    and that one theres an old Pontiac you can tell because of the split grille   Pontiac Bonneville Jake said He was amused and a little touched by the wonder in Susannahs eyes  most of these cars must look as futuristic to her as Buck Rogers scoutships That made him wonder how Roland felt about them and Jake looked around The gunslinger showed no interest in the cars at all He was gazing across the street into the park toward the turnpike    except Jake didnt think he was actually looking at any of those things Jake had an idea that Roland was simply looking into his own thoughts If so the expression on his face suggested that he wasnt finding anything good there Thats one of those little Chrysler Ks Eddie said pointing and thats a Subaru Mercedes SEL  excellent the car of champions    Mustang   Chrysler Imperial good shape but must be oldern God   Watch it boy Susannah said with a touch of what Jake thought was real asperity in her voice I recognize that one Looks new to me Sorry Suze Really This ones a Cougar   another Chevy   and one more  Topeka loves General Motors big fuckin surprise there    Honda Civic    VW Rabbit a Dodge  a Ford    a   Eddie stopped looking at a little car near the end of the row white with red trim A Takuro he said mostly to himself He went around to look at the trunk A Takuro Spirit to be exact Ever hear of that make and model Jake of New York Jake shook his head Me neither he said Me fucking neither Eddie began pushing Susannah toward Gage Boulevard Roland with them but still mostly off in his own private world walking when they walked stopping where they stopped Just shy of the lots automated entrance stop TAKE TICKET Eddie halted At this rate well be old before we get to yonder park and dead before we raise the turnpike Susannah said This time Eddie didnt apologize didnt seem even to hear her He was looking at the bumper sticker on the front of a rusty old AMC Pacer The sticker was blue and white like the little wheelchair signs marking the crip spaces Jake squatted for a better look and when Oy dropped his head on Jakes knee the boy stroked him absently With his other hand he reached out and touched the sticker as if to verify its reality kansas city monarchs it said The  in Monarchs was a baseball with speedlines drawn out behind it as if it were leaving the park Eddie said Check me if Im wrong on this sport because I know almost zilch about baseball west of Yankee Stadium but shouldnt that say Kansas City Royals You know George Brett and all that Jake nodded He knew the Royals and he knew Brett although he had been a young player in Jakes when and must have been a fairly old one in Eddies Kansas City Athletics you mean Susannah said sounding bewildered Roland ignored it all he was still cruising in his own personal ozone layer Not by  darlin Eddie said kindly By  the Athletics were in Oakland He glanced from the bumper sticker to Jake Minorleague team maybe he asked Triple A The Triple A Royals are still the Royals Jake said They play in Omaha Come on lets go And although he didnt know about the others Jake himself went on with a lighter heart Maybe it was stupid but he was relieved He didnt believe that this terrible plague was waiting up ahead for his world because there were no Kansas City Monarchs in his world Maybe that wasnt enough information upon which to base a conclusion but it felt true And it was an enormous relief to be able to believe that his mother and father werent slated to die of a germ people called Captain Trips and be burned in a  a landfill or something Except that wasnt quite a sure thing even if this wasnt the  version of his  world Because even if this awful plague had happened in a world where there were cars called Takuro Spirits and George Brett played for the KC Monarchs Roland said the trouble was spreading   that things like the superflu were eating through the fabric of existence like battery acid eating its way into a piece of cloth The gunslinger had spoken of times pool a phrase which had at first struck Jake as romantic and charming But suppose the pool was growing stagnant and swampy And suppose these Bermuda Triangletype things Roland called thinnies once great rarities were becoming the rule rather than the exception Suppose  oh and here was a hideous thought one guaranteed to keep you lying awake until way past three  all of reality was sagging as the structural weaknesses of the Dark Tower grew Suppose there came a crash one level falling down into the next and the next and the next until  When Eddie grasped his shoulder and squeezed Jake had to bite his tongue to keep from screaming Youre giving yourself the hoodoos Eddie said What do you know about it Jake asked That sounded rude but he was mad From being scared or being seen into He didnt know Didnt much care either When it comes to the hoodoos Im an old hand Eddie said I dont know exactly whats on your mind but whatever it is this would be an excellent time to stop thinking about it That Jake decided was probably good advice They walked across the street together Toward Gage Park and one of the greatest shocks of Jakes life  Passing under the wroughtiron arch with gage park written on it in oldfashioned curlicued letters they found themselves on a brick path leading through a garden that was half English Formal and half Ecuadorian Jungle With no one to tend it through the hot Midwestern summer it had run to riot with no one to tend it this fall it had run to seed A sign just inside the arch proclaimed this to be the Reinisch Rose Garden and there were roses all right roses everywhere Most had gone over but some of the wild ones still throve making Jake think of the rose in the vacant lot at Fortysixth and Second with a longing so deep it was an ache Off to one side as they entered the park was a beautiful oldtime carousel its prancing steeds and racing stallions now still on their posts The carousels very silence its flashing lights and steamy calliope music stilled forever gave Jake a chill Hung over the neck of one horse dangling from a rawhide strip was some kids baseball glove Jake was barely able to look at it Beyond the carousel the foliage grew even thicker strangling the path until the travellers edged along singlefile like lost children in a fairytale wood Thorns from overgrown and unpruned rosebushes tore at Jakes clothes He had somehow gotten into the lead probably because Roland was still deep inside his own thoughts and that was why he saw Charlie the ChooChoo first His only thought while approaching the narrowgauge traintracks which crossed the path  they were little more than toy tracks really  was of the gunslinger saying that ka was like a wheel always rolling around to the same place again We re haunted by roses and trains he thought Why I dont know I guess its just another rid  Then he looked to his left and OhgoodnesstoChrist fell out of his mouth all in one word The strength ran out of his legs and he sat down His voice sounded watery and distant to his own ears He didnt quite faint but the color drained out of the world until the runningtoriot foliage on the west side of the park looked almost as gray as the autumn sky overhead Jake Jake whats wrong It was Eddie and Jake could hear the genuine concern in his voice but it seemed to be coming over a bad longdistance connection From Beirut say or maybe Uranus And he could feel Rolands steadying hand on his shoulder but it was as distant as Eddies voice Jake Susannah Whats wrong honey What   Then she saw and stopped talking at him Eddie saw and also stopped talking at him Rolands hand fell away They all stood looking  except for Jake who sat looking He supposed that strength and feeling would come back into his legs eventually and he would get up but right now they felt like limp macaroni The train was parked fifty feet up by a toy station that mimicked the one across the street Hanging from its eaves was a sign which read topeka The train was Charlie the ChooChoo cowcatcher and all a  Big Boy Steam Locomotive And Jake knew if he found enough strength to get up on his feet and go over there he would find a family of mice nested in the seat where the engineer whose name had undoubtedly been Bob Somethingorother had once sat There would he another family this one of swallows nested in the smokestack And the dark oily tears Jake thought looking at the tiny train waiting in front of its tiny station with his skin crawling all over his body and his balls hard and his stomach in a knot At night it cries those dark oily tears and theyre rusting the hell out of his fine Stratham headlight But in your time Charlieboy you pulled your share of kids right Around and around Gage Park you went and the kids laughed except some of them werent really laughing some of them the ones who were wise to you were screaming The way Id scream now if I had the strength But his strength was coming back and when Eddie put a hand under one of his arms and Roland put one under the other Jake was able to get up He staggered once then stood steady Just for the record I dont blame you Eddie said His voice was grim so was his face I feel a little like falling over myself Thats the one in your book thats it to the life So now we know where Miss Beryl Evans got the idea for Charlie the ChooChoo Susannah said Either she lived here or sometime before  when the damned thing was published she visited Topeka     and saw the kids train that goes through Reinisch Rose Garden and around Gage Park Jake said He was getting over his scare now and he  not just an only child but for most of his life a lonely child  felt a burst of love and gratitude for his friends They had seen what he had seen they had understood the source of his fright Of course  they were katet It wont answer silly questions it wont play silly games Roland said musingly Can you go on Jake Yes You sure Eddie asked and when Jake nodded Eddie pushed Susannah across the tracks Roland went next Jake paused a moment remembering a dream hed had  he and Oy had been at a traincrossing and the bumbler had suddenly leaped onto the tracks barking wildly at the oncoming headlight Now Jake bent and scooped Oy up He looked at the rusting train standing silently in its station its dark headlamp like a dead eye Im not afraid he said in a low voice Not afraid of you The headlamp came to life and flashed at him once brief but glarebright emphatic I know different I know different my dear little squint Then it went out None of the others had seen Jake glanced once more at the train expecting the light to flash again  maybe expecting the cursed thing to actually start up and make a run at him  but nothing happened Heart thumping hard in his chest Jake hurried after his companions  The Topeka Zoo the World Famous Topeka Zoo according to the signs was full of empty cages and dead animals Some of the animals that had been freed were gone but others had died near to hand The big apes were still in the area marked Gorilla Habitat and they appeared to have died handinhand That made Eddie feel like crying somehow Since the last of the heroin had washed out of his system his emotions always seemed on the verge of blowing up into a cyclone His old pals would have laughed Beyond Gorilla Habitat a gray wolf lay dead on the path Oy approached it carefully sniffed then stretched out his long neck and began to howl Make him quit that Jake you hear me Eddie said gruffly He suddenly realized he could smell decaying animals The aroma was faint mostly boiled off over the hot days of the summer just passed but what was left made him feel like upchucking Not that he could precisely remember the last time hed eaten Oy To me Oy howled one final time then returned to Jake He stood on the kids feet looking up at him with those spooky weddingring eyes of his Jake picked him up took him in a circle around the wolf and then set him down again on the brick path The path led them to a steep set of steps weeds had begun to push through the stonework already and at the top Roland looked back over the zoo and the gardens From here they could easily see the circuit the toy traintracks made allowing Charlies riders to tour the entire perimeter of Gage Park Beyond it fallen leaves clattered down Gage Boulevard before a rush of cold wind So fell Lord Perth murmured Roland And the countryside did shake with that thunder Jake finished Roland looked down at him with surprise like a man awakening from a deep sleep then smiled and put an arm around Jakes shoulders I have played Lord Perth in my time he said Have you Yes Very soon now you shall hear  Beyond the steps was an aviary full of dead exotic birds beyond the aviary was a snackbar advertising perhaps heartlessly given the location topekas best buffaloburger beyond the snackbar was another wrought iron arch with a sign reading come back to gage park real soon Beyond this was the curving upslope of a limitedaccesshighway entrance ramp Above it the green signs they had first spotted from across the way stood clear Tumpikin again Eddie said in a voice almost too low to hear Goddam Then he sighed Whats tumpikin Eddie Jake didnt think Eddie was going to answer when Susannah craned around to look at him as he stood with his fingers wrapped around the handles of the new wheelchair Eddie looked away Then he looked back first at Susannah then at Jake Its not pretty Not much about my life before Gary Cooper here yanked me across the Great Divide was You dont have to   Its also no big deal A bunch of us would get together  me my brother Henry Bum OHara usually cause he had a car Sandra Corbitt and maybe this friend of Henrys we called Jimmie Polio  and wed stick all our names in a hat The one we drew out was the  the tripguide Henry used to call him He  she if it was Sandi  had to stay straight Relatively anyway Everyone else got seriously goobered Then wed all pile into Bums Chrysler and go up  into Connecticut or maybe take the Taconic Parkway into upstate New York    only we called it the Catatonic Parkway Listen to Creedence or Marvin Gaye or maybe even Elvis s Greatest Hits on the tapeplayer It was better at night best when the moon was full Wed cruise for hours sometimes with our heads stuck out the windows like dogs do when theyre riding looking up at the moon and watching for shooting stars We called it tumpikin Eddie smiled It looked like an effort A charming life folks It sounds sort of fun Jake said Not the drug part I mean but riding around with your pals at night looking at the moon and listening to the music    that sounds excellent It was actually Eddie said Even stuffed so full of reds we were as apt to pee on our own shoes as in the bushes it was excellent He paused Thats the horrible part dont you get it Tumpikin the gunslinger said Lets do some They left Gage Park and crossed the road to the entrance ramp  Someone had spraypainted over both signs marking the ramps ascending curve On the one reading st louis  someone had slashed in black On the one marked next rest area  mi had been written in fat red letters That scarlet was still bright enough to scream even after an entire summer Each had been decorated with a symbol  Do you know what any of that truck means Roland Susannah asked Roland shook his head but he looked troubled and that introspective look never left his own eyes They went on  At the place where the ramp merged with the turnpike the two men the boy and the bumbler clustered around Susannah in her new wheelchair All of them looked east Eddie didnt know what the traffic situation would be like once they cleared Topeka but here all the lanes those headed west as well as the eastbound ones on their side were crammed with cars and trucks Most of the vehicles were piled high with possessions gone rusty with a seasons worth of rain But the traffic was the least of their concerns as they stood there looking silently eastward For half a mile or so on either side of them the city continued  they could see church steeples a strip of fast food places Arbys Wendys McDs Pizza Hut and one Eddie had never heard of called Boing Boing Burgers car dealerships the roof of a bowling alley called Heartland Lanes They could see another turnpike exit ahead the sign by the ramp reading Topeka State Hospital and SW th Beyond the offramp there bulked a massive old red brick edifice with tiny windows peering like desperate eyes out of the climbing ivy Eddie figured a place that looked so much like Attica had to be a hospital probably the kind of welfare purgatory where poor folks sat in shitty plastic chairs for hours on end all so some doctor could look at them like they were dogshit Beyond the hospital the city abruptly ended and the thinny began To Eddie it looked like flat water standing in a vast marshland It crowded up to the raised barrel of  on both sides silvery and shimmering making the signs and guardrails and stalled cars waver like mirages it gave off that liquidy humming sound like a stench Susannah put her hands to her ears her mouth drawn down I dont know as I can stand it Really I dont mean to be spleeny but already I feel like vomiting and I havent had anything to eat all day Eddie felt the same way Yet sick as he felt he could hardly take his eyes away from the thinny It was as if unreality had been given    what A face No The vast and humming silver shimmer ahead of them had no face was the very antithesis of a face in fact but it had a body  an aspect  a presence Yes that last was best It had a presence as the demon which had come to the circle of stones while they were trying to draw Jake had had a presence Roland meanwhile was rummaging in the depths of his purse He appeared to dig all the way to the bottom before finding what he wanted a fistful of bullets He plucked Susannahs right hand off the arm of her chair and put two of the bullets in her palm Then he took two more and poked them slug ends first into his ears Susannah looked first amazed then amused then doubtful In the end she followed his example Almost at once an expression of blissful relief filled her face Eddie unshouldered the pack he wore and pulled out the halffull box of s that went with Jakes Ruger The gunslinger shook his head and held out his hand There were still four bullets in it two for Eddie and two for Jake Whats wrong with these Eddie shook a couple of shells from the box that had come from behind the hanging files in Elmer Chamberss desk drawer Theyre from your world and they wont block out the sound Dont ask me how I know that I just do Try them if you want but they wont work Eddie pointed at the bullets Roland was offering Those are from our world too The gunshop on Seventh and Fortyninth Clements wasnt that the name These didnt come from there These are mine Eddie reloaded often but originally brought from the green land From Gilead You mean the wets Eddie asked incredulously The last of the wet shells from the beach The ones that really got soaked Roland nodded You said those would never fire again No matter how dry they got That the powder had been   what did you say Flattened  Roland nodded again So whyd you save them Why bring a bunch of useless bullets all this way What did I teach you to say after a kill Eddie In order to focus your mind  Father guide my hands and heart so that no part of the animal will be wasted  Roland nodded a third time Jake took two shells and put them in his ears Eddie took the last two but first he tried the ones hed shaken from the box They muffled the sound of the thinny but it was still there vibrating in the center of his forehead making his eyes water the way they did when he had a cold making the bridge of his nose feel like it was going to explode He picked them out and put the bigger slugs  the ones from Rolands ancient revolvers  in their place Putting bullets in my ears he thought Ma would shit But that didnt matter The sound of the thinny was gone  or at least down to a distant drone  and that was what did When he turned and spoke to Roland he expected his own voice to sound muffled the way it did when you were wearing earplugs but he found he could hear himself pretty well Is there anything you dont know he asked Roland Yes Roland said Quite a lot What about Oy Jake asked Oy will be fine I think Roland said Come on lets make some miles before dark  Oy didnt seem bothered by the warble of the thinny but he stuck close to Jake Chambers all that afternoon looking mistrustfully at the stalled cars which clogged the eastbound lanes of  And yet Susannah saw those cars did not clog the highway completely The congestion eased as the travellers left downtown behind them but even where the traffic had been heavy some of the dead vehicles had been pulled to one side or the other a number had been pushed right off the highway and onto the median strip which was a concrete divider in the metro area and grass outside of town Somebodys been at work with a wrecker thats my guess Susannah thought The idea made her happy No one would have bothered clearing a path down the center of the highway while the plague was still raging and if someone had done it after  if someone had been around to do it after  that meant the plague hadnt gotten everyone those crammedtogether obituaries werent the whole story There were corpses in some of the cars but they like the ones at the foot of the station steps were dry not runny  mummies wearing seatbelts for the most part The majority of the cars were empty A lot of the drivers and passengers caught in the traffic jams had probably tried to walk out of the plaguezone she supposed but she guessed that wasnt the only reason they had taken to their feet Susannah knew that she herself would have to be chained to the steering wheel to keep her inside a car once she felt the symptoms of some fatal disease setting in if she was going to die she would want to do it in Gods open air A hill would be best someplace with a little elevation but even a wheatfield would do came it to that Anything but coughing your last while smelling the airfreshener dangling from the rearview mirror At one time Susannah guessed they would have been able to see many of the corpses of the fleeing dead but not now Because of the thinny They approached it steadily and she knew exactly when they entered it A kind of tingling shudder ran through her body making her draw her shortened legs up and the wheelchair stopped for a moment When she turned around she saw Roland Eddie and Jake holding their stomachs and grimacing They looked as if they had all been stricken with the bellyache at the same time Then Eddie and Roland straightened up Jake bent to stroke Oy who had been staring at him anxiously You boys all right Susannah asked The question came out in the halfquerulous halfhumorous voice of Detta Walker Using that voice was nothing she planned sometimes it just came out Yeah Jake said Feels like I got a bubble in my throat though He was staring uneasily at the thinny Its silvery blankness was all around them now as if the whole world had turned into a flat Norfolk fen at dawn Nearby trees poked out of its silver surface casting distorted reflections that never stayed quite still or quite in focus A little farther away Susannah could see a grainstorage tower seeming to float The words gaddish feeds were written on the side in pink letters which might have been red under normal conditions Feels to me like I got a bubble in my mind Eddie said Man look at that shit shimmer Can you still hear it Susannah asked Yeah But faint I can live with it Can you Uhhuh Lets go It was like riding in an opencockpit plane through broken clouds Susannah decided Theyd go for what felt like miles through that humming brightness that was not quite fog and not quite water sometimes seeing shapes a bam a tractor a Stuckeys billboard loom out of it then losing everything but the road which ran consistently above the thinnys bright but somehow indistinct surface Then all at once they would run into the clear The humming would fall away to a faint drone you could even unplug your ears and not be too bothered at least until you got near the other side of the break Once again there were vistas  Well no that was too grand Kansas didnt exactly have vistas but there were open fields and the occasional copse of autumnbright trees marking a spring or cowpond No Grand Canyon or surf crashing on Portland Headlight hut at least you could see a byGod horizon off in the distance and lose some of that unpleasant feeling of entombment Then back into the goop you went Jake came closest to describing it she thought when he said that being in the thinny was like finally reaching the shining watermirage you could often see far up the highway on hot days Whatever it was and however you described it being inside it was claustrophobic purgatorial all the world gone except for the twin barrels of the turnpike and the hulks of the cars like derelict ships abandoned on a frozen ocean Please help us get out of this Susannah prayed to a God in whom she no longer precisely believed  she still believed in something but since awakening to Rolands world on the beach of the Western Sea her concept of the invisible world had changed considerably Please help us find the Beam again Please help us escape this world of silence and death They ran into the biggest clear space they had yet come to near a roadsign which read big springs  mi Behind them in the west the setting sun shone through a brief rift in the clouds skipping scarlet splinters across the top of the thinny and lighting the windows and taillights of the stalled cars in tones of fire On either side of them empty fields stretched away Full Earth come and gone Susannah thought Reaping come and gone too This is what Roland calls closing the year The thought made her shiver Well camp here for the night Roland said soon after they had passed the Big Springs exit ramp Up ahead they could see the thinny encroaching on the highway again but that was miles farther on  you could see a damn long way in eastern Kansas Susannah was discovering We can get firewood without going too near the thinny and the sound wont be too bad We may even be able to sleep without bullets stuffed into our ears Eddie and Jake climbed over the guardrails descended the bank and foraged for wood along a dry creekbed staying together as Roland admonished them to do When they came back the clouds had gulped the sun again and an ashy uninteresting twilight had begun to creep over the world The gunslinger stripped twigs for kindling then laid his fuel around them in his usual fashion building a kind of wooden chimney in the breakdown lane As he did it Eddie strolled across to the median strip and stood there hands in pockets looking east After a few moments Jake and Oy joined him Roland produced his flint and steel scraped fire into the shaft of his chimney and soon the little campfire was burning Roland Eddie called Suze Come over here Look at this Susannah started rolling her chair toward Eddie then Roland  after a final check of his campfire  took hold of the handles and pushed her Look at what Susannah asked Eddie pointed At first Susannah saw nothing although the turnpike was perfectly visible even beyond the point where the thinny closed in again perhaps three miles ahead Then  yes she might see something Maybe A kind of shape at the farthest edge of vision If not for the fading daylight Is it a building Jake asked Cripes it looks like its built right across the highway What about it Roland Eddie asked Youve got the best eyes in the universe For a time the gunslinger said nothing only looked up the median strip with his thumbs hooked in his gunbelt At last he said Well see it better when we get closer Oh come on Eddie said I mean holy shit Do you know what it is or not Well see it better when we get closer the gunslinger repeated  which was of course no answer at all He moseyed back across the eastbound lanes to check on his campfire bootheels clicking on the pavement Susannah looked at Jake and Eddie She shrugged They shrugged back    and then Jake burst into bright peals of laughter Usually Susannah thought the kid acted more like an eighteenyearold than a boy of eleven but that laughter made him sound about ninegoingonten and she didnt mind a bit She looked down at Oy who was looking at them earnestly and rolling his shoulders in an effort to shrug  They ate the leafwrapped delicacies Eddie called gunslinger burritos drawing closer to the fire and feeding it more wood as the dark drew down Somewhere south a bird cried out  it was just about the loneliest sound he had ever heard in his life Eddie reckoned None of them talked much and it occurred to him that at this time of their day hardly anyone ever did As if the time when the earth swapped day for dark was special a time that somehow closed them off from the powerful fellowship Roland called katet Jake fed Oy small scraps of dried deermeat from his last burrito Susannah sat on her bedroll legs crossed beneath her hide smock looking dreamily into the fire Roland lay back on his elbows looking up at the sky where the clouds had begun to melt away from the stars Looking up himself Eddie saw that Old Star and Old Mother were gone their places taken by Polaris and the Big Dipper This might not be his world  Takuro automobiles the Kansas City Monarchs and a food franchise called Boing Boing Burgers all suggested it wasnt  but Eddie thought it was too close for comfort Maybe he thought the world next door When the bird cried in the distance again he roused himself and looked at Roland You had something you were going to tell us he said A thrilling tale of your youth I believe Susan  that was her name wasnt it For a moment longer the gunslinger continued to look up at the sky  now it was Roland who must find himself adrift in the constellations Eddie realized  and then he shifted his gaze to his friends He looked strangely apologetic strangely uneasy Would you think I was cozening he said if I asked for one more day to think of these things Or perhaps its a night to dream of them that I really want They are old things dead things perhaps but I   He raised his hands in a kind of distracted gesture Some things dont rest easy even when theyre dead Their bones cry out from the ground There are ghosts Jake said and in his eyes Eddie saw a shadow of the horror he must have felt inside the house in Dutch Hill The horror he must have felt when the Doorkeeper came out of the wall and reached for him Sometimes there are ghosts and sometimes they come back Yes Roland said Sometimes there are and sometimes they do Maybe its better not to brood Susannah said Sometimes  especially when you know a things going to be hard  its better just to get on your horse and ride Roland thought this over carefully then raised his eyes to look at her At tomorrow nights fire I will tell you of Susan he said This I promise on my fathers name Do we need to hear Eddie asked abruptly He was almost astounded to hear this question coming out of his mouth no one had been more curious about the gunslingers past than Eddie himself I mean if it really hurts Roland    hurts bigtime    maybe Im not sure you need to hear but I think I need to tell Our future is the Tower and to go toward it with a whole heart I must put my past to rest as best I may Theres no way I could tell you all of it  in my world even the past is in motion rearranging itself in many vital ways  but this one story may stand for all the rest Is it a Western Jake asked suddenly Roland looked at him puzzled I dont take your meaning Jake Gilead is a Barony of the Western World yes and Mejis as well but   Itll be a Western Eddie said All Rolands stories are Westerns when you get right down to it He lay back and pulled his blanket over him Faintly from both east and west he could hear the warble of the thinny He checked in his pocket for the bullets Roland had given him and nodded with satisfaction when he felt them He reckoned he could sleep without them tonight but he would want them again tomorrow They werent done tumpikin just yet Susannah leaned over him kissed the tip of his nose Done for the day sugar Yep Eddie said and laced his hands together behind his head Its not every day that I hook a ride on the worlds fastest train destroy the worlds smartest computer and then discover that everyones been scragged by the flu All before dinner too Shit like that makes a man tired Eddie smiled and closed his eyes He was still smiling when sleep took him  In his dream they were all standing on the comer of Second Avenue and Fortysixth Street looking over the short board fence and into the weedy vacant lot behind it They were wearing their MidWorld clothes  a motley combination of deerskin and old shirts mostly held together with spit and shoelaces  but none of the pedestrians hurrying by on Second seemed to notice No one noticed the billybumbler in Jakes arms or the artillery they were packing either Because were ghosts Eddie thought Were ghosts and we dont rest easy On the fence there were handbills  one for the Sex Pistols a reunion tour according to the poster and Eddie thought that was pretty funny  the Pistols was one group that was never going to get back together one for a comic Adam Sandier that Eddie had never heard of one for a movie called The Craft about teenage witches Beyond that one written in letters the dusky pink of summer roses was this See the bear of fearsome size All the worlds within his eyes time grows thin the pasts a riddle The tower awaits you in the middle There  Jake said pointing The rose See how it awaits us there in the middle of the lot  Yes its very beautiful  Susannah said Then she pointed to the sign standing near the rose and facing Second Avenue Her voice and her eyes were troubled But what about that  According to the sign two outfits  Mills Construction and Sombra Real Estate  were going to combine on something called Turtle Bay Condominiums said condos to be erected on this very spot When coming soon was all the sign had to say in that regard Iwouldnt worry about that  Jake said That sign was here before Its probably old as the hi   At that moment the revving sound of an engine tore into the air From beyond the fence on the Fortysixth Street side of the lot chugs of dirty brown exhaust ascended like badnews smoke signals Suddenly the boards on that side burst open and a huge red bulldozer lunged through Even the blade was red although the words slashed across its scoop  all hail the crimson king  were written in a yellow as bright as panic Sitting in the peakseat his rotting face leering at them from above the controls was the man who had kidnapped Jake from the bridge over the River Send  their old pal Gasher On the front of his cockedback hardhat the words lamerk foundry stood out in black Above them a single staring eye had been painted Gasher lowered the dozers blade It tore across the lot on a diagonal smashing brick pulverizing beer and soda bottles to glittering powder striking sparks from the rocks Directly in its path the rose nodded its delicate head Lets see you ask some of yer silly questions now this unwelcome apparition cried Ask all yer wants my dear little culls why not Wery fond of riddles is yer old pal Gasher Just so you understand that no matter what yer ask Im gointer run that nasty thing over mash it flat aye so I will Then back over it Ill go Root and branch my dear little culls Aye root and branch Susannah shrieked as the scarlet bulldozer blade bore down on the rose and Eddie grabbed for the fence He would vault over it throw himself on the rose try to protect it  except it was too late And he knew it He looked back up at the cackling thing in the bulldozers peakseat and saw that Gasher was gone Now the man at the controls was Engineer Bob from Charlie the ChooChoo Stop Eddie screamed For Christs sake stop I cant Eddie The world has moved on and I cant stop I must move on with it  And as the shadow of the dozer fell over the rose as the blade tore through one of the posts holding up the sign Eddie saw coming soon had changed to coming now he realized that the man at the controls wasnt Engineer Bob either It was Roland  Eddie sat up in the breakdown lane of the turnpike gasping breath he could see in the air and with sweat already chilling on his hot skin He was sure he had screamed must have screamed but Susannah still slept beside him with only the top of her head poking out of the bedroll they shared and Jake was snoring softly off to the left one arm out of his own blankets and curled around Oy The bumbler was also sleeping Roland wasnt Roland sat calmly on the far side of the dead campfire cleaning his guns by starlight and looking at Eddie Bad dreams Not a question Yeah A visit from your brother Eddie shook his head The Tower then The field of roses and the Tower Rolands face remained impassive but Eddie could hear the subtle eagerness which always came into his voice when the subject was the Dark Tower Eddie had once called the gunslinger a Tower junkie and Roland hadnt denied it Not this time What then Eddie shivered Cold Yes Thank your gods theres no rain at least Autumn rains an evil to be avoided whenever one may What was your dream Still Eddie hesitated Youd never betray us would you Roland No man can say that for sure Eddie and I have already played the betrayer more than once To my shame But  I think those days are over We are one katet If I betray any one of you  even Jakes furry friend perhaps  I betray myself Why do you ask And youd never betray your quest Renounce the Tower No Eddie Not that not ever Tell me your dream Eddie did omitting nothing When he had finished Roland looked down at his guns frowning They seemed to have reassembled themselves while Eddie was talking So what does it mean that I saw you driving that dozer at the end That I still dont trust you That subconsciously   Is this ologyofthepsyche The cabala I have heard you and Susannah speak of Yes I guess it is Its shit Roland said dismissively Mudpies of the mind Dreams either mean nothing or everything  and when they mean everything they almost always come as messages from    well from other levels of the Tower He gazed at Eddie shrewdly And not all messages are sent by friends Something or someone is fucking with my head Is that what you mean I think it possible But you must watch me all the same I bear watching as you well know I trust you Eddie said and the very awkwardness with which he spoke lent his words sincerity Roland looked touched almost shaken and Eddie wondered how he ever could have thought this man an emotionless robot Roland might be a little short on imagination but he had feelings all right One thing about your dream concerns me very much Eddie The bulldozer The machine yes The threat to the rose Jake saw the rose Roland It was fine Roland nodded In his when the when of that particular day the rose was thriving But that doesnt mean it will continue to do so If the construction the sign spoke of comes    if the bulldozer comes  There are other worlds than these Eddie said Remember Some things may exist only in one In one where in one when Roland lay down and looked up at the stars We must protect that rose he said We must protect it at all costs You think its another door dont you One that opens on the Dark Tower The gunslinger looked at him from eyes that ran with starshine I think it may be the Tower he said And if its destroyed   His eyes closed He said no more Eddie lay awake late  The new day dawned clear and bright and cold In the strong morning sunlight the thing Eddie had spotted the evening before was more clearly visible   but he still couldnt tell what it was Another riddle and he was getting damned sick of them He stood squinting at it shading his eyes from the sun with Susannah on one side of him and Jake on the other Roland was back by the campfire packing what he called their gunna a word which seemed to mean all their worldly goods He appeared not to be concerned with the thing up ahead or to know what it was How far away Thirty miles Fifty The answer seemed to depend on how far could you see in all this flat land and Eddie didnt know the answer One thing he felt quite sure of was that Jake had been right on at least two counts  it was some kind of building and it sprawled across all four lanes of the highway It must how else could they see it It would have been lost in the thinny  wouldnt it Maybe its standing in one of those open patches  what Suze callsthe holes in the clouds Or maybe the thinny ends beforewe get that far or maybe its a goddam hallucination In any case you might as well put it out of your mind for the time being Got a little more turnpikin to do Still the building held him It looked like an airy Arabian Nights confection of blue and gold    except Eddie had an idea that the blue was stolen from the sky and the gold from the newly risen sun Roland come here a second At first he didnt think the gunslinger would but then Roland cinched a rawhide lace on Susannahs pack rose put his hands in the small of his back stretched and walked over to them Gods one would think no one in this band has the wit to housekeep but me Roland said Well pitch in Eddie said we always do dont we But look at that thing first Roland did but only with a quick glance as if he did not even want to acknowledge it Its glass isnt it Eddie asked Roland took another brief look I wot he said a phrase which seemed to mean Reckon so partner Weve got lots of glass buildings where I come from but most of them are office buildings That thing up ahead looks more like something from Disney World Do you know what it is No Then why dont you want to look at it Susannah asked Roland did take another look at the distant blaze of light on glass but once again it was quick  little more than a peek Because its trouble Roland said and its in our road Well get there in time No need to live in trouble until trouble comes Will we get there today Jake asked Roland shrugged his face still closed Therell be water if God wills it he said Christ you could have made a fortune writing fortune cookies Eddie said He hoped for a smile at least but got none Roland simply walked back across the road dropped to one knee shouldered his purse and his pack and waited for the others When they were ready the pilgrims resumed their walk east along Interstate  The gunslinger led walking with his head down and his eyes on the toes of his boots  Roland was quiet all day and as the building ahead of them neared trouble and in our road he had said Susannah came to realize it wasnt grumpiness they were seeing or worry about anything which lay any farther ahead of them than tonight It was the story hed promised to tell them that Roland was thinking about and he was a lot more than worried By the time they stopped for their noon meal they could clearly see the building ahead  a manyturreted palace which appeared to be made entirely of reflective glass The thinny lay close around it but the palace rose serenely above all its turrets trying for the sky Madly strange here in the flat countryside of eastern Kansas of course it was but Susannah thought it the most beautiful building she had ever seen in her life even more beautiful than the Chrysler Building and that was going some As they drew closer she found it more and more difficult to look elsewhere Watching the reflections of the puffy clouds sailing across the glass castles bluesky wains and walls was like watching some splendid illusion  yet there was a solidity to it as well An inarguability Some of that was probably just the shadow it threw  mirages did not so far as she knew create shadows  but not all It just was She had no idea what such a fabulosity was doing out here in the land of Stuckeys and Hardees not to mention Boing Boing Burgers but there it was She reckoned that time would tell the rest  They made camp in silence watched Roland build the wooden chimney that would be their fire in silence then sat before it in silence watching the sunset turn the huge glass edifice ahead of them into a castle of fire Its towers and battlements glowed first a fierce red then orange then a gold which cooled rapidly to ocher as Old Star appeared in the firmament above them  No she thought in Deltas voice Aint dat one girl Not tall Thats the North Star Same one you seen back home sittin on yo daddys lap But it was Old Star she wanted she discovered Old Star and Old Mother She was astounded to find herself homesick for Rolands world and then wondered why she should be so surprised It was a world after all where no one had called her a nigger bitch at least not yet a world where she had found someone to love    and made good friends as well That last made her feel a little bit like crying and she hugged Jake to her He let himself be hugged smiling his eyes halfclosed At some distance unpleasant but bearable even without bullet earplugs the thinny warbled its moaning song When the last traces of yellow began to fade from the castle up the road Roland left them to sit in the turnpike travel lane and returned to his fire He cooked more leafwrapped deermeat and handed the food around They ate in silence Roland actually ate almost nothing Susannah observed By the time they were finished they could see the Milky Way scattered across the walls of the castle ahead of them fierce points of reflection that burned like fire in still water Eddie was the one who finally broke the silence You dont have to he said Youre excused Or absolved Or whatever the hell it is you need to take that look off your face Roland ignored him He drank tilting the waterskin up on his elbow like some hick drinking moonshine from a jug head back eyes on the stars The last mouthful he spat to the roadside Life for your crop Eddie said He did not smile Roland said nothing but his cheek went pale as if he had seen a ghost Or heard one  The gunslinger turned to Jake who looked back at him seriously I went through the trial of manhood at the age of fourteen the youngest of my katel  of my class you would say  and perhaps the youngest ever I told you some of that Jake Do you remember You told all of us some of that Susannah thought but kept her mouth shut and warned Eddie with her eyes to do the same Roland hadnt been himself during that telling with Jake both dead and alive within his head the man had been fighting madness You mean when we were chasing Walter Jake said After the way station but before I I took my fall Thats right I remember a little but thats all The way you remember the stuff you dream about Roland nodded Listen then I would tell you more this time Jake because you are older I suppose we all are Susannah was no less fascinated with the story the second time how the boy Roland had chanced to discover Marten his fathers advisor his fathers wizard in his mothers apartment Only none of it had been by chance of course the boy would have passed her door with no more than a glance had Marten not opened it and invited him in Marten had told Roland that his mother wanted to see him but one look at her rueful smile and downcast eyes as she sat in her lowback chair told the boy he was the last person in the world Gabrielle Deschain wanted to see just then The flush on her cheek and the lovebite on the side of her neck told him everything else Thus had he been goaded by Marten into an early trial of manhood and by employing a weapon his teacher had not expected  his hawk David  Roland had defeated Cort taken his stick  and made the enemy of his life in Marten Broadcloak Beaten badly face swelling into something that looked like a childs goblin mask slipping toward a coma Cort had fought back unconsciousness long enough to offer his newest apprentice gunslinger counsel stay away from Marten yet awhile Cort had said He told me to let the story of our battle grow into a legend the gunslinger told Eddie Susannah and Jake To wait until my shadow had grown hair on its face and haunted Marten in his dreams Did you take his advice Susannah asked I never got a chance Roland said His face cracked in a rueful painful smile I meant to think about it and seriously but before I even got started on my thinking things  changed They have a way of doing that dont they Eddie said My goodness yes I buried my hawk the first weapon I ever wielded and perhaps the finest Then  and this part Im sure I didnt tell you before Jake  I went into the lower town That summers heat broke in storms full of thunder and hail and in a room above one of the brothels where Cort had been wont to roister I lay with a woman for the first time He poked a stick thoughtfully into the fire seemed to become aware of the unconscious symbolism in what he was doing and threw it away with a lopsided grin It landed smoldering near the tire of an abandoned Dodge Aspen and went out It was good The sex was good Not the great thing I and my friends had thought about and whispered about and wondered about of course   I think storebought pussy tends to be overrated by the young sugar Susannah said I fell asleep listening to the sots downstairs singing along with the piano and to the sound of hail on the window I awoke the next morning in  well   lets just say I awoke in a way I never would have expected to awake in such a place Jake fed fresh fuel to the fire It flared up painting highlights on Rolands cheeks brushing crescents of shadow beneath his brows and below his lower lip And as he talked Susannah found she could almost see what had happened on that longago morning that must have smelled of wet cobblestones and rainsweetened summer air what had happened in a whores crib above a drinkingdive in the lower town of Gilead Barony seat of New Canaan one small mote of land located in the western regions of MidWorld One boy still aching from his battle of the day before and newly educated in the mysteries of sex One boy now looking twelve instead of fourteen his lashes dusting down thick upon his cheeks the lids shuttering those extraordinary blue eyes one boy with his hand loosely cupping a whores breast his hawkscarred wrist lying tanned upon the counterpane One boy in the final instants of his lifes last good sleep one boy who will shortly be in motion who will be falling as a dislodged pebble falls on a steep and broken slope of scree a falling pebble that strikes another and another and another those pebbles striking yet more until the whole slope is in motion and the earth shakes with the sound of the landslide One boy one pebble on a slope loose and ready to slide A knot exploded in the fire Somewhere in this dream of Kansas an animal yipped Susannah watched sparks swirl up past Rolands incredibly ancient face and saw in that face the sleeping boy of a summers mom lying in a bawds bed And then she saw the door crash open ending Gileads last troubled dream  The man who strode in crossing the room to the bed before Roland could open his eyes and before the woman beside him had even begun to register the sound was tall slim dressed in faded jeans and a dusty shirt of blue chambray On his head was a dark gray hat with a snakeskin band Lying low on his hips were two old leather holsters Jutting from them were the sandalwood grips of the pistols the boy would someday bear to lands of which this scowling man with the furious blue eyes would never dream Roland was in motion even before he was able to unseal his eyes rolling to the left groping beneath the bed for what was there He was fast so fast it was scary but  and Susannah saw this too saw it clearly  the man in the faded jeans was faster yet He grabbed the boys shoulder and yanked turning him naked out of bed and onto the floor The boy sprawled there reaching again for what was beneath the bed lightningquick The man in the jeans stamped down on his fingers before they could grasp Bastard the boy gasped Oh you bas   But now his eyes were open he looked up and saw that the invading bastard was his father The whore was sitting up now her eyes puffy her face slack and petulant Here she cried Here here You cant just be acomin in like that so you cant Why if I was to raise my voice   Ignoring her the man reached beneath the bed and dragged out two gunbelts Near the end of each was a bolstered revolver They were large and amazing in this largely gunless world but they were not so large as those worn by Rolands father and the grips were eroded metal plates rather than inlaid wood When the whore saw the guns on the invaders hips and the ones in his hands  the ones her young customer of the night before had been wearing until she had taken him upstairs and divested him of all weapons save for the one with which she was most familiar  the expression of sleepy petulance left her face What replaced it was the foxlike look of a born survivor She was up out of bed across the floor and out the door before her bare bum had more than a brief moment to twinkle in the morning sun Neither the father standing by the bed nor the son lying naked upon the floor at his feet so much as looked at her The man in the jeans held out the gunbelts which Roland had taken from the fuzer beneath the apprentices barracks on the previous afternoon using Corts key to open the arsenal door The man shook the belts under Rolands very nose as one might hold a torn garment beneath the nose of a feckless puppy that has chewed He shook them so hard that one of the guns tumbled free Despite his stupefaction Roland caught it in midair I thought you were in the west Roland said In Cressia After Farson and his   Rolands father slapped him hard enough to send the boy tumbling across the room and into a corner with blood pouring from one comer of his mouth Rolands first appalling instinct was to raise the gun he still held Steven Deschain looked at him hands on hips reading this thought even before it was fully formed His lips pulled back in a singularly mirthless grin one that showed all of his teeth and most of his gums Shoot me if you will Why not Make this abortion complete Ah gods Id welcome it Roland laid the gun on the floor and pushed it away using the back of his hand to do it All at once he wanted his fingers nowhere near the trigger of a gun They were no longer fully under his control those fingers He had discovered that yesterday right around the time he had broken Corts nose Father I was tested yesterday I took Corts stick I won Im a man Youre a fool his father said His grin was gone now he looked haggard and old He sat down heavily on the whores bed looked at the gunbelts he still held and dropped them between his feet Youre a fourteenyearold fool and thats the worst most desperate kind He looked up angry all over again but Roland didnt mind anger was better than that look of weariness That look of age Ive known since you toddled that you were no genius but I never believed until yestereve that you were an idiot To let him drive you like a cow in a chute Gods You have forgotten the face of your father Say it And that sparked the boys own anger Everything he had done the day before he had done with his fathers face firmly fixed in his mind Thats not true he shouted from where he now sat with his bare butt on the splintery boards of the whores crib and his back against the wall the sun shining through the window and touching the fuzz on his fair unscarred cheek It is true you whelp Foolish whelp Say your atonement or Ill strip the hide from your very   They were together he burst out Your wife and your minister  your magician I saw the mark of his mouth on her neck On my mothers neck He reached for the gun and picked it up but even in his shame and fury was still careful not to let his fingers stray near the trigger he held the apprentices revolver only by the plain undecorated metal of its barrel Today I end his treacherous seducers life with this and if you arent man enough to help me at least you can stand aside and let m   One of the revolvers on Stevens hip was out of its holster and in his hand before Rolands eyes saw any move There was a single shot deafening as thunder in the little room it was a full minute before Roland was able to hear the babble of questions and commotion from below The prenticegun meanwhile was long gone blown out of his hand and leaving nothing behind but a kind of buzzing tingle It flew out the window down and gone its grip a smashed ruin of metal and its short turn in the gunslingers long tale at an end Roland looked at his father shocked and amazed Steven looked back saying nothing for a long time But now he wore the face Roland remembered from earliest childhood calm and sure The weariness and the look of halfdistracted fury had passed away like last nights thunderstorms At last his father spoke I was wrong in what I said and I apologize You did not forget my face Roland But still you were foolish  you allowed yourself to be driven by one far slyer than you will ever be in your life Its only by the grace of the gods and the working of ka that you have not been sent west one more true gunslinger out of Martens road    out of John Farsons road    and out of the road which leads to the creature that rules them He stood and held out his arms If I had lost you Roland I should have died Roland got to his feet and went naked to his father who embraced him fiercely When Steven Deschain kissed him first on one cheek and then the other Roland began to weep Then in Rolands ear Steven Deschain whispered six words  What Susannah asked What six words  I have known for two years  Roland said That was what he whispered Holy Christ Eddie said He told me I couldnt go back to the palace If I did Id be dead by nightfall He said You have been born to your destiny in spite of all Marten coulddo yet he has sworn to kill you before youcan grow to be a problem to him it seems that winner in the test or no you must leave Gilead anyway For only awhile though and youll go east instead of west Id not send you alone either or without a purpose Then almost as an afterthought he added Or with a pair of sorry prentice revolvers  What purpose Jake asked He had clearly been captivated by the story his eyes shone nearly as bright as Oys And which friends These things you must now hear Roland said and how you judge me will come in time He fetched a sigh  the deep sigh of a man who contemplates some arduous piece of work  and then tossed fresh wood on the fire As the flames flared up driving the shadows back a little way he began to talk All that queerly long night he talked not finishing the story of Susan Delgado until the sun was rising in the east and painting the glass castle yonder with all the bright hues of a fresh day and a strange green cast of light which was its own true color A perfect disc of silver  the Kissing Moon as it was called in Full Earth  hung above the ragged hill five miles east of Hambry and ten miles south of Eyebolt Canyon Below the hill the late summer heat still held suffocating even two hours after sundown but atop the Coos it was as if Reap had already come with its strong breezes and frostpinched air For the woman who lived here with no company but a snake and one old mutie cat it was to be a long night Never mind though never mind my dear Busy hands are happy hands So they are She waited until the hoofbeats of her visitors horses had faded sitting quietly by the window in the huts large room there was only one other a bedroom little bigger than a closet Musty the sixlegged cat was on her shoulder Her lap was full of moonlight Three horses bearing away three men The Big Coffin Hunters they called themselves She snorted Men were funny aye so they were and the most amusing thing about them was how little they knew it Men with their swaggering belthitching names for themselves Men so proud of their muscles their drinking capacities their eating capacities so everlastingly proud of their pricks Yes even in these times when a good many of them could shoot nothing but strange bent seed that produced children fit only to be drowned in the nearest well Ah but it was never their fault was it dear No always it was the woman  her womb her fault Men were such cowards Such grinning cowards These three had been no different from the general run The old one with the limp might bear watching  aye so he might a clear and overly curious pair of eyes had looked out at her from his head  but she saw nothing in them she could not deal with came it to that Men She could not understand why so many women feared them Hadnt the gods made them with the most vulnerable part of their guts hanging right out of their bodies like a misplaced bit of bowel Kick them there and they curled up like snails Caress them there and their brains melted Anyone who doubted that second bit of wisdom need only look at her nights second bit of business the one which still lay ahead Thorin Mayor of Hambry Chief Guard o Barony No fool like an old fool Yet none of these thoughts had any real power over her or any real malice to them at least not now the three men who called themselves the Big Coffin Hunters had brought her a marvel and she would look at it aye fill up her eyes with it so she would The gimp Jonas had insisted she put it away  he had been told she had a place for such things not that he wanted to see it himself not any of her secret places gods forbid at this sally Depape and Reynolds had laughed like trolls  and so she had but the hoofbeats of their horses had been swallowed by the wind now and she would do as she liked The girl whose tits had stolen what little there was of Hart Thorins mind would not be here for another hour at least the old woman had insisted that the girl walk from town citing the purification value of such a moonlit heelandtoe actually just wanting to put a safe bumper of time between her two appointments and during that hour she would do as she liked Oh its beautiful Im sure tis she whispered and did she feel a certain heat in that place where her ancient bowlegs came together A certain moisture in the dry creek which hid there Gods Aye even through the box where they hid it I felt its glam So beautiful Musty like you She took the cat from her shoulder and held it in front of her eyes The old torn purred and stretched out its pug of a face toward hers She kissed its nose The cat closed its milky graygreen eyes in ecstasy So beautiful like you  so yare so yare Hee She put the cat down It walked slowly toward the hearth where a late fire lazed desultorily eating at a single log Mustys tail split at the tip so it looked like the forked tail of a devil in an old drawing switched back and forth in the rooms dim orange air Its extra legs dangling from its sides twitched dreamily The shadow which trailed across the floor and grew up the wall was a horror a thing that looked like a cat crossed with a spider The old woman rose and went into her sleeping closet where she had taken the thing Jonas had given her Lose that and youll lose your head hed said Never fear me my good friend shed replied directing a cringing servile smile back over her shoulder all the while thinking Men Foolish strutting creatures they were Now she went to the foot of her bed knelt and passed one hand over the earth floor there Lines appeared in the sour dirt as she did They formed a square She pushed her fingers into one of these lines it gave before her touch She lifted the hidden panel hidden in such a way that no one without the touch would ever be able to uncover it revealing a compartment perhaps a foot square and two feet deep Within it was an ironwood box Curled atop the box was a slim green snake When she touched its back its head came up Its mouth yawned in a silent hiss displaying four pairs of fangs  two on top two on the bottom She took the snake up crooning to it As she brought its flat face close to her own its mouth yawned wider and its hissing became audible She opened her own mouth from between her wrinkled gray lips she poked the yellowish badsmelling mat of her tongue Two drops of poison  enough to kill an entire dinnerparty if mixed in the punch  fell on it She swallowed feeling her mouth and throat and chest bum as if with strong liquor For a moment the room swam out of focus and she could hear voices murmuring in the stenchy air of the hut  the voices of those she called the unseen friends Her eyes ran sticky water down the trenches time had drawn in her cheeks Then she blew out a breath and the room steadied The voices faded She kissed Ermot between his lidless eyes time o the Kissing Moon all right she thought and then set him aside The snake slipped beneath her bed curled itself in a circle and watched as she passed her palms over the top of the ironwood box She could feel the muscles in her upper arms quivering and that heat in her loins was more pronounced Years it had been since she had felt the call of her sex but she felt it now so she did and it was not the doing of the Kissing Moon or not much The box was locked and Jonas had given her no key but that was nothing to her who had lived long and studied much and trafficked with creatures that most men for all their bold talk and strutting ways would run from as if on fire had they caught even the smallest glimpse of them She stretched one hand toward the lock on which was inlaid the shape of an eye and a motto in the High Speech I see who opens me and then withdrew it All at once she could smell what her nose no longer noticed under ordinary circumstances must and dust and a dirty mattress and the crumbs of food that had been consumed in bed the mingled stench of ashes and ancient incense the odor of an old woman with wet eyes and ordinarily at least a dry pussy She would not open this box and look at the wonder it contained in here she would go outside where the air was clean and the only smells were sage and mesquite She would look by the light of the Kissing Moon Rhea of Coos Hill pulled the box from its hole with a grunt rose to her feet with another grunt this one from her nether regions tucked the box under her arm and left the room  The hut was far enough below the brow of the hill to block off the bitterest gusts of the winter wind which blew almost constantly in these highlands from Reaping until the end of Wide Earth A path led to the hills highest vantage beneath the full moon it was a ditch of silver The old woman toiled up it puffing her white hair standing out around her head in dirty clumps her old dugs swaying from side to side under her black dress The cat followed in her shadow still giving off its rusty purr like a stink At the top of the hill the wind lifted her hair away from her ravaged face and brought her the moaning whisper of the thinny which had eaten its way into the far end of Eyebolt Canyon It was a sound few cared for she knew but she herself loved it to Rhea of the Coos it sounded like a lullaby Overhead rode the moon the shadows on its bright skin sketching the faces of lovers kissing  if you believed the ordinary fools below that was The ordinary fools below saw a different face or set of faces in each full moon but the hag knew there was only one  the face of the Demon The face of death She herself however had never felt more alive Oh my beauty she whispered and touched the lock with her gnarled fingers A faint glimmer of red light showed between her bunched knuckles and there was a click Breathing hard like a woman who has run a race she put the box down and opened it Rosecolored light dimmer than that thrown by the Kissing Moon but infinitely more beautiful spilled out It touched the ruined face hanging above the box and for a moment made it the face of a young girl again Musty sniffed head stretched forward ears laid back old eyes rimmed with that rose light Rhea was instantly jealous Get away foolish tis not for the likes of you She swatted the cat Musty shied back hissing like a kettle and stalked in dudgeon to the hummock which marked the very tip of Coos Hill There he sat affecting disdain and licking one paw as the wind combed ceaselessly through his fur Within the box peeping out of a velvet drawstring bag was a glass globe It was filled with that rosy light it flowed in gentle pulses like the beat of a satisfied heart  Oh my lovely one she murmured lifting it out She held it up before her let its pulsing radiance run down her wrinkled face like rain Oh ye live so ye do Suddenly the color within the globe darkened toward scarlet She felt it thrum in her hands like an immensely powerful motor and again she felt that amazing wetness between her legs that tidal tug she believed had been left behind long ago Then the thrumming died and the light in the globe seemed to furl up like petals Where it had been there was now a pinkish gloom    and three riders coming out of it At first she thought it was the men who had brought her the globe  Jonas and the others But no these were younger even younger than Depape who was about twentyfive The one on the left of the trio appeared to have a birds skull mounted on the pommel of his saddle  strange but true Then that one and the one on the right were gone darkened away somehow by the power of the glass leaving only the one in the middle She took in the jeans and boots he wore the flatbrimmed hat that hid the upper half of his face the easy way he sat his horse and her first alarmed thought was Gunslinger Come east from the Inner Baronies aye perhaps from Gilead itself But she did not have to see the upper half of the riders face to know he was little more than a child and there were no guns on his hips Yet she didnt think the youth came unarmed If only she could see a little better   She brought the glass almost to the tip of her nose and whispered Closer lovie Closer still She didnt know what to expect  nothing at all seemed most likely  but within the dark circle of the glass the figure did come closer Swum closer almost like a horse and rider underwater and she saw there was a quiver of arrows on his back Before him on the pommel of his saddle was not a skull but a shortbow And to the right side of the saddle where a gunslinger might have carried a rifle in a scabbard there was the featherfluffed shaft of a lance He was not one of the Old People his face had none of that look  yet she did not think he was of the Outer Arc either But who are ye cully she breathed And how shall I know ye Yeve got yer hat pulled down so far I cant see your Godpounding eyes so ye do By yer horse mayhap  or praps by yer  get away Musty Why do yer trouble me so Arrrr The cat had come back from its lookout point and was twining back and forth between her swollen old ankles waowing up at her in a voice even more rusty than its purr When the old woman kicked out at him Musty dodged agilely away    then immediately came back and started in again looking up at her with moonstruck eyes and making those soft yowls Rhea kicked out at it again this one just as ineffectual as the first one then looked into the glass once more The horse and its interesting young rider were gone The rose light was gone as well It was now just a dead glass ball she held its only light a reflection borrowed from the moon The wind gusted pressing her dress against the ruination that was her body Musty undaunted by the feeble kicks of his mistress darted forward and began to twine about her ankles again crying up at her the whole time There do ye see what youve done ye nasty bag of fleas and disease The lights gone out of it gone out just when I   Then she heard a sound from the cart track which led up to her hut and understood why Musty had been acting out It was singing she heard It was the girl she heard The girl was early Grimacing horribly  she loathed being caught by surprise and the little miss down there would pay for doing it  she bent and put the glass back in its box The inside was lined with padded silk and the ball fit as neatly as the breakfast egg in His Lordships cup And still from down the hill the cursed wind was wrong or she would have heard it sooner the sound of the girl singing now closer than ever Love o love o careless love Cant you see what careless love has done Ill giveee careless love ye virgin bitch the old woman said She could smell the sour reek of sweat from under her arms but that other moisture had dried up again Ill give ye payday for walking in early on old Rhea so I will She passed her fingers over the lock on the front of the box but it wouldnt fasten She supposed she had been overeager to have it open and had broken something inside it when she used the touch The eye and the motto seemed to mock her i see who opens me It could be put right and in a jiffy but right now even a jiffy was more than she had Pestering cunt She whined lifting her head briefly toward the approaching voice almost here now by the gods and fortyfive minutes before her time Then she closed the lid of the box It gave her a pang to do it because the glass was coming to life again filling with that rosy glow but there was no time for looking or dreaming now Later perhaps after the object of Thorins unseemly latelife prickishness had gone And you must restrain yourself from doing anything too awful to the girl she cautioned herself Remember shes here because of him and at least aint one of those green girls with a bun in the oven and a boyfriend acting reluctant about the cries o marriage Its Thorin s doing this ones what he thinks about after his ugly old crow of a wife is asleep and he takes himself in his hand and commences the evening milking its Thorins doing he has the old law on his side and he has power Furthermore whats in that box is his mans business and if Jonas found out ye looked at it that ye used it  Aye but no fear of that And in the meantime possession were ninetenths of the law were it not She hoisted the box under one arm hoisted her skirts with her free hand and ran back along the path to the hut She could still run when she had to aye though few there were whod believe it Musty ran at her heels bounding along with his cloven tail held high and his extra legs flopping up and down in the moonlight Rhea darted into her hut crossed in front of the guttering fire then stood in the doorway to her tiny bedroom swiping a hand through her hair in a distracted gesture The bitch hadnt seen her outside the hut  she surely would have stopped caterwauling or at least faltered in it if she had  and that was good but the cursed hideyhole had sealed itself up again and that was bad There was no time to open it again either Rhea hurried to the bed knelt and pushed the box far back into the shadows beneath Ay that would do until Susy Greengown was gone it would do very well Smiling on the right side of her mouth the left was mostly frozen Rhea got up brushed her dress and went to meet her second appointment of the night  Behind her the unlocked lid of the box clicked open It came up less than an inch but that was enough to allow a sliver of pulsing rosecolored light to shine out  Susan Delgado stopped about forty yards from the witchs hut the sweat chilling on her arms and the nape of her neck Had she just spied an old woman surely the one she had come to see dart down that last bit of path leading from the top of the hill She thought she had Dont stop singing  when an old lady hurries like that she doesnt want to be seen If you stop singing shell likely know she was For a moment Susan thought shed stop anyway  that her memory would close up like a startled hand and deny her another verse of the old song which she had been singing since youngest childhood But the next verse came to her and she continued on with feet as well as voice Once my cares were far away Yes once my cares were far away Now my love has gone from me And misery is in my heart to stay A bad song for a night such as this mayhap but her heart went its own way without much interest in what her head thought or wanted always had She was frightened to be out by moonlight when werewolves were said to walk she was frightened of her errand and she was frightened by what that errand portended Yet when she had gained the Great Road out of Hambry and her heart had demanded she run she had run  under the light of the Kissing Moon and with her skirt held above her knees she had galloped like a pony with her shadow galloping right beside her For a mile or more she had run until every muscle in her body tingled and the air she pulled down her throat tasted like some sweet heated liquid And when she reached the upland track leading to this high sinister she had sung Because her heart demanded it And she supposed it really hadnt been such a bad idea if nothing else it had kept the worst of her megrims away Singing was good for that much anyway Now she walked to the end of the path singing the chorus of Careless Love As she stepped into the scant light which fell through the open door and onto the stoop a harsh raincrow voice spoke from the shadows Stop yer howling missy  it catches in my brains like a fishhook Susan who had been told all her life that she had a fair singing voice a gift from her gramma no doubt fell silent at once abashed She stood on the stoop with her hands clasped in front of her apron Beneath the apron she wore her secondbest dress she only had two Beneath it her heart was thumping very hard A cat  a hideous thing with two extra legs sticking out of its sides like toasting forks  came into the doorway first It looked up at her seemed to measure her then screwed its face up in a look that was eerily human contempt It hissed at her then flashed away into the night Well good evening to you too Susan thought The old woman she had been sent to see stepped into the doorway She looked Susan up and down with that same expression of flateyed contempt then stood back Come in And mind ye clap the door tight The wind has a way of blowin it open as ye see Susan stepped inside She didnt want to close herself into this badsmelling room with the old woman but when there was no choice hesitation was ever a fault So her father had said whether the matter under discussion was sums and subtractions or how to deal with boys at barndances when their hands became overly adventurous She pulled the door firmly to and heard it latch And here yare the old woman said and offered a grotesque smile of welcome It was a smile guaranteed to make even a brave girl think of stories told in the nursery  Winters tales of old women with snaggle teeth and bubbling cauldrons full of toadgreen liquid There was no cauldron over the fire in this room nor was the fire itself much of a shake in Susans opinion but the girl guessed there had been betimes and things in it of which it might be better not to think That this woman was a real witch and not just an old lady posing as one was something Susan had felt sure of from the moment she had seen Rhea darting back inside her hut with the malformed cat at her heels It was something you could almost smell like the reeky aroma rising off the hags skin Yes she said smiling She tried to make it a good one bright and unafraid Here I am And its early yare my little sweeting Early yare Hee I ran partway The moon got into my blood I suppose Thats what my da would have said The old womans horrible smile widened into something that made Susan think of the way eels sometimes seemed to grin after death and just before the pot Aye but dead he is dead these five years Pat Delgado of the red hair and beard the life mashed out of im by is own horse aye and went into the clearing at the end of the path with the music of his own snapping bones in his ears so he did The nervous smile slipped from Susans face as if slapped away She felt tears always close at the mere mention of her das name bum at the back of her eyes But she would not let them fall Not in this heartless old crows sight she wouldnt Let our business be quick and be done she said in a dry voice that was far from her usual one that voice was usually cheery and merry and ready for fun But she was Pat Delgados child daughter of the best drover ever to work the Western Drop and she remembered his face very well she could rise to a stronger nature if required as it now clearly was The old woman had meant to reach out and scratch as deep as she could and the more she saw that her efforts were succeeding the more she would redouble them The hag meanwhile was watching Susan shrewdly her bunchknuckled hands planted on her hips while her cat twined around her ankles Her eyes were rheumy but Susan saw enough of them to realize they were the same graygreen shade as the cats eyes and to wonder what sort of fell magic that might be She felt an urge  a strong one  to drop her eyes and would not It was all right to feel fear but sometimes a very bad idea to show it You look at me pert missy Rhea said at last Her smile was dissolving slowly into a petulant frown Nay old mother Susan replied evenly Only as one who wishes to do the business she came for and be gone I have come here at the wish of My Lord Mayor of Mejis and at that of my Aunt Cordelia sister of my father My dear father of whom I would hear no ill spoken I speak as I do the old woman said The words were dismissive yet there was a trace of fawning servility in the hags voice Susan set no importance on that it was a tone such a thing as this had probably adopted her whole life and came as automatically as breath Ive lived alone a long time with no mistress but myself and once it begins my tongue goes where it will Then sometimes it might be best not to let it begin at all The old womans eyes flashed uglily Curb your own stripling girl lest you find it dead in your mouth where it will rot and make the Mayor think twice about kissing you when he smells its stink aye even under such a moon as this Susans heart filled with misery and bewilderment Shed come up here intent on only one thing getting the business done as quickly as possible a barely explained rite that was apt to be painful and sure to be shameful Now this old woman was looking at her with flat and naked hatred How could things have gone wrong with such suddenness Or was it always this way with witches We have begun badly mistress  can we start over Susan asked suddenly and held out her hand The hag looked startled although she did reach out and make brief contact the wrinkled tips of her fingers touching the shortnailed lingers of the sixteenyearold girl who stood before her with her clearskinned face shining and her long hair braided down her back Susan had to make a real effort not to grimace at the touch brief as it was The old womans fingers were as chilly as those of a corpse but Susan had touched chilly fingers before Cold hands warm heart Aunt Cord sometimes said The real unpleasantness was in the texture the feel of cold flesh spongy and loose on the bones as if the woman to whom they were attached had drowned and lain long in some pool Nay nay theres no starting over the old woman said yet mayhap well go on better than weve begun Yeve a powerful friend in the Mayor and Id not have him for my enemy Shes honest at least Susan thought then had to laugh at herself This woman would be honest only when she absolutely had to be left to her own devices and desires shed lie about everything  the weather the crops the flights of birds come Reaping Ye came before I expected ye and its put me out of temper so it has Have ye brought me something missy Ye have Ill warrant Her eyes were glittering once more this time not with anger Susan reached beneath her apron so stupid wearing an apron for an errand on the backside of nowhere but it was what custom demanded and into her pocket There tied to a string so it could not be easily lost by young girls suddenly moved to run in the moonlight perchance was a cloth bag Susan broke the binding string and brought the bag out She put it in the outstretched hand before her the palm so worn that the lines marking it were now little more than ghosts She was careful not to touch Rhea again  although the old woman would be touching her again and soon Is it the sound o the wind makes ye shiver Rhea asked although Susan could tell her mind was mostly fixed on the little bag her fingers were busy tugging out the knot in the drawstring Yes the wind And so it should Tis the voices of the dead you hear in the wind and when they scream so tis because they regret  ah The knot gave She loosened the drawstring and tumbled two gold coins into her hand They were unevenly milled and crude  no one had made such for generations  but they were heavy and the eagles engraved upon them had a certain power Rhea lifted one to her mouth pulled back her lips to reveal a few gruesome teeth and bit down The hag looked at the faint indentations her teeth had left in the gold For several seconds she gazed rapt then closed her fingers over them tightly While Rheas attention was distracted by the coins Susan happened to look through the open door to her left and into what she assumed was the witchs bedchamber And here she saw an odd and disquieting thing a light under the bed A pink pulsing light It seemed to be coming from some kind of box although she could not quite  The witch looked up and Susan hastily moved her eyes to a comer of the room where a net containing three or four strange white fruits hung from a hook Then as the old woman moved and her huge shadow danced ponderously away from that part of the wall Susan saw they were not fruits at air but skulls She felt a sickish drop in her stomach The fire needs building up missy Go round to the side of the house and bring back an armload of wood Goodsized sticks are whats wanted and never mind whining ye cant lug em Yere of a strappin good size so ye are Susan who had quit whining about chores around the time she had quit pissing into her clouts said nothing    although it did cross her mind to ask Rhea if everyone who brought her gold was invited to lug her wood In truth she didnt mind the air outside would taste like wine after the stench of the hut She had almost reached the door when her foot struck something hot and yielding The cat yowled Susan stumbled and almost fell From behind her the old woman issued a series of gasping choking sounds which Susan eventually recognized as laughter Watch Musty my little sweet one Tricksy he is And tripsy as well betimes so he is Hee And off she went in another gale The cat looked up at Susan its ears laid back its graygreen eyes wide It hissed at her And Susan unaware she was going to do it until it was done hissed back Like its expression of contempt Mustys look of surprise was eerily  and in this case comically  human It turned and fled for Rheas bedroom its split tail lashing Susan opened the door and went outside to get the wood Already she felt as if she had been here a thousand years and that it might be a thousand more before she could go home  The air was as sweet as she had hoped perhaps even sweeter and for a moment she only stood on the stoop breathing it in trying to cleanse her lungs    and her mind After five good breaths she got herself in motion Around the side of the house she went but it was the wrong side it seemed for there was no woodpile here There was a narrow excuse for a window however halfburied in some tough and unlovely creeper It was toward the back of the hut and must look in on the old womans sleeping closet Dont look in there whatever shes got under her bed isnt your business and if she were to catch you   She went to the window despite these admonitions and peeked in It was unlikely that Rhea would have seen Susans face through the dense overgrowth of pig ivy even if the old besom had been looking in that direction and she wasnt She was on her knees the drawstring bag caught in her teeth reaching under the bed She brought out a box and opened its lid which was already ajar Her face was flooded with soft pink radiance and Susan gasped For one moment it was the face of a young girl  but one filled with cruelty as well as youth the face of a selfwilled child determined to learn all the wrong things for all the wrong reasons The face of the girl this hag once had been mayhap The light appeared to be coming from some sort of glass ball The old woman looked at it for several moments her eyes wide and fascinated Her lips moved as if she were speaking to it or perhaps even singing to it the little bag Susan had brought from town its string still clamped in the hags mouth bobbed up and down as she spoke Then with what appeared to be great effort of will she closed the box cutting off the rosy light Susan found herself relieved  there was something about it she didnt like The old woman cupped one hand over the silver lock in the middle of the lid and a brief scarlet light spiked out from between her fingers All this with the drawstring bag still hanging from her mouth Then she put the box on the bed knelt and began running her hands over the dirt just beneath the beds edge Although she touched only with her palms lines appeared as if she had used a drawing tool These lines darkened becoming what looked like grooves The wood Susan Gel the wood before she wakes up to how long youve been gone For your fathers sake Susan pulled the skirtof her dress all the way up to her waist  she did not want the old woman to see dirt or leaves on her clothing when she came back inside did not want to answer the questions the sight of such smuts might provoke  and crawled beneath the window with her white cotton drawers flashing in the moonlight Once she was past she got to her feet again and hurried quietly around to the far side of the hut Here she found the woodpile under an old moldysmelling hide She took half a dozen goodsized chunks and walked back toward the front of the house with them in her arms When she entered turning sideways to get her load through the doorway without dropping any the old woman was back in the main room staring moodily into the fireplace where there was now little more than embers Of the drawstring bag there was no sign Took you long enough missy Rhea said She continued to look into the fireplace as if Susan were of no account but one foot tapped below the dirty hem of her dress and her eyebrows were drawn together Susan crossed the room peering over the load of wood in her arms as well as she could while she walked It wouldnt surprise her a bit to spy the cat lurking near hoping to trip her up I saw a spider she said I flapped my apron at it to make it run away I hate the look of them so I do Yell see something ye like the look of even less soon enough Rhea said grinning her peculiar onesided grin Out of old Thorins nightshirt itll come stiff as a stick and as red as rhubarb Hee Hold a minute girl ye gods yeve brought enough for a FairDay bonfire Rhea took two fat logs from Susans pile and tossed them indifferently onto the coals Embers spiraled up the dark and faintly roaring shaft of the chimney There yeve scattered whats left of yer fire ye silly old thing and will likely have to rekindle the whole mess Susan thought Then Rhea reached into the fireplace with one splayed hand spoke a guttural word and the logs blazed up as if soaked in oil Put the rest over there she said pointing at the woodbox And mind ye not be a scatterbark missy What and dirty all this neat Susan thought She bit the insides of her cheeks to kill the smile that wanted to rise on her mouth Rhea might have sensed it however when Susan straightened again the old woman was looking at her with a dour knowing expression All right mistress lets do our business and have it done Do ye know why youre here I am here at Mayor Thorins wish Susan repeated knowing that was no real answer She was frightened now  more frightened than when she had looked through the window and seen the old woman crooning to the glass ball His wife has come barren to the end of her courses He wishes to have a son before he is also unable to   Pishtush spare me the codswallop and pretty words He wants tits and arse that dont squish in his hands and a box thatll grip what he pushes If hes still man enough to push it that is If a son come of it aye fine hell give it over to ye to keep and raise until its old enough to school and after that yell see it no more If its a daughter hell likely take it from ye and give it to his new man the one with the girls hair and the limp to drown in the nearest cattlewallow Susan stared at her shocked out of all measure The old woman saw the look and laughed Dont like the sound of the truth do yer Few do missy But thats neither here nor there yer auntie was ever a trig one and shell have done all right out of Thorin and Thorins treasury What gold you see of its none o mine    and wont be none o yours either if you dont watch sharp Hee Take off that dress Iwont was what rose to her lips but what then To be turned out of this hut and to be turned out pretty much as she had come and not as a lizard or a hopping toad would probably be the best luck she could hope for and sent west as she was now without even the two gold coins shed brought up here And that was only the small half of it The large was that she had given her word At first she had resisted but when Aunt Cord had invoked her fathers name she had given in As she always did Really she had no choice And when there was no choice hesitation was ever a fault She brushed the front of her apron to which small bits of bark now clung then untied it and took it off She folded it laid it on a small grimy hassock near the hearth and unbuttoned her dress to the waist She shivered it from her shoulders and stepped out She folded it and laid it atop the apron trying not to mind the greedy way Rhea of Coos was staring at her in the firelight The cat came sashaying across the floor grotesque extra legs hobbling and sat at Rheas feet Outside the wind gusted It was warm on the hearth but Susan was cold just the same as if that wind had gotten inside her somehow Hurry girl for yer fathers sake Susan pulled her shift over her head folded it atop the dress then stood in only her drawers with her arms folded over her bosom The fire painted warm orange highlights along her thighs black circles of shadow in the tender folds behind her knees And still shes not nekkid the old crow laughed Aint we lahdidah Aye we are very fine Take off those drawers mistress and stand as ye slid from yer mother Although ye had not so many goodies as to interest the likes of Hart Thorin then did ye Hee Feeling caught in a nightmare Susan did as she was bid With her mound and bush uncovered her crossed arms seemed foolish She lowered them to her sides Ah no wonder he wants ye the old woman said Tis beautiful ye are and true Is she not Musty The cat waowed Theres dirt on yer knees Rhea said suddenly How came it there  Susan felt a moment of awful panic She had lifted her skirts to crawl beneath the hags window    and hung herself by doing it Then an answer rose to her lips and she spoke it calmly enough When I came in sight of your hut I grew fearful I knelt to pray and raised my skirt so as not to soil it Im touched  to want a clean dress for the likes o me How good yare Dont you agree Musty The cat waowed then began to lick one of its forepaws Get on with it Susan said Youve been paid and Ill obey but stop teasing and have done You know what it is I have to do mistress I don t  Susan said The tears were close again burning the backs of her eyes but she would not let them fall Would not I have an idea but when I asked Aunt Cord if I was right she said that youd take care of my education in that regard  Wouldnt dirty her mouth with the words would she Well thats all right Yer Aunt Rheas not too nice to say what yer Aunt Cordelia wont Im to make sure that yere physically and spiritually intact missy Proving honesty is what the old ones called it and its a good enough name So it is Step to me Susan took two reluctant steps forward so that her bare toes were almost touching the old womans slippers and her bare breasts were almost touching the old womans dress If a devil or demon has polluted yer spirit such a thing as might taint the child youll likely bear it leaves a mark behind Most often its a suckmark or a lovers bite but theres others   open yer mouth Susan did and when the old woman bent closer the reek of her was so strong that the girls stomach clenched She held her breath praying this would be over soon Run out yer tongue Susan ran out her tongue Now send yer breezes into my face Susan exhaled her held breath Rhea breathed it in and then mercifully pulled her head away a little She had been close enough for Susan to see the lice hopping in her hair Sweet enough the old woman said Aye goods a meal Now turn around Susan did and felt the old witchs fingers trail down her back and to her buttocks Their tips were cold as mud Bend over and spread yer cheeks missy be not shy Rheas seen more than one pultry in her time Face flushing  she could feel the beat of her heart in the center of her forehead and in the hollows of her temples  Susan did as told And then she felt one of those corpselike fingers prod its way into her anus Susan bit her lips to keep from screaming The invasion was mercifully short  but there would be another Susan feared Turn around She turned The old woman passed her hands over Susans breasts flicked lightly at the nipples with her thumbs then examined the undersides carefully Rhea slipped a finger into the cup of the girls navel then hitched up her own skirt and dropped to her knees with a grunt of effort She passed her hands down Susans legs first front then back She seemed to take special pains with the area just below the calves where the tendons ran Lift yer right foot girl Susan did and uttered a nervous screamy laugh as Rhea ran a thumbnail down her instep to her heel The old woman parted her toes looking between each pair After this process had been repeated with the other foot the old woman  still on her knees  said You know what comes next Aye The word came out of her in a little trembling rush Hold ye still missy  all else is well clean as a willowstrip ye are but now weve come to the cozy nook thats all Thorin cares for weve come to where honesty must really be proved So hold ye still Susan closed her eyes and thought of horses running along the Drop  nominally they were the Baronys horse overlooked by Rimer Thorins Chancellor and the Baronys Minister of Inventory but the horses didnt know that they thought they were free and if you were free in your mind what else mattered Let me be free in my mind as free as the horses along the Drop and dont let her hurt me Please dont let her hurt me And if she does please help me to bear it in decent silence Cold fingers parted the downy hair below her navel there was a pause and then two cold fingers slipped inside her There was pain but only a moment of it and not bad shed hurt herself worse stubbing her toe or barking her shin on the way to the privy in the middle of the night The humiliation was the bad part and the revulsion of Rheas ancient touch Caulked tight ye are Rhea cried Good as ever was But Thorinll see to that so he will As for you my girl Ill tell yer a secret yer prissy aunt with her long nose n tight purse n little goosebump tits never knew even a girl whos intact dont need to lack for a shiver now n then if she knows how The hags withdrawing fingers closed gently around the little nubbin of flesh at the head of Susans cleft For one terrible second Susan thought they would pinch that sensitive place which sometimes made her draw in a breath if it rubbed just so against the pommel of her saddle when she was riding but instead the fingers caressed    then pressed  and the girl was horrified to feel a heat which was far from unpleasant kindle in her belly Like a little bud o silk the old woman crooned and her meddling fingers moved faster Susan felt her hips sway forward as if with a mind and life of their own and then she thought of the old womans greedy selfwilled face pink as the face of a whore by gaslight as it hung over the open box she thought of the way the drawstring bag with the gold pieces in it had hung from the wrinkled mouth like some disgorged piece of flesh and the heat she felt was gone She drew back trembling her arms and belly and breasts breaking out in gooseflesh Youve finished what you were paid to do Susan said Her voice was dry and harsh Rheas face knotted Yell not tell me aye no yes or maybe impudent stripling of a girl I know when Im done I Rhea the Weirding of Coos and   Be still and be on your feet before I kick you into the fire unnatural thing The old womans lips wriggled back from her few remaining teeth in a doglike sneer and now Susan realized she and the witchwoman were back where they had been at the start ready to claw each others eyes out Raise hand or foot to me you impudent cunt and what leaves my house will leave handless footless and blind of eye I do not much doubt you could do it but Thorin should be vexed Susan said It was the first time in her life she had ever invoked a mans name for protection Realizing this made her feel ashamed    small somehow She didnt know why that should be especially since she had agreed to sleep in his bed and bear his child but it was The old woman stared her seamed face working until it folded into a parody of a smile that was worse than her snarl Puffing and pulling at the arm of her chair Rhea got to her feet As she did Susan quickly began to dress Aye vexed he would be Perhaps you know best after all missy Ive had a strange night and its wakened parts of me better left asleep Anything else that might have happened take it as a compliment to yer youthn purity    and to yer beauty as well Aye Youre a beautiful thing and theres no doubtin it Yer hair now    when yer let it down as ye will for Thorin I wot when ye lay with him  it glows like the sun doesnt it Susan did not want to force the old hag out of her posturing but she didnt want to encourage these fawning compliments either Not when she could still see the hate in Rheas rheumy eyes not when she could feel the old womans touch still crawling like beetles on her skin She said nothing only stepped into her dress set it on her shoulders and began to button up the front Rhea perhaps understood the run of her thoughts for the smile dropped off her mouth and her manner grew businesslike Susan found this a great relief Well never mind it Yeve proved honest ye may dress yerself and go But not a word of what passed between us to Thorin mind ye Words between women need trouble no mans ear especially one as great as he Yet at this Rhea could not forbear a certain spasming sneer Susan didnt know if the old woman was aware of it or not Are we agreed Anything anything just as long as I can be out of here and away You declare me proved Aye Susan daughter of Patrick So I do But its not what I say that matters Now  wait somewhere here  She scrabbled along the mantel pushing stubs of candles stuck on cracked saucers this way and that lifting first a kerosene lantern and then a battery flashlight looking fixedly for a moment at a drawing of a young boy and then putting it aside Where   where   arrrrr  here She snatched up a pad of paper with a sooty cover citgo stamped on it in ancient gold letters and a stub of pencil She paged almost to the end of the pad before finding a blank sheet On it she scrawled something then tore the sheet off the spiral of wire at the top of the pad She held the sheet out to Susan who took it and looked at it Scrawled there was a word she did not understand at first Below it was a symbol Whats this she asked tapping the little drawing Rhea her mark Known for six Baronies around it is and cant be copied Show that paper to yer aunt Then to Thorin If yer aunt wants to take it and show it to Thorin herself  I know her ysee and her bossy ways  tell her no Rhea says no shes not to have the keeping of it And if Thorin wants it Rhea shrugged dismissively Let him keep it or bum it or wipe his bum with it for all of me Its nothing to you either for you knew you were honest all along so you did True Susan nodded Once walking home after a dance she had let a boy slip his hand inside her shirt for a moment or two but what of that She was honest And in more ways than this nasty creature meant But dont lose that paper Unless youd see me again that is and go through the same business a second time Gods perish even the thought Susan thought and managed not to shudder She put the paper in her pocket where the drawstring bag had been Now come to the door missy She looked as if she wanted to grasp Susans arm then thought better of it The two of them walked side by side to the door not touching in such a careful way that it made them look awkward Once there Rhea did grip Susans arm Then with her other hand she pointed to the bright silver disc hanging over the top of the Coos The Kissing Moon Rhea said  Tis midsummer Yes Tell Thorin hes not to have you in his bed  or in a haystack or on the scullery floor or anywhere else  until Demon Moon rises full in the sky Not until Reaping That was three months  a lifetime it seemed to her Susan tried not to show her delight at this reprieve Shed thought Thorin would put an end to her virginity by moonrise the next night She wasnt blind to the way he looked at her Rhea meanwhile was looking at the moon seeming to calculate Her hand went to the long tail of Susans hair and stroked it Susan bore this as well as she could and just when she felt she could bear it no longer Rhea dropped her hand back to her side and nodded Aye not just Reaping but true fin de ano  FairNight tell him Say that he may have you after the bonfire You understand True fin de ano yes She could barely contain her joy When the fire in Green Heart bums low and the last of the redhanded men are ashes Rhea said Then and not until then You must tell him so I will The hand came out and began to stroke her hair again Susan bore it After such good news she thought it would have been meanspirited to do otherwise The time between now and Reaping you will use to meditate and to gather your forces to produce the male child the Mayor wants  or mayhap just to ride along the Drop and gather the last flowers of your maidenhood Do you understand Yes She dropped a curtsey Thankeesai Rhea waved this off as if it were a flattery Speak not of what passed between us mind Tis no ones affair but our own I wont And our business is done Well  mayhap theres one more small thing  Rhea smiled to show it was indeed small then raised her left hand in front of Susans eyes with three fingers together and one apart Glimmering in the fork between was a silver medallion seemingly produced from nowhere The girls eyes fastened on it at once Until Rhea spoke a single guttural word that was Then they closed  Rhea looked at the girl who stood asleep on her stoop in the moonlight As she replaced the medallion within her sleeve her fingers were old and bunchy but they moved dexterously enough when it was required oh aye the businesslike expression fell from her face and was replaced by a look of squinteyed fury Kick me into the fire would you you trull Tattle to Thorin But her threats and impudence werent the worst The worst had been the expression of revulsion on her face when she had pulled back from Rheas touch Too good for Rhea she was And thought herself too good for Thorin as well no doubt she with sixteen years worth of fine blonde hair hanging down from her head hair Thorin no doubt dreamed of plunging his hands into even as he plunged and reared and plowed down below She couldnt hurt the girl much as she wanted to and much as the girl deserved it if nothing else Thorin might take the glass ball away from her and Rhea couldnt bear that Not yet anyway So she could not hurt the girl but she could do something that would spoil his pleasure in her at least for awhile Rhea leaned close to the girl grasped the long braid which lay down her back and began to slip it through her fist enjoying its silky smoothness Susan she whispered Doee hear me Susan daughter of Patrick Yes The eyes did not open Then listen The light of the Kissing Moon fell on Rheas face and turned it into a silver skull Listen to me well and remember Remember in the deep cave where yer waking mind never goes She pulled the braid through her hand again and again Silky and  smooth Like the little bud between her legs Remember the girl in the doorway said Aye Theres something yell do after he takes yer virginity Yell do it right away without even thinking about it Now listen to me Susan daughter of Patrick and hear me very well Still stroking the girls hair Rhea put her wrinkled lips to the smooth cup of Susans ear and whispered in the moonlight She had never in her life had such a strange night and it was probably not surprising that she didnt hear the rider approaching from behind until he was almost upon her The thing that troubled her most as she made her way back toward town was her new understanding of the compact she had made It was good to have a reprieve  months yet before she would have to live up to her end of the bargain  but a reprieve didnt change the basic fact when the Demon Moon was full she would lose her virginity to Mayor Thorin a skinny twitchy man with fluffy white hair rising like a cloud around the bald spot on top of his head A man whose wife regarded him with a certain weary sadness that was painful to look at Hart Thorin was a man who laughed uproariously when a company of players put on an entertainment involving headknocking or pretend punching or rotten fruitthrowing but who only looked puzzled at a story which was pathetic or tragical A knucklecracker a backslapper a dinnertable belcher a man who had a way of looking anxiously toward his Chancellor at almost every other word as if to make sure he hadnt offended Rimer in some way Susan had observed all these things often her father had for years been in charge of the Baronys horse and had gone to Seafront often on business Many times he had taken his much loved daughter with him Oh she had seen a lot of Hart Thorin over the years and he had seen a lot of her as well Too much mayhap For what now seemed the most important fact about him was that he was almost fifty years older than the girl who would perhaps bear his son She had made the bargain lightly enough  No not lightly that was being unfair to herself but she had lost little sleep over it that much was true She had thought after listening to all Aunt Cords arguments Well its little enough really to have the indenture off the lands to finally own our little piece of the Drop in fact as well as in tradition    to actually have papers one in our house and one in Rimers files saying its ours Aye and to have horses again Only three tis true but thats three more than we have now And against that To lie with him a time or two and to bear a child which millions of women have done before me with no harm Tis not after all a mutant or a leper Im being asked to partner with but just an old man with noisy knuckles Tis not forever and as Aunt Cord says I may still marry if time and ka decree I should not be the first woman to come to her husbands bed as a mother And does it make me a whore to do such The law says not but never mind that my hearts law is what matters and my heart says that if I may gain the land that was my das and three horses to run on it by being such then its a whore Ill be There was something else Aunt Cord had capitalized  rather ruthlessly Susan now saw  on a childs innocence It was the baby Aunt Cord had harped on the cunning little baby she would have Aunt Cord had known that Susan the dolls of her childhood put aside not all that long ago would love the idea of her own baby a little living doll to dress and feed and sleep with in the heat of the afternoon What Cordelia had ignored perhaps shes too innocent even to have considered it Susan thought but didnt quite believe was what the hagwoman had made brutally clear to her this evening Thorin wanted more than a child He wants tits and arse that dont squish in his hands and a box that ll grip what he pushes Just thinking of those words made her face throb as she walked through the postmoonset dark toward town no highspirited running this time no singing either She had agreed with vague thoughts of how managed livestock mated  they were allowed to go at it until the seed took then separated again But now she knew that Thorin might want her again and again probably would want her again and again and common law going back like iron for two hundred generations said that he could continue to lie with her until she who had proved the consort honest should prove her honestly with child as well and that child honest in and of itself    not that was a mutant aberration Susan had made discreet enquiries and knew that this second proving usually came around the fourth month of pregnancy  around the time she would begin to show even with her clothes on It would be up to Rhea to make the judgment and Rhea didnt like her Now that it was too late  now that she had accepted the compact formally tendered by the Chancellor now that she had been proved honest by yon strange bitch  she rued the bargain Mostly what she thought of was how Thorin would look with his pants off his legs white and skinny like the legs of a stork and how as they lay together she would hear his long bones crackling knees and back and elbows and neck And knuckles Dont forget his knuckles Yes Big old mans knuckles with hair growing out of them Susan chuckled at the thought it was that comical but at the same time a warm tear ran unnoticed from the comer of one eye and tracked down her cheek She wiped it away without knowing it any more than she heard the clipclip of approaching hoofs in the soft roaddust Her mind was still far away returning to the odd thing she had seen through the old womans bedroom window  the soft but somehow unpleasant light coming from the pink globe the hypnotized way the hag had been looking down at it When Susan at last heard the approaching horse her first alarmed thought was that she must get into the copse of trees she was currently passing and hide The chances of anyone aboveboard being on the road this late seemed small to her especially now that such bad times had come to MidWorld  but it was too late for that The ditch then and sprawled flat With the moon down there was at least a chance that whoever it was would pass without  But before she could even begin in that direction the rider who had sneaked up behind her while she was thinking her long and rueful thoughts had hailed her Goodeven lady and may your days be long upon the earth She turned thinking What if its one of the new men always lounging about Mayors House or in the Travellers Rest Not the oldest one the voice isnt wavery like his but maybe one of the others    it could be the one they call Depape Goodeven she heard herself saying to the man shape on the tall horse May yours be long also Her voice didnt tremble not that she could hear She didnt think it was Depape or the one named Reynolds either The only thing she could tell about the fellow for sure was that he wore a flatbrimmed hat the sort she associated with men of the Inner Baronies back when travel between east and west had been more common than it was now Back before John Farson came  the Good Man  and the bloodletting began As the stranger came up beside her she forgave herself a little for not hearing him approach  there was no buckle or bell on his gear that she could see and everything was tied down so as not to snap or flap It was almost the rig of an outlaw or a harrier she had the idea that Jonas he of the wavery voice and his two friends might have been both in other times and other climes or even a gunslinger But this man bore no guns unless they were hidden A bow on the pommel of his saddle and what looked like a lance in a scabbard that was all And there had never she reckoned been a gunslinger as young as this He clucked sidemouth at the horse just as her da had always done and she herself of course and it stopped at once As he swung one leg over his saddle lifting it high and with unconscious grace Susan said Nay nay dont trouble yerself stranger but go as ye would If he heard the alarm in her voice he paid no heed to it He slipped off the horse not bothering with the tieddown stirrup and landed neatly in front of her the dust of the road puffing about his squaretoed boots By starlight she saw that he was young indeed close to her own age on one side or the other His clothes were those of a working cowboy although new Will Dearborn at your service he said then doffed his hat extended a foot on one bootheel and bowed as they did in the Inner Baronies Such absurd courtliness out here in the middle of nowhere with the acrid smell of the oil patch on the edge of town already in her nostrils startled her out of her fear and into a laugh She thought it would likely offend him but he smiled instead A good smile honest and artless its inner part lined with even teeth She dropped him a little curtsey holding out one side of her dress Susan Delgado at yours He tapped his throat thrice with his right hand Thankeesai Susan Delgado Were well met I hope I didnt mean to startle you   Ye did a little Yes I thought I had Im sorry Yes Not aye but yes A young man from the Inner Baronies by the sound She looked at him with new interest Nay ye need not apologize for I was deep in my own thoughts she said Id been to see a  friend  and hadnt realized how much time had passed until I saw the moon was down If ye stopped out of concern I thankee stranger but ye may be on yer way as I would be on mine Its only to the edge of the village I go  Hambry Its close now Pretty speech and lovely sentiments he answered with a grin but its late youre alone and I think we may as well pass on together Do you ride sai Yesbut really   Step over and meet my friend Rusher then He shall carry you the last two miles Hes gelded sai and gentle She looked at Will Dearborn with a mixture of amusement and irritation The thought which crossed her mind was If he calls me sai again as though I were a schoolteacher or his doddery old great aunt Im going to take off this stupid apron and swat him with it I never minded a bit of temper in a horse docile enough to wear a saddle Until his death my father managed the Mayors horses  and the Mayor in these parts is also Guard o Barony Ive ridden my whole life She thought he might apologize perhaps even stutter but he only nodded with a calm thoughtfulness that she rather liked Then step to the stirrup my lady Ill walk beside and trouble you with no conversation if youd rather not have it Its late and talk palls after moonset some say She shook her head softening her refusal with a smile Nay I thank ye for yer kindness but it would not be well mayhap for me to be seen riding a strange young mans horse at eleven o the clock Lemonjuice wont take the stain out of a ladys reputation the way it will out of a shirtwaist you know Theres no one out here to see you the young man said in a maddeningly reasonable voice And that youre tired I can tell Come sai   Please dont call me that It makes me feel as ancient as a    She hesitated for a brief moment rethinking the word witch that first came to her mind    as an old woman Miss Delgado then Are you sure you wont ride Sure as can be Id not ride crosssaddle in a dress in any case Mr Dearborn  not even if you were my own brother Twouldnt be proper He stood in the stirrup himself reached over to the far side of his saddle Rusher stood docilely enough at this only flicking his ears which Susan would have been happy to flick herself had she been Rusher  they were that beautiful and stepped back down with a rolled garment in his hands It was tied with a rawhide hank She thought it was a poncho You may spread this over your lap and legs like a duster he said Theres quite enough of it for decorums sake  it was my fathers and hes taller than me He looked off toward the western hills for a moment and she saw he was handsome in a hard sort of way that jagged against his youth She felt a little shiver inside her and wished for the thousandth time that the foul old woman had kept her hands strictly on her business as unpleasant as that business had been Susan didnt want to look at this handsome stranger and remember Rheas touch Nay she said gently Thankee again I recognize yer kindness but I must refuse Then Ill walk along beside and Rusherll be our chaperone he said cheerfully As far as the edge of town at least therell be no eyes to see and think ill of a perfectly proper young woman and a moreorless proper young man And once there Ill tip my hat and wish you a very good night I wish ye wouldnt Really She brushed a hand across her forehead Easy for you to say there are no eyes to see but sometimes there are eyes even where there shouldnt be And my position is  a little delicate just now Ill walk with you however he repeated and now his face was somber These are not good times Miss Delgado Here in Mejis you are far from the worst of the troubles but sometimes trouble reaches out She opened her mouth  to protest again she supposed perhaps to tell him that Pat Delgados daughter could take care of herself  and then she thought of the Mayors new men and the cold way they had run their eyes over her when Thorins attention had been elsewhere She had seen those three this very night as she left on her way to the witchs hut Them she had heard approaching and in plenty of time for her to leave the road and rest behind a handy pinon tree she refused to think of it as hiding exactly Back toward town they had gone and she supposed they were drinking at the Travellers Rest right now  and would continue to until Stanley Ruiz closed the bar  but she had no way of knowing that for sure They could come back If I cant dissuade ye very well she said sighing with a vexed resignation she didnt really feel But only to the first mailbox  Mrs Beechs That marks the edge of town He tapped his throat again and made another of those absurd enchanting bows  foot stuck out as if he would trip someone heel planted in the dirt Thankee Miss Delgado At least he didnt t call me sai she thought Thats a start  She thought hed chatter away like a magpie in spite of his promise to be silent because that was what boys did around her  she was not vain of her looks but she thought she was goodlooking if only because the boys could not shut up or stop shuffling their feet when they were around her And this one would be full of questions the town boys didnt need to ask  how old was she had she always lived in Hambry were her parents alive half a hundred others just as boring  but they would all circle in on the same one did she have a steady fellow But Will Dearborn of the Inner Baronies didnt ask her about her schooling or family or friends the most common way of approaching any romantic rivals she had found Will Dearborn simply walked along beside her one hand wrapped around Rushers bridle looking off east toward the Clean Sea They were close enough to it now so that the teary smell of salt mingled with the tarry stench of oil even though the wind was from the south They were passing Citgo now and she was glad for Will Dearborns presence even if his silence was a little irritating She had always found the oil patch with its skeletal forest of gantries a little spooky Most of those steel towers had stopped pumping long since and there was neither the parts the need nor the understanding to repair them And those which did still labor along  nineteen out of about two hundred  could not be stopped They just pumped and pumped the supplies of oil beneath them seemingly inexhaustible A little was still used but a very little  most simply ran back down into the wells beneath the dead pumping stations The world had moved on and this place reminded her of a strange mechanical graveyard where some of the corpses hadnt quite  Something cold and smooth nuzzled the small of her back and she wasnt quite able to stifle a little shriek Will Dearborn wheeled toward her his hands dropping toward his belt Then he relaxed and smiled Rushers way of saying he feels ignored Im sorry Miss Delgado She looked at the horse Rusher looked back mildly then dipped his head as if to say he was also sorry for having startled her Foolishness girl she thought hearing the hearty nononsense voice of her father He wants to know why you re being so standoffy thats all And so do I Tisnt like you so its not Mr Dearborn Ive changed my mind she said Id like to ride  He turned his back and stood looking out at Citgo with his hands in his pockets while Susan first laid the poncho over the cantle of the saddle the plain black saddle of a working cowboy without a Barony brand or even a ranch brand to mark it and then mounted into the stirrup She lifted her skirt and glanced around sharply sure he would be stealing a peek but his back was still to her He seemed fascinated with the rusty oil derricks Whats so interesting about them cully she thought a trifle crossly  it was the lateness of the hour and the residue of her stirredup emotions she supposed Filthy old things have been there six centuries and more and Ive been smelling their stink my whole life Stand easy now my boy she said once she had her foot fixed in the stirrup One hand held the top of the saddles pommel the other the reins Rusher meanwhile flicked his ears as if to say he would stand easy all night were that what she required She swung up one long bare thigh flashing in the starlight and felt the exhilaration of being horsed that she always felt    only tonight it seemed a little stronger a little sweeter a little sharper Perhaps because the horse was such a beauty perhaps because the horse was a stranger   Perhaps because the horses owner is a stranger she thought and fair That was nonsense of course    and potentially dangerous nonsense Yet it was also true He was fair As she opened the poncho and spread it over her legs Dearborn began to whistle And she realized with a mixture of surprise and superstitious fear what the tune was Careless Love The very lay she had been singing on her way up to Rheas hut Mayhap its ka girl her fathers voice whispered No such thing she thought right back at him Illnot see ka in every passing wind and shadow like the old ladies who gather in Green Heart of a summers evening Its an old tune everyone knows it Mayhap better if youre right Pat Delgados voice returned For if its ka it II come like a wind and your plans will stand before it no more than my das barn stood before the cyclone when it came Not ka she would not be seduced by the dark and the shadows and the grim shapes of the oil derricks into believing it was Not ka but only a chance meeting with a nice young man on the lonely road back to town Ive made myself decent she said in a dry voice that didnt sound much like her own Ye may turn back if you like Mr Dearborn He did turn and gazed at her For a moment he said nothing but she could see the look in his eyes well enough to know that he found her fair as well And although this disquieted her  perhaps because of what hed been whistling  she was also glad Then he said You look well up there You sit well And I shall have horses of my own to sit before long she said Now the questions will come she thought But he only nodded as though he had known this about her already and began to walk toward town again Feeling a little disappointed and not knowing exactly why she clucked sidemouth at Rusher and twitched her knees at him He got moving catching up with his master who gave Rushers muzzle a companionable little caress What do they call that place yonder he asked pointing at the derricks The oil patch Citgo Some of the derricks still pump Aye and no way to stop them Not that anyone still knows Oh he said and that was all  just oh But he left his place by Rushers head for a moment when they came to the weedy track leading into Citgo walking across to look at the old disused guardhut In her childhood there had been a sign on it reading authorized personnel only but it had blown away in some windstorm or other Will Dearborn had his look and then came ambling back to the horse boots puffing up summer dust easy in his new clothes They went toward town a young walking man in a flatcrowned hat a young riding woman with a poncho spread over her lap and legs The starlight rained down on them as it has on young men and women since times first hour and once she looked up and saw a meteor flash overhead  a brief and brilliant orange streak across the vault of heaven Susan thought to wish on it and then with something like panic realized she had no idea what to wish for None at all  She kept her own silence until they were a mile or so from town and then asked the question which had been on her mind She had planned to ask hers after he had begun asking his and it irked her to be the one to break the silence but in the end her curiosity was too much Where do ye come from Mr Dearborn and what brings ye to our little bit o MidWorld  if ye dont mind me asking Not at all he said looking up at her with a smile Im glad to talk and was only trying to think how to begin Talks not a specialty of mine Then what is Will Dearborn she wondered Yes she wondered very much for in adjusting her position on the saddle she had put her hand on the rolled blanket behind    and had touched something hidden inside that blanket Something that felt like a gun It didnt have to be of course but she remembered the way his hands had dropped instinctively toward his belt when she had cried out in surprise I come from the InWorld Ive an idea you probably guessed that much on your own We have our own way of talking Aye Which Barony is yer home might I ask New Canaan She felt a flash of real excitement at that New Canaan Center of the Affiliation That did not mean all it once had of course but still  Not Gilead she asked detesting the hint of a girlish gush she heard in her voice And more than just a hint mayhap No he said with a laugh Nothing so grand as Gilead Only Hemphill a village forty or so wheels west of there Smaller than Hambry I wot Wheels she thought marvelling at the archaism He said wheels And what brings ye to Hambry then May ye tell Why not Ive come with two of my friends Mr Richard Stockworth of Pennilton New Canaan and Mr Arthur Heath a hilarious young man who actually does come from Gilead Were here at the order of the Affiliation and have come as counters Counters of what Counters of anything and everything which may aid the Affiliation in the coming years he said and she heard no lightness in his voice now  The business with the Good Man has grown serious Has it We hear little real news this far to the south and east of the hub He nodded The Baronys distance from the hub is the chief reason were here Mejis has been ever loyal to the Affiliation and if supplies need to be drawn from this part of the Outers theyll be sent The question that needs answering is how much the Affiliation can count on How much of what Yes he agreed as if shed made a statement instead of asking a question And how much of what Ye speak as though the Good Man were a real threat Hes just a bandit surely frosting his thefts and murders with talk of democracy and equality Dearborn shrugged and she thought for a moment that would be his only comment on the matter but then he said reluctantly  Twas once so perhaps Times have changed At some point the bandit became a general and now the general would become a ruler in the name of the people He paused then added gravely The Northern and Westrd Baronies are in flames lady But those are thousands of miles away surely This talk was upsetting and yet strangely exciting too Mostly it seemed exotic after the pokey alldaysthesame world of Hambry where someones dry well was good for three days of animated conversation Yes he said Not aye but yes  the sound was both strange and pleasing to her ear But the wind is blowing in this direction He turned to her and smiled Once more it softened his hard good looks and made him seem no more than a child up too late after his bedtime But I dont think well see John Farson tonight do you She smiled back If we did Mr Dearborn would ye protect me from him No doubt he said still smiling but I should do so with greater enthusiasm I wot if you were to let me call you by the name your father gave you Then in the interests of my own safety ye may do so And I suppose I must call ye Will in those same interests  Tis both wise and prettily put he said the smile becoming a grin wide and engaging I   Then walking as he was with his face turned back and up to her Susans new friend tripped over a rock Jutting out of the road and almost fell Rusher whinnied through his nose and reared a little Susan laughed merrily The poncho shifted revealing one bare leg and she took a moment before putting matters right again She liked him aye so she did And what harm could there be in it He was only a boy after all When he smiled she could see he was only a year or two removed from jumping in haystacks The thought that she had recently graduated from haystackjumping herself had somehow fled her mind Im usually not clumsy he said I hope I didnt startle you Not at all Will boys have been stubbing their toes around me ever since I grew my breasts Not at all she said and returned to the previous topic It interested her greatly So ye and yer friends come at the behest of the Affiliation to count our goods do you Yes The reason I took particular note of yon oil patch is because one of us will have to come back and count the working derricks   I can spare ye that Will There are nineteen He nodded Im in your debt But well also need to make out  if we can  how much oil those nineteen pumps are bringing up Are there so many oilfired machines still working in New Canaan that such news matters And do ye have the alchemy to change the oil into the stuff yer machines can use Its called refinery rather than alchemy in this case  at least I think so  and I believe there is one that still works But no we havent that many machines although there are still a few working filamentlights in the Great Hall at Gilead Fancy it she said delighted She had seen pictures of filamentlights and electric flambeaux but never the lights themselves The last ones in Hambry they had been called sparklights in this part of the world but she felt sure they were the same had burned out two generations ago You said your father managed the Mayors horses until his death Will Dearborn said Was his name Patrick Delgado It was wasnt it She looked down at him badly startled and brought back to reality in an instant How do ye know that His name was in our lessons of calling Were to count cattle sheep pigs oxen    and horses Of all your livestock horses are the most important Patrick Delgado was the man we were to see in that regard Im sorry to hear hes come to the clearing at the end of the path Susan Will you accept my condolence Aye and with thanks Was it an accident Aye Hoping her voice said what she wanted it to say which was leave this subject ask no more Let me be honest with you he said and for the first time she thought she heard a false note there Perhaps it was only her imagination Certainly she had little experience of the world Aunt Cord reminded her of this almost daily but she had an idea that people who set on by saying Let me be honest with you were apt to go on by telling you straightfaced that rain fell up money grew on trees and babies were brought by the Grand Featherex Aye Will Dearborn she said her tone just the tiniest bit dry They say honestys the best policy so they do He looked at her a bit doubtfully and then his smile shone out again That smile was dangerous she thought  a quicksand smile if ever there was one Easy to wander in perhaps more difficult to wander back out Theres not much Affiliation in the Affiliation these days Thats part of the reason Parsons gone on as long as he has thats what has allowed his ambitions to grow Hes come a far way from the harrier who began as a stagerobber in Garlan and Desoy and hell come farther yet if the Affiliation isnt revitalized Maybe all the way to Mejis She couldnt imagine what the Good Man could possibly want with her own sleepy little town in the Barony which lay closest to the Clean Sea but she kept silent In any case it wasnt really the Affiliation that sent us he said Not all this way to count cows and oil derricks and hectares of land under cultivation He paused a moment looking down at the road as if for more rocks in the way of his boots and stroking Rushers nose with absentminded gentleness She thought he was embarrassed perhaps even shamed We were sent by our fathers Yer   Then she understood Bad boys they were sent out on a makework quest that wasnt quite exile She guessed their real job in Hambry might be to rehabilitate their reputations Well she thought it certainly explains the quicksand smile doesnt it Ware this one Susan hes the sort to burn bridges and upset mailcarts then go on his merryway without a single look back Not in meanness but in plain old boycarelessness That made her think of the old song again the one shed been singing the one hed been whistling Our fathers yes Susan Delgado had cut a caper or two or perhaps it was two dozen other own in her time and she felt sympathy for Will Dearborn as well as caution And interest Bad boys could be amusing  up to a point The question was how bad had Will and his cronies been Helling she asked Helling he agreed still sounding glum but perhaps brightening just a bit about the eyes and mouth We were warned yes warned very well There was  a certain amount of drinking And a few girls to squeeze with the hand not busy squeezing the alepot It was a question no nice girl could outright ask but one that couldnt help occurring to her mind Now the smile which had played briefly around the comers of his mouth dropped away We pushed it too far and the fun stopped Fools have a way of doing that One night there was a race One moonless night After midnight All of us drunk One of the horses caught his hoof in a gopherhole and snapped a foreleg He had to be put down Susan winced It wasnt the worst thing she could think of but bad enough And when he opened his mouth again it got worse The horse was a thoroughbred one of just three owned by my friend Richards father who is not welltodo There were scenes in our households which I havent any desire to remember let alone talk about Ill make a long story short and say that after much talk and many proposals for punishment we were sent here on this errand It was Arthurs fathers idea I think Arthurs da has always been a bit appalled by Arthur Certainly Arthurs ructions didnt come from George Heaths side Susan smiled to herself thinking of Aunt Cordelia saying She certainly doesnt get it from our side of the family Then the calculated pause followed by She had a greataunt on her mothers side who ran crazy    you didnt know Yes Set herself on fire and threw herself over the Drop In the year of the comet it was Anyway Will resumed Mr Heath set us on with a saying from his own father  One should meditate in purgatory And here we are Hambrys far from purgatory He sketched his funny little how again If it were all should wanttobe bad enough to come here and meet the pretty denizens Work on that one a bit she said in her driest voice Its still rough  fear Perhaps   She fell silent as a dismaying realization occurred to her she was going to have to hope this boy would enter into a limited conspiracy with her Otherwise she was apt to be embarrassed Susan I was just thinking Are you here yet Will Officially I mean No he said taking her meaning at once And likely already seeing where this was going He seemed sharp enough in his way We only arrived in Barony this afternoon and youre the first person any of us has spoken to  unless that is Richard and Arthur have met folks I couldnt sleep and so came out to ride and to think things over a little Were camped over there He pointed to the right On that long slope that runs toward the sea Aye the Drop its called She realized that Will and his mates might even be camped on what would be her own land by law before much more time had passed The thought was amusing and exciting and a little startling Tomorrow we ride into town and present our compliments to My Lord Mayor Hart Thorin Hes a bit of a fool according to what we were told before leaving New Canaan Were ye indeed told so she asked raising one eyebrow Yes  apt to blabber fond of strong drink even more fond of young girls Will said Is it true would you say I think ye must judge for yerself said she stifling a smile with some effort In any case well also be presenting to the Honorable Kimba Rimer Thorins Chancellor and I understand he knows his beans And counts his beans as well Thorin will have ye to dinner at Mayors House Susan said Perhaps not tomorrow night but surely the night after A dinner of state in Hambry Will said smiling and still stroking Rushers nose Gods how shall I bear the agony of my anticipation Never mind yer nettlesome mouth she said but only listen ifyed be my friend This is important His smile dropped away and she saw again  as she had for a moment or two before  the man hed be before too many more years had passed The hard face the concentrated eyes the merciless mouth It was a frightening face in a way  a frightening prospect  and yet still the place the old hag had touched felt warm and she found it difficult to take her eyes off him What she wondered was his hair like under that stupid hat he wore Tell me Susan If you and yer friends come to table at Thorins ye may see me If ye see me Will see me for the first time See Miss Delgado as I shall see Mr Dearborn Doee take my meaning To the letter He was looking at her thoughtfully Do you serve Surely if your father was the Baronys chief drover you do not   Never mind what I do or dont do Just promise that if we meet at Seafront we meet for the first time I promise But   No more questions Weve nearly come to the place where we must part ways and I want to give ye a warning  fair payment for the ride on this nice mount of yours mayhap If ye dine with Thorin and Rimer yell not be the only new folk at his table Therell likely be three others men Thorin has hired to serve as private guards o the house Not as Sheriff s deputies Nay they answer to none but Thorin  or mayhap to Rimer Their names are Jonas Depape and Reynolds They look like hard boys to me  although Jonass boyhood is so long behind him that I imagine hes forgot he ever had one Jonas is the leader Aye He limps has hair that falls to his shoulders pretty as any girls and the quavery voice of an old gaffer who spends his days polishing the chimneycomer but I think hes the most dangerous of the three all the same Id guess these three have forgot more about helling than you and yer friends will ever learn Now why had she told him all that She didnt know exactly Gratitude perhaps He had promised to keep the secret of this latenight meeting and he had the look of a promisekeeper in hack with his father or not Ill watch them And I thank you for the advice They were now climbing a long gentle slope Overhead Old Mother blazed relentlessly Bodyguards he mused Bodyguards in sleepy little Hambry Its strange times Susan Strange indeed Aye She had wondered about Jonas Depape and Reynolds herself and could think of no good reason for them to be in town Had they been Rimers doing Rimers decision It seemed likely  Thorin wasnt the sort of man to even think about bodyguards she would have said the High Sheriff had always done well enough for him  but still why They breasted the hill Below them lay a nestle of buildings  the village of Hambry Only a few lights still shone The brightest cluster marked the Travellers Rest From here on the warm breeze she could hear the piano beating out Hey Jude and a score of drunken voices gleefully murdering the chorus Not the three men of whom she had warned Will Dearborn though they would be standing at the bar watching the room with their flat eyes Not the singing type were those three Each had a small blue coffinshape tattooed on his right hand burned into the webbing between thumb and forefinger She thought to tell Will this then realized hed see for himself soon enough Instead she pointed a little way down the slope at a dark shape which overhung the road on a chain Do ye see that Yes He heaved a large and rather comical sigh Is it the object I fear beyond all others Is it the dread shape of Mrs Beechs mailbox Aye And its there we must part If you say we must we must Yet I wish   Just then the wind shifted as it sometimes did in the summer and blew a strong gust out of the west The smell of seasalt was gone in an instant and so was the sound of the drunken singing voices What replaced them was a sound infinitely more sinister one that never failed to produce a scutter of gooseflesh up her back a low atonal noise like the warble of a siren being turned by a man without much longer to live Will took a step backward eyes widening and again she noticed his hands take a dip toward his belt as if reaching for something not there What in gods name is that Its a thinny she said quietly In Eyebolt Canyon Have ye never heard of such Heard of yes but never heard until now Gods how do you stand it It sounds alive She had never thought of it quite like that but now in a way listening with his ears instead of her own she thought he was right It was as if some sick part of the night had gained a voice and was actually trying to sing She shivered Rusher felt the momentary increased pressure of her knees and whickered softly craning his head around to look at her We dont often hear it so clearly at this time of year she said In the fall the men bum it to quiet I dont understand Who did Who understood anything anymore Gods they couldnt even turn off the few oilpumps in Citgo that still worked although half of them squealed like pigs in a slaughtering chute These days you were usually just grateful to find things that still worked at all In the summer when theres time drovers and cowboys drag loads of brush to the mouth of Eyebolt she said Dead brush is all right but live is better for its smoke thats wanted and the heavier the better Eyebolts a box canyon very short and steepwalled Almost like a chimney lying on its side you see Yes The traditional time for burning is Reap Mom  the day after the fair and the feast and the fire The first day of winter Aye although in these parts it doesnt feel like winter so soon In any case its no tradition the brush is sometimes lit sooner if the winds have been prankish or if the sounds particularly strong It upsets the livestock you know  cows give poorly when the noise of the thinnys strong  and it makes sleep difficult I should think it would Will was still looking north and a stronger gust of wind blew his hat off It fell to his back the rawhide tugstring pulling against the line of his throat The hair so revealed was a little long and as black as a crows wing She felt a sudden greedy desire to run her hands through it to let her fingers tell its texture  rough or smooth or silky And how would it smell At this she felt another shiver of heat down low in her belly He turned to her as though he had read her mind and she flushed grateful that he wouldnt be able to see the darkening of her cheek How long has it been there Since before I was born she said but not before my da was born He said that the ground shook in an earthquake just before it came Some say the earthquake brought it some say thats superstitious nonsense All I know is that its always been there The smoke quiets it awhile the way it will quiet a hive of bees or wasps but the sound always comes back The brush piled at the mouth helps to keep any wandering livestock out too  sometimes theyre drawn to it gods know why But if a cow or sheep does happen to yet in  after the burning and before the next years pile has started to grow mayhap  it doesnt come back out Whatever it is its hungry She put his poncho aside lifted her right leg over the saddle without so much as touching the horn and slipped off Rusher  all this in a single liquid movement It was a stunt made for pants rather than a dress and she knew from the further widening of his eyes that hed seen a good lot of her    but nothing she had to wash with the bathroom door closed so what of that And that quick dismount had ever been a favorite trick of hers when she was in a showoffy mood Pretty he exclaimed I learned it from my da she said responding to the more innocent interpretation of his compliment Her smile as she handed him the reins however suggested that she was willing to accept the compliment any way it was meant Susan Have you ever seen the thinny Aye once or twice From above What does it look like Ugly she responded at once Until tonight when she had observed Rheas smile up close and endured her twiddling meddling fingers she would have said it was the ugliest thing she had ever seen It looks a little like a slowburning peat fire and a little like a swamp full of scummy green water Theres a mist that rises off it Sometimes it looks like long skinny arms With hands at the end of em Is it growing Aye they say it is that every thinny grows but it grows slowly Twont escape Eyebolt Canyon in your time or mine She looked up at the sky and saw that the constellations had continued to tilt along their tracks as they spoke She felt she could talk to him all night  about the thinny or Citgo or her irritating aunt or just about anything  and the idea dismayed her Why should this happen to her now for the gods sake After three years of dismissing the Hambry boys why should she now meet a boy who interested her so strangely Why was life so unfair Her earlier thought the one shed heard in her fathers voice recurred to her If its ka itll come like a wind and your plans will stand before it no more than a barn before a cyclone But no And no And no So set she with all her considerable determination her mind against the idea This was no bam this was her life Susan reached out and touched the rusty tin of Mrs Beechs mailbox as if to steady herself in the world Her little hopes and daydreams didnt mean so much perhaps but her father had taught her to measure herself by her ability to do the things shed said she would do and she would not overthrow his teachings simply because she happened to encounter a goodlooking boy at a time when her body and her emotions were in a stew Ill leave ye here to either rejoin yer friends or resume yer ride she said The gravity she heard in her voice made her feel a bit sad for it was an adult gravity But remember yer promise Will  if ye see me at Seafront  Mayors House  and ifyed be my friend see me there for the first time As Id see you He nodded and she saw her seriousness now mirrored in his own face And the sadness mayhap Ive never asked a girl to ride out with me or if shed accept a visit of me Id ask of you Susan daughter of Patrick  Id even bring you flowers to sweeten my chances  but it would do no good I think She shook her head Nay Twouldnt Are you promised in marriage Its forward of me to ask I know but I mean no harm Im sure ye dont but Id as soon not answer My position is a delicate one just now as I told ye Besides its late Heres where we part Will But stay    one more moment    She rummaged in the pocket of her apron and brought out half a cake wrapped in a piece of green leaf The other half she had eaten on her way up to the Coos  in what now felt like the other half of her life She held what was left of her little evening meal out to Rusher who sniffed it then ate it and nuzzled her hand She smiled liking the velvet tickle in the cup of her palm Aye thees a good horse so ye are She looked at Will Dearborn who stood in the road shuffling his dusty boots and gazing at her unhappily The hard look was gone from his face now he looked her age again or younger We were well met werent we he asked She stepped forward and before she could let herself think about what she was doing she put her hands on his shoulders stood on her toes and kissed him on the mouth The kiss was brief but not sisterly Aye very well met Will But when he moved toward her as thoughtlessly as a flower turning its face to follow the sun wishing to repeat the experience she pushed him back a step gently but firmly Nay that was only a thankyou and one thankyou should be enough for a gentleman Go yer course in peace Will He took up the reins like a man in a dream looked at them for a moment as if he didnt know what in the world they were and then looked hack at her She could see him working to clear his mind and emotions of the impact her kiss had made She liked him for it And she was very glad she had done it And you yours he said swinging into the saddle I look forward to meeting you for the first time He smiled at her and she saw both longing and wishes in that smile Then he gigged the horse turned him and started back the way theyd come  to have another look at the oil patch mayhap She stood where she was by Mrs Beechs mailbox willing him to turn around and wave so she could see his face once more She felt sure he would    but he didnt Then just as she was about to turn away and start down the hill to town he did turn and his hand lifted fluttering for a moment in the dark like a moth Susan lifted her own in return and then went her way feeling happy and unhappy at the same time Yet  and this was perhaps the most important thing  she no longer felt soiled When she had touched the boys lips Rheas touch seemed to have left her skin A small magic perhaps but she welcomed it She walked on smiling a little and looking up at the stars more frequently than was her habit when out after dark He rode restlessly for nearly two hours back and forth along what she called the Drop never pushing Rusher above a trot although what he wanted to do was gallop the big gelding under the stars until his own blood began to cool a little Itll cool plenty if you draw attention to yourself he thought and likely you wont even have to cool it yourself Fools are the only folk on the earth who can absolutely count on getting what they deserve That old saying made him think of the scarred and bowlegged man who had been his lifes greatest teacher and he smiled At last he turned his horse down the slope to the trickle of brook which ran there and followed it a mile and a half upstream past several gathers of horse they looked at Rusher with a kind of sleepy walleyed surprise to a grove of willows From the hollow within a horse whickered softly Rusher whickered in return stamping one hoof and nodding his head up and down His rider ducked his own head as he passed through the willow fronds and suddenly there was a narrow and inhuman white face hanging before him its upper half all but swallowed by black pupilless eyes He dipped for his guns  the third time tonight hed done that and for the third time there was nothing there Not that it mattered already he recognized what was hanging before him on a string that idiotic rooks skull The young man who was currently calling himself Arthur Heath had taken it off his saddle it amused him to call the skull so perched their lookout ugly as an old gammer but perfect cheap to feed and hung it here as a prank greeting Him and his jokes Rushers master batted it aside hard enough to break the string and send the skull flying into the dark Fie Rolandsaid a voice from the shadows it was reproachful but there was laughter bubbling just beneath  as there always was Cuthbert was his oldest friend  the marks of their first teeth had been embedded on many of the same toys  but Roland had in some ways never understood him Nor was it just his laughter on the longago day when Hax the palace cook was to be hung for a traitor on Gallows Hill Cuthbert had been in an agony of terror and remorse Hed told Roland he couldnt stay couldnt watch    but in the end he had done both Because neither the stupid jokes nor the easy surface emotions were the truth of Cuthbert Allgood As Roland entered the hollow at the center of the grove a dark shape stepped out from behind the tree where it had been keeping Halfway across the clearing it resolved itself into a tall narrowhipped boy who was barefooted below his jeans and barechested above them In one hand he held an enormous antique revolver  a kind which was sometimes called a beerbarrel because of the cylinders size Fie Cuthbert repeated as if he liked the sound of this word not archaic only in forgotten backwaters like Mejis Thats a fine way to treat the guard o the watch smacking the poor thinfaced fellow halfway to the nearest mountainrange If Id been wearing a gun I likely would have blown it to smithereens and woken half the countryside I knew you wouldnt be going about strapped Cuthbert answered mildly Youre remarkably illlooking Roland son of Steven but nobodys fool even as you approach the ancient age of fifteen I thought we agreed wed use the names were travelling under Even among ourselves Cuthbert stuck out his leg bare heel planted in the turf and bowed with his arms outstretched and his hands strenuously bent at the wrist  an inspired imitation of the sort of man for whom court has become career He also looked remarkably like a heron standing in a marsh and Roland snorted laughter in spite of himself Then he touched the inside of his left wrist to his forehead to see if he had a fever He felt feverish enough inside his head gods knew but the skin above his eyes felt cool I cry your pardon gunslinger Cuthbert said his eyes and hands still turned humbly down The smile on Rolands face died And dont call me that again Cuthbert Please Not here not anywhere Not if you value me Cuthbert dropped his pose at once and came quickly to where Roland sat his horse He looked honestly humbled Roland  Will  Im sorry Roland clapped him on the shoulder No harm done Just remember from here on out Mejis may be at the end of the world    but it still is the world Wheres Alain Dick do you mean Where do you think Cuthbert pointed across the clearing to where a dark hulk was either snoring or slowly choking to death That one Cuthbert said would sleep through an earthquake But you heard me coming and woke Yes Cuthbert said His eyes were on Rolands face searching it with an intensity that made Roland feel a little uneasy Did something happen to you You look different Do I Yes Excited Aired out somehow If he was going to tell Cuthbert about Susan now was the time He decided without really thinking about it most of his decisions certainly the best of them were made in this same way not to tell If he met her at Mayors House it would be the first time as far as Cuthbert and Alain knew as well What harm in that Ive been properly aired all right he said dismounting and bending to uncinch the girths of his saddle Ive seen some interesting things too Ah Speak companion of my bosoms dearest tenant Ill wait until tomorrow I think when yon hibernating bear is finally awake Then I only have to tell once Besides Im tired Ill share you one thing though there are too many horses in these parts even for a Barony renowned for its horseflesh Too many by far Before Cuthbert could ask any questions Roland pulled the saddle from Rushers back and set it down beside three small wicker cages which had been bound together with rawhide making them into a carrier which could be secured to a horses back Inside three pigeons with white rings around their necks cooed sleepily One took his head out from beneath his wing had a peek at Roland and then tucked himself away again These fellows all right Roland asked Fine Pecking and shitting happily in their straw As far as theyre concerned theyre on vacation What did you mean about   Tomorrow Roland said and Cuthbert seeing that there would be no more only nodded and went to find his lean and bony lookout Twenty minutes later Rusher unloaded and rubbed down and set to forage with Buckskin and Glue Boy Cuthbert could not even name his horse as a normal person would Roland lay on his back in his bedroll looking up at the late stars overhead Cuthbert had gone back to sleep as easily as he had awakened at the sound of Rushers hoofs but Roland had never felt less sleepy in his life His mind turned back a month to the whores room to his father sitting on the whores bed and watching him dress The words his father had spoken  I have known for two years  had reverberated like a struck gong in Rolands head He suspected they might continue to do so for the rest of his life But his father had had much more to say About Marten About Rolands mother who was perhaps more sinned against than sinning About harriers who called themselves patriots And about John Farson who had indeed been in Cressia and who was gone from that place now  vanished as he had a way of doing like smoke in a high wind Before leaving he and his men had burned Indrie the Barony seat pretty much to the ground The slaughter had been in the hundreds and perhaps it was no surprise that Cressia had since repudiated the Affiliation and spoken for the Good Man The Barony Governor the Mayor of Indrie and the High Sheriff had all ended the early summer day which concluded Farsons visit with their heads on the wall guarding the towns entrance That was Steven Deschain had said pretty persuasive politics It was a game of Castles where both armies had come out from behind their Hillocks and the final moves had commenced Rolands father had said and as was so often the case with popular revolutions that game was apt to be over before many in the Baronies of MidWorld had begun to realize that John Farson was a serious threat or if you were one of those who believed passionately in his vision of democracy and an end to what he called class slavery and ancient fairytales a serious agent of change His father and his fathers small katet of gunslingers Roland was amazed to learn cared little about Farson in either light they looked upon him as small cheese Looked upon the Affiliation itself as small cheese come to that Im going to send you away Steven had said sitting there on the bed and looking somberly at his only son the one who had lived There is no true safe place left in Mid  World hut the Barony of Mejis on the Clean Sea is as close to true safety as any place may be these days    so its there youll go along with at least two of your mates Alain I suppose for one Just not that laughing boy for the other I beg of you You d be better off with a barking dog Roland who on any other day in his life would have been overjoyed at the prospect of seeing some of the wider world had protested hotly If the final battles against the Good Man were at hand he wanted to fight them at his fathers side He was a gunslinger now after all if only a prentice and  His father had shaken his head slowly and emphatically No Roland You dont understand You shall however as well as possible you shall Later the two of them had walked the high battlements above MidWorlds last living city  green and gorgeous Gilead in the morning sun with its pennons flapping and the vendors in the streets of the Old Quarter and horses trotting on the bridle paths which radiated out from the palace standing at the heart of everything His father had told him more not everything and he had understood more far from everything  nor did his father understand everything The Dark Tower had not been mentioned by either of them but already it hung in Rolands mind a possibility like a storm cloud far away on the horizon Was the Tower what all of this was really about Not a jumpedup harrier with dreams of ruling MidWorld not the wizard who had enchanted his mother not the glass ball which Steven and his posse had hoped to find in Cressia    but the Dark Tower He hadnt asked He hadnt dared ask Now he shifted in his bedroll and closed his eyes He saw the girls face at once he felt her lips pressed firmly against his own again and smelled the scent of her skin He was instantly hot from the top of his head to the base of his spine cold from the base of his spine to the tips of his toes Then he thought of the way her legs had flashed as she slid from Rushers back also the glimmer of the undergarments beneath her briefly raised dress and his hot half and cold half changed places The whore had taken his virginity but wouldnt kiss him had turned her face aside when he tried to kiss her Shed allowed him to do whatever else he wanted but not that At the time hed been bitterly disappointed Now he was glad The eye of his adolescent mind both restless and clear considered he braid which fell down her back to her waist the soft dimples which had formed at the comers of her mouth when she smiled the lilt of her voice her oldfashioned way of saying aye and nay ye and yer and da He thought of how her hands had felt on his shoulders as she stretched up to kiss him and thought he would give everything he owned to feel her hands there again so light and so firm And her mouth on his It was a mouth that knew only a little about kissing he guessed but that was a little more than he knew himself Be careful Roland  dont let your feeling for this girl tip anything over Shes not free anyway  she said as much Not married but spoken for in some other way Roland was far from the relentless creature he would eventually become but the seeds of that relentlessness were there  small stony things that would in their time grow into trees with deep roots    and bitter fruit Now one of these seeds cracked open and sent up its first sharp blade Whats been spoken for may be unspoken and whats done may be undone Nothings sure but    I want her Yes That was the one thing he did know and he knew it as well as he knew the face of his father he wanted her Not as he had wanted the whore when she lay naked on her bed with her legs spread and her halflidded eyes looking up at him but in the way he wanted food when he was hungry or water when he was thirsty In the way he supposed that he wanted to drag Martens dusty body behind his horse down Gileads High Road in payment for what the wizard had done to his mother He wanted her he wanted the girl Susan Roland turned over on his other side closed his eyes and fell asleep His rest was thin and lit by the crudely poetic dreams only adolescent boys have dreams where sexual attraction and romantic love come together and resonate more powerfully than they ever will again In these thirsty visions Susan Delgado put her hands on Rolands shoulders over and over kissed his mouth over and over told him over and over to come to her for the first time to be with her for the first time to see her for the first time to see her very well  Five miles or so from where Roland slept and dreamed his dreams Susan Delgado lay in her bed and looked out her window and watched Old Star begin to grow pale with the approaching dawn Sleep was no closer now than it had been when she lay down and there was a throb between her legs where the old woman had touched her It was distracting but no longer unpleasant because she now associated it with the boy shed met on the road and impulsively kissed by starlight Every time she shifted her legs that throb flared into a brief sweet ache When shed got home Aunt Cord who would have been in her own bed an hour before on any ordinary night had been sitting in her rocking chair by the fireplace  dead and cold and swept clean of ashes at this time of year  with a lapful of lace that looked like wavefroth against her dowdy black dress She was edging it with a speed that seemed almost supernatural to Susan and she hadnt looked up when the door opened and her niece came in on a swirl of breeze I expected ye an hour ago Aunt Cord said And then although she didnt sound it I was worried Aye Susan said and said no more She thought that on any other night she would have offered one of her fumbling excuses which always sounded like a lie to her own ears  it was the effect Aunt Cord had had on her all her life  but this hadnt been an ordinary night Never in her life had there been a night like this She found she could not get Will Dearborn out of her mind Aunt Cord had looked up then her closeset rather beady eyes sharp and inquisitive above her narrow blade of a nose Some things hadnt changed since Susan had set out for the Coos she had still been able to feel her aunts eyes brushing across her face and down her body like little whiskbrooms with sharp bristles What took ye so long Aunt Cord had asked Was there trouble No trouble Susan had replied but for a moment she thought of how the witch had stood beside her in the doorway pulling her braid through the gnarled tube of one loosely clenched fist She remembered wanting to go and she remembered asking Rhea if their business was done Mayhap theres one more little thing the old woman had said  or so Susan thought But what had that one more little thing been She couldnt remember And really what did it matter She was shut of Rhea until her belly began to rise with Thorins child    and if there could be no babymaking until ReapNight shed not be returning to the Coos until late winter at the soonest An age And it would be longer than that were she slow to kindle    I walked slowly coming home Aunt Thats all Then why look ye so Aunt Cord had asked scant brows knitting toward the vertical line which creased her brow How so Susan had asked taking off her apron and knotting the strings and hanging it on the hook just inside the kitchen door Flushy Frothy Like milk fresh out of the cow Shed almost laughed Aunt Cord who knew as little about men as Susan did about the stars and planets had struck it directly Flushy and frothy was exactly how she felt Only the night air I suppose she had said I saw a meteor Aunt And heard the thinny The sounds strong tonight Aye her aunt asked without interest then returned to the subject which did interest her Did it hurt A little Did ye cry Susan shook her head Good Better not Always better She likes it when they cry Ive heard Now Sue  did she give you something Did the old pussy give you something Aye She reached into her pocket and brought out the paper with written upon it She held it out and her aunt snatched it away with a greedy look Cordelia had been quite the sugarplum over the last month or so but now that she had what she wanted and now that Susan had come too far and promised too much to have a change of heart shed reverted to the sour supercilious often suspicious woman Susan had grown up with the one whod been driven into almost weekly bouts of rage by her phlegmatic lifegoesastwill brother In a way it was a relief It had been nervewracking to have Aunt Cord playing Cybilla GoodSprite day after day Aye aye theres her mark all right her aunt had said tracing her fingers over the bottom of the sheet A devils hoofs what it means some say but what do we care eh Sue Nasty horrid creature that she is shes still made it possible for two women to get on in the world a little longer And yell only have to see her once more probably around Years End when yeve caught proper It will be later than that Susan had told her Im not to lie with him until the full of the Demon Moon After the Reaping Fair and the bonfire Aunt Cord had stared eyes wide mouth open Said she so Are you calling me a liar Auntie she had thought with a sharpness that wasnt much like her usually her nature was more like her fathers Aye But why Why so long Aunt Cord was obviously upset obviously disappointed There had so far been eight pieces of silver and four of gold out of this they were tucked up wherever it was that Aunt Cord squirreled her money away and Susan suspected there was a fair amount of it although Cordelia liked to plead poverty at every opportunity and twice that much was still owed  or would be once the bloodstained sheet went to the Mayors House laundress That same amount would be paid yet again when Rhea had confirmed the baby and the babys honesty A lot of money all told A great lot for a little place like this and little folk like them And now to have the paying of it put back so far    Then came a sin Susan had prayed over although without much enthusiasm before getting into her bed she had rather enjoyed the cheated frustrated look on Aunt Cords face  the look of the thwarted miser Why so long  she repeated I suppose you could go up the Coos and ask her Cordelia Delgados lips thin to begin with had pressed together so tightly they almost disappeared Are you pert missy Are you pert with me No Im much too tired to be pert with anyone I want to wash  I can still feel her hands on me so I can  and go to bed Then do so Perhaps in the morning we can discuss this in more ladylike fashion And we must go and see Hart of course She folded the paper Rhea had given Susan looking pleased at the prospect of visiting Hart Thorin and moved her hand toward her dress pocket No Susan said and her voice had been unusually sharp  enough so to freeze her aunts hand in midair Cordelia had looked at her frankly startled Susan had felt a little embarrassed by that look but she hadnt dropped her eyes and when she held out her own hand it had been steady enough Im to have the keeping of that Aunt Who tells ye to speak so Aunt Cord had asked her voice almost whining with outrage  it was close to blasphemy Susan supposed but for a moment Aunt Cords voice had reminded her of the sound the thinny made Who tells ye to speak so to the woman who raised a motherless girl To the sister of that girls poor dead father You know who Susan said She still held her hand out Im to keep it and Im to give it to Mayor Thorin She said she didnt care what happened to it then he could wipe his bum with it for all of her the flush which suffused her aunts face at that had been very enjoyable but until then it was to be in my keeping I never heard of such a thing Aunt Cordelia had huffed    but she had handed the grimy scrap of paper back Giving the keep of such an important document to a mere scrap of a girl Yet not too mere a scrap to be his gilly am I To lie under him and listen to his bones creak and take his seed and mayhap bear his child Shed dropped her eyes to her pocket as she put the paper away again not wanting Aunt Cord to see the resentment in them Go up Aunt Cord had said brushing the froth of lace off her lap and into her workbasket where it lay in an unaccustomed tangle And when you wash do your mouth with especial care Cleanse it of its impudence and disrespect toward those who have given up much for love of its owner Susan had gone silently biting back a thousand retorts mounting the stairs as she had so often throbbing with a mixture of shame and resentment And now here she was in her bed and still awake as the stars paled away and the first brighter shades began to color the sky The events of the night just past slipped through her mind in a kind of fantastical blur like shuffled playing cards  and the one which turned up with the most persistence was the face of Will Dearborn She thought of how that face could be hard at one moment and soften so unexpectedly at the next And was it a handsome face Aye she thought so For herself she knew so Ive never asked a girl to ride out with me or if she would accept a visit of me I would ask you Susan daughter of Patrick Why now Why should I meet him now when no good can come of it If its ka it ll come like a wind Like a cyclone She tossed from one side of the bed to the other then at last rolled onto her back again There would be no sleep for her in what remained of this night she thought She might as well walk out on the Drop and watch the sun come up Yet she continued to lie in bed feeling somehow sick and well at the same time looking into the shadows and listening to the first cries of the morning birds thinking of how his mouth had felt against hers the tender grain of it and the feeling of his teeth below his lips the smell of his skin the rough texture of his shirt under her palms She now put those palms against the top of her shift and cupped her breasts with her fingers The nipples were hard like little pebbles And when she touched them the heat between her legs flared suddenly and urgently She could sleep she thought She could if she took care of that heat If she knew how And she did The old woman had shown her Even a girl whos intact dont need to lack for a shiver now n then Like a little bud o silk so it is Susan shifted in bed and slipped a hand deep beneath the sheet She forced the old womans bright eyes and hollow cheeks out of her mind  it wasnt hard to do at all once you set your mind to it she discovered  and replaced it with the face of the boy with the big gelding and the silly flatcrowned hat For a moment the vision of her mind became so clear and so sweet that it was real and all the rest of her life only a drab dream In this vision he kissed her over and over their mouths widening their tongues touching what he breathed out she breathed in She burned She burned in her bed like a torch And when the sun finally came over the horizon some short time later she lay deeply asleep with a faint smile on her lips and her unbraided hair lying across the side of her face and her pillow like loose gold  In the last hour before dawn the public room of the Travellers Rest was as quiet as it ever became The gaslights which turned the chandelier into a brilliant jewel until two of the clock or so on most nights were now turned down to guttering blue points and the long high room was shadowy and spectral In one corner lay a jumble of kindling  the remains of a couple of chairs smashed in a fight over a Watch Me game the combatants were currently residing in the High Sheriffs drunkcell In another comer was a fairly large puddle of congealing puke On the raised platform at the east end of the room stood a battered piano propped against its bench was the ironwood club which belonged to Barkie the saloons bouncer and allaround tough man Barkie himself the naked mound of his scarred stomach rising above the waistband of his corduroy pants like a clot of bread dough lay under the bench snoring In one hand he held a playing card the deuce of diamonds At the west end of the room were the card tables Two drunks lay with their heads on one of these snoring and drooling on the green felt their outstretched hands touching Above them on the wall was a picture of Arthur the Great King of Eld astride his white stallion and a sign which read in a curious mixture of High and Low Speech ARGYOU NOT ABOUT THE HAND YOU ARE DELT IN CARDS OR LIFE Mounted behind the bar which ran the length of the room was a monstrous trophy a twoheaded elk with a rack of antlers like a forest grove and four glaring eyes This beast was known to local habitus of the Travellers as The Romp None could have said why Some wit had carefully drawn a pair of sowtitty condoms over the prongs of two of its antlers Lying on the bar itself and directly beneath The Romps disapproving gaze was Pettie the Trotter one of the Travellers dancers and gillygirls    although Petties actual girlhood was well behind her now and soon she would be reduced to doing her business on her knees behind the Travellers rather than upstairs in one of the tiny cribs Her plump legs were spread one dangling over the bar on the inside one on the outside the filthy tangle of her skirt frothed up between She breathed in long snores occasionally twitching at the feet and fat fingers The only other sounds were the hot summer wind outside and the soft regular snap of cards being turned one by one A small table stood by itself near the batwing doors which gave upon the Hambry High Street it was here that Coral Thorin owner of the Travellers Rest and the Mayors sister sat on the nights when she descended from her suite to be a part of the company When she came down she came down early  when there were still more steaks than whiskey being served across the old scratched bar  and went back up around the time that Sheb the piano player sat down and began to pound his hideous instrument The Mayor himself never came in lit nil although it was wellknown that he owned at least a halfinterest in the Travellers Clan Thorin enjoyed the money the place brought in they just didnt enjoy the look of it after midnight when the sawdust spread on the floor began to soak up the spilled beer and the spilled blood Yet there was a hard streak in Coral who had twenty years before been what was called a wild child She was younger than her political brother not so thin and goodlooking in a largeeyed weaselheaded way No one sat at her table during the saloons operating hours  Barkie would have put a stop to anyone who tried and doublequick  but operating hours were over now the drunks mostly gone or passed out upstairs Sheb curled up and fast asleep in the comer behind his piano The softheaded boy who cleaned the place had been gone since two o the clock or so chased out by jeers and insults and a few flying beerglasses as he always was Roy Depape in particular had no love in his heart for that particular lad He would be back around nine or so to begin readying the old partypalace for another night of hilarity but until then the man sitting at Mistress Thorins table had the place to himself A game of Patience was laid out before him black on red red on black the partially formed Square o Court above all just as it was in the affairs of men In his left hand the player held the remains of the deck As he flipped the cards up one by one the tattoo on his right hand moved It was disconcerting somehow as if the coffin were breathing The cardplayer was an oldish fellow not as thin as the Mayor or his sister but thin His long white hair straggled down his back He was deeply tanned except for his neck where he always burned the flesh there hung in scant wattles He wore a mustache so long the ragged white ends hung nearly to his jaw  a sham gunslingers mustache many thought it but no one used the word sham to Eldred Jonass face He wore a white silk shirt and a blackhandled revolver hung low on his hip His large redrimmed eyes looked sad on first glance A second closer look showed them only to be watery Of emotion they were as dead as the eyes of The Romp He turned up the Ace of Wands No place for it Pah you bugger he said in an odd reedy voice It quavered as well like the voice of a man on the verge of tears It fit perfectly with his damp and redrimmed eyes He swept the cards together Before he could reshuffle a door opened and closed softly upstairs Jonas put the cards aside and dropped his hand to the butt of his gun Then as he recognized the sound of Reynoldss boots coming along the gallery he let go of the gun and drew his tobaccopouch from his belt instead The hem of the cloak Reynolds always wore came into view and then he was coming down the stairs his face freshly washed and his curly red hair hanging about his ears Vain of his looks was dear old Mr Reynolds and why not Hed sent his cock on its exploring way up more damp and cozy cracks than Jonas had ever seen in his life and Jonas was twice his age At the bottom of the stairs Reynolds walked along the bar pausing to squeeze one of Petties plump thighs and then crossed to where Jonas sat with his makings and his deck of cards Evening Eldred Morning Clay Jonas opened the sack took out a paper and sprinkled tobacco into it His voice shook but his hands were steady Like a smoke I could do with one Reynolds pulled out a chair turned it around and sat with his forearms crossed on its back When Jonas handed him the cigarette Reynolds danced it along the backs of his fingers an old gunslinger trick The Big Coffin Hunters were full of old gunslinger tricks Wheres Roy With Her Nibs They had been in Hambry a little over a month now and in that time Depape had conceived a passion for a fifteenyearold whore named Deborah Her bowlegged clumping walk and her way of squinting off into the distance led Jonas to suspect she was just another cowgirl from a long line of them but she had highhat ways It was Clay who had started calling the girl Her Nibs or Her Majesty or sometimes when drunk Roys Coronation Cunt Reynolds now nodded Its like hes drunk on her Hell be all right He aint throwing us over for some little snugglebunny with pimples on her tits Why shes so ignorant she cant spell cat Not so much as cat no I asked her Jonas made a second cigarette drew a sulfur match from the sack and popped it alight with his thumbnail He lit Reynoldss first then his own A small yellow cur came in under the batwing doors The men watched it in silence smoking It crossed the room first sniffed at the curdled vomit in the comer then began to eat it Its stub of a tail wagged back and forth as it dined Reynolds nodded toward the admonition not toargue about the cards you were dealt that muttd understand that Id say Not at all not at all Jonas demurred Just a dog is all he is a speweating dog I heard a horse twenty minutes ago First on the come then on the go Would it have been one of our hired watchmen You dont miss a trick do you Dont pay to no dont pay a bit Was it Yep Fellow who works for one of the small freeholders out along the east end of the Drop He seen em come in Three Young Babies Reynolds pronounced this last as they did in the Northrd Baronies babbies Nothing to worry of Now now we dont know that Jonas said his quavering voice making him sound like a temporizing old man Young eyes see far they say Young eyes see what theyre pointed at Reynolds replied The dog trotted past him licking its chops Reynolds helped it on its way with a kick the cur was not quite quick enough to avoid It scuttled back out under the batwings uttering little yikeyike sounds that made Barkie snort thickly from his place of rest beneath the piano bench His hand opened and the playing card dropped out of it Maybe so maybe not Jonas said In any case theyre Affiliation brats sons of big estates off in the Green Somewhere if Rimer and that fool he works for have it straight That means well be very very careful Walk easy like on eggshells Why weve got three more months here at least And those younguns may be here that whole time counting this n counting that and putting it all down on paper Folks counting things aint good for us right now Not for men in the resupply business Come on Its makework thats all  a slap on the wrist for getting in trouble Their daddies   Their daddies know Farsons in charge of the whole Southwest Edge now and sitting on high ground The brats may know the same  that playtimes purt near over for the Affiliation and all its pukesome royalty Cant know Clay With folks like these you cant know which way theyll jump At the very least they may try to do a halfdecent job just to try and get on the good side o their parents again Well know better when we see em but I tell you one thing we cant just put guns to the backs of their heads and drop them like brokeleg bosses if they see the wrong thing Their daddies might be mad at em alive but I think theyd be very tender of em dead  thats just the way daddies are Well want to be trig Clay as trig as we can be Better leave Depape out of it then Roy will be fine Jonas said in his quavery voice He dropped the stub of his cigarette to the floor and crushed it under his bootheel He looked up at The Romps glassy eyes and squinted as if calculating Tonight your friend said They arrived tonight these brats Yep Theyll be in to see Avery tomorrow then I reckon This was Herk Avery High Sheriff of Mejis and Chief Constable of Hambry a large man who was as loose as a trundle of laundry Reckon so Clay Reynolds said To present their papers n all Yes sir yes indeedy Howdyoudo and howdyoudo and howdyoudo again Reynolds said nothing He often didnt understand Jonas but he had been riding with him since the age of fifteen and knew it was usually better not to ask for enlightenment If you did you were apt to end up listening to a cultmanni lecture about the other worlds the old buzzard had visited through what he called the special doors As far as Reynolds was concerned there were enough ordinary doors in the world to keep him busy Ill speak to Rimer and Rimerll talk to the Sheriff about where they should stay Jonas said I think the bunkhouse at the old Bar K ranch You know where I mean Reynolds did In a Barony like Mejis you got to know the few landmarks in a hurry The Bar K was a deserted spread of land northwest of town not too far from that weird squalling canyon They burned at the mouth of the canyon every fall and once six or seven years ago the wind had shifted and gone back wrong and burned most of the Bar K to the ground  barns stables the home place It had spared the bunkhouse however and that would be a good spot for three tenderfeet from the Inners It was away from the Drop it was also away from the oil patch Ye like it dont ye Jonas asked putting on a hick Hambry accent Aye ye like it very much I can see ye do my cully Ye know what they say in Cressia Ifyed steal the silver from the dining room first put the dog in the pantry  Reynolds nodded It was good advice And those trucks Those whatdoyoucallums tankers Fine where they are Jonas said Not that we could move em now without attracting the wrong kind of attention eh You and Roy want to go out there and cover them with brush Lay it on nice and thick Day after tomorrow youll do it And where will you be while were flexing our muscles out at Citgo By daylight Preparing for dinner at Mayors House you clod  the dinner Thorin will be giving to introduce his guests from the Great World to the shitpicky society of the smaller one Jonas began making another cigarette He gazed up at The Romp rather than at what he was doing and still spilled barely a scrap of tobacco A bath a shave a trim of these tangled old mans locks  I might even wax my mustache Clay what do you say to that Dont strain yourself Eldred Jonas laughed the sound shrill enough to make Barkie mutter and Pettie stir uneasily on her makeshift bartop bed So Roy and I arent invited to this fancy do Youll be invited oh yes youll be invited very warmly Jonas said and handed Reynolds the fresh cigarette He began making another for himself Ill offer your excuses Ill do you boys proud count on me Strong men may weep All so we can spend the day out there in the dust and stink covering those hulks Youre too kind Jonas Ill be asking questions as well Jonas said dreamily Drifting here and there    looking spruce smelling of baybemes    and asking my little questions Ive known folks in our line of trade wholl go to a fat jolly fellow to find out the gossip  a saloonkeeper or bartender perhaps a livery stable owner or one of the chubby fellows who always hangs about the jail or the courthouse with his thumbs tucked into his vest pockets As for myself Clay I find that a womans best and the narrower the better  one with more nose than tits sticking off her I look for one who dont paint her lips and keeps her hair scrooped back against her head You have someone in mind Yar Cordelia Delgados her name Delgado You know the name its on the lips of everyone in this town I reckon Susan Delgado our esteemed Mayors soontobe gilly Cordelias her auntie Now heres a fact of human nature Ive found folk are more apt to talk to someone like her who plays them close than they are to the local jolly types wholl buy you a drink And that lady plays them close Im going to slip in next to her at that dinner and Im going to compliment her on the perfume I doubt like hell shell be wearing and Im going to keep her wineglass full Now how sounds that for a plan A plan for what Thats what I want to know For the game of Castles we may have to play Jonas said and all the lightness dropped out of his voice Were to believe that these boys have been sent here more as punishment than to do any real job of work It sounds plausible too Ive known rakes in my time and it sounds plausible indeed I believe it each day until about three in the morning and then a little doubt sets in And do you know what Clay Reynolds shook his head Im right to doubt Just as I was right to go with Rimer to old man Thorin and convince him that Farsons glass would be better with the witchwoman for the nonce Shell keep it in a place where a gunslinger couldnt find it let alone a nosy lad whos yet to have his first piece of arse These are strange times A storms coming And when you know the wind is going to blow its best to keep your gear battened down He looked at the cigarette he had made He had been dancing it along the backs of his knuckles as Reynolds had done earlier Jonas pushed back the fall of his hair and tucked the cigarette behind his ear I dont want to smoke he said standing up and stretching His back made small crackling sounds Im crazy to smoke at this hour of the morning Too many cigarettes are apt to keep an old man like me awake He walked toward the stairs squeezing Petties bare leg as he went by also as Reynolds had done At the foot of the stairs he looked back I dont want to kill them Things are delicate enough without that Ill smell quite a little wrong on them and not lift a finger no not a single finger of my hand But   Id like to make them clear on their place in the great scheme o things Give them a sore paw Jonas brightened Yessir partner maybe a sore paws just what Id like to give them Make them think twice about tangling with the Big Coffin Hunters later on when it matters Make them swing wide around us when they see us in their road Yessir thats something to think about It really is He started up the stairs chuckling a little his limp quite pronounced  it got worse late at night It was a limp Rolands old teacher Cort might have recognized for Cort had seen the blow which caused it Corts own father had dealt it with an ironwood club breaking Eldred Jonass leg in the yard behind the Great Hall of Gilead before taking the boys weapon and sending him west gunless into exile Eventually the man the boy had become had found a gun of course the exiles always did if they looked hard enough That such guns could never be quite the same as the big ones with the sandalwood grips might haunt them for the rest of their lives but those who needed guns could still find them even in this world Reynolds watched until he was gone then took his seat at Coral Thorins desk shuffled the cards and continued the game which Jonas had left halffinished Outside the sun was coming up Two nights after arriving in the Barony of Mejis Roland Cuthbert and Alain rode their mounts beneath an adobe arch with the words come in peace inscribed above it Beyond was a cobblestone courtyard lit with torches The resin which coated these had been doctored somehow so that the torches glowed different colors green orangeyred a kind of sputtery pink that made Roland think of fireworks He could hear the sound of guitars the murmur of voices the laughter of women The air was redolent of those smells which would always remind him of Mejis seasalt oil and pine I dont know if I can do this Alain muttered He was a big boy with a mop of unruly blond hair spilling out from under his stockmans hat He had cleaned up well  they all had  but Alain no social butterfly under the best of circumstances looked scared to death Cuthbert was doing better but Roland guessed his old friends patina of insouciance didnt go very deep If there was to be leading done here he would have to do it Youll be fine he told Alain Just   Oh he looks fine Cuthbert said with a nervous laugh as they crossed the courtyard Beyond it was Mayors House a sprawling manywinged adobe hacienda that seemed to spill light and laughter from every window White as a sheet ugly as a   Shut up Roland said curtly and the teasing smile tumbled off Cuthberts face at once Roland noted this then turned to Alain again Just dont drink anything with alcohol in it You know what to say on that account Remember the rest of our story too Smile Be pleasant Use what social graces you have Remember how the Sheriff fell all over himself to make us feel welcome Alain nodded at that looking a little more confident In the matter of social graces Cuthbert said they wont have many themselves so we should all be a step ahead Roland nodded then saw that the birds skull was back on the horn of Cuthberts saddle And get rid of that Looking guilty Cuthbert stuffed the lookout hurriedly into his saddlebag Two men wearing white jackets white pants and sandals were coming forward bowing and smiling Keep your heads Roland said lowering his voice Both of you Remember why youre here And remember the faces of your fathers He clapped Alain who still looked doubtful on the shoulder Then he turned to the hostlers Goodeven gents he said May your days be long upon the earth They both grinned their teeth flashing in the extravagant torchlight The older one bowed And your own as well young masters Welcome to Mayors House  The High Sheriff had welcomed them the day before every bit as happily as the hostlers So far everyone had greeted them happily even the carters they had passed on their way into town and that alone made Roland feel suspicious and on his guard He told himself he was likely being foolish  of course the locals were friendly and helpful that was why they had been sent here because Mejis was both outoftheway and loyal to the Affiliation  and it probably was foolish but he thought it best to be on close watch just the same To be a trifle nervous The three of them were little more than children after all and if they fell into trouble here it was apt to be as a result of taking things at face value The combined Sheriffs office and jail o Barony was on Hill Street overlooking the bay Roland didnt know for sure but guessed that few if any hungover drunks and wifebeaters anywhere else in MidWorld woke up to such picturesque views a line of manycolored boathouses to the south the docks directly below with boys and old men linefishing while the women mended nets and sails beyond them Hambrys small fleet moving back and forth on the sparkling blue water of the bay setting their nets in the morning pulling them in the afternoon Most buildings on the High Street were adobe but up here overlooking Hambrys business section they were as squat and bricky as any narrow lane in Gileads Old Quarter Well kept too with wroughtiron gates in front of most and treeshaded paths The roofs were orange tile the shutters closed against the summer sun It was hard to believe riding down this street with their horses hoofs clocking on the swept cobbles that the northwestern side of the Affiliation  the ancient land of Eld Arthurs kingdom  could be on fire and in danger of falling The jailhouse was just a larger version of the post office and land office a smaller version of the Town Gathering Hall Except of course for the bars on the windows facing down toward the small harbor Sheriff Herk Avery was a bigbellied man in a lawmans khaki pants and shirt He must have been watching them approach through the spy hole in the center of the jails ironbanded front door because the door was thrown open before Roland could even reach for the turnbell in the center Sheriff Avery appeared on the stoop his belly preceding him as a bailiff may precede My Lord Judge into court His arms were thrown wide in the most amiable of greetings He bowed deeply to them Cuthbert said later he was afraid the man might overbalance and go rolling down the steps perhaps go rolling all the way down to the harbor and wished them repeated goodmorns tapping away at the base of his throat like a madman the whole while His smile was so wide it looked as if it might cut his head clean in two Three deputies with a distinctly farmerish look about them dressed in khaki like the Sheriff crowded into the door behind Avery and gawked That was what it was all right a gawk there was just no other word for that sort of openly curious and totally unselfconscious stare Avery shook each boy by the hand continuing to bow as he did so and nothing Roland said could get him to stop until he was done When he finally was he showed them inside The office was delightfully cool in spite of the beating midsummer sun That was the advantage of brick of course It was big as well and cleaner than any High Sheriffs office Roland had ever been in before    and he had been in at least half a dozen over the last three years accompanying his father on several short trips and one longer patrolswing There was a rolltop desk in the center a noticeboard to the right of the door the same sheets of foolscap had been scribbled on over and over paper was a rare commodity in MidWorld and in the far comer two rifles in a padlocked case These were such ancient blunderbusses that Roland wondered if there was ammunition for them He wondered if they would fire come to that To the left of the guncase an open door gave on the jail itself  three cells on each side of a short corridor and a smell of strong lye soap drifting out Theyve cleaned for our coming Roland thought He was amused touched and uneasy Cleaned it as though we were a troop of Inner Barony horse  career soldiers who might want to stage a hard inspection instead of three lads serving punishment detail But was such nervous care on the part of their hosts really so strange They were from New Canaan after all and folk in this tuckedaway corner of the world might well see them as a species of visiting royalty Sheriff Avery introduced his deputies Roland shook hands with all of them not trying to memorize their names It was Cuthbert who took care of names and it was a rare occasion when he dropped one The third a bald fellow with a monocle hanging around his neck on a ribbon actually dropped to one knee before them Dont do that ye great idiot Avery cried yanking him back up by the scruff of his neck What kind of a bumpkin will they think ye Besides youve embarrassed them so ye have Thats all right Roland said he was in fact very embarrassed although trying not to show it Were really nothing at all special you know   Nothing special Avery said laughing His belly Roland noticed did not shake as one might have expected it to do it was harder than it looked The same might be true of its owner Nothing special he says Five hundred mile or more from the InWorld theyve come our first official visitors from the Affiliation since a gunslinger passed through on the Great Road four year ago and yet he says theyre nothing special Would ye sit my boys Ive got graf which ye wont want so early in the day  praps not at all given your ages and if youll forgive me for statin so bald the obvious fact of yer youth for youths not a thing to be ashamed of so its not we were all young once and I also have white iced tea which I recommend most hearty as Daves wife makes it and shes a dab hand with most any potable Roland looked at Cuthbert and Alain who nodded and smiled and tried not to look all at sea then back at Sheriff Avery White tea would go down a treat in a dusty throat he said One of the deputies went to fetch it chairs were produced and set in a row at one side of Sheriff Averys rolltop and the business of the day commenced You know who ye are and where ye hail from and I know the same Sheriff Avery said sitting down in his own chair it uttered a feeble groan beneath his bulk but held steady I can hear InWorld in yer voices but more important I can see it in yer faces Yet we hold to the old ways here in Hambry sleepy and rural as we may be aye we hold to our course and remember the faces of our fathers as wells we can So although Id not keep yer long from yer duties and if yell forgive me for the impertinence Id like a look at any papers and documents of passage ye might just happen tove brought into town with ye They just happened to have brought all of their papers into town with them as Roland was sure Sheriff Avery well knew they would He went through them quite slowly for a man whod promised not to hold them from their duties tracing the wellfolded sheets the linen content so high that the documents were perhaps closer to cloth than paper with one pudgy finger his lips moving Every now and then the finger would reverse as he reread a line The two other deputies stood behind him looking sagely down over his large shoulders Roland wondered if either could actually read William Dearborn Drovers son Richard Stockworth Ranchers son Arthur Heath Stockline breeders son The identification document belonging to each was signed by an attestor  James Reed of Hemphill in the case of Dearborn Piet Ravenhead of Pennilton in the case of Stockworth Lucas Rivers of Gilead in the case of Heath All in order descriptions nicely matched The papers were handed back with profuse thanks Roland next handed Avery a letter which he took from his wallet with some care Avery handled it in the same fashion his eyes growing wide as he saw the frank at the bottom  Pon my soul boys Twas a gunslinger wrote this Aye so it was Cuthbert agreed in a voice of wonder Roland kicked his ankle  hard  without taking his respectful eyes from Averys face The letter above the frank was from one Steven Deschain of Gilead a gunslinger which was to say a knight squire peacemaker and Baron    the last title having almost no meaning in the modem day despite all John Farsons ranting of the twentyninth generation descended from Arthur of Eld on the side line of descent the longdescended gel of one of Arthurs many gillies in other words To Mayor Hartwell Thorin Chancellor Kimba Rimer and High Sheriff Herkimer Avery it sent greetings and recommended to their notice the three young men who delivered this document Masters Dearborn Stockworth and Heath These had been sent on special mission from the Affiliation to serve as counters of all materials which might serve the Affiliation in time of need the word war was omitted from the document but glowed between every line Steven Deschain on behalf of the Affiliation of Baronies exhorted Misters Thorin Rimer and Avery to afford the Affiliations nominated counters every help in their service and to be particularly careful in the enumerations of all livestock all supplies of food and all forms of transport Dearborn Stockworth and Heath would be in Mejis for at least three months Deschain wrote possibly as long as a year The document finished by inviting any or all of the addressed public officials to write us word of these young men and their deportment in all detail as you shall imagine of interest to us And it begged Do not stint in this matter if you love us Tell us if they behaved themselves in other words Tell us if theyve learned their lesson The deputy with the monocle came back while the High Sheriff was perusing this document He carried a tray loaded with four glasses of white tea and bent down with it like a butler Roland murmured thanks and handed the glasses around He took the last for himself raised it to his lips and saw Alain looking at him his blue eyes bright in his stolid face Alain shook his glass slightly  just enough to make the ice tinkle  and Roland responded with the barest sliver of a nod He had expected cool tea from a jug kept in a nearby springhouse but there were actual chunks of ice in the glasses Ice in high summer It was interesting And the tea was as promised delicious Avery finished the letter and handed it back to Roland with the air of one passing on a holy relic Ye want to keep that safe about yer person Will Dearborn  aye very safe indeed Yes sir He tucked the letter and his identification back into his purse His friends Richard and Arthur were doing the same This is excellent white tea sir Alain said Ive never had better Aye Avery said sipping from his own glass  Tis the honey that makes it so fearsome Eh Dave The deputy with he monocle smiled from his place by the noticehoard  believe so but Judy dont like to say She had the recipe from her mother Aye we must remember the faces of our mothers too so we must Sheriff Avery looked sentimental for a moment but Roland had an idea that the face of his mother was the furthest thing from the big mans mind just then He turned to Alain and sentiment was replaced by a surprising shrewdness Yere wondering about the ice Master Stockworth Alain started Well I Ye expected no such amenity in a backwater like Hambry Ill warrant Avery said and although there was a joshing quality on top of his voice Roland thought there was something else entirely underneath He doesnt like us He doesnt like what he thinks of as our city ways  He hasnt known us long enough to know what kind of ways we have if any at all but already he doesnt like them He thinks were a trio of snotnoses that we see him and everyone else here as country bumpkins Not just Hambry Alain said quietly Ice is as rare in the Inner Arc these days as anywhere else Sheriff Avery When I grew up I saw it mostly as a special treat at birthday parties and such There was always ice on Glowing Day Cuthbert put in He spoke with very unCuthbertian quiet Except for the fireworks thats what we liked about it most Is that so is that so Sheriff Avery said in an amazed wonderswillnevercease tone Avery perhaps didnt like them riding in like this didnt like having to take up what he would probably call half the damn morning with them he didnt like their clothes their fancy identification papers their accents or their youth Least of all their youth Roland could understand all that but wondered if it was the whole story If there was something else going on here what was it Theres a gasfired refrigerator and stove in the Town Gathering Hall Avery said Both work Theres plenty of earthgas out at Citgo  thats the oil patch east of town Yer passed it on yer way in I wot They nodded Stoves nobbut a curiosity these days  a history lesson for the schoolchildren  but the refrigerator comes in handy so it does Avery held up his glass and looked through the side  Specially in summer He sipped some tea smacked his lips and smiled at Alain You see No mystery Im surprised you havent found use for the oil Roland said No generators in town Sheriff Aye there be four or five Avery said The biggest is out at Francis Lengylls Rocking B ranch and I recall when it useter run Its HONDA Do ye kennit that name boys HONDA Ive seen it once or twice Roland said on old motordriven bicycles Aye In any case none of the generators will run on the oil from the Citgo patch Tis too thick Tarry goo is all We have no refineries here I see Alain said In any case ice in summers a treat However it comes to the glass He let one of the chunks slip into his mouth and crunched it between his teeth Avery looked at him a moment longer as if to make sure the subject was closed then switched his gaze back to Roland His fat face was once more radiant with his broad untrustworthy smile Mayor Thorin has asked me to extend ye his very best greetings and convey his regrets for not bein here today  very busy is our Lord Mayor very busy indeed But hes laid on a dinnerparty at Mayors House tomorrow evening  seven o the clock for most folk eight for you young fellows  so you can make a bit of an entrance I imagine add a touch o drama like And I need not tell such as yourselves whove probably attended more such parties than Ive had hot dinners that it would be best to arrive pretty much on the dot Is it fancydress Cuthbert asked uneasily Because weve come a long way almost four hundred wheels and we didnt pack formal wear and sashes none of us Avery was chuckling  more honestly this time Roland thought perhaps because he felt Arthur had displayed a streak of unsophistication and insecurity Nay young master Thorin understands yeve come to do a job  next door to workin cowboys ye be Ware they dont have ye out draggin nets in the bay next From the comer Dave  the deputy with the monocle  honked unexpected laughter Perhaps it was the sort of joke you had to be local to understand Roland thought Wear the best ye have and yell be fine Therell be no one there in sashes in any case  thats not how things are done in Hambry Again Roland was struck by the mans constant smiling denigration of his town iiul Barony    and the resentment of the outsiders which lay just beneath it In any case yell find yerselves working more than playing tomorrow night I imagine Harts invited all the large ranchers stockliners and livestock owners from this part of the Barony  not that theres so many you understand bein as how Mejis is next door to desert once you get west o the Drop But everyone whose goods and chattel youve been sent to count will be there and I think youll find all of them loyal Affiliation men ready and eager to help Theres Francis Lengyll of the Rocking B  John Croydon of the Piano Ranch   Henry Wertner whos the Baronys stockliner as well as a horsebreeder in his own right   Hash Renfrew who owns the Lazy Susan the biggest horseranch in Mejis not that its much by the standards you fellows are used to I wot    and therell be others as well Rimerll introduce you and get you about your business right smart Ronald nodded and turned to Cuthbert Youll want to be on your mettle tomorrow night Cuthbert nodded Dont fear me Will Ill note em all Avery sipped more tea eyeing them over his glass with a roguish expression so false it made Roland want to squirm Most of ems got daughters of marriageable age and theyll bring em You boys want to look out Roland decided hed had enough tea and hypocrisy for one morning He nodded emptied his glass smiled hoping his looked more genuine than Averys now looked to him and got to his feet Cuthbert and Alain took the cue and did likewise Thank you for the tea and for the welcome Roland said Please send a message to Mayor Thorin thanking him for his kindness and telling him that hell see us tomorrow at eight o the clock prompt Ayeso i will Roland then turned to Dave That worthy was so surprised to be noticed again that he recoiled almost bumping his head on the noticeboard And please thank your wife for the tea It was wonderful I will Thankeesai They went back outside High Sheriff Avery herding them along like a genial overweight sheepdog As to where youll locate   he began as they descended the steps and started down the walk As soon as they hit the sunshinehe began to sweat Oh land I forgot to ask you about that Roland said knocking the heel of his hand against his forehead Weve camped out on that long slope lots of horses as you go down the turf Im sure you know where I mean   The Drop aye   but without permission because we dont yet know who to ask Thatd be John Croydons land and Im sure he wouldnt begrudge ye but we mean to do ye better than that Theres a spread northwest of here the Bar K Used to blong to the Garber family but they gave it up and moved on after a fire Now it blongs to the Horsemens Association  thats a little local group of farmers and ranchers I spoke to Francis Lengyll about you fellows  hes the HA president just current  and he said Well put em out to the old Garber place why not  Why not Cuthbert agreed in a gentle musing voice Roland shot him a sharp glance but Cuthbert was looking down at the harbor where the small fishing boats skittered to and fro like waterbugs Aye just what I said Why not indeed I said The home place burned to a cinder but the bunkhouse still stands so does the stable and the cookshack next door to it On Mayor Thorins orders Ive taken the liberty of stocking the larder and having the bunkhouse swept out and spruced up a little Ye may see the occasional bug but nothing thatll bite or sting    and no snakes unless theres a few under the floor and if there are let em stay theres what I say Hey boys Let em stay there Let em stay there right under the floor where theyre happy Cuthbert agreed still gazing down at the harbor with his arms folded over his chest Avery gave him a brief uncertain glance his smile flickering a bit at the comers Then he turned back to Roland and the smile shone out strongly once more Theres no holes in the roof lad and if it rains yell be dry What think ye of that Does it sound well to ye Better than we deserve I think that youve been very efficient and Mayor Thorins been far too kind And he did think that The question was why But we appreciate his thoughtfulness Dont we boys Cuthbert and Alain made vigorous assent And we accept with thanks Avery nodded Ill tell him Go safely boys They had reached the hitching rail Avery once more shook hands all around this time saving his keenest looks for their horses Until tomorrow night then young gents Tomorrow night Roland agreed Will ye be able to find the Bar K on your own do yer think Again Roland was struck by the mans unspoken contempt and unconscious condescension Yet perhaps it was to the good If the High Sheriff thought they were stupid who knew what might come of it Well find it Cuthbert said mounting up Avery was looking suspiciously at the rooks skull on the horn of Cuthberts saddle Cuthbert saw him looking but for once managed to keep his mouth shut Roland was both amazed and pleased by this unexpected reticence Fare you well Sheriff And you boy He stood there by the hitching post a large man in a khaki shirt with sweatstains around the armpits and black boots that looked too shiny for a working sheriffs feet And wheres the horse that could support him through a day of rangeriding Roland thought Id like to see the cut of that Cayuse Avery waved to them as they went The other deputies came down the walk Deputy Dave in the forefront They waved too  The moment the Affiliation brats mounted on their fathers expensive horseflesh were around the comer and headed downhill to the High Street the sheriff and the deputies stopped waving Avery turned to Dave Hollis whose expression of slightly stupid awe had been replaced by one marginally more intelligent What think ye Dave Dave lifted his monocle to his mouth and began to nibble nervously at its brass edging a habit about which Sheriff Avery had long since ceased to nag him Even Daves wife Judy had given up on that score and Judy Hollis  Judy Wertner that was  was a fair engine when it came to getting her own way Soft Dave said Soft as eggs just dropped out of a chickens ass Mayhap Avery said putting his thumbs in his belt and rocking enormously back and forth but the one did most of the talking him in the flathead hat he doesnt think hes soft Dont matter what he thinks Dave said still nibbling at his eyeglass Hes in Hambry now He may have to change his way of thinking to ourn Behind him the other deputies laughed Even Avery smiled They would leave the rich boys alone if the rich boys left them alone  those were orders straight from Mayors House  but Avery had to admit that he wouldnt mind a little dustup with them so he wouldnt He would enjoy putting his boot into the balls of the one with that idiotic birds skull on his saddlehorn  standing there and mocking him hed been thinking all the while that Herk Avery was too countrydumb to know what he was up to  but the thing hed realty enjoy would be beating the cool look from the eyes of the boy in the flathead preachers hat seeing a hotter expression of fear rise up in them as Mr Will Dearborn of Hemphill realized that New Canaan was far away and his rich father couldnt help him Aye he said clapping Dave on the shoulder Mayhap hell have to change his way of thinking He smiled  one very different from any of those he had shown the Affiliation counters Mayhap they all will  The three boys rode in single file until they were past the Travellers Rest a young and obviously retarded man with kinky black hair looked up from scrubbing the brick stoop and waved to them they waved back Then they moved up abreast Roland in the middle What did you think of our new friend the High Sheriff Roland asked I have no opinion Cuthbert said brightly No none at all Opinion is politics and politics is an evil which has caused many a fellow to be hung while hes still young and pretty He leaned forward and tapped the rooks skull with his knuckles The lookout didnt care for him though Im sorry to say that our faithful lookout thought Sheriff Avery a fat bag of guts without a trustworthy bone in his body Roland turned to Alain And you young Master Stockworth Alain considered it for some time as was his way chewing a piece of grass hed bent oversaddle to pluck from his side of the road At last he said If he came upon us burning in the street I dont think hed piss on us to put us out Cuthbert laughed heartily at that And you Will How do you say dear captain He doesnt interest me much  but one thing he said does Given that the horsemeadow they call the Drop has to be at least thirty wheels long and runs five or more to the dusty desert how do you suppose Sheriff Avery knew we were on the part of it that belongs to Croydons Piano Ranch They looked at him first with surprise then speculation After a moment Cuthbert leaned forward and rapped once more on the rooks skull Were being watched and you never reported it No supper for you sir and itll be the stockade the next time it happens But before they had gone much farther Rolands thoughts of Sheriff Avery gave way to more pleasant ones of Susan Delgado He would see her the following night of that he was sure He wondered if her hair would be down He couldnt wait to find out  Now here they were at Mayors House Let the game begin Roland thought not clear on what that meant even as the phrase went through his mind surely not thinking of Castles    not then The hostlers led their mounts away and for a moment the three of them stood at the foot of the steps  huddled almost as horses do in unfriendly weather  their beardless faces washed by the light of the torches From inside the guitars played and voices were raised in a fresh eddy of laughter Do we knock Cuthbert asked Or just open and march in Roland was spared answering The main door of the had was thrown open and two women stepped out both wearing long whitecollared dresses that reminded all three boys of the dresses stockmens wives wore in their own part of the world Their hair was caught back in snoods that sparkled with some bright diamondy stuff in the light of the torches The plumper of the two stepped forward smiling and dropped them a deep curtsey Her earrings which looked like squarecut firedims flashed and bobbed You are the young men from the Affiliation so you are and welcome you are as well Goodeven sirs and may your days be long upon the earth They bowed in unison boots forward and thanked her in an unintended chorus that made her laugh and clap her hands The tall woman beside her offered them a smile as spare as her frame I am Olive Thorin the plump woman said the Mayors wife This is my sisterinlaw Coral Coral Thorin still with that narrow smile it barely creased her lips and touched her eyes not at all dipped them a token curtsey Roland Cuthbert and Alain bowed again over their outstretched legs I welcome you to Seafront Olive Thorin said her dignity leavened and made pleasant by her artless smile her obvious dazzlement at the appearance of her young visitors from InWorld Come to our house with joy I say so with all my heart so I do And so we will madam Roland said for your greeting has made us joyful He took her hand and with no calculation whatever raised it to his lips and kissed it Her delighted laughter made him smile He liked Olive Thorin on sight and it was perhaps well he met someone of that sort early on for with the problematic exception of Susan Delgado he met no one else he liked no one else he trusted all that night  It was warm enough even with the seabreeze and the cloak  and coatcollector in the foyer looked as though hed had little or no custom Roland wasnt entirely surprised to see that it was Deputy Dave his remaining bits of hair slicked back with some sort of gleaming grease and his monocle now lying on the snowwhite breast of a housemans jacket Roland gave him a nod Dave his hands clasped behind his back returned it Two men  Sheriff Avery and an elderly gent as gaunt as Old Doctor Death in a cartoon  came toward them Beyond through a pair of double doors now open wide a whole roomful of people stood about with crystal punchcups in their hands talking and taking little bits of food from the trays which were circulating Roland had time for just one narroweyed glance toward Cuthbert Everything Every name every face    every nuance Especially those Cuthbert raised an eyebrow  his discreet version of a nod  and then Roland was pulled willynilly into the evening his first real evening of service as a working gunslinger And he had rarely worked harder Old Doctor Death turned out to be Kimba Rimer Thorins Chancellor and Minister of Inventory Roland suspected the title had been made up special for their visit He was easily five inches taller than Roland who was considered tall in Gilead and his skin was pale as candlewax Not unhealthylooking just pale Wings of irongray hair floated away from either side of his head gossamer as cobwebs The top of his skull was completely bald Balanced on his whelk of a nose was a pincenez My boys he said when the introductions had been made He had the smooth sadly sincere voice of a politician or an undertaker Welcome to Mejis To Hambry And to Seafront our humble Mayors House If this is humble I should wonder at the palace your folk might build Roland said It was a mild enough remark more pleasantry than witticism he ordinarily left the wit to Bert but Chancellor Rimer laughed hard So did Sheriff Avery Come boys Rimer said when he apparently felt he had expressed enough amusement The Mayor awaits you with impatience Im sure Aye said a timid voice from behind them The skinny sisterinlaw Coral had disappeared but Olive Thorin was still there looking up at the newcomers with her hands decorously clasped before that area of her body which might once have been her waist She was still smiling her hopeful pleasant smile Very eager to meet you Hart is very eager indeed Shall I conduct them Kimba or   Nay nay you mustnt trouble yourself with so many other guests to attend Rimer said I suppose youre right She curtseyed to Roland and his companions a final time and although she still smiled and although the smile looked completely genuine to Roland he thought Shes unhappy about something all the same Desperately so I think Gentlemen Rimer asked The teeth in his smile were almost disconcertingly huge Will ye come He led them past the grinning Sheriff and into the reception hall  Roland was hardly overwhelmed by it he had after all been in the Great Hall of Gilead  the Hall of the Grandfathers it was sometimes called  and had even peeped down on the great party which was held there each year the socalled Dance of Easterling which marked the end of Wide Earth and the advent of Sowing There were five chandeliers in the Great Hall instead of just one and lit with electric bulbs rather than oil lamps The dress of the partygoers many of them expensive young men and women who had never done a hands turn of work in their lives a fact of which John Farson spoke at every opportunity had been richer the music had been fuller the company of older and nobler lines which grew closer and closer together as they stretched back toward Arthur Eld he of the white horse and unifying sword Yet there was life here and plenty of it There was a robustness that had been missing in Gilead and not just at Easterling either The texture he felt as he stepped into the Mayors House reception room was the sort of thing Roland reflected that you didnt entirely miss when it was gone because it slipped away quietly and painlessly Like blood from a vein cut in a tub filled with hot water The room  almost but not quite grand enough to be a hall  was circular its panelled walls decorated by paintings most quite bad of previous Mayors On a raised stand to the right of the doors leading into the dining area four grinning guitarists in tati jackets and sombreros were playing something that sounded like a waltz with pepper on it In the center of the floor was a table supporting two cutglass punchbowls one vast and grand the other smaller and plainer The whitejacketed fellow in charge of the dippingout operations was another of Averys deputies Contrary to what the High Sheriff had told them the day before several of the men were wearing sashes of various colors but Roland didnt feel too out of place in his white silk shirt black string tie and one pair of stovepipe dress trousers For every man wearing a sash he saw three wearing the sort of dowdy boxtailed coats that he associated with stockmen at church and he saw several others younger men for the most part who werent wearing coats at all Some of the women wore jewelry though nothing so expensive as sai Thorins firedim earrings and few looked as if theyd missed many meals but they also wore clothes Roland recognized the long roundcollared dresses usually with the lace fringe of a colored underskirt showing below the hem the dark shoes with low heels the snoods most sparkling with gemdust as those of Olive and Coral Thorin had been And then he saw one who was very different It was Susan Delgado of course shimmering and almost too beautiful to look at in a blue silk dress with a high waist and a squarecut bodice which showed the tops of her breasts Around her neck was a sapphire pendant that made Olive Thorins earrings look like paste She stood next to a man wearing a sash the color of coals in a hot woodfire That deep orangered was the Baronys color and Roland supposed that the man was their host but for the moment Roland barely saw him His eye was held by Susan Delgado the blue dress the tanned skin the triangles of color too pale and perfect to be makeup which ran lightly up her cheeks most of all her hair which was unbound tonight and fell to her waist like a shimmer of palest silk He wanted her suddenly and completely with a desperate depth of feeling that felt like sickness Everything he was and everything he had come for it seemed was secondary to her She turned a little then and spied him Her eyes they were gray he saw widened the tiniest bit He thought that the color in her cheeks deepened a little Her lips  lips that had touched his as they stood on a dark road he thought with wonder  parted a little Then the man standing next to Thorin also tall also skinny with a mustache and long white hair lying on the dark shoulders of his coat said something and she turned back to him A moment later the group around Thorin was laughing Susan included The man with the white hair didnt join them but smiled thinly Roland hoping his face did not give away the fact that his heart was pounding like a hammer was led directly to this group which stood close to the punchbowls Distantly he could feel Rimers bony confederation of fingers clamped to his arm above the elbow More clearly he could smell mingled perfumes the oil from the lamps on the walls the aroma of the ocean And thought for no reason at all Oh I am dying I am dying Take hold of yourself Roland of Gilead Stop this foolishness for your fathers sake Take hold He tried  to some degree succeeded   and knew he would be lost the next time she looked at him It was her eyes The other night in the dark he hadnt been able to see those fogcolored eyes Ididnt know how lucky I was he thought wryly Mayor Thorin Rimer asked May I present our guests from the Inner Baronies Thorin turned away from the man with the long white hair and the woman standing next to him his face brightening He was shorter than his Chancellor but just as thin and his build was peculiar a short and narrowshouldered upper body over impossibly long and skinny legs He looked Roland thought like the sort of bird you should glimpse in a marsh at dawn bobbing for its breakfast Aye you may he cried in a strong high voice Indeed you may weve been waiting with impatience great impatience for this moment Well met we are very well met Welcome sirs May your evening in this house of which I am the fleeting proprietor be happy and may your days be long upon the earth Roland took the bony outstretched hand heard the knuckles crack beneath his grip looked for an expression of discomfort on the Mayors face and was relieved to see none He bowed low over his outstretched leg William Dearborn Mayor Thorin at your service Thank you for your welcome and may your own days be long upon the earth Arthur Heath made his manners next then Richard Stockworth Thorins smile widened at each deep bow Rimer did his best to beam but looked unused to it The man with the long white hair took a glass of punch passed it to his female companion and continued to smile thinly Roland was aware that everyone in the room  the guests numbered perhaps fifty in all  was looking at them but what he felt most upon his skin beating like a soft wing was her regard He could see the blue silk of her dress from the side of one eye but did not dare look at her more directly Was your trip difficult Thorin was asking Did you have adventures and experience perils We would hear all the details at dinner so we would for we have few guests from the Inner Arc these days His eager slightly fatuous smile faded his tufted brows drew together Did ye encounter patrols of Farson No Excellency Rolandsaid we   Nay lad nay  no Excellency I wont have it and the fisherfolk and hossdrovers I serve wouldnt even if I would Just Mayor Thorin if you please Thank you We saw many strange things on our journey Mayor Thorin but no Good Men Good Men Rimer jerked out and his upper lip lifted in a smile which made him look doglike Good Men indeed We would hear it all every word Thorin said But before I forget my manners in my eagerness young gentlemen let me introduce you to these close around me Kimba youve met this formidable fellow to my left is Eldred Jonas chief of my newly installed security staff Thorins smile looked momentarily embarrassed Im not convinced that I need extra security Sheriff Averys always been quite enough to keep the peace in our comer of the world but Kimba insists And when Kimba insists the Mayor must bow Very wise sir Rimer said and bowed himself They all laughed save for Jonas who simply held onto his narrow smile Jonas nodded Pleased gents Im sure The voice was a reedy quaver He then wished them long days upon the earth all three coming to Roland last in his round of handshaking His grip was dry and firm utterly untouched by the tremor in his voice And now Roland noticed the queer blue shape tattooed on the back of the mans right hand in the webbing between thumb and first finger It looked like a coffin Long days pleasant nights Roland said with hardly a thought It was a greeting from his childhood and it was only later that he would realize it was one more apt to be associated with Gilead than with any such rural place as Hemphill Just a small slip but he was beginning to believe that their margin for such slips might be a good deal less than his father had thought when he had sent Roland here to get him out of Martens way And to you Jonas said His bright eyes measured Roland with a thoroughness that was close to insolence still holding his hand Then he released it and stepped back Cordelia Delgado Mayor Thorin said next bowing to the woman who had been speaking to Jonas As Roland also bowed in her direction he saw the family resemblance    except that what looked generous and lovely on Susans face looked pinched and folded on the face before him now Not the girls mother Roland guessed that Cordelia Delgado was a bit too young for that And our especial friend Miss Susan Delgado Thorin finished sounding flustered Roland supposed she would have that effect on any man even an old one like the Mayor Thorin urged her forward bobbing his head and grinning one of his knucklechoked hands pressed against the small of her back and Roland felt an instant of poisonous jealousy Ridiculous given this mans age and his plump pleasant wife but it was there all right and it was sharp Sharp as a bees ass Cort would have said Then her face tilted up to his and he was looking into her eyes again He had heard of drowning in a womans eyes in some poem or story and thought it ridiculous He still thought it ridiculous but understood it was perfectly possible nonetheless And she knew it He saw concern in her eyes perhaps even fear Promise me that if we meet at Mayors House we meet for the first time The memory of those words had a sobering clarifying effect and seemed to widen his vision a little Enough for him to be aware that the woman beside Jonas the one who shared some of Susans features was looking at the girl with a mixture of curiosity and alarm He bowed low but did little more than touch her ringless outstretched hand Even so he felt something like a spark jump between their fingers From the momentary widening of those eyes he thought that she felt it too Pleased to meet you sai he said His attempt to be casual sounded tinny and false in his own ears Still he was begun it felt like the whole world was watching him them and there was nothing to do but go on with it He tapped his throat three times May your days be long   Aye and yours Mr Dearborn Thankeesai She turned to Alain with a rapidity that was almost rude then to Cuthbert who bowed tapped then said gravely Might I recline briefly at your feet miss Your beauty has loosened my knees Im sure a few moments spent looking up at your profile from below with the back of my head on these cool tiles would put me right They all laughed at that  even Jonas and Miss Cordelia Susan blushed prettily and slapped the back of Cuthberts hand For once Roland blessed his friends relentless sense of foolery Another man joined the party by the punchbowl This newcomer was blocky and blessedly unthin in his boxtail coat His cheeks burned with high color that looked like windburn rather than drink and his pale eyes lay in nets of wrinkles A rancher Roland had ridden often enough with his father to know the look Therell be maids aplenty to meet you boys tonight the newcomer said with a friendly enough smile Yell find yselves drunk on perfume if yere not careful But Id like my crack at you before you meet em Fran Lengyll at your service His grip was strong and quick no bowing or other nonsense went with it I own the Rocking B  or it owns me whichever way ye want to look at it Im also boss of the Horsemens Association at least until they fire me The Bar K was my idea Hope its all right Its perfect sir Alain said Clean and dry and room for twenty Thank you Youve been too kind Nonsense Lengyll said looking pleased all the same as he knocked back a glass of punch Were all in this together boy John Farsons but one bad straw in a field of wrongheadedness these days The worlds moved on folks say Huh So it has aye and a good piece down the road to hell is where its moved on to Our job is to hold the hay out of the furnace as well as we can as long as we can For the sake of our children even more than for that of our fathers Hear hear Mayor Thorin said in a voice that strove for the high ground of solemnity and fell with a splash into fatuity instead Roland noticed the scrawny old fellow was gripping one of Susans hands she seemed almost unaware of it was looking intently at Lengyll instead and suddenly he understood the Mayor was either her uncle or perhaps a cousin of some close degree Lengyll ignored both looking at the three newcomers instead scrutinizing each in turn and finishing with Roland Anything us in Mejis can do to help lad just ask  me John Croydon Hash Renfrew Jake White Hank Wertner any or all Yell meet em tonight aye their wives and sons and daughters as well and ye need only ask We may be a good piece out from the hub of New Canaan here but were strong for the Affiliation all the same Aye very strong Well spoken Rimer said quietly And now Lengyll said well toast your arrival proper And yeve had to wait too long already for a dip of punch Its dry as dust ye must be He turned to the punchbowls and reached for the ladle in the larger and more ornate of the two waving off the attendant clearly wanting to honor them by serving them himself Mr Lengyll Roland said quietly Yet there was a force of command in that voice Fran Lengyll heard it and turned The smaller bowl is soft punch is it not Lengyll considered this at first not understanding Then his eyebrow went up For the first time he seemed to consider Roland and the others not as living symbols of the Affiliation and the Inner Baronies but as actual human beings Young ones Only boys when you got right down to it Aye Draw ours from that if youd be so kind He felt all eyes upon them now Her eyes particularly He kept his own firmly fixed on the rancher but his peripheral vision was good and he was very aware that Jonass thin smile had resurfaced Jonas knew what this was about already Roland supposed Thorin and Rimer did as well These country mice knew a lot More than they should and he would need to think about that carefully later It was the least of his concerns at the current moment however We have forgotten the faces of our fathers in a matter that has some bearing on our posting to Hambry Roland was uncomfortably aware that he was now making a speech like it or not It wasnt the whole room he was addressing  thank the gods for little blessings  but the circle of listeners had grown well beyond the original group Yet there was nothing for it but to finish the boat was launched I neednt go into details  nor would you expect them I know  but I should say that we promised not to indulge in spirits during our time here As penance you see Her gaze He could still feel it on his skin it seemed For a moment there was complete quiet in the little group around the punchbowls and then Lengyll said Your father would be proud to hear ye speak so frank Will Dearborn  aye so he would And what boy worth his salt didnt get up to a little noise n wind from time to time He clapped Roland on the shoulder and although the grip of his hand was firm and his smile looked genuine his eyes were hard to read only gleams of speculation deep in those beds of wrinkles In his place may I be proud for him Yes Roland said smiling in return And with my thanks And mine Cuthbert said Mine as well Alain said quietly taking the offered cup of soft punch and bowing to Lengyll Lengyll filled more cups and handed them rapidly around Those already holding cups found them plucked away and replaced with fresh cups of the soft punch When each of the immediate group had one Lengyll turned apparently intending to offer the toast himself Rimer tapped him on the shoulder shook his head slightly and cut his eyes toward the Mayor That worthy was looking at them with his eyes rather popped and his jaw slightly dropped To Roland he looked like an enthralled playgoer in a penny seat all he needed was a lapful of orangepeel Lengyll followed the Chancellors glance and then nodded Rimer next caught the eye of the guitar player standing at the center of the musicians He stopped playing so did the others The guests looked that way then back to the center of the room when Thorin began speaking There was nothing ridiculous about his voice when he put it to use as he now did  it was carrying and pleasant Ladies and gentlemen my friends he said I would ask you to help me in welcoming three new friends  young men from the Inner Baronies fine young men who have dared great distances and many perils on behalf of the Affiliation and in the service of order and peace Susan Delgado set her punchcup aside retrieved her hand with some difficulty from her uncles grip and began to clap Others joined in The applause which swept the room was brief but warm Eldred Jonas did not Roland noticed put his cup aside to join in Thorin turned to Roland smiling He raised his cup May I set you on with a word Will Dearborn Aye so you may and with thanks Roland said There was laughter and fresh applause at his usage Thorin raised his cup even higher Everyone else in the room followed suit crystal gleamed like starpoints in the light of the chandelier Ladies and gentlemen I give you William Dearborn of Hemphill Richard Stockworth of Pennilton and Arthur Heath of Gilead Gasps and murmurs at that last as if their Mayor had announced Arthur Heath of Heaven Take of them well give to them well make their days in Mejis sweet and their memories sweeter Help them in their work and to advance the causes which are so dear to all of us May their days be long upon the earth So says your Mayor SO SAY WE ALL they thundered back Thorin drank the rest followed his example There was fresh applause Roland turned helpless to stop himself and found Susans eyes again at once For a moment she looked at him fully and in her frank gaze he saw that she was nearly as shaken by his presence as he was by hers Then the older woman who looked like her bent and murmured something into her ear Susan turned away her face a composed mask    but he had seen her regard in her eyes And thought again that what was done might be undone and what was spoken might be unspoken  As they passed into the dining hall which had tonight been set with four long trestle tables so close there was barely room to move between them Cordelia tugged her nieces hand pulling her back from the Mayor and Jonas who had fallen into conversation with Fran Lengyll Why looked you at him so miss Cordelia whispered furiously The vertical line had appeared on her forehead Tonight it looked as deep as a trench What ails thy pretty stupid head Thy Just that was enough to tell Susan that her aunt was in a fine rage Looked at who And how Her tone sounded right she thought but oh her heart  The hand over hers clamped down hurting Play no fiddle with me Miss Oh So Young and Pretty Have ye ever seen that fineturned row of pins before Tell me the truth No how could I Aunt youre hurting me Aunt Cord smiled balefully and clamped down harder Better a small hurt now than a large one later Curb your impudence And curb your flirtatious eyes Aunt I dont know what you   I think you do Cordelia said grimly pressing her niece close to the wood panelling to allow the guests to stream past them When the rancher who owned the boathouse next to theirs said hello Aunt Cord smiled pleasantly at him and wished him goodeven before turning back to Susan Mind me miss  mind me well If I saw yer cows eyes ye may be sure that half the company saw Well whats done is done but it stops now Your time for such childmaid games is over Do you understand Susan was silent her face setting in those stubborn lines Cordelia hated most of all it was an expression that always made her feel like slapping her headstrong niece until her nose bled and her great gray does eyes gushed tears Yeve made a vow and a contract Papers have been passed the weirdwoman has been consulted money has changed hands And yeve given your promise If that means nothing to such as yerself girl remember what itd mean to yer father Tears rose in Susans eyes again and Cordelia was glad to see them Her brother had been an improvident irritation capable of producing only this far too pretty womanchild  but he had his uses even dead Now promise yell keep yer eyes to yourself and that if ye see that boy coming yell swing wide  aye wides you can  to stay out of his way I promise Aunt Susan whispered I do Cordelia smiled She was really quite pretty when she smiled Its well then Lets go in Were being looked at Hold my arm child Susan clasped her aunts powdered arm They entered the room side by side their dresses rustling the sapphire pendant on the swell of Susans breast flashing and many there were who remarked upon how alike they looked and how well pleased poor old Pat Delgado would have been with them  Roland was seated near the head of the center table between Hash Renfrew a rancher even bigger and blockier than Lengyll and Thorins rather morose sister Coral Renfrew had been handy with the punch now as the soup was brought to table he set about proving himself equally adept with the ale He talked about the fishing trade not what it useter be boy although its less muties they pull up in their nets these days n thats a blessin the farming trade folks round here can grow most anythin longs its corn or beans and finally about those things clearly closest to his heart horsin coursin and ranchin Those businesses went on as always aye so they did although times had been hard in the grassandseacoast Baronies for forty year or more Werent the bloodlines clarifying Roland asked For they had begun to do so where he came from Aye Renfrew agreed ignoring his potato soup and gobbling barbecued beefstrips instead These he scooped up with a bare hand and washed down with more ale Aye young master bloodlines was clarifying wonderful well indeed they were three colts out of every five were threaded stock  in thoroughbred as well as common lines kennit  and the fourth could be kept and worked if not bred Only one in five these days born with extra legs or extra eyes or its guts on the outside and that was good But the birthrates were way down so they were the stallions had as much ram as ever in their ramrods it seemed but not as much powder and ball Beggin your pardon maam Renfrew said leaning briefly across Roland to Coral Thorin She smiled her thin smile it reminded Roland of Jonass trudged her spoon through her soup and said nothing Renfrew emptied his alecup smacked his lips heartily and held the cup out again As it was recharged he turned back to Roland Things werent good not as they once had been but they could be worse Would be worse if that bugger Farson had his way This time he didnt bother excusing himself to sai Thorin They all had to pull together that was the ticket  rich and poor great and small while pulling could still do some good And then he seconded Lengyll telling Roland that whatever he and his friends wanted whatever they needed they had only to name it Information should be enough Roland said Numbers of things Aye cant be a counter without numbers Renfrew agreed and sprayed beery laughter On Rolands left hand Coral Thorin nibbled a bit of green the beefstrips she had not so much as touched smiled her narrow smile and went on boating with her spoon Roland guessed there was nothing wrong with her ears though and that her brother might get a complete report of their conversation Or possibly it would be Rimer to get the report For while it was too early to say for sure Roland had an idea that Rimer might be the real force here Along perhaps with sai Jonas For instance Roland said how many riding horses do you think we may be able to report back to the Affiliation Titheor total Total Renfrew put his cup down and appeared to calculate As he did Roland looked across the table and saw Lengyll and Henry Wertner the Baronys stockliner exchange a quick glance They had heard And he saw something else as well when he returned his attention to his seatmate Hash Renfrew was drunk but likely not as drunk as he wanted young Will Dearborn to believe Total ye say  not just what we owe the Affiliation or might be able to send along in a pinch Yes Well lets see young sai Fran must run a hundredn forty head John Croydons got near a hundred Hank Wertners got forty on his own hook and must run sixty more out along the Drop for the Barony Govmint hossflesh Mr Dearborn Roland smiled I know it well Split hoofs low necks no speed bottomless bellies Renfrew laughed hard at that nodding   but Roland found himself wondering if the man was really amused In Hambry the waters on top and the waters down below seemed to run in different directions As for myself Ive had a bad ten or twelve year  sandeye brain fever cabbards At one time there was two hundred head of running horses out there on the Drop with the Lazy Susan brand on em now there cant be more than eighty Roland nodded So were speaking of four hundred and twenty head Oh moren that Renfrew said with a laugh He went to pick up his alecup struck it with the side of one work  and weatherreddened hand knocked it over cursed picked it up then cursed the aleboy who came slow to refill it More than that Roland prompted when Renfrew was finally cocked and locked and ready to resume action Ye have to remember Mr Dearborn that this is hosscountry more than its fishercountry We josh each other we and the fishers but theres many a scalescraper got a nag put away behind his house or in the Barony stables if they have no roof of their own to keep the rain off a bosss head Twas her poor da useter keep the Barony stables Renfrew nodded toward Susan who was seated across and three seats up from Roland himself  just a tables turn from the Mayor who was of course seated at the head Roland found her placement there passing peculiar especially given the fact that the Mayors missus had been seated almost all the way at the far end of the table with Cuthbert on one side of her and some rancher to whom they had not yet been introduced on her other Roland supposed an old fellow like Thorin might like to have a pretty young relation near at hand to help draw attention to him or to cheer up his own eye but it still seemed odd Almost an insult to ones wife If he was tired of her conversation why not put her at the head of another table They have their own customs thats all and the customs of the country arent your concern This mans crazy horsecount is your concern How many other running horses would you say he asked Renfrew In all Renfrew gazed at him shrewdly An honest answerll not come back to haunt me will it sonny Im an Affiliation man  so I am Affiliation to the core theyll carve Excalibur on my gravehead like as not  but Id not see Hambry and Mejis stripped of all its treasure That wont happen sai How could we force you to give up what you dont want to in any case Such forces as we have are all committed in the north and west against the Good Man Renfrew considered this then nodded And may I not be Will to you Renfrew brightened nodded and offered his hand a second time He grinned broadly when Roland this time shook it in both of his the overandunder grip preferred by drovers and cowboys Thesere bad times we live in Will and theyve bred bad manners Id guess there are probably another hundred and fifty head of horse in and about Mejis Good ones is what I mean Bighat stock Renfrew nodded clapped Roland on the back ingested a goodly quaff of ale Bighats aye From the top of their table there came a burst of laughter Jonas had apparently said something funny Susan laughed without reservation her head tilted back and her hands clasped before the sapphire pendant Cordelia who sat with the girl on her left and Jonas on her right was also laughing Thorin was absolutely convulsed rocking back and forth in his chair wiping his eyes with a napkin Yons a lovely girl Renfrew said He spoke almost reverently Roland could not quite swear that a small sound  a womanly hmmpf perhaps  had come from his other side He glanced in that direction and saw sai Thorin still sporting with her soup He looked back toward the head of the table Is the Mayor her uncle or perhaps her cousin Roland asked What happened next had a heightened clarity in his memory as if someone had turned up all the colors and sounds of the world The velvet swags behind Susan suddenly seemed a brighter red the caw of laughter which came from Coral Thorin was the sound of a breaking branch It was surely loud enough to make everyone in the vicinity stop their conversations and look at her Roland thought    except only Renfrew and the two ranchers across the table did Her uncle It was her first conversation of the evening Her uncle thats good Eh Rennie Renfrew said nothing only pushed his alecup away and finally began to eat his soup Im surprised at ye young man so I am Ye may be from the InWorld but oh goodness whoever tended to your education of the real world  the one outside of books n maps  stopped a mite short Id say Shes his   And then a word so thick with dialect that Roland had no idea what it was Seefin it sounded or perhaps sheevin I beg pardon He was smiling but the smile felt cold and false on his mouth There was a heaviness in his belly as if the punch and the soup and the single beefstrip he had eaten for politeness sake had all lumped together in his stomach Do you serve hed asked her meaning did she serve at table Mayhap she did serve but likely she did it in a room rather more private than this Suddenly he wanted to hear no more had not the slightest interest in the meaning of the word the Mayors sister had used Another burst of laughter rocked the top of the table Susan laughed with her head back her cheeks glowing her eyes sparkling One strap of her dress had slipped down her arm disclosing the tender hollow of her shoulder As he watched his heart full of fear and longing she brushed it absently back into place with the palm of her hand It means quiet little woman  Renfrew said clearly uncomfortable Its an old term not used much these days   Stop it Rennie said Coral Thorin Then to Roland Hes just an old cowboy and cant quit shovelling horseshit even when hes away from his beloved nags Sheevin means sidewife In the time of my greatgrandmother it meant whore    but one of a certain kind She looked with a pale eye at Susan who was now sipping ale then turned back to Roland There was a species of baleful amusement in her gaze an expression that Roland liked little The kind of whore you had to pay for in coin the kind too fine for the trade of simple folk Shes his gilly Roland asked through lips which felt as if they had been iced Aye Coral said Not consummated not until the Reap  and none too happy about that is my brother Ill warrant  but bought and paid for just as in the old days So she is Coral paused then said Her father would die of shame if he could see her She spoke with a kind of melancholy satisfaction I hardly think we should judge the Mayor too harshly Renfrew said in an embarrassed pontificating voice Coral ignored him She studied the line of Susans jaw the soft swell of her bosom above the silken edge of her bodice the fall of her hair The thin humor was gone from Coral Thorins face In it now was a somehow chilling species of contempt In spite of himself Roland found himself imagining the Mayors knucklebunchy hands pushing down the straps of Susans dress crawling over her naked shoulders plunging like gray crabs into the cave beneath her hair He looked away toward the tables lower end and what he saw there was no better It was Olive Thorin that his eye found  Olive who had been relegated to the foot of the table Olive looking up at the laughing folk who sat at its head Looking up at her husband who had replaced her with a beautiful young girl and gifted that girl with a pendant which made her own firedim earrings look dowdy by comparison There was none of Corals hatred and angry contempt on her face Looking at her might have been easier if that were so She only gazed at her husband with eyes that were humble hopeful and unhappy Now Roland understood why he had thought her sad She had every reason to be sad More laughter from the Mayors party Rimer had leaned over from the next table where he was presiding to contribute some witticism It must have been a good one This time even Jonas was laughing Susan put a hand to her bosom then took her napkin and raised it to wipe a tear of laughter from the comer of her eye Thorin covered her other hand She looked toward Roland and met his eyes still laughing He thought of Olive Thorin sitting down there at the foot of the table with the salt and spices an untouched bowl of soup before her and that unhappy smile on her face Seated where the girl could see her as well And he thought that had he been wearing his guns he might well have drawn one and put a bullet in Susan Delgados cold and whoring little heart And thought Who do you hope to fool Then one of the serving boys was there putting a plate offish in front of him Roland thought he had never felt less like eating in his life   but he would eat just the same just as he would turn his mind to the questions raised by his conversation with Hash Renfrew of the Lazy Susan Ranch He would remember the face of his father Yes Ill remember it very well he thought If only I could forget the one above yon sapphire  The dinner was interminable and there was no escape afterward The table at the center of the reception room had been removed and when l lie guests came back that way  like a tide which has surged as high as it can and now ebbs  they formed two adjacent circles at the direction of a sprightly little redhaired man whom Cuthbert later dubbed Mayor Thorins Minister of Fun The boygirl boygirl boygirl circling was accomplished with much laughter and some difficulty Roland guessed that about threequarters of lie guests were now fairly well shottered and then the guitarists struck up a quesa This proved to be a simple sort of reel The circles revolved in opposite directions all holding hands until the music stopped for a moment Then the couple created at the place where the two circles touched danced at the center of the female partners circle while everyone else clapped and cheered The lead musician managed this old and clearly wellloved tradition with a keen eye to the ridiculous stopping his muchachos in order to create the most amusing couples tall womanshort man fat womanskinny man old womanyoung man Cuthbert ended up sidekicking with a woman as old as his greatgranddame to the sais breathless cackles and the companys general roars of approval Then just when Roland was thinking this stupid dance would never end the music stopped and he found himself facing Susan Delgado For a moment he could do nothing but stare at her feeling that his eyes must burst from their sockets feeling that he could move neither of his stupid feet Then she raised her arms the music began the circle this one included Mayor Thorin and the watchful narrowly smiling Eldred Jonas applauded and he led her into the dance At first as he spun her through a figure his feet moved with all their usual grace and precision numb or not he felt like a man made of glass Then he became aware of her body touching his and the rustle of her dress and he was all too human again She moved closer for just a moment and when she spoke her breath tickled in his ear He wondered if a woman could drive you mad  literally mad He wouldnt have believed so before tonight but tonight everything had changed Thank you for your discretion and your propriety she whispered He pulled back from her a little and at the same time twirled her his hand against the small of her back  palm resting on cool satin fingers touching warm skin Her feet followed his with never a pause or stutter they moved with perfect grace unafraid of his great and booted clodstompers even in their flimsy silk slippers I can be discreet sai he said As for propriety Im amazed you even know the word She looked up into his cold face her smile fading He saw anger come in to fill it but before anger there was hurt as if he had slapped her He felt both glad and sorry at the same time Why do you speak so she whispered The music stopped before he could answer  although how he might have answered he had no idea She curtseyed and he bowed while those surrounding them clapped and whistled They went back to their places to their separate circles and the guitars began again Roland felt his hands grasped on either side and began to turn with the circle once more Laughing Kicking Clapping on the beat Feeling her somewhere behind him doing the same Wondering if she wanted as badly as he did to be out of here to be in the dark to be alone in the dark where he could put his false face aside before the real one beneath could grow hot enough to set it afire Around ten o the clock the trio of young men from the Inner Baronies made their manners to host and hostess then slipped off into the fragrant summer night Cordelia Delgado who happened to be standing near Henry Wertner the Baronys stockliner remarked that they must be tired Wertner laughed at this and replied in an accent so thick it was almost comic Nay maam byes that agere like rats explorin en woodpile after hokkut rain so they are Itll be hours yet before the bunks outta Bar K sees em Olive Thorin left the public rooms shortly after the boys pleading a headache She was pale enough to be almost believable By eleven the Mayor his Chancellor and the chief of his newly inaugurated security staff were conversing in the Mayors study with the last few latestaying guests all ranchers all members of the Horsemens Association The talk was brief but intense Several of the ranchers present expressed relief that the Affiliations emissaries were so young Eldred Jonas said nothing to this only looked down at his pale longfingered hands and smiled his narrow smile By midnight Susan was at home and undressing for bed She didnt have the sapphire to worry about at least that was a Barony jewel and had been tucked back into the strongbox at Mayors House before she left despite what Mr AintWeFine Will Dearborn might think about it and her Mayor Thorin she couldnt bring herself to call him Hart although he had asked her to do so  not even to herself could she do it had taken it back from her himself In the hallway just off from the reception room that had been by the tapestry showing Arthur Eld carrying his sword out of the pyramid in which it had been entombed And he Thorin not the Eld had taken the opportunity to kiss her mouth and have a quick fumble at her breasts  a part of her that had felt much too naked during that entire interminable evening  burn for Reaping he had whispered melodramatically in her ear His breath had been redolent of brandy Each day of this summer seems an age Now in her room brushing her hair with harsh quick strokes and looking out at the waning moon she thought she had never been so angry in her life as she was at this moment angry at Thorin angry at Aunt Cord furious with that selfrighteous prig of a Will Dearborn Most of all however she was angry at herself Theres three things ye can do in any situation girl her father had told her once Ye can decide to do a thing ye can decide not to do a thing  or ye can decide not to decide That last her da had never quite come out and said he hadnt needed to was the choice of weaklings and fools She had promised herself she would never elect it herself   and yet she had allowed herself to drift into this ugly situation Now all the choices seemed bad and honorless all the roads either filled with rocks or hubdeep in mud In her room at Mayors House she had not shared a chamber with Hart for ten years or a bed even briefly for five Olive sat in a nightdress of undecorated white cotton also looking out at the waning moon After closing herself into this safe and private place she had wept   but not for long Now she was dryeyed and felt as hollow as a dead tree And what was the worst That Hart didnt understand how humiliated she was and not just for herself He was too busy strutting and preening also too busy trying to look down the front of sai Delgados dress at every opportunity to know that people  his own Chancellor among them  were laughing at him behind his back That might stop when the girl had returned to her aunts with a big belly but that wouldnt be for months yet The witch had seen to that It would be even longer if the girl kindled slowly And what was the silliest most humiliating thing of all That she John Havertys daughter Olive still loved her husband Hart was an overweening vainglorious prancing loon of a man but she still loved him There was something else something quite apart from the matter of Harts turning into George o Goats in his late middle age she thought there was an intrigue of some sort going on something dangerous and quite likely dishonorable Hart knew a little about it but she guessed he knew only what Kimba Rimer and that hideous limping man wanted him to know There was a time and not so long ago when Hart wouldnt have allowed himself to be fobbed off in such fashion by the likes of Rimer a time when he would have taken one look at Eldred Jonas and his friends and sent them west ere they had so much as a single hot dinner in them But that was before Hart had become besotted with sai Delgados gray eyes high bosom and flat belly Olive turned down the lamp blew out the flame and crept off to bed where she would lie wakeful until dawn By one o the clock no one was left in the public rooms of Mayors House except for a quartet of cleaning women who performed their chores silently and nervously beneath the eye of Eldred Jonas When one of them looked up and saw him gone from the windowseat where he had been sitting and smoking she murmured softly to her friends and they all loosened up a little But there was no singing no laughter Ilspectra the man with the blue coffin on his hand might only have stepped hack into the shadows He might still be watching By two o the clock even the cleaning women were gone It was an hour at which a party in Gilead would just have been reaching its apogee of glitter and gossip but Gilead was far away not just in another Barony hut almost in another world This was the Outer Arc and in the Outers even gentry went to bed early There was no gentry on view at the Travellers Rest however and beneath the allencompassing gaze of The Romp the night was still fairly young  At one end of the saloon fishermen still wearing their rolleddown boots drank and played Watch Me for small stakes To their right was a poker table to their left a knot of yelling exhorting men  cowpokes mostly  stood along Satans Alley watching the dice bounce down the velvet incline At the rooms other end Sheb McCurdy was pounding out jagged boogie right hand flying left hand pumping the sweat pouring down his neck and pale cheeks Beside and above him standing drunk on a stool Pettie the Trotter shook her enormous bottom and bawled out the words to the song at the top of her voice Come on over baby we got chicken in the hum what hum whose barn my burn Come on over baby baby got the bull by the horns  Sheemie stopped beside the piano the camel bucket in one hand grinning up at her and attempting to sing along Pettie swatted him on his way never missing a word bump or grind and Sheemie went with his peculiar laugh which was shrill but somehow not unpleasant A game of darts was in progress in a booth near the back a whore who styled herself Countess Jillian of Upard Killian exiled royalty from distant Garlan my dears oh how special we are was managing to give two handjobs at the same time while smoking a pipe And at the bar a whole line of assorted toughs drifters cowpunchers drovers drivers carters wheelwrights stagies carpenters conmen stockmen boatmen and gunmen drank beneath The Romps double head The only real gunmen in the place were at the end of the bar a pair drinking by themselves No one attempted to join them and not just because they wore shooting irons in holsters that were slung low and tied down gunslinger fashion Guns were uncommon but not unknown in Mejis at that time and not necessarily feared but these two had the sullen look of men who have spent a long day doing work they didnt want to do  the look of men who would pick a fight on no account at all and be glad to end their day by sending some new widows husband home in a hurryup wagon Stanley the bartender served them whiskey after whiskey with no attempt to make conversation not so much as a Hot day gents want it They reeked of sweat and their hands were pitchy with pinegum Not enough to keep Stanley from being able to see the blue coffinshapes tattooed on them though Their friend the old limping buzzard with the girls hair and the gimp leg wasnt here at least In Stanleys view Jonas was easily the worst of the Big Coffin Hunters but these two were bad enough and he had no intention of getting aslant of them if he could help it With luck no one would they looked tired enough to call it a night early Reynolds and Depape were tired all right  they had spent the day out at Citgo camouflaging a line of empty steel tankers with nonsense words texaco citgo sunoco exxon printed on their sides a billion pineboughs theyd hauled and stacked it seemed  but they had no consequent plans to finish their drinking early Depape might have done so if Her Nibs had been available but that young beauty actual name Gert Moggins had a ranchjob and wouldnt be back until two nights hence And itll be a week if theres hard cash on offer Depape said morosely He pushed his spectacles up on his nose Fuck her Reynolds said Thats just what Id do if I could but I cant Im going to get me a plate of that free lunch Reynolds said pointing down to the other end of the bar where a tin bucket of steamed clams had just come out of the kitchen You want some Them look like hocks of snot and go down the same way Bring me a strip of beef jerky All right partner Reynolds went off down the bar People gave him wide passage gave even his silklined cloak wide passage Depape more morose than ever now that he had thought of Her Nibs gobbling cowboy spareribs out there at the Piano Ranch downed his drink winced at the stench of pinegum on his hand then held his glass out in Stanley Ruizs direction Fill this up you dog he shouted A cowhand leaning with his back butt and elbows against the bar jerked forward at the sound of Depapes bellow and that was all it took to start trouble Sheemie was bustling toward the pass through from which the steamers had just appeared now holding the camel bucket out before him in both hands Later when the Travellers began to empty out his job would he to clean up For now however it was simply to circulate with the camel bucket dumping in every unfinished drink he found This combined elixir ended up in a jug behind the bar The jug was labelled fairly enough  camel piss  and a double shot could be obtained for three pennies It was a drink only for the reckless or the impecunious but a fair number of both passed beneath the stem gaze of The Romp each night Stanley rarely had a problem emptying the jug And if it wasnt empty at the end of the night why there was always a fresh night coming along Not to mention a fresh supply of thirsty fools But on this occasion Sheemie never made it to the Camel Piss jug behind the end of the bar He tripped over the boot of the cowboy who had jerked forward and went to his knees with a grunt of surprise The contents of the bucket sloshed out ahead of him and following Satans First Law of Malignity  to wit if the worst can happen it usually will  they drenched Roy Depape from the knees down in an eye watering mixture of beer graf and white lightning Conversation at the bar stopped and that stopped the talk of the men gathered around the dicechute Sheb turned saw Sheemie kneeling before one of Jonass men and stopped playing Pettie her eyes squeezed shut as she poured her entire soul into her singing continued on a capella for three or four bars before registering the silence which was spreading out like a ripple She stopped singing and opened her eyes That sort of silence usually meant that someone was going to be killed If so she didnt intend to miss it Depape stood perfectly still inhaling the raw stench of alcohol as it rose He didnt mind the smell on the whole it had the stink of pinegum beat six ways to the Peddler He didnt mind the way his pants were sticking to his knees either It might have been a bit of an irritation if some of that joyjuice had gotten down inside his boots but none had His hand fell to the butt of his gun Here by god and by goddess was something to take his mind off his sticky hands and absent whore And good entertainment was ever worth a little wetting Silence blanketed the place now Stanley stood as stiff as a soldier behind the bar nervously plucking at one of his armgarters At the bars other end Reynolds looked back toward his partner with bright interest He took a clam from the steaming bucket and cracked it on the edge of the bar like a boiled egg At Depapes feet Sheemie looked up his eyes big and fearful beneath the wild snarl of his black hair He was trying his best to smile Well now boy Depape said You have wet me considerable Sorry big fella I go trippytrip Sheemie jerked a hand back over his shoulder a little spray of camel piss flew from the tips of his fingers Somewhere someone cleared his throat nervously  raaaach The room was full of eyes and quiet enough so that they all could hear both the wind in the eaves and the waves breaking on the rocks of Hambry Point two miles away The hell you did said the cowpoke who had jerked He was about twenty and suddenly afraid he might never see his mother again Dont you go tryin to put your trouble off on me you damned feeb I dont care how it happened Depape said He was aware he was playing for an audience and knew that what an audience mostly wants is to be entertained Sai R B Depape always a trouper intended to oblige He pinched the corduroy of his pants above the knees and pulled the legs up revealing the toes of his boots They were shiny and wet See there Look at what you got on my boots Sheemie looked up at him grinning and terrified Stanley Ruiz decided he couldnt let this happen without at least trying to stop it He had known Dolores Sheemer the boys mother there was even a possibility that he himself was the boys father In any case he liked Sheemie The boy was foolish but his heart was good he never took a drink and he always did his work Also he could find a smile for you even on the coldest foggiest winters day That was a talent many people of normal intelligence did not have Sai Depape he said taking a step forward and speaking in a low respectful tone Im very sorry about that Ill be happy to buy your drinks for the rest of the evening if we can just forget this regrettable   Depapes movement was a blur almost too fast to see but that wasnt what amazed the people who were in the Rest that night they would have expected a man running with Jonas to be fast What amazed them was the fact that he never looked around to set his target He located Stanley by his voice alone Depape drew his gun and swept it to the right in a rising arc It struck Stanley Ruiz dead in the mouth mashing his lips and shattering three of his teeth Blood splashed the backbar mirror several highflying drops decorated the tip of The Romps lefthand nose Stanley screamed clapped his hands to his face and staggered back against the shelf behind him In the silence the chattery clink of the bottles was very loud Down the bar Reynolds cracked another clam and watched fascinated Good as a play it was Depape turned his attention back to the kneeling boy Clean my boots he said A look of muddled relief came onto Sheemies face Clean his boots Yes You bet Right away He pulled the rag he always kept in his back pocket It wasnt even dirty yet Not very at least No Depape said patiently Sheemie looked up at him gaping and puzzled Put that nasty clout back where it come from  I dont even want to look at it Sheemie tucked it into his back pocket again Lick em Depape said in that same patient voice Thats what I want You lick my boots until theyre dry again and so clean you can see your stupid rabbits face in em Sheemie hesitated as if still not sure what was required of him Or perhaps he was only processing the information Id do it boy Barkie Callahan said from what he hoped was a safe place behind Shebs piano If you want to see the sun come up Id surely do it Depape had already decided the mushbrain wasnt going to see another sunrise not in this world but kept quiet He had never had his boots licked He wanted to see what it felt like If it was nice  kind of sexylike  he could maybe try Her Nibs out on it Does I have to Sheemies eyes were filling with tears Cant just Isorry and polish em real good Lick you feebleminded donkey Depape said Sheemies hair fell across his forehead His tongue poked tentatively out between his lips and as he bent his head toward Depapes boots the first of his tears fell Stop it stop it stop it a voice said It was shocking in the silence  not because it was sudden and certainly not because it was angry It was shocking because it was amused I simply cant allow that Nope I would if I could but I cant Unsanitary you see Who knows what disease might be spread in such fashion The mind quails Absolutely cuhwails Standing just inside the batwing doors was the purveyor of this idiotic and potentially fatal screed a young man of middling height his flatcrowned hat pushed back to reveal a tumbled comma of brown hair Except young man didnt really cover him Depape realized young man was drawing it heavy He was only a kid Around his neck gods knew why he wore a birds skull like an enormous comical pendant It was hung on a chain that ran through the eyeholes And in his hands was not a gun where would an unwhiskered dribble like him get a gun in the first place Depape wondered but a goddam slingshot Depape burst out laughing The kid laughed as well nodding as if he understood how ridiculous the whole thing looked how ridiculous the whole thing was His laughter was infectious Pettie still up on her stool tittered herself before clapping her hands over her mouth This is no place for a boy such as you Depape said His revolver an old fiveshooter was still out it lay in his fist on the bar with Stanley Ruizs blood dripping off the gunsight Depape without raising it from the ironwood waggled it slightly Boys who come to places like this learn had habits kid Dying is apt to be one of them So I give you this one chance Get out of here Thank you sir  appreciate my one chance the boy said He spoke with great and winning sincerity    but didnt move Still he stood just inside the batwing doors with the wide elastic strap of his sling pulled hack Depape couldnt quite make out what was in the cup but it glittered in the gaslight A metal ball of some sort Well then Depape snarled This was getting old and fast I know Im being a pain in the neck sir  not to mention an ache in he ass and a milky drip from the tip of a sore dick  but if its all the same to you my dear friend Id like to give my chance to the young fellow on his knees before you Let him apologize let him polish your boots with his clout until you are entirely satisfied and let him go on living his life There was an unfocused murmur of approval at this from the area where the cardplayers were watching Depape didnt like the sound of it at all and he made a sudden decision The boy would die as well executed for the crime of impertinence The swabby who had spilled the bucket of dregs on him was clearly retarded Yon brat had not even that excuse He just thought he was funny From the comer of his eye Depape saw Reynolds moving to flank the boy smooth as oiled silk Depape appreciated the thought but didnt believe hed need much help with the slingshot specialist Boy I think youve made a mistake he said in a kindly voice I really believe   The cup of the slingshot dipped a little  or Depape fancied it did He made his move  They talked about it in Hambry for years to come three decades after the fall of Gilead and the end of the Affiliation they were still talking By that time there were better than five hundred old gaffers and a few old gammers claiming that they were drinking a beer in the Rest that night and saw it all Depape was young and had the speed of a snake Nevertheless he never came close to getting a shot off at Cuthbert Allgood There was a thipTWANG as the elastic was released a steel gleam that drew itself across the saloons smoky air like a line on a slateboard and then Depape screamed His revolver tumbled to the floor and a foot spun it away from him across the sawdust no one would claim that foot while the Big Coffin Hunters were still in Hambry hundreds claimed it after they were gone Still screaming  he could not bear pain  Depape raised his bleeding hand and looked at it with agonized unbelieving eyes Actually he had been lucky Cuthberts ball had smashed the tip of the second finger and torn off the nail Lower and Depape would have been able to blow smokerings through his own palm Cuthbert meanwhile had already reloaded the cup of his slingshot and drawn the elastic back again Now he said if I have your attention good sir   I cant speak for his Reynolds said from behind him but you got mine partner I dont know if youre good with that thing or just shitass lucky but either way youre done with it now Relax the draw on it and put it down That table in front of yous the place I want to see it Ive been blindsided Cuthbert said sadly Betrayed once more by my own callow youth I dont know nothing about your callow youth brother but youve been blindsided all right Reynolds agreed He stood behind and slightly to the left of Cuthbert and now he moved his gun forward until the boy could feel the muzzle against the back of his head Reynolds thumbed the hammer In the pool of silence which the Travellers Rest had become the sound was very loud Now put that twanger down I think good sir that I must offer my regrets and decline What You see Ive got my trusty sling aimed at your pleasant friends head   Cuthbert began and when Depape shifted uneasily against the bar Cuthberts voice rose in a whipcrack that did not sound callow in the least Stand still Move again and you re a dead man Depape subsided holding his bloody hand against his pinetacky shirt For the first time he looked frightened and for the first time that night  for the first time since hooking up with Jonas in fact  Reynolds felt mastery of a situation on the verge of slipping away  except how could it be How could it be when hed been able to circle around this smarttalking squint and get the drop on him This should be over Lowering his voice to its former conversational  not to say playful  pitch Cuthbert said If you shoot me the ball flies and your friend dies too I dont believe that Reynolds said but he didnt like what he heard in his own voice It sounded like doubt No man could make a shot like that Why dont we let your friend decide Cuthbert raised his voice in a goodhumored hail Hiho there Mr Spectacles Would you like your pal to shoot me No Depapes cry was shrill verging on panic No Clay Dont shoot So its a standoff Reynolds said bemused And then bemusement changed to horror as he felt the blade of a very large knife slip against his throat It pressed the tender skin just over his adams apple No its not Alain said softly Put the gun down my friend or Ill cut your throat  Standing outside the batwing doors having arrived by simple good fortune in time for this Pinch and Jilly show Jonas watched with amazement contempt and something close to horror First one of the Affiliation brats gets the drop on Depape and when Reynolds covers that one the big kid with the round face and the plowboys shoulders puts a knife to Reynoldss throat Neither of the brats a day over fifteen and neither with a gun Marvelous He would have thought it better than a travelling circus if not for the problems that would follow if this were not put right What sort of work could they do in Hambry if it got around that the boogeymen were afraid of the children instead of viceversa Theres time to stop this before theres killing mayhap If you wantto Do you Jonas decided he did that they could walk out winners if they played it just right He also decided the Affiliation brats would not unless they were very lucky indeed be leaving Mejis Barony alive Wheres the other one Dearborn A good question An important question Embarrassment would become outright humiliation if he found himself trumped in the same fashion as Roy and Clay Dearborn wasnt in the bar and that was sure Jonas turned on his heels scanning the South High Street in both directions It was almost daybright under a Kissing Moon only two nights past the full No one there not in the street not on the far side where Hambrys mercantile store stood The mercantile had a porch but there was nothing on it save for a line of carved totems illustrating Guardians of the Beam Bear Turtle Fish Eagle Lion Bat and Wolf Seven of twelve bright as marble in the moonlight and no doubt great favorites of the kiddies No men over there though Good Lovely Jonas peered hard into the thread of alley between the mercantile and the butchers glimpsed a shadow behind a tumble of castoff boxes tensed then relaxed as he saw a cats shining green eyes He nodded and turned to the business at hand pushing back the lefthand batwing and stepping into the Travellers Rest Alain heard the squeak of a hinge but Jonass gun was at his temple before he could even begin to turn Sonny unless youre a barber I think youd better put that pigsticker down You dont get a second warning No Alain said Jonas who had expected nothing but compliance and had been prepared for nothing else was thunderstruck What  You heard me Alain said I said no  After making their manners and excusing themselves from Seafront Roland had left his friends to their own amusements  they would finish up at the Travellers Rest he supposed but wouldnt stay long or get into much trouble when they had no money for cards and could drink nothing more exciting than cold tea He had ridden into town another way tethered his mount at a public post in the lower of the two town squares Rusher had offered a single puzzled nicker at this treatment but no more and had since been tramping the empty sleeping streets with his hat yanked low over his eyes and his hands clasped into an aching knot at the small of his back His mind was full of questions  things were wrong here very wrong At first hed thought that was just his imagination the childish part of him finding makebelieve troubles and storybook intrigue because he had been removed from the heart of the real action But after his talk with Rennie Renfrew he knew better There were questions outright mysteries and the most hellish thing of all was that he couldnt concentrate on them let alone go any distance toward making sense of them Every time he tried Susan Delgados face intruded  her face or the sweep of her hair or even the pretty fearless way her silkslippered feet had followed his boots in the dance never lagging or hesitating Again and again he heard the last thing he had said to her speaking in the stilted priggish voice of a boy preacher He would have given almost anything to take back both the tone and the words themselves Shed be on Thorins pillow come Reaptide and kindle him a child before the first snow flew perhaps a male heir and what of it Rich men famous men and wellblooded men had taken gillygirls since the beginning of time Arthur Eld had had better than forty himself according to the tales So really what was it to him I think Ive gone and fallen in love with her Thats what it is to me A dismaying idea but not a dismissible one he knew the landscape of his own heart too well He loved her very likely it was so but part of him also hated her and held to the shocking thought hed had at dinner that he could have shot Susan Delgado through the heart if hed come armed Some of this was jealousy but not all perhaps not even the greater part He had made some indefinable but powerful connection between Olive Thorin  her sad but game little smile from the foot of the table  and his own mother Hadnt some of that same woeful rueful look been in his mothers eyes on the day when he had come upon her and his fathers advisor Marten in an openthroated shirt Gabrielle Deschain in a sacque that had slipped off one shoulder the whole room reeking of what they had been up to that hot morning His mind tough as it already was shrank from the image horrified It returned instead to that of Susan Delgado  her gray eyes and shining hair He saw her laughing chin uptilted hands clasped before the sapphire Thorin had given her Roland could forgive her the gilly business he supposed What he could not forgive in spite of his attraction to Susan was that awful smile on Olive Thorins face as she watched the girl sitting in what should have been her place Sitting in her place and laughing These were the things that chased through his head as he paced off acres of moonlight He had no business with such thoughts Susan Delgado was not the reason he was here nor was the ridiculous knucklecracking Mayor and his pitiable countryMary of a wife    yet he couldnt put them away and get to what was his business He had forgotten the face of his father and walked in the moonlight hoping to find it again In such fashion he came along the sleeping silvergilded High Street walking north to south thinking vaguely that he would perhaps stand Cuthbert and Alain to a taste of something wet and toss the dice down Satans Alley a time or two before going back to get Rusher and call it a night And so it was that he happened to spy Jonas  the mans gaunt figure and fall of long white hair were impossible to mistake  standing outside the batwings of the Travellers Rest and peering in Jonas did this with one hand on the butt of his gun and a tense set of body that put everything else from Rolands mind at once Something was going on and if Bert and Alain were in there it might involve them They were the strangers in town after all and it was possible  even likely  that not everyone in Hambry loved the Affiliation with the fervor that had been professed at tonights dinner Or perhaps it was Jonass friends who were in trouble Something was brewing in any case With no clear thought as to why he was doing it Roland went softly up the steps to the mercantiles porch There was a line of carved animals there and probably spiked firmly to the boards so that drunken wags from the saloon across the street couldnt carry them away chanting the nursery rhymes of their childhood as they went Roland stepped behind the last one in line  it was the Bear  and bent his knees so that the crown of his hat wouldnt show Then he went as still as the carving He could see Jonas turn look across the street then look to his left peering at something  Very low a sound Waow Waow Its a cat In the alley Jonas looked a moment longer then stepped into the Rest Roland was out from behind the carved bear down the steps and into the street at once He hadnt Alains gift of the touch but he had intuitions that were sometimes very strong This one was telling him he must hurry Overhead the Kissing Moon drifted behind a cloud  Pettie the Trotter still stood on her stool but she no longer felt drunk and singing was the last thing on her mind She could hardly believe what she was seeing Jonas had the drop on a boy who had the drop on Reynolds who had the drop on another boy this last one wearing a birds skull around his neck on a chain who had the drop on Roy Depape Who had in fact drawn some of Roy Depapes blood And when Jonas had told the big boy to put down the knife he was holding to Reynoldss throat the big boy had refused You can blow my lights out and send me to the clearing at the end of the path thought Pettie for now Ive seen it all so I have She supposed she should get off the stool  there was apt to be shooting any second now and likely a great lot of it  but sometimes you just had to take your chances Because some things were just too good to miss  Were in this town on Affiliation business Alain said He had one hand buried deep in Reynoldss sweaty hair the other maintained a steady pressure on the knife at Reynoldss throat Not quite enough to break the skin If you harm us the Affiliation will take note So will our fathers Youll be hunted like dogs and hung upside down like as not when youre caught Sonny theres not an Affiliation patrol within two hundred wheels of here probably three hundred Jonas said and I wouldnt care a fart in a windstorm if there was one just over yon hill Nor do your fathers mean a squitter to me Put that knife down or Ill blow your fucking brains out No Future developments in this matter should be quite wonderful Cuthbert said cheerily    although there was now a beat of nerves under his prattle Not fear perhaps not even nervousness just nerves The good kind more likely than not Jonas thought sourly He had underestimated these boys at meat if nothing else was clear that was You shoot Richard and Richard cuts Mr Cloaks throat just as Mr Cloak shoots me my poor dying fingers release my slings elastic and put a steel ball in what passes for Mr Spectacless brain Youll walk away at least and I suppose that will be a great comfort to your dead friends Call it a draw Alain said to the man with the gun at his temple We all stand back and walk away No sonny Jonas said His voice was patient and he didnt think his anger showed but it was rising Gods to be outfaced like this even temporarily No one does like that to the Big Coffin Hunters This is your last chance to   Something hard and cold and very much to the point pressed against the back of Jonass shirt dead center between the shoulderblades He knew what it was and who held it at once understood the game was lost but couldnt understand how such a ludicrous maddening turn of events could have happened Holster the gun the voice behind the sharp tip of metal said It was empty somehow  not just calm but emotionless Do it now or this goes in your heart No more talk Talkings done Do it or die Jonas heard two things in that voice youth and truth He bolstered his gun You with the black hair Take your gun out of my friends ear and put it back in your holster Now Clay Reynolds didnt have to be invited twice and he uttered a long shaky sigh when Alain took the blade off his throat and stood back Cuthbert did not look around only stood with the elastic of his slingshot pulled and his elbow cocked You at the bar Roland said Holster up Depape did so grimacing with pain as he bumped his hurt finger against his gunbelt Only when this gun was put away did Cuthbert relax his hold on his sling and drop the ball from the cup into the palm of his hand The cause of all this had been forgotten as the effects played themselves out Now Sheemie got to his feet and pelted across the room His cheeks were wet with tears He grasped one of Cuthberts hands kissed it several times loud smacking noises that would have been comic under other circumstances and held the hand to his cheek for a moment Then he dodged past Reynolds pushed open the righthand batwing and flew right into the arms of a sleepyeyed and still halfdrunk Sheriff Avery had been fetched by Sheb from the jailhouse where the Sheriff o Barony had been sleeping off the Mayors ceremonial dinner in one of his own cells  This is a nice mess isnt it Avery speaking No one answering He hadnt expected they would not if they knew what was good for them The office area of the jail was too small to hold three men three strapping notquitemen and one extralarge Sheriff comfortably so Avery had herded them into the nearby Town Gathering Hall which echoed to the soft flutter of the pigeons in the rafters and the steady beatbeatbeat of the grandfather clock behind the podium It was a plain room but an inspired choice all the same It was where the townsfolk and Barony landowners had come for hundreds of years to make their decisions pass their laws and occasionally send some especially troublesome person west There was a feeling of seriousness in its moonglimmered darkness and Roland thought even the old man Jonas felt a little of it Certainly it invested Sheriff Herk Avery with an authority he might not otherwise have been able to project The room was filled with what were in that place and time called bareback benches  oaken pews with no cushions for either butt or back There were sixty in all thirty on each side of a wide center aisle Jonas Depape and Reynolds sat on the front bench to the left of the aisle Roland Cuthbert and Alain sat across from them on the right Reynolds and Depape looked sullen and embarrassed Jonas looked remote and composed Will Dearborns little crew was quiet Roland had given Cuthbert a look which he hoped the boy could read One smart remark and Ill rip the tongue right out of your head He thought the message had been received Bert had stowed his idiotic lookout somewhere which was a good sign A nice mess Avery repeated and blew liquorscented wind at them in a deep sigh He was sitting on the edge of the stage with his short legs hanging down looking at them with a kind of disgusted wonder The side door opened and in came Deputy Dave his white service jacket laid aside his monocle tucked into the pocket of his more usual khaki shirt In one hand he carried a mug in the other a folded scrap of what looked to Roland like birchbark Did ye boil the first half David Avery asked He now wore a putupon expression Aye Boiled it twice Ayetwice For that was the directions Aye Dave repeated in a resigned voice He handed Avery the cup and dumped the remaining contents of the birchbark scrap in when the Sheriff held the cup out for them Avery swirled the liquid peered in with a doubtful resigned expression then drank He grimaced Oh foul he cried Whats so nasty as this What is it Jonas asked Headache powder Hangover powder ye might say From the old witch The one who lives up the Coos Know where I mean Avery gave Jonas a knowing look The old gunny pretended not to see it but Roland thought he had And what did it mean Another mystery Depape looked up at the word Coos then went back to sucking his wounded finger Beyond Depape Reynolds sat with his cloak drawn about him looking grimly down at his lap Does it work Roland asked Aye boy but ye pay a price for witchs medicine Remember that ye always pay This un takes away the headache if ye drink too much of Mayor Thorins damned punch but it gripes the bowels somethin fierce so it does And the farts   He waved a hand in front of his face to demonstrate took another sip from the cup then set it aside He returned to his former gravity but the mood in the room had lightened just a little they all felt it Now what are we to do about this business Herk Avery swept them slowly with his eyes from Reynolds on his far right to Alain  Richard Stockworth  on his far left Eh boys Weve got the Mayors men on one side and the Affiliations    men  on the other six fellows at the point of murder and over what A halfwit and a spilled bucket of slops He pointed first at the Big Coffin Hunters then to the Affiliations counters Two powderkegs and one fat sheriff in the middle So whats yer thoughts ont Speak up dont be shy you wasnt shy in Corals whoreden down the road dont be shy in here No one said anything Avery sipped some more of his foul drink then set it down and looked at them decisively What he said next didnt surprise Roland much it was exactly what he would have expected of a man like Avery right down to the tone which implied that he considered himself a man who could make the hard decisions when he had to by the gods Ill tell yer what were going to do Were going to forget it He now assumed the air of one who expects an uproar and is prepared to handle it When no one spoke or even shuffled a foot he looked discomfited Yet he had a job to do and the night was growing old He squared his shoulders and pushed on Ill not spend the next three or four months waiting to see who among yous killed who Nay Nor will I be put in a position where I might have to take the punishment for your stupid quarrel over that halfwit Sheemie I appeal to your practical natures boys when I point out that I may he either your friend or your enemy during your time here    but Id be wrong if  didnt also appeal to your more noble natures which I am sure are both large and sensitive The Sheriff now tried on an exalted expression which was not in Rolands estimation notably successful Avery turned his attention to Jonas Sai I cant believe yell want to be causin trouble for three young men from the Affiliation  the Affiliation thats been like mothers milk and fathers shelterin hand since aye or oh fifty generations back yed not be so disrespectful as all that would ye Jonas shook his head smiling his thin smile Avery nodded again Things were going along well that nod said Yeve all yer own cakes to bake and oats to roll and none of ye wants something like this to get in the way of doin yer jobs do yer They all shook their heads this time So what I want you to do is to stand up face each other shake hands and cry each others pardon If ye dont do that ye can all ride west out of town by sunrise far as Im concerned He picked up the mug and took a bigger drink this time Roland saw that the mans hand was trembling the tiniest bit and wasnt surprised It was all bluff and blow of course The Sheriff would have understood that Jonas Reynolds and Depape were beyond his authority as soon as he saw the small blue coffins on their hands after tonight he must feel the same way about Dearborn Stockworth and Heath He could only hope that all would see where their selfinterest lay Roland did So apparently did Jonas for even as Roland got up Jonas did the same Avery recoiled a little bit as if expecting Jonas to go for his gun and Dearborn for the knife in his belt the one hed been holding against Jonass back when Avery came puffing up to the saloon There was no gun or knife drawn however Jonas turned toward Roland and held out his hand Hes right lad Jonas said in his reedy quavering voice Yes Will you shake with an old man and vow to start over Yes Roland held out his hand Jonas took it I cry your pardon I cry your own Mr Jonas Roland tapped lefthand at his throat as was proper when addressing an elder in such fashion As the two of them sat down Alain and Reynolds rose as neatly as men in a prerehearsed ceremony Last of all Cuthbert and Depape rose Roland was all but positive that Cuthberts foolishness would pop out like Jack from his box  the idiot would simply not be able to help himself although he must surely realize that Depape was no man to make sport of tonight Cry your pardon Bert said with an admirable lack of laughter in his voice Cryerown Depape mumbled and held out his bloodstreaked hand Roland had a nightmare vision of Bert squeezing down on it as hard as he could making the redhead yowl like an owl on a hot stove but Berts grip was as restrained as his voice Avery sat on the edge of the stage with his pudgy legs hanging down watching it all with avuncular good cheer Even Deputy Dave was smiling Now I propose to shake hands with yer all myself n then send yer on yer ways for the hours late so it is and such as me needs my beauty rest He chuckled and again looked uncomfortable when no one joined in But he slipped off the stage and began to shake hands doing so with the enthusiasm of a minister who has finally succeeded in marrying a headstrong couple after a long and stormy courtship  When they stepped outside the moon was down and the first lightening in the sky had begun to show at the far edge of the Clean Sea Mayhap well meet again sai Jonas said Mayhap we will Roland said and swung up into his saddle  The Big Coffin Hunters were staying in the watchmans house about a mile south of Seafront  five miles out of town this was Halfway there Jonas stopped at a turnout beside the road From here the land made a steep rocky descent to the brightening sea Get down mister he said It was Depape he was looking at JonasJonas I Get down Biting his lip nervously Depape got down Take off your spectacles Jonas whats this about I dont   Or if you want em broke leave em on Its all the same to me Biting his lip harder now Depape took off his goldrimmed spectacles They were barely in his hand before Jonas had fetched him a terrific clip on the side of the head Depape cried out and reeled toward the drop Jonas drove forward moving as fast as he had struck and seized him by the shirt just before he went tumbling over the edge Jonas twisted his hand into the shirt material and yanked Depape toward him He breathed deep inhaling the scent of pinetar and Depapes sweat I ought to toss you right over the edge he breathed Do you know how much harm youve done I Jonas I never meant just a little fun is all I how was we supposed to know they  Slowly Jonass hand relaxed That last bit of babble had gone home How was they supposed to know that was ungrammatical but right And if not for tonight they might not have known If you looked at it that way Depape had actually done them a favor The devil you knew was always preferable to the devil you didnt Still word would get around and people would laugh Maybe even that was all right though The laughter would stop in due time Jonas I cry your pardon Shut up Jonas said In the east the sun would shortly heave itself over the horizon casting its first gleams on a new day in this world of toil and sorrow I aint going to toss you over because then Id have to toss Clay over and follow along myself They got the drop on us the same as you right Depape wanted to agree but thought it might be dangerous to do so He was prudently silent Get down here Clay Clay slid off his mount Now hunker The three of them hunkered on their bootsoles heels up Jonas plucked a shoot of grass and put it between his lips Affiliation brats is what we were told and we had no reason not to believe it he said The bad boys are sent all the way to Mejis a sleepy Barony on the Clean Sea on a makework detail thats two pans penance and three parts punishment Aint that what we were told They nodded Either of you believe it after tonight Depape shook his head So did Clay They may be rich boys but thats not all they are Depape said The way they were tonight    they were like    He trailed off not quite willing to finish the thought It was too absurd Jonas was willing They acted like gunslingers Neither Jonas nor Reynolds replied at first Then Clay Reynolds said Theyre too young Eldred Too young by years Not too young to be prentices mayhap In any case were going to find out He turned to Depape Youve got some riding to do cully Aww Jonas   None of us exactly covered ourselves with glory but you were the fool that started the pot boiling He looked at Depape but Depape only looked down at the ground between them Youre going to ride their backtrail Roy and youre going to ask questions until youve got the answers you think will satisfy my curiosity Clay and I are mostly going to wait And watch Play Castles with em if you like When I feel like enough times gone by for us to be able to do a little snooping without being trigged mayhap well do it He bit on the piece of grass in his mouth The larger piece tumbled out and lay between his boots Do you know why I shook his hand That boy Dearborns damned hand Because we cant rock the boat boys Not just when its edging in toward harbor Latigo and the folks weve been waiting for will be moving toward us very soon now Until they get into these parts its in our interest to keep the peace But I tell you this no one puts a knife to Eldred Jonass back and lives Now listen Roy Dont make me tell you any of this twice Jonas began to speak leaning forward over his knees toward Depape as he did After awhile Depape began to nod He might like a little trip actually After the recent comedy in the Travellers Rest a change of air might be just the ticket  The boys were almost back to the Bar K and the sun was coming over the horizon before Cuthbert broke the silence Well That was an amusing and instructive evening was it not Neither Roland nor Alain replied so Cuthbert leaned over to the rooks skull which he had returned to its former place on the horn of his saddle What say you old friend Did we enjoy our evening Dinner a circledance and almost killed to top things off Did you enjoy The lookout only stared ahead of Cuthberts horse with its great dark eyes He says hes too tired for talk Cuthbert said then yawned Som I actually He looked at Roland I got a good look into Mr Jonass eyes after he shook hands with you Will He means to kill you Roland nodded They mean to kill all of us Alain said Roland nodded again Well make it hard for them but they know more about us now than they did at dinner Well not get behind them that way again He stopped just as Jonas had stopped not three miles from where they now were Only instead of looking directly out over the Clean Sea Roland and his friends were looking down the long slope of the Drop A herd of horses was moving from west to east barely more than shadows in this light What do you see Roland Alain asked almost timidly Trouble Roland said and in our road Then he gigged his horse and rode on Before they got back to the Bar K bunkhouse he was thinking about Susan again Five minutes after he dropped his head on his flat burlap pillow he was dreaming of her Three weeks had passed since the welcoming dinner at Mayors House and the incident at the Travellers Rest There had been no more trouble between Rolands katet and Jonass In the night sky Kissing Moon had waned and Peddlers Moon had made its first thin appearance The days were bright and warm even the oldtimers admitted it was one of the most beautiful summers in memory On a midmorning as beautiful as any that summer Susan Delgado galloped a twoyearold rosillo named Pylon north along the Drop The wind dried the tears on her cheeks and yanked her unbound hair out behind her as she went She urged Pylon to go faster yet lightly thumping his sides with her spurless boots Pylon turned it up a notch at once ears flattening tail flagging Susan dressed in jeans and the faded oversized khaki shirt one of her das that had caused all the trouble leaned over the light practice saddle holding to the horn with one hand and rubbing the other down the side of the horses strong silky neck More she whispered More and faster Go on boy Pylon let it out yet another notch That he had at least one more in him she knew that he had even one more beyond that she suspected They sped along the Drops highest ridge and she barely saw the magnificent slope of land below her all green and gold or the way it faded into the blue haze of the Clean Sea On any other day the view and the cool saltsmelling breeze would have uplifted her Today she only wanted to hear the steady low thunder of Pylons hoofs and feel the flex of his muscles beneath her today she wanted to outrun her own thoughts And all because she had come downstairs this morning dressed for riding in one of her fathers old shirts  Aunt Cord had been at the stove wrapped in her dressing gown and with her hair still netted She dished herself up a bowl of oatmeal and brought it to the table Susan had known things werent good as soon as her aunt I timed toward her bowl in hand she could see the discontented twitch of Aunt Cords lips and the disapproving glance she shot at the orange Susan was peeling Her aunt was still rankled by the silver and gold she had expected to have in hand by now coins which would be withheld yet awhile due to the witchs prankish decree that Susan should remain a virgin until autumn But that wasnt the main thing and Susan knew it Quite simply put the two of them had had enough of each other The money was only one of Aunt Cords disappointed expectations she had counted on having the house at the edge of the Drop to herself this summer    except perhaps or the occasional visit from Mr Eldred Jonas with whom Cordelia seemed quite taken Instead here they still were one woman growing toward the end of her courses thin disapproving lips in a thin disapproving face tiny applebreasts under her highnecked dresses with their choker collars The Neck she frequently told Susan is the First Thing to Go her hair losing its former chestnut shine and showing wirethreads of gray the other young intelligent agile and rounding toward the peak of her physical beauty They grated against each other each word seeming to produce a spark and that was not surprising The man who had loved them both enough to make them love each other was gone Are ye going out on that horse Aunt Cord had said putting her bowl down and sitting in a shaft of early sun It was a bad location one she never would have allowed herself to be caught in had Mr Jonas been in attendance The strong light made her face look like a carved mask There was a coldsore growing at one corner other mouth she always got them when she was not sleeping well Ayesusan said Ye should eat moren that then Twont keep ye til nine o the clock girl Itll keep me fine Susan had replied eating the sections of orange faster She could see where this was tending could see the look of dislike and disapproval in her aunts eyes and wanted to get away from the table before trouble could begin Why not let me get ye a dish of this Aunt Cord asked and plopped her spoon into her oatmeal To Susan it sounded like a horses hoof stamping down in mud  or shit  and her stomach clenched Itll hold ye to lunch if ye plan to ride so long I suppose a fine young lady such as yerself cant be bothered with chores   Theyre done And you know they re done she did not add Idid em while you were sitting before your glass poking at that sore on your mouth Aunt Cord dropped a chunk of creamery butter into her muck  Susan had no idea how the woman stayed so thin really she didnt  and watched it begin to melt For a moment it seemed that breakfast might end on a reasonably civilized note after all Then the shirt business had begun Before ye go out Susan I want ye to take off that rag youre wearing and put on one of the new riding blouses Thorin sent ye week before last Its the least ye can do to show yer   Anything her aunt might have said past that point would have been lost in anger even if Susan hadnt interrupted She passed a hand down the sleeve of her shirt loving its texture  it was almost velvety from so many washings This rag belonged to my father Aye Pats Aunt Cord sniffed Its too big for ye and worn out and not proper in any case When you were young it was mayhap all right to wear a mans buttonshirt but now that ye have a womans bustline  The riding blouses were on hangers in the comer they had come four days ago and Susan hadnt even deigned to take them up to her room There were three of them one red one green one blue all silk all undoubtedly worth a small fortune She loathed their pretension and the overblown blushyfrilly look of them full sleeves to flutter artistically in the wind great floppy foolish collars    and of course the lowscooped fronts which were probably all Thorin would see if she appeared before him dressed in one As she wouldnt if she could possibly help it My womans bustline as you call it is of no interest to me and cant possibly be of any interest to anyone else when Im out riding Susan said Perhaps perhaps not If one of the Baronys drovers should see you  even Rennie hes out that way all the time as ye well know  it wouldnt hurt for him to mention to Hart that he saw yer wearing one of the camisas that he so kindly gave to ye Now would it Why do ye have lo he such a stiffkins girl Why always so unwilling so unfair What does it matter to ye one way or tother Susan had asked Ye have the money dont ye And yell have more yet After he fucks me Aunt Cord her face white and shocked and furious had leaned across the table and slapped her How dare thee use that word in my house ye malhablada How dare ye That was when her tears began to flow  at hearing her call it her houseit was my fathers house His and mine Ye were all on yer own with no real place to go except perhaps to the Quarters and he took ye in He took ye in Aunt The last two orange sections were still in her hand She threw them into her aunts face then pushed herself back from the table so violently that her chair tottered tipped and spilled her to the floor Her aunts shadow fell over her Susan crawled frantically out of it her hair hanging her slapped cheek throbbing her eyes burning with tears her throat swelled and hot At last she found her feet Ye ungrateful girl her aunt said Her voice was soft and so full of venom it was almost caressing After all I have done for thee and all Hart Thorin has done for thee Why the very nag ye mean to ride this morning was Harts gift of respect to   PYLON WAS OURS she shrieked almost maddened with fury at this deliberate blurring of the truth ALL OF THEM WERE THE HORSES THE LAND  THEY WERE OURS  Lower thy voice Aunt Cord said Susan took a deep breath and tried to find some control She swept her hair back from her face revealing the red print of Aunt Cords hand on her cheek Cordelia flinched a little at the sight of it My father never would have allowed this Susan said He never would have allowed me to go as Hart Thorins gilly Whatever he might have felt about Hart as the Mayor  or as his patrono  he never would have allowed this And ye know it Thee knows it Aunt Cord rolled her eyes then twirled a finger around her ear as if Susan had gone mad Thee agreed to it yerself Miss Oh So Young and Pretty Aye so ye did And if yer girlish megrims now cause ye to want to cry off whats been done   Aye Susan agreed I agreed to the bargain so I did After yed dunned me about it day and night after yed come to me in tears   I never did Cordelia cried stung Have ye forgotten so quick Aunt Aye I suppose As by tonight yell have forgotten slapping me at breakfast Well I havent forgotten Thee cried all right cried and told me ye feared we might be turned off the land since we had no more legal right to it that wed be on the road thee wept and said   Stop calling me that Aunt Cord shouted Nothing on earth maddened her so much as having her own thees and thous turned back at her Thee has no more right to the old tongue than thee has to thy stupid sheeps complaints Go on Get out But Susan went on Her rage was at the flood and would not be turned aside Thee wept and said wed be turned out turned west that wed never see my das homestead or Hambry again    and then when I was frightened enough ye talked of the cunning little baby Id have The land that was ours to begin with given back again The horses that were ours likewise given back As a sign of the Mayors honesty I have a horse Imyself helped to foal And what have I done to deserve these things that would have been mine in any case but for the loss of a single paper What have I done so that he should give ye money What have I done save promise to fuck him while his wife of forty year sleeps down the hall Is it the money ye want then Aunt Cord asked smiling furiously Do ye and do ye and aye Ye shall have it then Take it keep it lose it feed it to the swine I care not She turned to her purse which hung on a post by the stove She began to fumble in it but her motions quickly lost speed and conviction There was an oval of mirror mounted to the left of the kitchen doorway and in it Susan caught sight other aunts face What she saw there  a mixture of hatred dismay and greed  made her heart sink Never mind Aunt I see thees loath to give it up and I wouldnt have it anyway Its whores money Aunt Cord turned back to her face shocked her purse conveniently forgotten  Tis not whoring ye stupid get Why some of the greatest women in history have been gillys and some of the greatest men have been born of gillys Tis not whoring Susan ripped the red silk blouse from where it hung and held it up The shirt moulded itself to her breasts as if it had been longing all the while to touch them Then why does he send me these whores clothes Susan Tears stood in Aunt Cords eyes Susan flung the shirt at her as she had the orange slices It landed on her shoes Pick it up and put it on yerself if ye fancy You spread yer legs for him if ye fancy She turned and hurled herself out the door Her aunts halfhysterical shriek had followed her Dont thee go off thinking foolish thoughts Susan Foolish thoughts lead to foolish deeds and its too late for either Thees agreed She knew that And however fast she rode Pylon along the Drop she could not outrace her knowing She had agreed and no matter how horrified Pat Delgado might have been at the fix she had gotten herself into he would have seen one thing clear  she had made a promise and promises must be kept Hell awaited those who would not do so  She eased the rosillo back while he still had plenty of wind She looked behind her saw that she had come nearly a mile and brought him down further  to a canter a trot a fast walk She took a deep breath and let it out For the first time that morning she registered the days bright beauty  gulls circling in the hazy air off to the west high grasses all around her and flowers in every shaded cranny cornflowers and lupin and phlox and her favorites the delicate blue silkflowers From everywhere came the somnolent buzz of bees The sound soothed her and with the high surge of her emotions subsiding a little she was able to admit something to herself admit it and then voice it aloud Will Dearborn she said and shivered at the sound of his name on her lips even though there was no one to hear it but Pylon and the bees So she said it again and when the words were out she abruptly turned her own wrist inward to her mouth and kissed it where the blood beat close to the surface The action shocked her because she hadnt known she was going to do it and shocked her more because the taste of her own skin and sweat aroused her immediately She felt an urge to cool herself off as she had in her bed after meeting him The way she felt it would be short work Instead she growled her fathers favorite cuss  Oh bite it  and spat past her boot Will Dearborn had been responsible for all too much upset in her life these last three weeks Will Dearborn with his unsettling blue eyes his dark tumble of hair and his stiffnecked judgmental attitude Ican be discreet madam As for propriety Im amazed you even know the word Every time she thought of that her blood sang with anger and shame Mostly anger How dare he presume to make judgments He who had grown up possessing every luxury no doubt with servants to tend his every whim and so much gold that he likely didnt even need it  he would be given the things he wanted free as a way of currying favor What would a boy like that  for that was all he was really just a boy  know about the hard choices she had made For that matter how could such as Mr Will Dearborn of Hemphill understand that she hadnt really made those choices at all That she had been carried to them the way a mother cat carries a wayward kitten back to the nestingbox by the scruff of the neck Still he wouldnt leave her mind she knew even if Aunt Cord didnt that there had been an unseen third present at their quarrel this morning She knew something else as well something that would have upset her aunt to no end Will Dearborn hadnt forgotten her either  About a week after the welcoming dinner and Dearborns disastrous hurtful remark to her the retarded slopsfella from the Travellers Rest  Sheemie folks called him  had appeared at the house Susan and her aunt shared In his hands he held a large bouquet mostly made up of the wildflowers that grew out on the Drop but with a scattering of dusky wild roses as well They looked like pink punctuation marks On the boys face there had been a wide sunny grin as he swung the gate open not waiting for an invitation Susan had been sweeping the front walk at the time Aunt Cord had been out back in the garden That was fortunate but not very surprising these days the two of them got on best when they kept apart as much as they could Susan had watched Sheemie come up the walk his grin beaming out from behind his upheld freight of flowers with a mixture of fascination and horror Gday Susan Delgado daughter of Pat Sheemie said cheerfully I come to you on an errand and cry yer pardon at any troubleation I be oh aye for I am a problem for folks and know it same as them These be for you Here He thrust them out and she saw a small folded envelope tucked amongst them Susan Aunt Cords voice from around the side of the house    and getting closer Susan did I hear the gate Yes Aunt she called back Curse the womans sharp ears Susan nimbly plucked the envelope from its place among the phlox and daisies Into her dress pocket it went They from my thirdbest friend Sheemie said I got three different friends now This many He held up two fingers frowned added two more and then grinned splendidly Arthur Heath my firstbest friend Dick Stockworth my secondbest friend My thirdbest friend   Hush Susan said in a low fierce voice that made Sheemies smile fade Not a word about your three friends A funny little flush almost like a pocket fever raced across her skin  it seemed to run down her neck from her cheeks then slip all the way to her feet There had been a lot of talk in Hambry about Sheemies new friends during the past week  talk about little else it seemed The stories she had heard were outlandish but if they werent true why did the versions told by so many different witnesses sound so much alike Susan was still trying to get herself back under control when Aunt Cord swept around the comer Sheemie fell back a step at the sight of her puzzlement becoming outright dismay Her aunt was allergic to beestings and was presently swaddled from the top of her straw brera to the hem of her faded garden dress in gauzy stuff that made her look peculiar in strong light and downright eerie in shade Adding a final touch to her costume she carried a pair of dirtstreaked garden shears in one gloved hand She saw the bouquet and bore down on it shears raised When she reached her niece she slid the scissors into a loop on her belt almost reluctantly it seemed to the niece herself and parted the veil on her face Who sent ye those I dont know Aunt Susan said much more calmly than she felt This is the young man from the inn   Inn Aunt Cord snorted He doesnt seem to know who sent him Susan carried on If only she could get him out of here Hes well I suppose youd say hes   Hes a fool yes I know that Aunt Cord cast Susan a brief irritated look then bent her attention on Sheemie Talking with her gloved hands upon her knees shouting directly into his face she asked WHO    SENT    THESE    FLOWERS    YOUNG MAN  The wings of her faceveil which had been pushed aside now fell back into place Sheemie took another step backward He looked frightened WAS IT    PERHAPS    SOMEONE FROM SEAFRONT    FROM    MAYOR    THORIN    TELL ME AND    ILL    GIVE YOU    A PENNY  Susans heart sank sure he would tell  hed not have the wit to understand hed be getting her into trouble Will too likely But Sheemie only shook his head Dont member I got a empty head sai so I do Stanley says I a bugwit His grin shone out again a splendid thing full of white even teeth Aunt Cord answered it with a grimace Oh foo Be gone then Straight back to town too  dont be hanging around hoping for a goosefeather For a boy who cant remember deserves not so much as a penny And dont you come back here again no matter who wants you to carry flowers for the young sai Do you hear me Sheemie had nodded energetically Then Sai Aunt Cord glowered at him The vertical line on her forehead had been very prominent that day Why you all wropped up in cobwebbies sai Get out of here ye impudent cull Aunt Cord cried She had a good loud voice when she wanted to use it and Sheemie jumped back from her in alarm When she was sure he was headed back down the High Street toward town and had no intention of returning to their gate and hanging about in hopes of a tip Aunt Cord had turned to Susan Get those in some water before they wilt Miss Oh So Young and Pretty and dont go mooning about wondering who yer secret admirer might be Then Aunt Cord had smiled A real smile What hurt Susan the most confused her the most was that her aunt was no cradlestory ogre no witch like Rhea of the Coos There was no monster here only a maiden lady with some few social pretensions a love of gold and silver and a tear of being turned out penniless into the world For folks such as us Susiepie she said speaking with a terrible heavy kindness  tis best to stick to our housework and leave dreams to them as can afford them  She had been sure the flowers were from Will and she was right His note was written in a hand which was clear and passing fair Dear Susan Delgado I spoke out of turn the other night and cry your pardon May I see you and speak to you It must be private This is a matter of importance If you will see me get a message to the boy who brings this He is safe Will Dearborn A matter of importance Underlined She felt a strong desire to know what was so important to him and cautioned herself against doing anything foolish Perhaps he was smitten with her  and if so whose fault was that Who had talked to him ridden his horse showed him her legs in a flashy carnival dismount Who had put her hands on his shoulders and kissed him Her cheeks and forehead burned at the thought of that and another hot ring seemed to go slipping down her body She wasnt sure she regretted the kiss but it had been a mistake regrets or no regrets Seeing him again now would be a worse one Yet she wanted to see him and knew in her deepest heart that she was ready to set her anger at him aside But there was the promise she had made The wretched promise That night she lay sleepless tossing about in her bed first thinking it would be better more dignified just to keep her silence then composing mental notes anyway  some haughty some cold some with a laceedge of flirtation When she heard the midnight bell ring passing the old day out and calling the new one in she decided enough was enough Shed thrown herself from her bed gone to her door opened it and thrust her head out into the hall When she heard Aunt Cords flutelike snores she had closed her door again crossed to her little desk by the window and lit her lamp She took one of her sheets of parchment paper from the top drawer tore it in half in Hambry the only crime greater than wasting paper was wasting threaded stockline and then wrote quickly sensing that the slightest hesitation might condemn her to more hours of indecision With no salutation and no signature her response took only a breath to write I may not see you Twould not be proper She had folded it small blew out her lamp and returned to bed with the note safely tucked under her pillow She was asleep in two minutes The following day when the marketing took her to town she had gone by the Travellers Rest which at eleven in the morning had all the charm of something which has died badly at the side of the road The saloons dooryard was a beaten dirt square bisected by a long hitching rail with a watering trough beneath Sheemie was trundling a wheelbarrow along the rail picking up last nights horsedroppings with a shovel He was wearing a comical pink sombrero and singing Golden Slippers Susan doubted if many of the Rests patrons would wake up feeling as well as Sheemie obviously did this morning  so who when you came right down to it was more softheaded She looked around to make sure no one was paying heed to her then went over to Sheemie and tapped him on the shoulder He looked frightened at first and Susan didnt blame him  according to the stories shed been hearing Jonass friend Depape had almost killed the poor kid for spilling a drink on his boots Then Sheemie recognized her Hello Susan Delgado from out there by the edge of town he said companionably Its a good day I wish you sai He bowed  an amusing imitation of the Inner Baronies bow favored by his three new friends Smiling she dropped him a bit of curtsey wearing jeans she had to pretend at the skirtholding part but women in Mejis got used to curtseying in pretend skirts See my flowers sai he asked and pointed toward the unpainted side of the Rest What she saw touched her deeply a line of mixed blue and white silkflowers growing along the base of the building They looked both brave and pathetic flurrying there in the faint morning breeze with the bald turdlittered yard before them and the splintery public house behind them Rid you grow those Sheemie Aye so I did And Mr Arthur Heath of Gilead has promised me yellow ones Ive never seen yellow silkflowers Noeyno me neither but Mr Arthur Heath says they have them in Gilead He looked at Susan solemnly the shovel held in his hands as a soldier would hold a gun or spear at port arms Mr Arthur Heath saved my life Id do anything for him Would you Sheemie she asked touched Also he has a lookout Its a birds head And when he talks to it tendypretend do I laugh Aye fit to split She looked around again to make sure no one was watching save for the carved totems across the street then removed her note folded small from her jeans pocket Would you give this to Mr Dearborn for me Hes also your friend is he not Will Aye He took the note and put it carefully into his own pocket And tell no one Shhhhh he agreed and put a finger to his lips His eyes had been amusingly round beneath the ridiculous pink ladys straw he wore Like when I brought you the flowers Hushaboo Thats right hushaboo Fare ye well Sheemie And you Susan Delgado He went back to his cleanup operations Susan had stood watching him for a moment feeling uneasy and out of sorts with herself Now that the note was successfully passed she felt an urge to ask Sheemie to give it back to scratch out what she had written and promise to meet him If only to see his steady blue eyes again looking into her face Then Jonass other friend the one with the cloak came sauntering out of the mercantile She was sure he didnt see her  his head was down and he was rolling a cigarette  but she had no intention of pressing her luck Reynolds talked to Jonas and Jonas talked  all too much  to Aunt Cord If Aunt Cord heard she had been passing the time of day with the boy who had brought her the flowers there were apt to be questions Ones she didnt want to answer  All thats history now Susan  water under the bridge Best to get your thoughts out of the past She brought Pylon to a stop and looked down the length of the Drop at the horses that moved and grazed there Quite a surprising number of them this morning It wasnt working Her mind kept turning back to Will Dearborn What bad luck meeting him had been If not for that chance encounter on her way back down from the Coos she might well have made peace with her situation by now  she was a practical girl after all and a promise was a promise She certainly never would have expected herself to get all goosygushy over losing her maidenhead and the prospect of carrying and bearing a child actually excited her But Will Dearborn had changed things had gotten into her head and now lodged there a tenant who defied eviction His remark to her as they danced stayed with her like a song you cant stop humming even though you hate it It had been cruel and stupidly selfrighteous that remark  but was there not also a grain of truth in it Rhea had been right about Hart Thorin of that much Susan no longer had any doubt She supposed that witches were right about mens lusts even when they were wrong about everything else Not a happy thought but likely a true one It was Will Be Damned to You Dearborn who had made it difficult for her to accept what needed accepting who had goaded her into arguments in which she could hardly recognize her own shrill and desperate voice who came to her in her dreams  dreams where he put his arms around her waist and kissed her kissed her kissed her She dismounted and walked downhill a little way with the reins looped in her fist Pylon followed willingly enough and when she stopped to look off into the blue haze to the southwest he lowered his head and began to crop again She thought she needed to see Will Dearborn once more if only to give her innate practicality a chance to reassert itself She needed to see him at his right size instead of the one her mind had created for him in her warm thoughts and warmer dreams Once that was done she could get on with her life and do what needed doing Perhaps that was why she had taken this path  the same one shed ridden yesterday and the day before yesterday and the day before that He rode this part of the Drop that much she had heard in the lower market She turned away from the Drop suddenly knowing he would be there as if her thought had called him  or her ka She saw only blue sky and low ridgeline hills that curved gently like the line of a womans thigh and hip and waist as she lies on her side in bed Susan felt a bitter disappointment fill her She could almost taste it in her mouth like wet tea leaves She started back to Pylon meaning to return to the house and take care of the apology she reckoned she must make The sooner she did it the sooner it would be done She reached for her left stirrup which was twisted a little and as she did a rider came over the horizon breaking against the sky at the place which looked to her like a womans hip He sat there only a silhouette on horseback but she knew who it was at once Run she told herself in a sudden panic Mount and gallop Get out of here Quickly Before something terrible happens    before it really is ka come like a wind to take you and all your plans over the sky and far away She didnt run She stood with Pylons reins in one hand and murmured to him when the rosillo looked up and nickered a greeting to the big baycolored gelding coming down the hill Then Will was there first above her and looking down then dismounted in an easy liquid motion she didnt think she could have matched for all her years of horsemanship This time there was no kickedout leg and planted heel no hat swept over a comically solemn bow this time the gaze he gave her was steady and serious and disquietingly adult They looked at each other in the Drops big silence Roland of Gilead and Susan of Mejis and in her heart she felt a wind begin to blow She feared it and welcomed it in equal measure  Goodmorn Susan he said Im glad to see you again She said nothing waiting and watching Could he hear her heart beating as clearly as she could Of course not that was so much romantic twaddle Yet it still seemed to her that everything within a fiftyyard radius should be able to hear that thumping Will took a step forward She took a step back looking at him mistrustfully He lowered his head for a moment then looked up again his lips set I cry your pardon he said Do you Her voice was cool What I said that night was unwarranted At that she felt a spark of real anger I care not that it was unwarranted I care that it was unfair That it hurt me A tear overbrimmed her left eye and slipped down her cheek She wasnt all cried out after all it seemed She thought what she said would perhaps shame him but although faint color came into his cheeks his eyes remained firmly on hers I fell in love with you he said Thats why I said it It happened even before you kissed me I think She laughed at that    but the simplicity with which he had spoken made her laughter sound false in her own ears Tinny Mr Dearborn   Will Please Mr Dearborn she said patiently as a teacher working with a dull student the idea is ridiculous On the basis of one single meeting One single kiss A sisters kiss Now she was the one who was blushing but she hurried on Such things happen in stories but in real life I think not But his eyes never left hers and in them she saw some of Rolands truth the deep romance of his nature buried like a fabulous streak of alien metal in the granite of his practicality He accepted love as a fact rather than a flower and it rendered her genial contempt powerless over both of them I cry your pardon he repeated There was a kind of brute stubbornness in him It exasperated her amused her and appalled her all at the same time I dont ask you to return my love thats not why I spoke You told me your affairs were complicated   Now his eyes did leave hers and he looked off toward the Drop He even laughed a little I called him a bit of a fool didnt I To your face So whos the fool after all She smiled couldnt help it Ye also said yed heard he was fond of strong drink and berrygirls Roland hit his forehead with the heel of his hand If his friend Arthur Heath had done that she would have taken it as a deliberate comic gesture Not with Will She had an idea he wasnt much for comedy Silence between them again this time not so uncomfortable The two horses Rusher and Pylon cropping contentedly side by side If we were horses all this would be much easier she thought and almost giggled Mr Dearborn ye understand that I have agreed to an arrangement Aye He smiled when she raised her eyebrows in surprise Its not mockery but the dialect It just   seeps in Who told ye of my business The Mayors sister Coral She wrinkled her nose and decided she wasnt surprised And she supposed there were others who could have explained her situation even more crudely Eldred Jonas for one Rhea of the Coos for another Best to leave it So if ye understand and if ye dont ask me to return your    whatever it is ye think ye feel    why are we talking Why do ye seek me out I think it makes ye passing uncomfortable   Yes he said and then as if stating a simple fact It makes me uncomfortable all right I can barely look at you and keep my head Then mayhap itd be best not to look not to speak not to think Her voice was both sharp and a little shaky How could he have the courage to say such things to just state them straight out and stareyeyed like that Why did ye send me the bouquet and that note Are ye not aware of the trouble ye couldve gotten me into If yknew my aunt    Shes already spoken to me about ye and if she knew about the note  or saw us together out here  She looked around verifying that they were still unobserved They were at least as best she could tell He reached out touched her shoulder She looked at him and he pulled his fingers back as if he had put them on something hot I said what I did so youd understand he said Thats all I feel how I feel and youre not responsible for that But I am she thought I kissed you I think Im more than a little responsible for how we both feel Will What I said while we were dancing I regret with all my heart Wont you give me your pardon Aye she said and if he had taken her in his arms at that moment she would have let him and damn the consequences But he only took off his hat and made her a charming little bow and the wind died Thankeesai Dont call me that I hate it My name is Susan Will you call me Will  She nodded Good Susan I want to ask you something  not as the fellow who insulted you and hurt you because he was jealous This is something else entirely May I Aye I suppose she said warily Are you for the Affiliation She looked at him flabbergasted It was the last question in the world she had expected    but he was looking at her seriously Id expected ye and yer friends to count cows and guns and spears and boats and who knows what else she said but I didnt think thee would also count Affiliation supporters She saw his look of surprise and a little smile at the comers of his mouth This time the smile made him look older than he could possibly be Susan thought back across what shed just said realized what must have struck him and gave a small embarrassed laugh My aunt has a way of lapsing into thee and thou My father did too Its from a sect of the Old People who called themselves Friends I know We have the Friendly Folk in my part of the world still Do you Yes  or aye if you like the sound of that better Im coming to And I like the way the Friends talk It has a lovely sound Not when my aunt uses it Susan said thinking back to the argument over the shirt To answer your question aye  Im for the Affiliation I suppose Because my da was If ye ask am I strong for the Affiliation I suppose not We see and hear little enough of them these days Mostly rumors and stories carried by drifters and fartravelling drummers Now that theres no railway  She shrugged Most of the ordinary daytoday folk Ive spoken to seem to feel the same And yet your Mayor Thorin   Hes not my Mayor Thorin she said more sharply than she had intended And yet the Baronys Mayor Thorin has given us every help weve asked for and some we havent I have only to snap my fingers and Kimba Rimer stands before me Then dont snap them she said looking around in spite of herself She tried to smile and show it was a joke but didnt make much success of it  The townsfolk the fisherfolk the farmers the cowboys    they all speak well of the Affiliation but distantly Yet the Mayor his Chancellor and the members of the Horsemens Association Lengyll and Garber and that lot   I know them she said shortly Theyre absolutely enthusiastic in their support Mention the Affiliation to Sheriff Avery and he all but dances In every ranch parlor were offered a drink from an Eld commemorative cup it seems A drink of what she asked a trifle roguishly Beer Ale Graf Also wine whiskey and pettibone he said not responding to her smile Its almost as if they wish us to break our vow Does that strike you as strange Aye a little or just as Hambry hospitality In these parts when someone  especially a young man  says hes taken the pledge folks tend to think him coy not serious And this joyful support of the Affiliation amongst the movers and the shakers How does that strike you Queer And it did Pat Delgados work had brought him in almost daily contact with these landowners and horsebreeders and so she who had tagged after her da any time he would let her had seen plenty of them She thought them a cold bunch by and large She couldnt imagine John Croydon or Jake White waving an Arthur Eld stein in a sentimental toast especially not in the middle of the day when there was stock to be run and sold Wills eyes were full upon her as if he were reading these thoughts But you probably dont see as much of the big fellas as you once did he said Before your father passed I mean Perhaps not   but do bumblers learn to speak backward No cautious smile this time this time he outright grinned It lit his whole face Gods how handsome he was I suppose not No more than cats change their spots as we say And Mayor Thorin doesnt speak of such as us  me and my friends  to you when you two are aloneor is that question beyond what i have a right to ask i suppose it is I care not about that she said tossing her head pertly enough to make her long braid swing I understand little of propriety as some have been good enough to point out But she didnt care as much for his downcast look and flush of embarrassment as she had expected She knew girls who liked to tease as well as flirt and to tease hard some of them  but it seemed she had no taste for it Certainly she had no desire to set her claws in him and when she went on she spoke gently Im not alone with him in any case And oh how ye do lie she thought mournfully remembering how Thorin had embraced her in the hall on the night of the party groping at her breasts like a child trying to get his hand into a candyjar telling her that he burned for her Oh ye great liar In any case Will Harts opinion of you and yer friends can hardly concern ye can it Ye have a job to do thats all If he helps ye why not just accept and be grateful Because somethings wrong here he said and the serious almost somber quality of his voice frightened her a little Wrong With the Mayor With the Horsemens Association What are ye talking about He looked at her steadily then seemed to decide something Im going to trust you Susan Im not sure I want thy trust any more than I want thy love she said He nodded And yet to do the job I was sent to do I have to trust someone Can you understand that She looked into his eyes then nodded He stepped next to her so close she fancied she could feel the warmth of his skin Look down there Tell me what you see She looked then shrugged The Drop Same as always She smiled a little And as beautiful This has always been my favorite place in all the world Aye its beautiful all right What else do you see Horses of courses She smiled to show this was a joke an old one of her das in fact but he didnt smile back Fair to look at and courageous if the stories they were already telling about town were true  quick in both thought and movement too Really not much sense of humor though Well there were worse failings Grabbing a girls bosom when she wasnt expecting it might be one of them Horses Yes But does it look like the right number of them Youve been seeing horses on the Drop all your life and surely no one whos not in the Horsemens Association is better qualified to say And ye dont trust them Theyve given us everything weve asked for and theyre as friendly as dogs under the dinnertable but no   dont think  do Yet yed trust me He looked at her steadily with his beautiful and frightening eyes  a darker blue than they would later be not yet faded out by the suns of ten thousand drifting days I have to trust someone he repeated She looked down almost as though he had rebuked her He reached out put gentle fingers beneath her chin and tipped her face up again Does it seem the right number Think carefully But now that hed brought it to her attention she hardly needed to think about it at all She had been aware of the change for some time she supposed but it had been gradual easy to overlook No she said at last Its not right Too few or too many Which She paused for a moment Drew in breath Let it out in a long sigh Too many Far too many Will Dearborn raised his clenched fists to shoulderheight and gave them a single hard shake His blue eyes blazed like the sparklights of which her grandda had told her I knew it he said I knew it  How many horses are down there he asked Below us Or on the whole Drop Just below us She looked carefully making no attempt to actually count That didnt work it only confused you She saw four goodsized groups of about twenty horses each moving about on the green almost exactly as birds moved about in the blue above them There were perhaps nine smaller groups ranging from octets to quartets  several pairs they reminded her of lovers but everything did today it seemed  a few galloping loners  young stallions mostly    A hundred and sixty he asked in a low almost hesitant voice She looked at him surprised Aye A hundred sixtys the number I had in mind To a pin And how much of the Drop are we looking at A quarter A third Much less She tilted him a small smile As I think thee knows A sixth of the total open graze perhaps If there are a hundred and sixty horses freegrazing on each sixth that comes to   She waited for him to come up with nine hundred and sixty When he did she nodded He looked down a moment longer and grunted with surprise when Rusher nosed him in the small of the back Susan put a curled hand to her mouth to stifle a laugh From the impatient way he pushed the horses muzzle away she guessed he still saw little that was funny How many more are stabled or training or working do you reckon he asked One for every three down there At a guess So wed be talking twelve hundred head of horses All threaded stock no muties She looked at him with faint surprise Aye Theres almost no mutie stock here in Mejis  in any of the Outer Baronies for that matter You truebreed more than three out of every five We breed em all Of course every now and then we get a freak that has to be put down but   Not one freak out of every five livebirths One out of five born with   How had Renfrew put it With extra legs or its guts on the outside Her shocked look was enough answer Whos been telling ye such Renfrew He also told me that there was about five hundred and seventy head of threaded stock here in Mejis Thats just    She gave a bewildered little laugh Just crazy If my da was here   But hes not Roland said his tone as dry as a snapping twig Hes dead For a moment she seemed not to register the change in that tone Then as if an eclipse had begun to happen somewhere inside her head her entire aspect darkened My da had an accident Do you understand that Will Dearborn An accident It was terribly sad but the sort of thing that happens sometimes A horse rolled on him Ocean Foam Fran says Foam saw a snake in the grass Fran Lengyll Aye Her skin was pale except for two wild roses  pink like those in the bouquet hed sent her by way of Sheemie  glowing high up on her cheekbones Fran rode many miles with my father They werent great friends  they were of different classes for one thing  but they rode together Ive a cap put away somewhere that Frans first wife made for my christening They rode the trail together  cant believe Fran Lengyll would lie about how my da died let alone that he had  anything to do with it Yet she looked doubtfully down at the running horses So many Too many Her da would have seen And her da would have wondered what she was wondering now whose brands were on the extras It so happens Fran Lengyll and my friend Stockworth had a discussion about horses Will said His voice sounded almost casual but there was nothing casual on his face Over glasses of spring water after beer had been offered and refused They spoke of them much as I did with Renfrew at Mayor Thorins welcoming dinner When Richard asked sai Lengyll to estimate riding horses he said perhaps four hundred Insane It would seem so Will agreed Do they not kennit the horses are out here where ye can see em They know weve barely gotten started he said and that weve begun with the fisherfolk Well be a month yet Im sure they think before we start to concern ourselves with the horseflesh hereabouts And in the meantime they have an attitude about us of how shall I put it Well never mind how Id put it Im not very good with words but my friend Arthur calls it genial contempt They leave the horses out in front of our eyes I think because they dont believe well know what were looking at Or because they think we wont believe what were seeing Im very glad I found you out here Just so I could give you a more accurate horsecount Is that the only reason But ye will get around to counting the horses Eventually I mean that must surely be one of the Affiliations main needs He gave her an odd look as if she had missed something that should have been obvious It made her feel selfconscious What What is it Perhaps they expect the extra horses to be gone by the time we get around to this side of the Baronys business Gone where I dont know But I dont like this Susan you will keep this just between the two of us wont you She nodded Shed be insane totell anyone she had been with willdearborn unchaperoned except by Rusher and Pylon out on the Drop It may all turn out to be nothing but if it doesnt knowing could be dangerous Which led back to her da again Lengyll had told her and Aunt Cord that Pat had been thrown and that Ocean Foam had then rolled upon him Neither of them had had any reason to doubt the mans story But Fran Lengyll had also told Wills friend that there were only four hundred head of riding stock in Mejis and that was a bald lie Will turned to his horse and she was glad Part of her wanted him to stay  to stand close to her while the clouds sent their long shadows flying across the grassland  but they had been together out here too long already There was no reason to think anyone would come along and see them but instead of comforting her that idea for some reason made her more nervous than ever He straightened the stirrup hanging beside the scabbarded shaft of his lance Rusher whickered way back in his throat as if to say About time we got going then turned to her again She felt actually faint as his gaze fell upon her and now the idea of ka was almost too strong to deny She tried to tell herself it was just the dim  that feeling of having lived a thing before  but it wasnt the dim it was a sense of finding a road one had been searching for all along Theres something else I want to say I dont like returning to where we started but I must No she said faintly Thats closed surely I told you that I loved you and that I was jealous he said and for the first time his voice had come unanchored a little wavering in his throat She was alarmed to see that there were tears standing in his eyes There was more Something more Will I dont want to   She turned blindly for her horse He took her shoulder and turned her back It wasnt a harsh touch but there was an inexorability to it that was dreadful She looked helplessly up into his face saw that he was young and far from home and suddenly understood she could not stand against him for long She wanted him so badly that she ached with it She would have given a year of her life just to be able to put her palms on his cheeks and feel his skin You miss your father Susan Aye she whispered With all my heart I do I miss my mother the same way He held her by both shoulders now One eye overbrimmed one tear drew a silver line down his cheek Is she dead No but something happened About her To her Shit How can I talk about it when I dont even know how to think about it In a way she did die For me Will thats terrible He nodded The last time I saw her she looked at me in a way that will haunt me to my grave Shame and love and hope all of them bound up together Shame at what Id seen and knew about her hope maybe that Id understand and forgive    He took a deep breath The night of the party toward the end of the meal Rimer said something funny You all laughed   If I did it was only because it would have looked strange if I was the only one who didnt Susan said I dont like him I think hes a schemer and a conniver You all laughed and I happened to look down toward the end of the table Toward Olive Thorin And for a moment  only a moment  I thought she was my mother The expression was the same you see The same one I saw on the morning when I opened the wrong door at the wrong time and came upon my mother and her   Stop it she cried pulling back from his hands Inside her everything was suddenly in motion all the mooringlines and buckles and clamps shed been using to hold herself together seeming to melt at once Stop it just stop it I cant listen to you talk about her She groped out for Pylon but now the whole world was wet prisms She began to sob She felt his hands on her shoulders turning her again and she did not resist them Im so ashamed she said Im so ashamed and so frightened and Im sorry Ive forgotten my fathers face and    and  And Ill never be able to find it again she wanted to say but she didnt have to say anything He stopped her mouth with his kisses At first she just let herself be kissed    and then she was kissing him back kissing him almost furiously She wiped the wetness from beneath his eyes with soft little sweeps of her thumbs then slipped her palms up his cheeks as she had longed to do The feeling was exquisite even the soft rasp of the stubble close to the skin was exquisite She slid her arms around his neck her open mouth on his holding him and kissing him as hard as she could kissing him there between the horses who simply looked at each other and then went back to cropping grass  They were the best kisses of his whole life and never forgotten the yielding pliancy of her lips and the strong shape of her teeth under them urgent and not shy in the least the fragrance of her breath the sweet line of her body pressed against his He slipped a hand up to her left breast squeezed it gently and felt her heart speeding under it His other hand went to her hair and combed along the side of it silk at her temple He never forgot its texture Then she was standing away from him her face flaming with blush and passion one hand going to her lips which he had kissed until they were swollen A little trickle of blood ran from the comer of the lower one Her eyes wide on his Her bosom rising and falling as if she had just run a race And between them a current that was like nothing he had ever felt in his life It ran like a river and shook like a fever No more she said in a trembling voice No more please If you really do love me dont let me dishonor myself Ive made a promise Anything might come later after that promise was fulfilled I suppose   if you still wanted me    I would wait forever he said calmly and do anything for you but stand away and watch you go with another man Then if you love me go away from me Please Will Another kiss She stepped forward at once raising her face trustingly up to his and he understood he could do whatever he wanted with her She was at least for the moment no longer her own mistress she might consequently be his He could do to her what Marten had done to his own mother if that was his fancy The thought broke his passion apart turned it to coals that fell in a bright shower winking out one by one in a dark bewilderment His fathers acceptance Ihave known for two years was in many ways the worst part of what had happened to him this year how could he fall in love with this girl  any girl  in a world where such evils of the heart seemed necessary and might even be repeated Yet he did love her Instead of the passionate kiss he wanted he placed his lips lightly on the corner of her mouth where the little rill of blood flowed He kissed tasting salt like the taste of his own tears He closed his eyes and shivered when her hand stroked the hair at the nape of his neck Id not hurt Olive Thorin for the world she whispered in his ear No more than Id hurt thee Will I didnt understand and now tis too late to be put right But thank you for not not taking what you could And Ill remember you always How it was to be kissed by you Its the best thing that ever happened to me I think Like heaven and earth all wrapped up together aye Ill remember too He watched her swing up into the saddle and remembered how her bare legs had flashed in the dark on the night he had met her And suddenly he couldnt let her go He reached forward touched her boot Susan   No she said Please He stood back Somehow This is our secret she said Yes Aye She smiled at that  but it was a sad smile Stay away from me from now on Will Please And Ill stay away from you He thought about it If we can We must Will We must She rode away fast Roland stood beside Rushers stirrup watching her go And when she was out of sight over the horizon still he watched  Sheriff Avery Deputy Dave and Deputy George Riggins were sitting on the porch in front of the Sheriffs office and jail when Mr Stockworth and Mr Heath the latter with that idiotic birds skull still mounted on the horn of his saddle went past at a steady walk The bell o noon had rung fifteen minutes before and Sheriff Avery reckoned they were on their way to lunch perhaps at The Millbank or perhaps at the Rest which put on a fair noon meal Popkins and such Avery liked something a little more filling half a chicken or a haunch of beef suited him just fine Mr Heath gave them a wave and a grin Good day gents Long life Gentle breezes Happy siestas They waved and smiled back When they were out of sight Dave said They spent all mornin down there on the piers countin nets Nets Do you believe it Yessir Sheriff Avery said lifting one massive cheek a bit out of his rocker and letting off a noisy preluncheon fart Yessir I do Aye George said If not for them facing off Jonass boys the way they done Id think they was a pack of fools Nor would they likely mind Avery said He looked at Dave who was twirling his monocle on the end of its ribbon and looking off in the direction the boys had taken There were folks in town who had begun calling the Affiliation brats Little Coffin Hunters Avery wasnt sure what to make of that Hed soothed it down between them and Thorins hard boys and had gotten both a commendation and a piece of gold from Rimer for his efforts but still   what to make of them The day they came in he said to Dave ye thought they were soft How do ye say now Now Dave twirled his monocle a final time then popped it in his eye and stared at the Sheriff through it Now I think they might have been a little harder than I thought after all Yes indeed Avery thought But hard dont mean smart thank the gods Aye thank the gods for that Im hungry as a bull so I am he said getting up He bent put his hands on his knees and ripped off another loud fart Dave and George looked at each other George fanned a hand in front of his face Sheriff Herkimer Avery Barony Sheriff straightened up looking both relieved and anticipatory More room out than there is in he said Come on boys Lets go downstreet and tuck into a little  Not even sunset could do much to improve the view from the porch of the Bar K bunkhouse The building  except for the cookshack and the stable the only one still standing on what had been the home acre  was Lshaped and the porch was built on the inside of the short arm Left for them on it had been just the right number of seats two splintery rockers and a wooden crate to which an unstable board back had been nailed On this evening Alain sat in one of the rockers and Cuthbert sat on the boxseat which he seemed to fancy On the rail peering across the beaten dirt of the dooryard and toward the burnedout hulk of the Garber home place was the lookout Alain was bonetired and although both of them had bathed in the stream near the west end of the home acre he thought he still smelled fish and seaweed on himself They had spent the day counting nets He was not averse to hard work even when it was monotonous but he didnt like pointless work Which this was Hambry came in two parts the fishers and the horsebreeders There was nothing for them among the fishers and after three weeks all three of them knew it Their answers were out on the Drop at which they had so far done no more than look At Rolands order The wind gusted and for a moment they could hear the low grumbling squealing sound of the thinny I hate that sound Alain said Cuthbert unusually silent and introspective tonight nodded and said only Aye They were all saying that now not to mention So you do and So I am and So it is Alain suspected the three of them would have Hambry on their tongues long after they had wiped its dust from their boots From behind them inside the bunkhouse door came a less unpleasant sound  the cooing of pigeons And then from around the side of the bunkhouse a third for which he and Cuthbert had unconsciously been listening as they sat watching the sun go down horses hoofs Rushers Roland came around the comer riding easy and as he did something happened that struck Alain as oddly portentous  a kind of omen There was a flurryflutter of wings a dark shape in the air and suddenly a bird was roosting on Rolands shoulder He didnt jump barely looked around He rode up to the hitching rail and sat there holding out his hand Hile he said softly and the pigeon stepped into his palm Bound to one of its legs was a capsule Roland removed it opened it and took out a tiny strip of paper which had been rolled tight In his other hand he held the pigeon out Hile Alain said holding out his own hand The pigeon flew to it As Roland dismounted Alain took the pigeon into the bunkhouse where the cages had been placed beneath an open window He ungated the center one and held out his hand The pigeon which had just arrived hopped in the pigeon in the cage hopped out and into his palm Alain shut the cage door latched it crossed the room and turned up the pillow of Berts bunk Beneath it was a linen envelope containing a number of blank paper strips and a tiny storagepen He took one of the strips and the pen which held its own small reservoir of ink and did not have to be dipped He went back out on the porch Roland and Cuthbert were studying the unrolled strip of paper the pigeon had delivered from Gilead On it was a line of tiny geometric shapes What does it say Alain asked The code was simple enough but he could not get it by heart or read it on sight as Roland and Bert had been able to almost immediately Alains talents  his ability to track his easy access to the touch  lay in other directions  Farson moves east  Cuthbert read  Forces split one big one small Do you see anything unusual  He looked at Roland almost offended Anything unusual what does that mean Roland shook his head He didnt know He doubted if the men who had sent the message  of whom his own father was almost surely one  did either Alain handed Cuthbert the strip and the pen With one finger Bert stroked the head of the softly cooing pigeon It ruffled its wings as if already anxious to be off to the west What shall I write Cuthbert asked The same Roland nodded But we have seen things that are unusual Alain said And we know things are wrong here The horses  and at that small ranch way south  I cant remember the name    Cuthbert could The Rocking H Aye the Rocking H There are oxen there Oxen My gods Ive never seen them except for pictures in a book Roland looked alarmed Does anyone know you saw Alain shrugged impatiently I dont think so There were drovers about  three maybe four   Four aye Cuthbert said quietly   but they paid no attention to us Even when we see things they think we dont And thats the way it must stay Rolands eyes swept them but there was a kind of absence in his face as if his thoughts were far away He turned to look toward the sunset and Alain saw something on the collar of his shirt He plucked it a move made so quickly and nimbly that not even Roland felt it Bert couldnt have done that Alain thought with some pride Aye but   Same message Roland said He sat down on the top step and looked off toward the evening redness in the west Patience Mr Richard Stockworth and Mr Arthur Heath We know certain things and we believe certain other things But would John Farson come all this way simply to resupply horses I dont think so Im not sure horses are valuable aye so they are    but Im not sure So we wait All right all right same message Cuthbert smoothed the scrap of paper flat on the porch rail then made a small series of symbols on it Alain could read this message he had seen the same sequence several times since they had come to Hambry Message received We are fine Nothing to report at this time The message was put in the capsule and attached to the pigeons leg Alain went down the steps stood beside Rusher still waiting patiently to be unsaddled and held the bird up toward the fading sunset Hile It was up and gone in a flutter of wings For a moment only they saw it a dark shape against the deepening sky Roland sat looking after The dreamy expression was still on his face Alain found himself wondering if Roland had made the right decision this evening He had never in his life had such a thought Nor expected to have one Roland Hmmm Like a man halfawakened from some deep sleep Ill unsaddle him if you want He nodded at Rusher And rub him down No answer for a long time Alain was about to ask again when Roland said No Ill do it In a minute or two And went back to looking at the sunset Alain climbed the porch steps and sat down in his rocker Bert had resumed his place on the boxseat They were behind Roland now and Cuthbert looked at Alain with his eyebrows raised He pointed to Roland and then looked at Alain again Alain passed over what he had plucked fromrolands collar although it was almost too fine to be seen in this light Cuthberts eyes were gunslingers eyes and he took it easily with no fumbling It was a long strand of hair the color of spun gold He could see from Berts face that Bert knew whose head it had come from Since arriving in Hambry theyd met only one girl with long blonde hair The two boys eyes met In Berts Alain saw dismay and laughter in equal measure Cuthbert Allgood raised his forefinger to his temple and mimed pulling the trigger Alain nodded Sitting on the steps with his back to them Roland looked toward the dying sunset with dreaming eyes The town of Ritzy nearly four hundred miles west of Mejis was anything but Roy Depape reached it three nights before the Peddlers Moon  called Latesummers Moon by some  came full and left it a day later Ritzy was in fact a miserable little mining village on the eastern slope of the Vi Castis Mountains about fifty miles from Vi Castis Cut The town had but one street it was engraved with ironhard wheelruts now and would become a lake of mud roughly three days after the storms of autumn set in There was the Bear and Turtle Mercantile  Sundrie Items where miners were forbidden by the Vi Castis Company to shop and a company store where no one but grubbies would shop there was a combined jailhouse and Town Gathering Hall with a windmillcumgallows out front there were six roaring barrooms each more sordid desperate and dangerous than the last Ritzy was like an ugly lowered head between a pair of huge shrugged shoulders  the foothills Above town to the south were the clappedout shacks where the Company housed its miners each puff of breeze brought the stench of their unlimed communal privies To the north were the mines themselves dangerous undershored scratch drifts that went down fifty feet or so and then spread like fingers clutching for gold and silver and copper and the occasional nest of firedims From the outside they were just holes punched into the bare and rocky earth holes like staring eyes each with its own pile of till and scrapings beside the adit Once there had been freehold mines up there but they were all gone regulated out by the Vi Castis Company Depape knew all about it because the Big Coffin Hunters had been a part of that little spin and raree Just after hed hooked up with Jonas and Reynolds that had been Why they had gotten those coffins tattooed on their hands not fifty miles from here in the town of Wind a mudpen even less ritzy thanritzy how long ago he couldnt rightly say although it seemed to him that he should be able to But when it came to reckoning times past Depape often felt lost It was hard even to remember how old he was Because the world had moved on and time was different now Softer One thing he had no trouble remembering at all  his recollection was refreshed by the miserable flare of pain he suffered each time he bumped his wounded finger That one thing was a promise to himself that he would see Dearborn Stockworth and Heath laid out dead in a row hand to outstretched hand like a little girls paper dolls He intended to unlimber the part of him which had longed so bootlessly for Her Nibs these last three weeks and use it to hose down their dead faces The majority of his squirt would be saved for Arthur Heath of Gilead New Canaan That laughing chatterbox motherfucker had a serious hosingdown coming Depape rode out the sunrise end of Ritzys only street trotted his horse up the flank of the first hill and paused at the top for a single look back Last night when hed been talking to the old bastard behind Hattigans Ritzy had been roaring This morning at seven it looked as ghostly as the Peddlers Moon which still hung in the sky above the rim of the plundered hills He could hear the mines tinktonking away though You bet Those babies tinktonked away seven days a week No rest for the wicked    and he supposed that included him He dragged his horses head around with his usual unthinking and hamhanded force booted its flanks and headed east thinking of the old bastard as he went He had treated the old bastard passing fair he reckoned A reward had been promised and had been paid for information given Yar Depape said his glasses flashing in the new sun it was a rare morning when he had no hangover and he felt quite cheerful I reckon the old bugger cant complain Depape had had no trouble following the young culls backtrail they had come east on the Great Road the whole way from New Canaan it appeared and at every town where they had stopped they had been marked In most they were marked if they did no more than pass through And why not Young men on good horses no scars on their faces no regulator tattoos on their hands good clothes on their backs expensive hats on their heads They were remembered especially well at the inns and saloons where they had stopped to refresh themselves but had drunk no hard liquor No beer or graf either for that matter Yes they were remembered Boys on the road boys that seemed almost to shine As if they had come from an earlier better time Piss in their faces Depape thought as he rode One by one Mr Arthur HaHa  Heath last Ill save enough so it d drown you were you not already at the end of the path and into the clearing They had been noticed all right but that wasnt good enough  if he went back to Hambry with no more than that Jonas would likely shoot his nose off And he would deserve it They may be rich boys but thats not all they are Depape had said that himself The question was what else were they And finally in the shitandsulfur stench of Ritzy he had found out Not everything perhaps but enough to allow him to turn his horse around before he found himself all the way back in fucking New Canaan He had hit two other saloons sipping watered beer in each before rolling into Hattigans He ordered yet another watered beer and prepared to engage the bartender in conversation Before he even began to shake the tree however the apple he wanted fell off and dropped into his hand neat as you please It was an old mans voice an old bastards voice speaking with the shrill headhurting intensity which is the sole province of old bastards in their cups He was talking about the old days as old bastards always did and about how the world had moved on and how things had been ever so much better when he was a boy Then he had said something which caused Depapes ears to prick up something about how the old days might be coming again for hadnt he seen three young lords not two months agone mayhap less and even bought one of them a drink even if twas only sasparilly soda You wouldnt know a young lord from a young turd said a miss who appeared to have all of four teeth left in her charming young head There was general laughter at this The old bastard looked around offended I know all right he said Ive forgot more than youll ever learn so I have One of them at least came from the Eld line for I saw his father in his face    just as clear as I see your saggy tits Jolene And then the old bastard had done something Depape rather admired  yanked out the front of the saloonwhores blouse and poured the remainder of his beer down it Even the roars of laughter and heavy applause which greeted this couldnt entirely drown the girls caw of rage or the old mans cries when she began to slap and punch him about the head and shoulders These latter cries were only indignant at firstbut when the girl grabbed the old bastards own beerstein and shattered it against the side of his head they became screams of pain Blood  mixed with a few watery dregs of beer  began to run down the old bastards face Get out of here she yelled and gave him a shove toward the door Several healthy kicks from the miners in attendance who had changed sides as easily as the wind changes directions helped him along And dont come back I can smell the weed on your breath you old cocksucker Get out and take your godscussed stories of old days and young lords with you The old bastard was in such manner conveyed across the room past the tootling trumpetplayer who served as entertainment for the patrons of Hattigans that young bowlerhatted worthy added his own kick in the seat of the old bastards dusty trousers without ever missing so much as a single note of Play Ladies Play and out through the batwing doors where he collapsed facefirst into the street Depape had sauntered after him and helped him up As he did so he smelled an acrid odor  not beer  on the old mans breath and saw the telltale greenishgray discolorations at the comers of his lips Weed all right The old bastard was probably just getting started on it and for the usual reason devilgrass was free in the hills unlike the beer and whiskey that was sold in town but once they started the finish came quick They got no respect the old bastard said thickly Nor understanding either Aye so they dont said Depape who had not yet gotten the accents of the seacoast and the Drop out of his speech The old bastard stood swaying looking up at him wiping ineffectually at the blood which ran down his wrinkled cheeks from his lacerated scalp Son do you have the price of a drink Remember the face of your father and give an old soul the price of a drink Im not much for charity oldtimer Depape said but mayhap you could earn yourself the price of a drink Step on over here into my office and lets us see Hed led the old bastard out of the street and back to the boardwalk angling well to the left of the black batwings with their golden shafts of light spilling out above and below He waited for a trio of miners to go by singing at the top of their lungs Woman I love is long and tall she moves her body like a cannonball  and then still holding the old bastard by the elbow hail guided him into the alley between Hattigans and the undertaking establishment next door For some people Depape mused a visit to Ritzy could damn near amount to onestop shopping get your drink get your bullet get laid out next door Yer office the old bastard cackled as Depape led him down the alley toward the board fence and the heaps of rubbish at the far end The wind blew stinging Depapes nose with odors of sulfur and carbolic from the mines From their right the sounds of drunken revelry pounded through the side of Hattigans Your office thats good Aye my office The old man gazed at him in the light of the moon which rode the slot of sky above the alley Are you from Mejis Or Tepachi Maybe one maybe tother maybe neither Do I know you The old bastard was looking at him even more closely standing on tiptoe as if hoping for a kiss Ugh Depape pushed him away Not so close dad Yet he felt marginally encouraged He and Jonas and Reynolds had been here before and if the old man remembered his face likely he wasnt talking through his hat about fellows hed seen much more recently Tell me about the three young lords old dad Depape rapped on the wall of Hattigans Them in there may not be interested but I am The old bastard looked at him with a bleary calculating eye Might there be a bit o metal in it for me Yar Depape said If you tell me what I want to hear Ill give you metal Gold Tell me and well see No sir Dicker first tell second Depape seized him by the arm whirled him around and yanked a wrist which felt like a bundle of sticks up to the old bastards scrawny shoulderblades Fuck with me dad and well start by breaking your arm Let go the old bastard screamed breathlessly Let go Ill trust to your generosity young sir for you have a generous face Yes Yes indeed Depape let him go The old bastard eyed him warily rubbing his shoulder In the moonlight the blood drying on his cheeks looked black Three of them there were he said Fineborn lads Lads or lords Which is it dad The old bastard had taken the question thoughtfully The whack on the head the night air and having his arm twisted seemed to have sobered him up at least temporarily Both I do believe he said at last One was a lord for sure whether them in there believe it or not For I saw his father and his father bore the guns Not such poor things such as you wear  beggin your pardon I know theyre the best to be had these days  but real guns such as were seen when my own dad was a boy The big ones with the sandalwood grips Depape had stared at the old man feeling a rise of excitement    and a species of reluctant awe as well They acted like gunslingers Jonas had said When Reynolds protested they were too young Jonas had said they might be apprentices and now it seemed the boss had likely been right Sandalwood grips he had asked Sandalwood grips old dad Yep The old man saw his excitement and his belief He expanded visibly A gunslinger you mean This one young fellows father carried the big irons Yep a gunslinger One of the last lords Their line is passing now but my dad knew him well enough Steven Deschain of Gilead Steven son of Henry And this one you saw not long ago   His son Henry the Tails grandson The others looked wellborn as if they might also come from the line of lords but the one I saw come down all the way from Arthur Eld by one line or another Sure as you walk on two legs Have I earned my metal yet Depape thought to say yes then realized he didnt know which of the three culls this old bastard was talking about Three young men he mused Three highborns And did they have guns Not out where the driftdiggers of this town could see em the old bastard said and laughed nastily But they had em all right Probably hid in their bedrolls Id set my watch and warrant on it Aye Depape said I suppose you would Three young men one the son of a lord Of a gunslinger you think Steven of Gilead And the name was familiar to him aye it was Steven Deschain of Gilead thats it And what name did he give this young lord The old bastard had screwed his face up alarmingly in an effort to remember Deerfield Deerstine I dont quite remember   Thats all right I know it And youve earned your metal Have I the old bastard had edged close again his breath gaggingsweet with the weed Gold or silver Which is it my friend Lead Depape replied then hauled leather and shot the old man twice in the chest Doing him a favor really Now he rode back toward Mejis  it would be a faster trip without having to stop in every dipshit little town and ask questions There was a flurry of wings close above his head A pigeon  dark gray it was with a white ring around its neck  fluttered down on a rock just ahead of him as if to rest An interestinglooking bird Not Depape thought a wild pigeon Someones escaped pet He couldnt imagine anyone in this desolate quarter of the world keeping anything but a halfwild dog to bite the squash off any wouldbe robber although what these folks might have worth robbing was another question he couldnt answer but he supposed anything was possible In any case roast pigeon would go down a treat when he stopped for the night Depape drew his gun but before he could cock the hammer the pigeon was off and flying east Depape took a shot after it anyway Sometimes you got lucky but apparently not this time the pigeon dipped a little then straightened out and disappeared in the direction Depape himself was going He sat astride his horse for a moment not much put out of countenance he thought Jonas was going to be very pleased with what he had found out After a bit he booted his horse in the sides and began to canter east along the Barony Sea Road back toward Mejis where the boys who had embarrassed him were waiting to be dealt with Lords they might be sons of gunslingers they might be but in these latter days even such as those could die As the old bastard himself would undoubtedly have pointed out the world had moved on  On a late afternoon three days after Roy Depape left Ritzy and headed his horse toward Hambry again Roland Cuthbert and Alain rode north and west of town first down the long swell of the Drop then into the freeland Hambry folk called the Bad Grass then into deserty waste lands Ahead of them and clearly visible once they were back in the open were crumbled and eroded bluffs In the center of these was a dark almost vaginal cleft its edges so splintered it looked as if it had been whacked into reality by an illtempered god wielding a hatchet The distance between the end of the Drop and the bluffs was perhaps six miles Three quarters of the way across they passed the flatlands only real geographic feature a jutting upthrust of rock that looked like a finger bent at the first knuckle Below it was a small boomerangshaped greensward and when Cuthbert gave a ululating yell to hear his voice bounce back at him from the bluffs ahead a pack of chattering billybumblers broke from this greenplace and went racing back southeast toward the Drop Thats Hanging Rock Roland said Theres a spring at the base of it  only one in these parts they say It was all the talk that passed between them on the ride out but a look of unmistakable relief passed between Cuthbert and Alain behind Rolands back For the last three weeks they had pretty much marched in place as summer rolled around them and past them It was all well for Roland to say they must wait they must pay greatest attention to the things that didnt matter and count the things which did from the comers of their eyes but neither of them quite trusted the dreamy disconnected air which Roland wore these days like his own special version of Clay Reynoldss cloak They didnt talk about this between themselves they didnt have to Both knew that if Roland began courting the pretty girl whom Mayor Thorin meant for his gilly and who else could that long blonde hair have belonged to they would be in very bad trouble But Roland showed no courting plumage neither of them spied any more blonde hairs on his shirtcollars and tonight he seemed more himself as if he had put that cloak of abstraction aside Temporarily mayhap Permanently if they were lucky They could only wait and see In the end ka would tell as it always did A mile or so from the bluffs the strong sea breeze which had been at their backs for the whole ride suddenly dropped and they heard the low atonal squalling from the cleft that was Eyebolt Canyon Alain pulled up grimacing like a man who has bitten into a fruit of extravagant sourness All he could think of was a handful of sharp pebbles squeezed and ground together in a strong hand Buzzards circled above the canyon as if drawn to the sound The lookout dont like it Will Cuthbert said knocking his knuckles on the skull I dont like it much either What are we out here for To count Roland said We were sent to count everything and see everything and this is something to count and see Oh aye Cuthbert said He held his horse in with some effort the low grinding wail of the thinny had made it skittish Sixteen hundred and fourteen fishing nets seven hundred and ten boats small two hundred and fourteen boats large seventy oxen that nobody will admit to and on the north of town one thinny Whatever the hell that is Were going to find out Roland said They rode into the sound and although none of them liked it no one suggested they go back They had come all the way out here and Roland was right  this was their job Besides they were curious The mouth of the canyon had been pretty well stopped up with brush as Susan had told Roland it would be Come fall most of it would probably be dead but now the stacked branches still bore leaves and made it hard to see into the canyon A path led through the center of the brushpile but it was narrow for the horses who might have balked at going through anyway and in the failing light Roland could make out hardly anything Are we going in Cuthbert asked Let the Recording Angel note that Im against although Ill offer no mutiny Roland had no intention of taking them through the brush and toward the source of that sound Not when he had only the vaguest idea of what a thinny was He had asked a few questions about it over the last few weeks and gotten little useful response Id stay away was the extent of Sheriff Averys advice So far his best information was still what he had gotten from Susan on the night he met her Sit easy Bert Were not going in Good Alain said softly and Roland smiled There was a path up the canyons west side steep and narrow but passable if they were careful They went single file stopping once to clear a rockfall pitching splintered chunks of shale and hornfels into the groaning trench to their right When this was done and just as the three of them were preparing to mount up again a large bird of some sort  perhaps a grouse perhaps a prairie chicken  rose above the lip of the canyon in an explosive whir of feathers Roland dipped for his guns and saw both Cuthbert and Alain doing the same Quite funny considering that their firearms were wrapped in protective oilcloth and secreted beneath the floorboards of the Bar K bunkhouse They looked at each other said nothing except with their eyes which said plenty and went on Roland found that the effect of being this close to the thinny was cumulative  it wasnt a sound you could get used to Quite the contrary in fact the longer you were in the immediate vicinity of Eyebolt Canyon the more that sound scraped away at your brain It got into your teeth as well as your ears it vibrated in the knot of nerves below the breastbone and seemed to eat at the damp and delicate tissue behind the eyes Most of all though it got into your head telling you that everything you had ever been afraid of was just behind the next curve of the trail or yonder pile of tumbled rock waiting to snake out of its place and get you Once they got to the flat and barren ground at the top of the path and the sky opened out above them again it was a little better but by then the light was almost gone and when they dismounted and walked to the canyons crumbling edge they could see little but shadows No good Cuthbert said disgustedly We should have left earlier Roland    Will I mean What dummies we are I can be Roland to you out here if you like And well see what we came to see and count what we came to count  one thinny just as you said Only wait They waited and not twenty minutes later the Peddlers Moon rose above the horizon  a perfect summer moon huge and orange It loomed in the darkening violet swim of the sky like a crashing planet On its face as clear as anyone had ever seen it was the Peddler he who came out of Nones with his sackful of squealing souls A hunched figure made of smudged shadows with a pack clearly visible over one cringing shoulder Behind it the orange light seemed to flame like hellfire Ugh Cuthbert said Thats an ill sight to see with that sound coming up from below Yet they held their ground and their horses which periodically yanked back on their reins as if to tell them they should already be gone from this place and the moon rose in the sky shrinking a little as it went and turning silver Eventually it rose enough to cast its bony light into Eyebolt Canyon The three boys stood looking down None of them spoke Roland didnt know about his friends but he didnt think he himself could have spoken even if called on to do so A box canyon very short and steepsided Susan had said and the description was perfectly accurate Shed also said Eyebolt looked like a chimney lying on its side and Roland supposed that was also true if you allowed that a falling chimney might break up a little on impact and lie with one crooked place in its middle Up to that crook the canyon floor looked ordinary enough even the litter of bones the moon showed them was not extraordinary Many animals which wandered into box canyons hadnt the wit to find their way hack out again and with Eyebolt the possibility of escape was further reduced by the choke of brush piled at the canyons mouth The sides were much too steep to climb except maybe for one place just before that crooked little jog There Roland saw a kind of groove running up the canyon wall with enough jutting spurs inside it to  maybe  provide handholds There was no real reason for him to note this he just did as he would go on noting potential escaperoutes his entire life Beyond the jag in the canyon floor was something none of them had ever seen before  and when they got back to the bunkhouse several hours later they all agreed that they werent sure exactly what they had seen The latter part of Eyebolt Canyon was obscured by a sullen silvery liquescence from which snakes of smoke or mist were rising in streamers The liquid seemed to move sluggishly lapping at the walls which held it in Later they would discover that both liquid and mist were a light green it was only the moonlight that had made them look silver As they watched a dark flying shape  perhaps it was the same one that had frightened them before  skimmed down toward the surface of the thinny It snatched something out of the air  a bug another smaller bird  and then began to rise again Before it could a silvery arm of liquid rose from the canyons floor For a moment that soupy grinding grumble rose a notch and became almost a voice It snatched the bird out of the air and dragged it down Greenish light brief and unfocused flashed across the surface of the thinny like electricity and was gone The three boys stared at each other with frightened eyes Jump in gunslinger a voice suddenly called It was the voice of the thinny it was the voice of his father it was also the voice of Marten the enchanter Marten the seducer Most terrible of all it was his own voice Jump in and let all these cares cease There is no love of girls to worry you here and no mourning of lost mothers to weigh your childs heart Only the hum of the growing cavity at the center of the universe only the punky sweetness of rotting flesh Come gunslinger Be apart of the thinny Dreamyfaced and blankeyed Alain began walking along the edge of the drop his right boot so close to it that the heel puffed little clouds of dust over the chasm and sent clusters of pebbles down into it Before he could get more than five steps Roland grabbed him by the belt and yanked him roughly back Where do you think youre going Alain looked at him with sleepwalkers eyes They began to clear but slowly I dont    know Roland Below them the thinny hummed and growled and sang There was a sound as well an oozing sludgy mutter I know Cuthbert said I know where were all going Back to the Bar K Come on lets get out of here He looked pleadingly at Roland Please Its awful All right But before he led them back to the path he stepped to the edge and looked down at the smoky silver ooze below him Counting he said with a kind of clear defiance Counting one thinny Then lowering his voice And be damned to you  Their composure returned as they rode back  the seabreeze in their faces was wonderfully restorative after the dead and somehow baked smell of the canyon and the thinny As they rode up the Drop on a long diagonal so as to save the horses a little Alain said What do we do next Roland Do you know No As a matter of fact I dont Supper would be a start Cuthbert said brightly and tapped the lookouts hollow skull for emphasis You know what I mean Yes Cuthbert agreed And Ill tell you something Roland   Will please Now that were back on the Drop let me be Will Aye fine Ill tell you something Will we cant go on counting nets and boats and looms and wheelirons much longer Were running out of things that dont matter I believe that looking stupid will become a good deal harder once we move to the horsebreeding side of life as its lived in Hambry Aye Roland said He stopped Rusher and looked back the way they had come He was momentarily enchanted by the sight of horses apparently infected with a kind of moonmadness frolicking and racing across the silvery grass But I tell you both again this is not just about horses Does Farson need them Aye mayhap So does the Affiliation Oxen as well But there are horses everywhere  perhaps not as good as these Ill admit but any port does in a storm so they say So if its not horses what is it Until we know or decide well never know we go on as we are Part of the answer was waiting for them back at the Bar K It was perched on the hitching rail and flicking its tail saucily When the pigeon hopped into Rolands hand he saw that one of its wings was oddly frayed Some animal  likely a cat  had crept up on it close enough to pounce he reckoned The note curled against the pigeons leg was short but it explained a good deal of what they hadnt understood Ill have to see her again Roland thought after reading it and felt a surge of gladness His pulse quickened and in the cold silver light of the Peddlers Moon he smiled The Peddlers Moon began to wane it would take the hottest fairest part of the summer with it when it went On an afternoon four days past the full the old mozo from Mayors House Miguel had been there long before Hart Thorins time and would likely be there long after Thorin had gone back to his ranch showed up at the house Susan shared with her aunt He was leading a beautiful chestnut mare by a hack It was the second of the three promised horses and Susan recognized Felicia at once The mare had been one other childhoods favorites Susan embraced Miguel and covered his bearded cheeks with kisses The old mans wide grin would have showed every tooth in his head if hed had any left to show Gracias gracias a thousand thanks old father she told him Da nada  he replied and handed her the bridle It is the Mayors earnest gift She watched him away the smile slowly fading from her lips Felicia stood docilely beside her her dark brown coat shining like a dream in the summer sunlight But this was no dream It had seemed like one at first  that sense of unreality had been another inducement to walk into the trap she now understood  but it was no dream She had been proved honest now she found herself the recipient of earnest gifts from a rich man The phrase was a sop to conventionality of course  or a bitter joke depending on ones mood and outlook Felicia was no more a gift than Pylon had been  they were stepbystep fulfillments of the contract into which she had entered Aunt Cord could express shock but Susan knew the truth what lay directly ahead was whoring pure and simple Aunt Cord was in the kitchen window as Susan walked her gift which was really just returned property in her view to the stable She called out something passing cheery about how the horse was a good thing that caring for it would give Susan less time for her megrims Susan felt a hot reply rise to her lips and held it back There had been a wary truce between the two of them since the shouting match about the shirts and Susan didnt want to be the one to break it There was too much on her mind and heart She thought that one more argument with her aunt and she might simply snap like a dry twig under a boot Because often silence is best her father had told her when at age ten or so she had asked him why he was always so quiet The answer had puzzled her then but now she understood better She stabled Felicia next to Pylon rubbed her down fed her While the mare munched oats Susan examined her hooves She didnt care much for the look of the iron the mare was wearing  that was Seafront for you  and so she took her fathers shoebag from its nail beside the stable door slung the strap over her head and shoulder so the bag hung on her hip and walked the two miles to Hockeys Stable and Fancy Livery Feeling the leather bag bang against her hip brought back her father in a way so fresh and clear that grief pricked her again and made her feel like crying She thought he would have been appalled at her current situation perhaps even disgusted And he would have liked Will Dearborn of that she was sure  liked him and approved of him for her It was the final miserable touch  She had known how to shoe most of her life and even enjoyed it when her mood was right it was dusty elemental work with always the possibility of a healthy kick in the slats to relieve the boredom and bring a girl back to reality But of making shoes she knew nothing nor wished to Brian Hookey made them at the forge behind his barn and hostelry however Susan easily picked out four new ones of the right size enjoying the smell of horseflesh and fresh hay as she did Fresh paint too Hockeys Stable  Smithy looked very well indeed Glancing up she saw not so much as a single hole in the barn roof Times had been good for Hookey it seemed He wrote the new shoes up on a beam still wearing his blacksmiths apron and squinting horribly out of one eye at his own figures When Susan began to speak haltingly to him about payment he laughed told her he knew shed settle her accounts as soon as she could gods bless her yes Sides they werent any of them going anywhere were they Nawp nawp All the time gently propelling her through the fragrant smells of hay and horses toward the door He would not have treated even so small a matter as four iron shoes in such a carefree manner a year ago but now she was Mayor Thorins good friend and things had changed The afternoon sunlight was dazzling after the dimness of Hockeys barn and she was momentarily blinded groping forward toward the street with the leather bag bouncing on her hip and the shoes clashing softly inside She had just a moment to register a shape looming in the brightness and then it thumped into her hard enough to rattle her teeth and make Felicias new shoes clang She would have fallen but for strong hands that quickly reached out and grasped her shoulders By then her eyes were adjusting and she saw with dismay and amusement that the young man who had almost knocked her sprawling into the dirt was one of Wills friends  Richard Stockworth Oh sai your pardon he said brushing the arms of her dress as if he had knocked her over Are you well Are you quite well Quite well she said smiling Please dont apologize She felt a sudden wild impulse to stand on tiptoe and kiss his mouth and say Give that to Will and tell him to never mind what I said Tell him there are a thousand more where that came from Tell him to come and get every one Instead she fixed on a comic image this Richard Stockworth smacking Will full on the mouth and saying it was from Susan Delgado She began to giggle She put her hands to her mouth but it did no good Sai Stockworth smiled back at her    tentatively cautiously He probably thinks Im mad    and I am I am Good day Mr Stockworth she said and passed on before she could embarrass herself further Good day Susan Delgado he called in return She looked back once when she was fifty yards or so farther up the street but he was already gone Not into Hockeys though of that she was quite sure She wondered what Mr Stockworth had been doing at that end of town to begin with Half an hour later as she took the new iron from her das shoebag she found out There was a folded scrap of paper tucked between two of the shoes and even before she unfolded it she understood that her collision with Mr Stockworth hadnt been an accident She recognized Wills handwriting at once from the note in the bouquet Susan Can you meet me at Citgo this evening or tomorrow evening Very important Has to do with what we discussed before Please W PS Best you bum this note She burned it at once and as she watched the flames first flash up and then die down she murmured over and over the one word in it which had struck her the hardest Please  She and Aunt Cord ate a simple silent evening meal  bread and soup  and when it was done Susan rode Felicia out to the Drop and watched the sun go down She would not be meeting him this evening no She already owed too much sorrow to impulsive unthinking behavior But tomorrow Why Citgo Has to do with what we discussed before Yes probably She did not doubt his honor although she had much come to wonder if he and his friends were who they said they were He probably did want to see her for some reason which bore on his mission although how the oilpatch could have anything to do with too many horses on the Drop she did not know but there was something between them now something sweet and dangerous They might start off talking but would likely end up kissing  and kissing would just be the start Knowing didnt change feeling though she wanted to see him Needed to see him So she sat astride her new horse  another of Hart Thorins paymentsinadvance on her virginity  and watched the sun swell and turn red in the west She listened to the faint grumble of the thinny and for the first time in her sixteen years was truly torn by indecision All she wanted stood against all she believed of honor and her mind roared with conflict Around all like a rising wind around an unstable house she felt the idea of ka growing Yet to give over ones honor for that reason was so easy wasnt it To excuse the fall of virtue by invoking allpowerful ka It was soft thinking Susan felt as blind as shed been when leaving the darkness of Brian Hockeys bam for the brightness of the street At one point she cried silently in frustration without even being aware of it and pervading her every effort to think clearly and rationally was her desire to kiss him again and to feel his hand cupping her breast She had never been a religious girl had little faith in the dim gods of MidWorld so at the last of it with the sun gone and the sky above its point of exit going from red to purple she tried to pray to her father And an answer came although whether from him or from her own heart she didnt know Let ka mind itself the voice in her mind said It will anyway it always does If ka should overrule your honor so it will be in the meantime Susan theres no one to mind it but yourself Let ka go and mind the virtue of your promise hard as that may be All right she said In her current state she discovered that any decision  even one that would cost her another chance to see Will  was a relief Ill honor my promise Ka can take care of itself In the gathering shadows she clucked sidemouth to Felicia and turned for home  The next day was Sanday the traditional cowboys day of rest Rolands little band took this day off as well Its fair enough that we should Cuthbert said since we dont know what the hell were doing in the first place On this particular Sanday  their sixth since coming to Hambry  Cuthbert was in the upper market lower market was cheaper by and large but too fishysmelling for his liking looking at brightly colored scrapes and trying not to cry For his mother had a serape it was a great favorite others and thinking of how she would ride out sometimes with it flowing back from her shoulders had filled him with homesickness so strong it was savage Arthur Heath Rolands kamai missing his mama so badly his eyes were wet It was a joke worthy of well worthy of Cuthbert Allgood As he stood so looking at the serapes and a hanging rack of dolina blankets with his hands clasped behind his back like a patron in an art gallery and blinking back tears all the while there came a light tap on his shoulder He turned and there was the girl with the blonde hair Cuthbert wasnt surprised that Roland was smitten with her She was nothing short of breathtaking even dressed in jeans and a farmshirt Her hair was tied back with a series of rough rawhide hanks and she had eyes of the brightest gray Cuthbert had ever seen Cuthbert thought it was a wonder that Roland had been able to continue with any other aspect of his life at all even down to the washing of his teeth Certainly she came with a cure for Cuthbert sentimental thoughts of his mother disappeared in an instant Sai he said It was all he could manage at least to start with She nodded and held out what the folk of Mejis called a corvette  little packet was the literal definition little purse was the practical one These small leather accessories big enough for a few coins but not much more were more often carried by ladies than gentlemen although that was not a hardandfast rule of fashion Ye dropped this cully she said Nay thankeesai This one well might have been the property of a man  plain black leather and unadorned by foofraws  but he had never seen it before Never carried a corvette for that matter Its yours she said and her eyes were now so intense that her gaze felt hot on his skin He should have understood at once but he had been blinded by her unexpected appearance Also he admitted by her cleverness You somehow didnt expect cleverness from a girl this beautiful beautiful girls did not as a rule have to be clever So far as Bert could tell all beautiful girls had to do was wake up in the morning It is Oh aye he said almost snatching the little purse from her He could feel a foolish grin overspreading his face Now that you mention it sai   Susan Her eyes were grave and watchful above her smile Let me be Susan to you I pray With pleasure I cry your pardon Susan its just that my mind and memory realizing its Sanday have joined hands and gone off on holiday together  eloped you might say  and left me temporarily without a brain in my head He might well have rattled on like that for another hour he had before to that both Roland and Alain could testify but she stopped him with the easy briskness of an older sister I can easily believe ye havenocontrol over yer mind Mr Heath  or the tongue hung below it  but perhaps yell take better care of yer purse in the future Good day She was gone before he could get another word out  Bert found Roland where he so often was these days out on the part of the Drop that was called Town Lookout by many of the locals It gave a fair view of Hambry dreaming away its Sanday afternoon in a blue haze but Cuthbert rather doubted the Hambry view was what drew his oldest friend back here time after time He thought that its view of the Delgado house was the more likely reason This day Roland was with Alain neither of them saying a word Cuthbert had no trouble accepting the idea that some people could go long periods of time without talking to each other but he did not think he would ever understand it He came riding up to them at a gallop reached inside his shirt and pulled out the corvette From Susan Delgado She gave it to me in the upper market Shes beautiful and shes also as wily as a snake I say that with utmost admiration Rolands face filled with light and life When Cuthbert tossed him the corvette he caught it onehanded and pulled the lacetie with his teeth Inside where a travelling man would have kept his few scraps of money there was a single folded piece of paper Roland read this quickly the light going out of his eyes the smile fading off his mouth What does it say Alain asked Roland handed it to him and then went back to looking out at the Drop It wasnt until he saw the very real desolation in his friends eyes that Cuthbert fully realized how far into Rolands life  and hence into all their lives  Susan Delgado had come Alain handed him the note It was only a single line two sentences Its best we dont meet Im sorry Cuthbert read it twice as if rereading might change it then handed it back to Roland Roland put the note back into the corvette tied the lace and then tucked the little purse into his own shirt Cuthbert hated silence worse than danger it was danger to his mind but every conversational opening he tried in his mind seemed callow and unfeeling given the look on his friends face It was as if Roland had been poisoned Cuthbert was disgusted at the thought of that lovely young girl bumping hips with the long and bony Mayor of Hambry but the look on Rolands face now called up stronger emotions For that he could hate her At last Alain spoke up almost timidly And now Roland Shall we have a hunt out there at the oilpatch without her Cuthbert admired that Upon first meeting him many people dismissed Alain Johns as something of a dullard That was very far from the truth Now in a diplomatic way Cuthbert could never have matched he had pointed out that Rolands unhappy first experience with love did not change their responsibilities And Roland responded raising himself off the saddlehorn and sitting up straight The strong golden light of that summers afternoon lit his face in harsh contrasts and for a moment that face was haunted by the ghost of the man he would become Cuthbert saw that ghost and shivered  not knowing what he saw only knowing that it was awful The Big Coffin Hunters he said Did you see them in town Jonas and Reynolds Cuthbert answered Still no sign of Depape I think Jonas must have choked him and thrown him over the sea cliffs in a fit of pique after that night in the bar Roland shook his head Jonas needs the men he trusts too much to waste them  hes as far out on thin ice as we are No Depapes just been sent off for awhile Sent where Alain asked Where hell have to shit in the bushes and sleep in the rain if the weathers bad Roland laughed shortly without much humor Jonas has got Depape running our backtrail more likely than not Alain grunted softly in surprise that wasnt really surprise Roland sat easily astride Rusher looking out over the dreamy depths of land at the grazing horses With one hand he unconsciously rubbed the corvette he had tucked into his shirt At last he looked around at them again Well wait a bit longer he said Perhaps shell change her mind Roland   Alain began and his tone was deadly in its gentleness Roland raised his hands before Alain could go on Doubt me not Alain  I speak as my fathers son All right Alain reached out and briefly gripped Rolands shoulder As for Cuthbert he reserved judgment Roland might or might not be acting as his fathers son Cuthbert guessed that at this point Roland hardly knew his own mind at all Do you remember what Cort used to say was the primary weakness of maggots such as us Roland asked with a trace of a smile  You run without consideration and fall in a hole  Alain quoted in a gruff imitation that made Cuthbert laugh aloud Rolands smile broadened a touch Aye Theyre words I mean to remember boys Ill not upset this cart in order to see whats in it  not unless theres no other choice Susan may come around yet given time to think I believe she would have agreed to meet me already if not for  other matters between us He paused and for a little while there was quiet among them I wish our fathers hadnt sent us Alain said at last although it was Rolands father who had sent them and all three knew it Were too young for matters such as these Too young by years We did all right that night in the Rest Cuthbert said That was training not guile  and they didnt take us seriously That wont happen again They wouldnt have sent us  not my father not yours  if theyd known what wed find Roland said But now weve found it and now were for it Yes Alain and Cuthbert nodded They were for it all right  there no longer seemed any doubt of that In any case its too late to worry about it now Well wait and hope for Susan Id rather not go near Citgo without someone from Hambry who knows the lay of the place  but if Depape comes back well have to take our chance God knows what he may find out or what stories he may invent to please Jonas or what Jonas may do after they palaver There may be shooting After all this creeping around Id almost welcome it Cuthbert said Will you send her another note Will Dearborn Alain asked Roland thought about it Cuthbert laid an interior bet with himself on which way Roland would go And lost No he said at last Well have to give her time hard as that is And hope her curiosity will bring her around With that he turned Rusher toward the abandoned bunkhouse which now served them as home Cuthbert and Alain followed  Susan worked herself hard the rest of that Sanday mucking out the stables carrying water washing down all the steps Aunt Cord watched all this in silence her expression one of mingled doubt and amazement Susan cared not a bit for how her aunt looked  she wanted only to exhaust herself and avoid another sleepless night It was over Will would know it as well now and that was to the good Let done be done Are ye daft girl was all Aunt Cord asked her as Susan dumped her last pail of dirty rinsewater behind the kitchen Its Sanday Not daft a bit she replied shortly without looking around She accomplished the first half of her aim going to bed just after moonrise with tired arms aching legs and a throbbing back  but sleep still did not come She lay in bed wideeyed and unhappy The hours passed the moon set and still Susan couldnt sleep She looked into the dark and wondered if there was any possibility even the slightest that her father had been murdered To stop his mouth to close his eyes Finally she reached the conclusion Roland had already come to if there had been no attraction for her in those eyes of his or the touch of his hands and lips she would have agreed in a flash to the meeting he wanted If only to set her troubled mind to rest At this realization relief overspread her and she was able to sleep  Late the next afternoon while Roland and his friends were at fives in the Travellers Rest cold beef sandwiches and gallons of white iced tea  not as good as that made by Deputy Daves wife but not bad Sheemie came in from outside where he had been watering his flowers He was wearing his pink sombrero and a wide grin In one hand he held a little packet Hello there you Little Coffin Hunters he cried cheerfully and made a bow which was an amusingly good imitation of their own Cuthbert particularly enjoyed seeing such a bow done in gardening sandals How be you Well Im hoping so I do Right as rainbarrels Cuthbert said but none of us enjoys being called Little Coffin Hunters so maybe you could just play soft on that all right Aye Sheemie said as cheerful as ever Aye Mr Arthur Heath good fella who saved my life He paused and looked puzzled for a moment as if unable to remember why he had approached them in the first place Then his eyes cleared his grin shone out and he held the packet out to Roland For you Will Dearborn Really What is it Seeds So they are From you Sheemie Oh no Roland took the packet  just an envelope which had been folded over and sealed There was nothing written on the front or back and the tips of his fingers felt no seeds within Who from then Cant remember said Sheemie who then cast his eyes aside His brains had been stirred just enough Roland reflected so that he would never be unhappy for long and would never be able to lie at all Then his eyes hopeful and timid came back to Rolands I remember what I was supposed to say to you though Aye Then say it Sheemie Speaking as one who recites a painfully memorized line both proud and nervous he said These are the seeds you scattered on the Drop Rolands eyes blazed so fiercely that Sheemie stumbled back a step He gave his sombrero a quick tug turned and hurried back to the safety of his flowers He liked Will Dearborn and Wills friends especially Mr Arthur Heath who sometimes said things that made Sheemie laugh fit to split but in that moment he saw something in Willsais eyes that frightened him badly In that instant he understood that Will was as much a killer as the one in the cloak or the one who had wanted Sheemie to lick his boots clean or old whitehaired Jonas with the trembly voice As bad as them or even worse  Roland slipped the seedpacket into his shirt and didnt open it until the three of them were back on the porch of the Bar K In the distance the thinny grumbled making their horses twitch their ears nervously Well Cuthbert asked at last unable to restrain himself any longer Roland took the envelope from inside his shirt and tore it open As he did he reflected that Susan had known exactly what to say To a nicety The others bent in Alain mm his left and Cuthbert from his right as he unfolded the single scrap of paper Again he saw her simple neatly made writing the message not much longer than the previous one Very different in content however There is an orange grove a mile off the road on the town side of Citgo Meet me there at moonrise Come alone S And below that printed in emphatic little letters burn this Well keep a lookout Alain said Roland nodded Aye But from a distance Then he burned the note  The orange grove was a neatly kept rectangle of about a dozen rows at the end of a partly overgrown carttrack Roland arrived there after dark but still a good half hour before the rapidly thinning Peddler would haul himself over the horizon once more As the boy wandered along one of the rows listening to the somehow skeletal sounds from the oilpatch to the north squealing pistons grinding gears thudding driveshafts he was struck by deep homesickness It was the fragile fragrance of orangeblossoms  a bright runner laid over the darker stench of oil  that brought it on This toy grove was nothing like the great apple orchards of New Canaan    except somehow it was There was the same feeling of dignity and civilization here of much time devoted to something not strictly necessary And in this case he suspected not very useful either Oranges grown this far north of the warm latitudes were probably almost as sour as lemons Still when the breeze stirred the trees the smell made him think of Gilead with bitter longing and for the first time he considered the possibility that he might never see home again  that he had become as much a wanderer as old Peddler Moon in the sky He heard her but not until she was almost on top of him  if shed been an enemy instead of a friend he might still have had time to draw and fire but it would have been close He was filled with admiration and as he saw her face in the starlight he felt his heart gladden She halted when he turned and merely looked at him her hands linked before her at her waist in a way that was sweetly and unconsciously childlike He took a step toward her and they came up in what he took for alarm He stopped confused But he had misread her gesture in the chancy light She could have stopped then but chose not to She stepped toward him deliberately a tall young woman in a split riding skirt and plain black boots Her sombrero hung down on her back against the bound rope of her hair Will Dearborn we are met both fair and ill she said in a trembling voice and then he was kissing her they burned against one another as the Peddler rose in the famine of its last quarter  Inside her lonely hut high on the Coos Rhea sat at her kitchen table bent over the glass the Big Coffin Hunters had brought her a month and a half ago Her face was bathed in its pink glow and no one would have mistaken it for the face of a girl any longer She had extraordinary vitality and it had carried her for many years only the longestlived residents of Hambry had any idea of how old Rhea of the Coos actually was and they only the vaguest but the glass was finally sapping it  sucking it out of her as a vampire sucks blood Behind her the huts larger room was even dingier and more cluttered than usual These days she had no time for even a pretense of cleaning the glass ball took up all her time When she wasnt looking into it she was thinking of looking into it  and oh Such things she had seen Ermot twined around one of her scrawny legs hissing with agitation but she barely noticed him Instead she bent even closer into the balls poison pink glow enchanted by what she saw there It was the girl who had come to her to be proved honest and the young man she had seen the first time shed looked into the ball The one she had mistaken for a gunslinger until she had realized his youth The foolish girl who had come to Rhea singing and left in a more proper silence had proved honest and might well be honest yet certainly she kissed and touched the boy with a virgins mingled greed and timidity but she wouldnt be honest much longer if they kept on the way they were going And wouldnt Hart Thorin be in for a surprise when he took his supposedly pure young gilly to bed There were ways to fool men about that men practically begged to be fooled about that a thimble of pigs blood would serve nicely but she wouldnt know that Oh this was too good And to think she could watch Miss Haughty brought low right here in this wonderful glass Oh it was too good Too wonderful She leaned closer still the deep sockets of her eyes filling with pink fire Ermot sensing that she remained immune to his blandishments crawled disconsolately away across the floor in search of bugs Musty pranced away from him spitting feline curses his sixlegged shadow huge and misshapen on the firestruck wall  Roland sensed the moment rushing at them Somehow he managed to step away from her and she stepped back from him her eyes wide and her cheeks flushed  he could see that flush even in the light of the newly risen moon His balls were throbbing His groin felt full of liquid lead She halfturned away from him and Roland saw that her sombrero had gone askew on her back He reached out one trembling hand and straightened it She clasped his fingers in a brief but strong grip then bent to pick up her riding gloves which she had stripped off in her need to touch him skin to skin When she stood again the wash of blood abruptly left her face and she reeled But for his hands on her shoulders steadying her she might have fallen She turned toward him eyes rueful What are we to do Oh Will what are we to do The best we can he said As we both always have As our fathers taught us This is mad Roland who had never felt anything so sane in his life  even the deep ache in his groin felt sane and right  said nothing Do ye know how dangerous tis she asked and went on before he could reply Aye ye do I can see ye do If we were seen together at all twould be serious To be seen as we just were   She shivered He reached for her and she stepped back Best ye dont Will If ye do wont be nothing done between us but spooning Unless that was your intention You know it wasnt She nodded Have ye set your friends to watch Aye he said and then his face opened in that unexpected smile she loved so well But not where they can watch us Thank the gods for that she said and laughed rather distractedly Then she stepped closer to him so close that he was hard put not to take her in his arms again She looked curiously up into his face Who are you really Will Almost who I say I am Thats the joke of this Susan My friends and I werent sent here because we were drunk and belling but we werent sent here to uncover any fell plot or secret conspiracy either We were just boys to be put out of the way in a time of danger All thats happened since   He shook his head to show how helpless he felt and Susan thought again of her father saying ka was like a wind  when it came it might take your chickens your house your bam Even your life And is Will Dearborn your real name He shrugged One names as good as another I wot if the heart that answers to it is true Susan you were at Mayors House today for my friend Richard saw you ride up   Aye fittings she said For I am to be this years Reaping Girl  its Harts choice nothing I ever would have had on my own mark I say it A lot of foolishness and hard on Olive as well I warrant You will make the most beautiful ReapGirl that ever was he said and the clear sincerity in his voice made her tingle with pleasure her cheeks grew warm again There were five changes of costume for the Reaping Girl between the noon feast and the bonfire at dusk each more elaborate than the last in Gilead there would have been nine in that way Susan didnt know how lucky she was and she would have worn all five happily for Will had he been the Reaping Lad This years Lad was Jamie McCann a pallid and wheyfaced standin for Hart Thorin who was approximately forty years too old and gray for the job Even more happily would she have worn the sixth  a silvery shift with wispthin straps and a hem that stopped high on her thighs This was a costume no one but Maria her maid Conchetta her seamstress and Hart Thorin would ever see It was the one she would be wearing when she went to the old mans couch as his gilly after the feast was over When you were up there did you see the ones who call themselves the Big Coffin Hunters I saw Jonas and the one with the cloak standing together in the courtyard and talking she said Not Depape The redhead She shook her head Do you know the game Castles Susan Aye My father showed me when I was small Then you know how the red pieces stand at one end of the board and the white at the other How they come around the Hillocks and creep toward each other setting screens for cover Whats going on here in HamDry is very like that And as in the game it has now become a question of who will break cover first Do you understand She nodded at once In the game the first one around his Hillock is vulnerable In life too Always But sometimes even staying in cover is difficult My friends and I have counted nearly everything we dare count To count the rest   The horses on the Drop for instance Aye just so To count them would be to break cover Or the oxen we know about   Her eyebrows shot up There are no oxen in Hambry Ye must be mistaken about that No mistake Where The Rocking H Now her eyebrows drew back down and knitted in a thoughtful frown Thats Laslo Rimers place Aye  Kimbas brother Nor are those the only treasures hidden away in Hambry these days There are extra wagons extra tack hidden in barns belonging to members of the Horsemens Association extra caches of feed   Will no Yes All that and more But to count them  to be seen counting them  is to break cover To risk being Castled Our recent days have been pretty nightmarish  we try to look profitably busy without moving over to the Drop side of Hambry where most of the danger lies Its harder and harder to do Then we received a message   A message How From whom Best you not know those things I think But its led us to believe that some of the answers were looking for may be at Citgo Will dye think that whats out here may help me to know more about what happened to my da I dont know Its possible I suppose but not likely All I know for sure is that I finally have a chance to count something that matters and not be seen doing it His blood had cooled enough for him to hold out his hand to her Susans had cooled enough for her to take it in good confidence She had put her glove back on again however Better safe than sorry Come on she said I know a path  In the moons pale halflight Susan led him out of the orange grove and toward the thump and squeak of the oilpatch Those sounds made Rolands back prickle made him wish for one of the guns hidden under the bunkhouse floorboards back at the Bar K Ye can trust me Will but that doesnt mean Ill be much help to ye she said in a voice just a notch above a whisper Ive been within hearing distance of Citgo my whole life but I could count the number of times Ive actually been in it on the fingers of both hands so I could The first two or three were on dares from my friends And then With my da He were always interested in the Old People and my Aunt Cord always said hed come to a bad end meddling in their leavings She swallowed hard And he did come to a bad end although I doubt it were the Old People responsible Poor Da They had reached a smoothwire fence Beyond it the gantries of the oil wells stood against the sky like sentinels the size of Lord Perth How many had she said were still working Nineteen he thought The sound of them was ghastly  the sound of monsters being choked to death Of course it was the kind of place that kids dared each other to go into a kind of openair haunted house He held two of the wires apart so she could slip between them and she did the same for him As he passed through he saw a line of white porcelain cylinders marching down the post closest to him A fencewire went through each You understand what these are Were he asked Susan tapping one of the cylinders Aye When there was electricity some went through here She paused then added shyly Its how I feel when you touch me He kissed her cheek just below her ear She shivered and pressed a hand briefly against his check before drawing away I hope your friends will watch well They will Is there a signal The whistle of the nighthawk Lets hope we dont hear it Aye be it so She took his hand and drew him into the oilpatch  The first time the gasjet flared ahead of them Will spat a curse under his breath an obscenely energetic one she hadnt heard since her father died and dropped the hand not holding hers to his belt Be easy Its only the candle The gaspipe He relaxed slowly That they use dont they Aye To run a few machines  little more than toys they are To make ice mostly I had some the day we met the Sheriff When the flare licked out again  bright yellow with a bluish core  he didnt jump He glanced at the three gasstorage tanks behind what Hambryfolk called the candle without much interest Nearby was a stack of rusty canisters in which the gas could be bottled and carried Youve seen such before she asked He nodded The Inner Baronies must be very strange and wonderful Susan said  Im beginning to think theyre no stranger than those of the Outer Arc he said turning slowly He pointed Whats yon building down there Left over from the Old People Aye To the east of Citgo the ground dropped sharply down a thickly wooded slope with a lane cut through the middle of it  this lane was as clear in the moonlight as a part in hair Not far from the bottom of the slope was a crumbling building surrounded by rubble The tumbleandstrew was the detritus of many fallen smokestacks  that much could be extrapolated from the one which still stood Whatever else the Old People had done they had made lots of smoke There were useful things in there when my da was a child she said Paper and such  even a few inkwriters that would still work  for a little while at least If you shook them hard She pointed to the left of the building where there was a vast square of crumbled paving and a few rusting hulks that had been the Old Peoples weird horseless mode of travel Once there were things over there that looked like the gasstorage tanks only much much larger Like huge silver cans they were They didnt rust like those that are left I cant think what became of them unless someone hauled them off for water storage I never would Twould be unlucky even if they werent contaminated She turned her face up to his and he kissed her mouth in the moonlight Oh Will What a pity this is for you What a pity for both of us he said and then passed between them one of those long and aching looks of which only teenagers are capable They looked away at last and walked on again handinhand She couldnt decide which frightened her more  the few derricks that were still pumping or those dozens which had fallen silent One thing she knew for sure was that no power on the face of the earth could have gotten her within the fence of this place without a friend close beside her The pumps wheezed every now and then a cylinder screamed like someone being stabbed at periodic intervals the candle would fire off with a sound like dragons breath throwing their shadows out long in front of them Susan kept her ears pitched for the nighthawks piercing twonote whistle and heard nothing They came to a wide lane  what had once undoubtedly been a maintenance road  that split the oilpatch in two Running down the center was a steel pipe with rusting joints It lay in a deep concrete trough with the upper arc of its rusty circumference protruding above ground level Whats this he asked The pipe that took the oil to yon building I reckon It means nothing tis been dry for years He dropped to one knee slid his hand carefully into the space between the concrete sleeve and the pipes rusty side She watched him nervously biting her lip to keep herself from saying something which would surely come out sounding weak or womanish What if there were biting spiders down there in the forgotten dark Or what if his hand got stuck What would they do then Of that latter there had been no chance she saw when he pulled his hand free It was slick and black with oil Dry for years he asked with a little smile She could only shake her head bewildered  They followed the pipe toward a place where a rotten gate barred the road The pipe she could now see oil bleeding out of its old joints even in the weak moonlight ducked under the gate they went over it She thought his hands rather too intimate for polite company in their helping and rejoiced at each touch If he doesnt stop the top of my head will explode like the candle  she thought and laughed Susan  Tis nothing Will only nerves Another of those long glances passed between them as they stood on the far side of the gate and then they went down the hill together As they walked she noticed an odd thing many of the pines had been stripped of their lower branches The hatchet marks and scabs of pine resin were clear in the moonlight and looked new She pointed this out to Will who nodded but said nothing At the bottom of the hill the pipe rose out of the ground and supported on a series of rusty steel cradles ran about seventy yards toward the abandoned building before stopping with the ragged suddenness of a battlefield amputation Below this stopping point was what looked like a shallow lake of drying tacky oil That it had been there for awhile Susan could tell from the numerous corpses of birds she could see scattered across it  they had come down to investigate become stuck and stayed to die in what must have been an unpleasantly leisurely fashion She stared at this with wide uncomprehending eyes until Will tapped her on the leg He had hunkered down She joined him kneetoknee and followed the sweeping movement of his finger with growing disbelief and confusion There were tracks here Very big ones Only one thing could have made them Oxen she said Aye They came from there He pointed at the place where the pipe ended And they go   He turned on the soles of his boots still hunkered and pointed back toward the slope where the woods started Now that he pointed them out she easily saw what she should have seen at once horsemans daughter that she was A perfunctory effort had been made to hide the tracks and the churnedup ground where something heavy had been dragged or rolled Time had smoothed away more of the mess but the marks were still clear She even thought she knew what the oxen had been dragging and she could see that Will knew as well The tracks split off from the end of the pipe in two arcs Susan and Will Dearborn followed the righthand one She wasnt surprised to see ruts mingled in with the tracks of the oxen They were shallow  it had been a dry summer by and large and the ground was nearly as hard as concrete  but they were there To still be able to see them at all meant that some goodly amount of weight had been moved And aye of course why else would oxen be needed Look Will said as they neared the hem of forest at the foot of the slope She finally saw what had caught his attention but she had to get down on her hands and knees to do it  how sharp his eyes were Almost supernaturally so There were boottracks here Not fresh but they were a lot newer than the tracks of the oxen and the wheelruts This was the one with the cape he said indicating a clear pair of tracks Reynolds Will Thee cant know it He looked surprised then laughed Sure I can He walks with one foot turned in a little  the left foot And here it is He stirred the air over the tracks with the tip of his finger then laughed again at the way she was looking at him  Tisnt sorcery Susan daughter of Patrick only trailcraft How do ye know so much so young she asked Who are ye Will He stood up and looked down into her eyes He didnt have to look far she was tall for a girl My names not Will but Roland he said And now Ive put my life in your hands That I dont mind but mayhap Ive put your own life at risk as well You must keep it a dead secret Roland she said wonderingly Tasting it Aye Which do you like better Your real one she said at once  Tis a noble name so it is He grinned relieved and this was the grin that made him look young again She raised herself on her toes and put her lips on his The kiss which was chaste and closemouthed to begin with bloomed like a flower became open and slow and humid She felt his tongue touch her lower lip and met it shyly at first with her own His hands covered her back then slipped around to her front He touched her breasts also shy to begin with then slid his palms up their lower slopes to their tips He uttered a small moaning sigh directly into her mouth And as he drew her closer and began to trail kisses down her neck she felt the stone hardness of him below the buckle of his belt a slim warm length which exactly matched the melting she felt in the same place those two places were meant for each other as she was for him and he for her It was ka after all  ka like the wind and she would go with it willingly leaving all honor and promises behind She opened her mouth to tell him so and then a queer but utterly persuasive sensation enfolded her they were being watched It was ridiculous but it was there she even felt she knew who was watching She stepped back from Roland her booted heels rocking unsteadily on the halferoded oxen tracks Get out ye old bitch she breathed If ye be spying on us in some way I know not how get thee gone  On the hill of the Coos Rhea drew back from the glass spitting curses in a voice so low and harsh that she sounded like her own snake She didnt know what Susan had said  no sound came through the glass only sight  but she knew that the girl had sensed her And when she did all sight had been wiped out The glass had flashed a brilliant pink then had gone dark and none of the passes she made over it would serve to brighten it again Aye fine let it be so she said at last giving up She remembered the wretched prissy girl not so prissy with the young man though was she standing hypnotized in her doorway remembered what she had told the girl to do after she had lost her maidenhead and began to grin all her good humor restored For if she lost her maidenhead to this wandering boy instead of to Hart Thorin Lord High Mayor of Mejis the comedy would be even greater would it not Rhea sat in the shadows of her stinking hut and began to cackle  Roland stared at her wideeyed and as Susan explained about Rhea a little more fully she left out the humiliating final examinations which lay at the heart of proving honesty his desire cooled just enough for him to reassert control It had nothing to do with jeopardizing the position he and his friends were trying to maintain in Hambry or so he told himself and everything to do with maintaining Susans  her position was important her honor even more so I imagine it was your imagination he said when she had finished I think not With a touch of coolness Or conscience even At that she lowered her eyes and said nothing Susan I would not hurt you for the world And ye love me Still without looking up Aye I do Then its best you kiss and touch me no more  not tonight I cant stand it if ye do He nodded without speaking and held out his hand She took it and they walked on in the direction they had been going when they had been so sweetly distracted While they were still ten yards from the hem of the forest both saw the glimmer of metal despite the dense foliage  too dense she thought Too dense by far It was the pineboughs of course the ones which had been whacked from the trees on the slope What they had been interlaced to camouflage were the big silver cans now missing from the paved area The silver storage containers had been dragged over here  by the oxen presumably  and then concealed But why Roland inspected along the line of tangled pine branches then stopped and plucked several aside This created an opening like a doorway and he gestured her to go through Be sharp in your looks he said I doubt if theyve bothered to set traps or tripwires but tis always best to be careful Behind the camouflaging boughs the tankers had been as neatly lined up as toy soldiers at the end of the day and Susan at once saw one reason why they had been hidden they had been reequipped with wheels wellmade ones of solid oak which came as high as her chest Each had been rimmed with a thin iron strip The wheels were new so were the strips and the hubs had been custommade Susan knew only one blacksmith in Barony capable of such fine work Brian Hookey to whom she had gone for Felicias new shoes Brian Hookey who had smiled and clapped her on the shoulder like a compadre when she had come in with her das shoebag hanging on her hip Brian Hookey who had been one of Pat Delgados best friends She recalled looking around and thinking that times had been good for sai Hookey and of course she had been right Work in the blacksmithing line had been plentiful Hookey had been making lots of wheels and rims for one thing and someone must have been paying him to do it Eldred Jonas was one possibility Kimba Rimer an even better one Hart She simply couldnt believe that Hart had his mind  what little there was of it  fixed on other matters this summer There was a kind of rough path behind the tankers Roland walked slowly along it pacing like a preacher with his hands clasped at the small of his back reading the incomprehensible words writ upon the tankers rear decks citgo sunoco exxon conoco He paused once and read aloud haltingly Cleaner fuel for a better tomorrow He snorted softly Rot This is tomorrow Roland  Will I mean  what are they for  He didnt answer at first but turned and walked back down the line of bright steel cans Fourteen on this side of the mysteriously reactivated oilsupply pipe and she assumed a like number on the other As he walked he rapped his fist on the side of each The sound was dull and clunky They were full of oil from the Citgo oilpatch They were trigged quite some time ago I imagine he said I doubt if the Big Coffin Hunters did it all themselves but they no doubt oversaw it  first the fitting of the new wheels to replace the old rotten rubber ones then the filling They used the oxen to line them up here at the base of the hill because it was convenient As its convenient to let the extra horses run free out on the Drop Then when we came it seemed prudent to take the precaution of covering these up Stupid babies we might be but perhaps smart enough to wonder about twentyeight loaded oilcarts with new wheels So they came out here and covered them Jonas Reynolds and Depape Aye But why She took him by the arm and asked her question again What are they for  For Parson Roland said with a calm he didnt feel For the Good Man The Affiliation knows hes found a number of warmachines they come either from the Old People or from some other where Yet the Affiliation fears them not because they dont work Theyre silent Some feel Farson has gone mad to put his trust in such broken things but But mayhap theyre not broken Mayhap they only need this stuff And mayhap Farson knows it Roland nodded She touched the side of one of the tankers Her fingers came away oily She rubbed the tips together smelled them then bent and picked up a swatch of grass to wipe her hands This doesnt work in our machines Its been tried It clogs them Roland nodded again My fa  my folk in the Inner Crescent know that as well And count on it But if Farson has gone to this trouble  and split aside a troop of men to come and get these tankers as we have word he has done  he either knows a way to thin it to usefulness or he thinks he does If hes able to lure the forces of the Affiliation into a battle in some close location where rapid retreat is impossible and if he can use machineweapons like the ones that go on treads he could win more than a battle He could slaughter ten thousand horsemounted fighting men and win the war But surely yer fathers know this    Roland shook his head in frustration How much their fathers knew was one question What they made of what they knew was another What forces drove them  necessity fear the fantastic pride which had also been handed down father to son along the line of Arthur Eld  was yet a third He could only tell her his clearest surmise I think they darent wait much longer to strike Farson a mortal blow If they do the Affiliation will simply rot out from the inside And if that happens a good deal of MidWorld will go with it But    She paused biting her lip shaking her head Surely even Farson must know   understand  She looked up at him with wide eyes The ways of the Old People are the ways of death Everyone knows that so they do Roland of Gilead found himself remembering a cook named Hax dangling at the end of a rope while the rooks pecked up scattered breadcrumbs from beneath the dead mans feet Hax had died for Farson But before that he had poisoned children for Farson Death he said is what John Parsons all about  In the orchard again It seemed to the lovers for so they now were in all but the most physical sense that hours had passed but it had been no more than fortylive minutes Summers last moon diminished but still bright continued to shine above them She led him down one of the lanes to where she had tied her horse Pylon nodded his head and whickered softly at Roland He saw the horse had been rigged for silence  every buckle padded and the stirrups themselves wrapped in felt Then he turned to Susan Who can remember the pangs and sweetness of those early years We remember our first real love no more clearly than the illusions that caused us to rave during a high fever On that night and beneath that fading moon Roland Deschain and Susan Delgado were nearly torn apart by their desire for each other they floundered for what was right and ached with feelings that were both desperate and deep All of which is to say that they stepped toward each other stepped back looked into each others eyes with a kind of helpless fascination stepped forward again and stopped She remembered what he had said with a kind of horror that he would do anything for her but share her with another man She would not  perhaps could not  break her promise to Mayor Thorin and it seemed that Roland would not or could not break it for her And here was the most horrible thing of all strong as the wind of ka might be it appeared that honor and the promises they had made would prove stronger What will ye do now she asked through dry lips I dont know I must think and I must speak with my friends Will you have trouble with your aunt when you go home Will she want to know where youve been and what youve been doing Is it me youre concerned about or yourself and yer plans Willy He didnt respond only looked at her After a moment Susan dropped her eyes Im sorry that was cruel No shell not tax me I often ride at night although not often so far from the house She wont know how far youve ridden Nay And these days we tread carefully around each other Its like having two powder magazines in the same house She reached out her hands She had tucked her gloves into her belt and the fingers which grasped his fingers were cold Thisll have no good end she said in a whisper Dont say that Susan Aye I do I must But whatever comes I love thee Roland He took her in his arms and kissed her When he released her lips she put them to his ear and whispered If you love me then love me Make me break my promise For a long moment when her heart didnt beat there was no response from him and she allowed herself to hope Then he shook his head  only the one time but firmly Susan I cannot Is yer honor so much greater than yer professed love for me then Aye Then let it be so She pulled out of his arms beginning to cry ignoring his hand on her boot as she swung up into the saddle  his low call to wait as well She yanked free the slipknot with which Pylon had been tethered and turned him with one spurless foot Roland was still calling to her louder now but she flung Pylon into a gallop and away from him before her brief flare of rage could go out He would not take her used and her promise to Thorin had been made before she knew Roland walked the face of the earth That being so how dare he insist that the loss of honor and consequent shame be hers alone Later lying in her sleepless bed she would realize he had insisted nothing And she was not even clear of the orange grove before raising her left hand to the side of her face feeling the wetness there and realizing that he had been crying too  Roland rode the lanes outside town until well past moonset trying to get his roaring emotions under some kind of control He would wonder for awhile what he was going to do about their discovery at Citgo and then his thoughts would shift to Susan again Was he a fool for not taking her when she wanted to be taken For not sharing what she wanted to share If you love me then love me Those words had nearly torn him open Yet in the deep rooms of his heart rooms where the clearest voice was that of his father he felt he had not been wrong Nor was it just a matter of honor whatever she might think But let her think that if she would better she should hate him a little perhaps than realize how deep the danger was for both of them Around three o the clock as he was about to turn for the Bar K he heard the rapid drumming of hoofbeats on the main road approaching from the west Without thinking about why it seemed so important to do so Roland swung back in that direction then brought Rusher to a stop behind a high line of runtoriot hedges For nearly ten minutes the sound of the hoofbeats continued to swell  sound carried far in the deep quiet of early morning  and that was quite enough time for Roland to feel he knew who was riding toward Hambry hellforleather just two hours before dawn Nor was he mistaken The moon was down but he had no trouble even through the brambly interstices of the hedge recognizing Roy Depape By dawn the Big Coffin Hunters would be three again Roland turned Rusher back the way he had been heading and rode to rejoin his own friends The most important day of Susan Delgados life  the day upon which her life turned like a stone upon a pivot  came about two weeks after her moonlit tour of the oilpatch with Roland Since then she had seen him only half a dozen times always at a distance and they had raised their hands as passing acquaintances do when their errands bring them briefly into sight of one another Each time this happened she felt a pain as sharp as a knife twisting in her  and though it was no doubt cruel she hoped he felt the same twist of the knife If there was anything good about those two miserable weeks it was only that her great fear  that gossip might begin about herself and the young man who called himself Will Dearborn  subsided and she found herself actually sorry to feel it ebb Gossip There was nothing to gossip about Then on a day between the passing of the Peddlers Moon and the rise of the Huntress ka finally came and blew her away  house and barn and all It began with someone at the door  She had been finishing the washing  a light enough chore with only two women to do it for  when the knock came If its the ragman send him away ye mind Aunt Cord called from the other room where she was turning bed linen But it wasnt the ragman It was Maria her maid from Seafront looking woeful The second dress Susan was to wear on Reaping Day  the silk meant for luncheon at Mayors House and the Conversational afterward  was ruined Maria said and she was in hack because of it Would be sent back to Onnies Ford if she wasnt lucky and she the only support of her mother and father  oh it was hard much too hard so it was Could Susan come Please Susan was happy to come  was always happy to get out of the house these days and away from her aunts shrewish nagging voice The closer Reaping came the less she and Aunt Cord could abide each other it seemed They took Pylon who was happy enough to carry two girls riding double through the morning cool and Marias story was quickly told Susan understood almost at once that Marias position at Seafront wasnt really in much jeopardy the little darkhaired maid had simply been using her innate and rather charming penchant for creating drama out of what was really not very dramatic at all The second Reaping dress which Susan thought of as Blue Dress With Beads the first her breakfast dress was White Dress With High Waist and Puffed Sleeves had been kept apart from the others  it needed a bit of work yet  and something had gotten into the firstfloor sewing room and gnawed it pretty much to rags If this had been the costume she was to wear to the bonfire lighting or the one she was to wear to the ballroom dance after the bonfire had been lit the matter would indeed have been serious But Blue Dress With Beads was essentially just a fancified day receiving dress and could easily be replaced in the two months between now and the Reap Only two Once  on the night the old witch had granted her her reprieve  it had seemed like eons before she would have to begin her bedservice to Mayor Thorin And now it was only two months She twisted in a kind of involuntary protest at the thought Mum Maria asked Susan wouldnt allow the girl to call her sai and Maria who seemed incapable of calling her mistress by her given name had settled on this compromise Susan found the term amusing given the fact that she was only sixteen and Maria herself probably just two or three years older Mum are you all right Just a crick in my back Maria thats all Aye I get those Fair bad they are Ive had three aunts whove died of the wasting disease and when I get those twinges Im always afeard that   What kind of animal chewed up Blue Dress Do ye know Maria leaned forward so she could speak confidentially into her mistresss ear as if they were in a crowded marketplace alley instead of on the road to Seafront Its put about that a raccoon got in through a window that us opened during the heat of the dayand was then forgot at days end but i had a good sniff of that room and Kimba Rimer did too when he came down to inspect Just before he sent me after you that was What did you smell Maria leaned close again and this time she actually whispered although there was no one on the road to overhear Dog farts There was a moment of thunderstruck silence and then Susan began to laugh She laughed until her stomach hurt and tears went streaming down her cheeks Are ye saying that WWWolf the Mayors own dddog  got into the downstairs seamstresss closet and chewed up my Conversational dd   But she couldnt finish She was simply laughing too hard Aye Maria said stoutly She seemed to find nothing unusual about Susans laughter    which was one of the things Susan loved about her But hes not to be blamed so I say for a dog will follow his natural instincts if the way is open for him to do so The downstairs maids   She broke off Youd not tell the Mayor or Kimba Rimer this I suppose Mum Maria Im shocked at you  ye play me cheap No Mum I play ye dear so I do but its always best to be safe All I meant to say was that on hot days the downstairs maids sometimes go into that sewing closet for their fives It lies directly in the shadow of the watchtower ye know and is the coolest room in the house  even cooler than the main receiving rooms Ill remember that Susan said She thought of holding the Luncheon and Conversational in the seamstresss beck beyond the kitchen when the great day came and began to giggle again Go on No more to say Mum Maria told her as if all else were too obvious for conversation The maids eat their cakes and leave the crumbs I reckon Wolf smelled em and this time the door was left open When the crumbs was gone he tried the dress For a second course like This time they laughed together  But she wasnt laughing when she came home Cordelia Delgado who thought the happiest day of her life would be the one when she finally saw her troublesome niece out the door and the annoying business other defloration finally over bolted out other chair and hurried to the kitchen window when she heard the gallop of approaching hoofs about two hours after Susan had left with that little scrap of a maid to have one of her dresses refitted She never doubted that it was Susan returning and she never doubted it was trouble In ordinary circumstances the silly twist would never gallop one of her beloved horses on a hot day She watched nervously drywashing her hands as Susan pulled Pylon up in a very unDelgadolike scrunch then dismounted in an unladylike leap Her braid had come half undone spraying that damned blonde hair that was her vanity and her curse in all directions Her skin was pale except for twin patches of color flaring high on her cheekbones Cordelia didnt like the look of those at all Pat had always flared in that same place when he was scared or angry She stood at the sink now biting her lips as well as working her hands Oh twould be so good to see the back of that troublesome she Ye havent made trouble have ye she whispered as Susan pulled the saddle from Pylons back and then led him toward the barn You better not have Miss Oh So Young and Pretty Not at this late date You better not have  When Susan came in twenty minutes later there was no sign of her aunts strain and rage Cordelia had put them away as one might store a dangerous weapon  a gun say  on a high closet shelf She was back in her rocker knitting and the face she turned to Susans entry had a surface serenity She watched the girl go to the sink pump cold water into the basin and then splash it on her face Instead of reaching for a towel to pat herself dry Susan only looked out the window with an expression that frightened Cordelia badly The girl no doubt fancied that look haunted and desperate to Cordelia it looked only childishly willful All right Susan she said in a calm modulated voice The girl would never know what a strain it was to achieve that tone let alone maintain it Unless she was faced with a willful teenager of her own one day that was Whats fashed thee so Susan turned to her  Cordelia Delgado just sitting there in her rocker calm as a stone In that moment Susan felt she could fly at her aunt and claw her thin selfrighteous face to strings screaming This is your fault Yours All yours She felt soiled  no that wasnt strong enough she felt filthy and nothing had really happened In a way that was the horror of it Nothing had really happened yet It shows was all she said Of course it does Cordelia replied Now tell me girl Has he been on thee Yes  no  no Aunt Cord sat in her chair knitting in her lap eyebrows raised waiting for more At last Susan told her what had happened speaking in a tone that was mostly flat  a little tremble intruded toward the end but that was all Aunt Cord began to feel a cautious sort of relief Perhaps more goosegirl nerves was all it came down to after all The substitute gown like all the substitutes hadnt been finished off there was too much else to do Maria had therefore turned Susan over to bladefaced Conchetta Morgenstem the chief seamstress who had led Susan into the downstairs sewing room without saying anything  if saved words were gold Susan had sometimes reflected Conchetta would be as rich as the Mayors sister was reputed to be Blue Dress With Beads was draped over a headless dressmakers dummy crouched beneath one low eave and although Susan could see ragged places on the hem and one small hole around to the back it was by no means the tattered ruin she had been expecting Can it not be saved she asked rather timidly No Conchetta said curtly Get out of those trousers girl Shirt too Susan did as she was bid standing barefoot in the cool little room with her arms crossed over her bosom   not that Conchetta had ever shown the slightest interest in what she had back or front above or below Blue Dress With Beads was to be replaced by Pink Dress With Applique it seemed Susan stepped into it raised the straps and stood patiently while Conchetta bent and measured and muttered sometimes using a bit of chalk to write numbers on a wallstone sometimes grabbing a swag of material and pulling it tighter against Susans hip or waist checking the look in the fulllength mirror on the far wall As always during this process Susan slipped away mentally allowing her mind to go where it wanted Where it wanted to go most frequently these days was into a daydream of riding along the Drop with Roland the two of them side by side finally stopping in a willow grove she knew that overlooked Hambry Creek Stand there still as you can Conchetta said curtly I be back Susan was hardly aware she was gone was hardly aware she was in Mayors House at all The part of her that really mattered wasnt there That part was in the willow grove with Roland She could smell the faint halfsweet halfacrid perfume of the trees and hear the quiet gossip of the stream as they lay down together forehead to forehead He traced the shape of her face with the palm of his hand before taking her in his arms   This daydream was so strong that at first Susan responded to the arms which curled around her waist from behind arching her back as they first caressed her stomach and then rose to cup her breasts Then she heard a kind of plowing snorting breath in her ear smelled tobacco and understood what was happening Not Roland touching her breasts but Hart Thorins long and skinny fingers She looked in the mirror and saw him looming over her left shoulder like an incubus His eyes were bulging there were big drops of sweat on his forehead in spite of the rooms coolness and his tongue was actually hanging out like a dogs on a hot day Revulsion rose in her throat like the taste of rotten food She tried to pull away and his hands tightened their hold pulling her against him His knuckles cracked obscenely and now she could feel the hard lump at the center of him At times over the last few weeks Susan had allowed herself to hope that when the time came Thorin would be incapable  that he would be able to make no iron at the forge She had heard this often happened to men when they got older The hard throbbing column which lay against her bottom disabused her of that wistful notion in a hurry She had managed at least a degree of diplomacy by simply putting her hands over his and attempting to draw them off her breasts instead of pulling away from him again Cordelia impassive not showing the great relief she felt at this Mayor Thorin  Hart  you mustnt  this is hardly the place and not yet the time  Rhea said   Balls to her and all witches His cultured politicians tones had been replaced by an accent as thick as that in the voice of any backcountry farmhand from Onnies Ford I must have something a bonbon aye so I must Balls to the witch I say Owlshit to er The smell of tobacco a thick reek around her head She thought that she would vomit if she had to smell it much longer Just stand still girl Stand still my temptation Mind me well Somehow she did There was even some distant part of her mind a part totally dedicated to selfpreservation that hoped he would mistake her shudders of revulsion for maidenly excitement He had drawn her tight against him hands working energetically on her breasts his respiration a stinky steamengine in her ear She stood back to him her eyes closed tears squeezing out from beneath the lids and through the fringes of her lashes It didnt take him long He rocked back and forth against her moaning like a man with stomach cramps At one point he licked the lobe of her ear and Susan thought her skin would crawl right off her body in its revulsion Finally thankfully she felt him begin to spasm against her Oh aye get out ye damned poison he said in a voice that was almost a squeal He pushed so hard she had to brace her hands against the wall to keep from being driven facefirst into it Then he at last stepped back For a moment Susan only stood as she was with her palms against the rough cold stone of the sewing room wall She could see Thorin in the mirror and in his image she saw the ordinary doom that was rushing at her the ordinary doom of which this was but a foretaste the end of girlhood the end of romance the end of dreams where she and Roland lay together in the willow grove with their foreheads touching The man in the mirror looked oddly like a boy himself one whos been up to something he wouldnt tell his mother about Just a tall and gangly lad with strange gray hair and narrow twitching shoulders and a wet spot on the front of his trousers Hart Thorin looked as if he didnt quite know where he was In that moment the lust was flushed out of his face but what replaced it was no better  that vacant confusion It was as if he were a bucket with a hole in the bottom no matter what you put in it or how much it always ran out before long He II do it again she thought and felt an immense tiredness creep over her Now that hes done it once he II do it every chance he gets likely From now on coming up here is going to be like    well    Like Castles Like playing at Castles Thorin looked at her a moment longer Slowly like a man in a dream he pulled the tail of his billowy white shirt out of his pants and let it drop around him like a skirt covering the wet spot His chin gleamed he had drooled in his excitement He seemed to feel this and wiped the wetness away with the heel of one hand looking at her with those empty eyes all the while Then some expression at last came into them and without another word he turned and left the room There was a little scuffling thud in the hall as he collided with someone out there Susan heard him mutter Sorry Sorry under his breath it was more apology than hed given her muttered or not and then Conchetta stepped back into the room The swatch of cloth shed gone after was draped around her shoulders like a stole She took in Susans pale face and tearstained cheeks at once Shell say nothing Susan thought None of them will just as none of them will lift a finger to help me off this stick Ive run myself on Ye sharpened it yourself gilly theyd say if I called for help and thatll be their excuse for leaving me to wriggle But Conchetta had surprised her Lifes hard missy so it is Best get used to it  Susans voice  dry by now pretty much stripped of emotion  at last ceased Aunt Cord put her knitting aside got up and put the kettle on for tea Ye dramatize Susan She spoke in a voice that strove to be both kind and wise and succeeded at neither Its a trait ye get from your Manchester side  half of them fancied themselves poets tother half fancied themselves painters and almost all of them spent their nights too drunk to tapdance He grabbed yer titties and gave yer a dryhump thats all Nothing to be so upset over Certainly nothing to lose sleep over How would you know Susan asked It was disrespectful but she was beyond caring She thought shed reached a point where she could bear anything from her aunt except that patronizing worldlywise tone of voice It stung like a fresh scrape Cordelia raised an eyebrow and spoke without rancor How ye do love to throw that up to me Aunt Cord the dry old stick Aunt Cord the spinster Aunt Cord the graying virgin Aye Well Miss Oh So Young and Pretty virgin I might be but I had a lover or two back when I was young    before the world moved on ye might say Mayhap one was the great Fran Lengyll And mayhap not Susan thought Fran Lengyll was her aunts senior by at least fifteen years perhaps as many as twentyfive Ive felt old Toms goat on my backside a time or two Susan Aye and on my frontside as well And were any of these lovers sixty with bad breath and knuckles that cracked when they squeezed your titties Aunt Did any of them try to push you through the nearest wall when old Tom began to wag his beard and say baabaabaa The rage she expected did not come What did was worse  an expression close to the look of emptiness she had seen on Thorins face in the mirror Deeds done Susan A smile shortlived and awful nickered like an eyelid on her aunts narrow face Deeds done aye In a kind of terror Susan cried My father would have hated this Hated it And hated you for allowing it to happen For encouraging it to happen Mayhap Aunt Cord said and the awful smile winked at her again Mayhap so And the only thing hed hate more The dishonor of a broken promise the shame of a faithless child He would want thee to go on with it Susan If thee would remember his face thee must go on with it Susan looked at her mouth drawn down in a trembling arc eyes filling with tears again Ive met someone I love That was what she would have told her if she could Dont you understand how that changes things Ive met someone I love But if Aunt Cord had been the sort of person to whom she could have said such a thing Susan would likely never have been impaled on this stick to begin with So she turned and stumbled from the house without saying anything her streaming eyes blurring her vision and filling the late summer world with rueful color  She rode with no conscious idea of where she was going yet some part of her must have had a very specific destination in mind because forty minutes after leaving her house she found herself approaching the very grove of willows she had been daydreaming about when Thorin had crept up behind her like some bad elf out of a gammers story It was blessedly cool in the willows Susan tied Felicia whom she had ridden out bareback to a branch then walked slowly across the little clearing which lay at the heart of the grove Here the stream passed and here she sat on the springy moss which carpeted the clearing Of course she had come here it was where she had brought all her secret griefs and joys since she had discovered the clearing at the age of eight or nine It was here she had come time and time again in the nearly endless days after her fathers death when it had seemed to her that the very world  her version of it at least  had ended with Pat Delgado It was only this clearing that had heard the full and painful measure of her grief to the stream she had spoken it and the stream had carried it away Now a fresh spate of tears took her She put her head on her knees and sobbed  loud unladylike sounds like the caw of squabbling crows In that moment she thought she would have given anything  everything  to have her father back for one minute to ask him if she must go on with this She wept above the brook and when she heard the sound of a snapping branch she started and looked back over her shoulder in terror and chagrin This was her secret place and she didnt want to be found here especially not when she was bawling like a kiddie who has fallen and bumped her head Another branch snapped Someone was here all right invading her secret place at the worst possible time Go away she screamed in a tearclotted voice she barely recognized Go away whoever ye are be decent and leave me alone But the figure  she could now see it  kept coming When she saw who it was she at first thought that Will Dearborn Roland she thought his real name is Roland must be a figment of her overstrained imagination She wasnt entirely sure he was real until he knelt and put his arms around her Then she hugged him with panicky tightness How did you know I was   Saw you riding across the Drop I was at a place where I go to think sometimes and I saw you I wouldnt have followed except I saw that you were riding bareback I thought something might be wrong Everythings wrong Deliberately with his eyes wide open and serious he began kissing her cheeks He had done it several times on both sides of her face before she realized he was kissing her tears away Then he took her by the shoulders and held her back from him so he could look into her eyes Say it again and I will Susan I dont know if thats a promise or a warning or both at the same time but say it again and I will There was no need to ask him what he meant She seemed to feel the ground move beneath her and later she would think that for the first and only time in her life she had actually felt ka a wind that came not from the sky but from the earth It has come to me after all she thought My ka for good or ill Roland Yes Susan She dropped her hand below his beltbuckle and grasped what was there her eyes never leaving his If you love me then love me Aye lady I will He unbuttoned his shirt made in a part of MidWorld she would never see and took her in his arms  Ka They helped each other with their clothes they lay naked in each others arms on summer moss as soft as the finest goosedown They lay with their foreheads touching as in her daydream and when he found his way into her she felt pain melt into sweetness like some wild and exotic herb that may only be tasted once in each lifetime She held that taste as long as she could until at last the sweetness overcame it and she gave in to that moaning deep in her throat and rubbing her forearms against the sides of his neck They made love in the willow grove questions of honor put aside promises broken without so much as a look back and at the end of it Susan discovered there was more than sweetness there was a kind of delirious clinching of the nerves that began in the part of her that had opened before him like a flower it began there and then filled her entire body She cried out again and again thinking there could not be so much pleasure in the mortal world she would die of it Roland added his voice to hers and the sound of water rushing over stones wrapped around both As she pulled him closer to her locking her ankles together behind his knees and covering his face with fierce kisses his going out rushed after hers as if trying to catch up So were lovers joined in the Barony of Mejis near the end of the last great age and the green moss beneath the place where her thighs joined turned a pretty red as her virginity passed so were they joined and so were they doomed Ka  They lay together in each others arms sharing afterglow kisses beneath Felicias mild gaze and Roland felt himself drowsing This was understandable  the strain on him that summer had been enormous and he had been sleeping badly Although he didnt know it then he would sleep badly for the rest of his life Roland Her voice distant Sweet as well Yes Will thee take care of me Yes I cant go to him when the time comes I can bear his touching and his little thefts  if I have you I can  but I cant go to him on Reap Night I dont know if Ive forgotten the face of my father or not but I cannot go lo Hart Thorins bed There are ways the loss of a girls virginity can be concealed I think but I wont use them I simply cannot go to his bed All right he said good And then as her eyes widened in startlement he looked around No one was there He looked back at Susan fully awake now What What is it I might already be carrying your child she said Has thee thought of that He hadnt Now he did A child Another link in the chain stretching hack into the dimness where Arthur Eld had led his gunslingers into battle with the great sword Excalibur raised above his head and the crown of AllWorld on his brow But never mind that what would his father think Ur Gabrielle to know she had become a grandmother A little smile had formed at the comers of his mouth but the thought of his mother drove it away He thought of the mark on her neck When his mother came to his mind these days he always thought of the mark hed seen on her neck when he came unexpected into her apartment And the small rueful smile on her face If you carry my child such is my good fortune he said And mine It was her turn to smile but it had a sad look to it all the same that smile Were too young I suppose Little more than kiddies ourselves He rolled onto his back and looked up at the blue sky What she said might be true but it didnt matter Truth was sometimes not the same as reality  this was one of the certainties that lived in the hollow cavey place at the center of his divided nature That he could rise above both and willingly embrace the insanity of romance was a gift from his mother All else in his nature was humorless    and perhaps more important without metaphor That they were too young to be parents What of that If he had planted a seed it would grow Whatever comes well do as we must And Ill always love you no matter what comes She smiled He said it as a man would state any dry fact sky is up earth is down water flows south Roland how old are you She was sometimes troubled by the idea that young as she herself was Roland was even younger When he was concentrating on something he could look so hard he frightened her When he smiled he looked not like a lover but a kid brother Older than I was when I came here he said Older by far And if I have to stay in sight of Jonas and his men another six months Ill be hobbling and needing a boost in the arse to get aboard my horse She grinned at that and he kissed her nose And theell take care of me Aye he said and grinned back at her Susan nodded then also turned on her back They lay that way hip to hip looking up at the sky She took his hand and placed it on her breast As he stroked the nipple with his thumb it raised its head grew hard and began to tingle This sensation slipped quickly down her body to the place that was still throbbing between her legs She squeezed her thighs together and was both delighted and dismayed to find that doing so only made matters worse Ye must take care of me she said in a low voice Ive pinned everything on you All else is cast aside Ill do my best he said Never doubt it But for now Susan you must go on as you have been Theres more time yet to pass I know that because Depape is back and will have told his tale but they still havent moved in any way against us Whatever he found out Jonas still thinks its in his interest to wait Thats apt to make him more dangerous when he does move but for now its still Castles But after the Reaping Bonfire  Thorin   Youll never go to his bed That you can count on I set my warrant on it A little shocked at her own boldness she reached below his waist Heres a warrant ye can set on me if ye would she said He would Could And did When it was over for Roland it had been even sweeter than the first time if that was possible he asked her That feeling you had out at Citgo Susan  of being watched Did you have it this time She looked at him long and thoughtfully I dont know My mind was in other places ye ken She touched him gently then laughed as he jumped  the nerves in the halfhard halfsoft place where her palm stroked were still very lively it seemed She took her hand away and looked up at the circle of sky above the grove So beautiful here she murmured and her eyes drifted closed Roland also felt himself drifting It was ironic he thought This time she hadnt had that sensation of being watched  but the second time he had Yet he would have sworn there was no one near this grove No matter The feeling megrim or reality was gone now He took Susans hand and felt her fingers slip naturally through his entwining He closed his eyes  All of this Rhea saw in the glass and wery interesting viewing it made aye wery interesting indeed But shed seen shagging before  sometimes with three or four or even more doing it all at the same time sometimes with partners who were not precisely alive  and the hokeypokey wasnt very interesting to her at her advanced age What she was interested in was what would come after the hokeypokey Is our business done the girl had asked Mayhap theres one more little thing Rhea had responded and then she told the impudent trull what to do Aye shed given the girl very clear instructions as the two of them stood in the hut doorway the Kissing Moon shining down on them as Susan Delgado slept the strange sleep and Rhea stroked her braid and whispered instructions in her ear Now would come the fulfillment of that interlude    and that was what she wanted to see not two babbies shagging each other like they were the first two on earth to discover how twas done Twice they did it with hardly a pause to natter in between she would have given a good deal to hear that natter too Rhea wasnt surprised at his young age she supposed the brat had enough spunkum in his sack to give her a weeks worth of doubles and from the way the little slut acted that might be to her taste Some of them discovered it and never wanted aught else this was one Rhea thought But lets see how sexy you feel in a few minutes you snippy bitch she thought and leaned deeper into the pulsing pink light thrown from the glass She could sometimes feel that light aching in the very bones of her face    but it was a good ache Aye wery good indeed They were at last done  for the time being at least They clasped hands and drifted off to sleep Now Rhea murmured Now my little one Be a good girl and do as ye were told As if hearing her Susans eyes opened  but there was nothing in them They woke and slept at the same time Rhea saw her gently pull her hand free of the boys She sat up bare breasts against bare thighs and looked around She got to her feet  That was when Musty the sixlegged cat jumped into Rheas lap waowing for either food or affection The old woman shrieked with surprise and the wizards glass at once went dark  puffed out like a candleflame in a gust of wind Rhea shrieked again this time with rage and seized the cat before it could flee She hurled it across the room into the fireplace That was as dead a hole as only a summer fireplace can be but when Rhea cast a bony misshapen hand at it a yellow gust of flame rose from the single halfcharred log lying in there Musty screamed and fled from the hearth with his eyes wide and his split tail smoking like an indifferently butted cigar Run aye Rhea spat after him Begone ye vile cusk She turned back to the glass and spread her hands over it thumb to thumb But although she concentrated with all her might willed until her heart was beating with a sick fury in her chest she could do no more than bring back the balls natural pink glow No images appeared This was bitterly disappointing but there was nothing to be done And in time she would be able to see the results with her own two natural eyes if she cared to go to town and do so Everybody would be able to see Her good humor restored Rhea returned the ball to its hiding place  Only moments before he would have sunk too deep in sleep to have heard it a warning bell went off in Rolands mind Perhaps it was the faint realization that her hand was no longer entwined with his perhaps it was raw intuition He could have ignored that faint bell and almost did but in the end his training was too strong He came up from the threshold of real sleep fighting his way back to clarity as a diver kicks for the surface of a quarry It was hard at first but became easier as he neared wakefulness his alarm grew He opened his eyes and looked to his left Susan was no longer there He sat up looked to his right and saw nothing above the cut of the stream  yet he felt that she was in that direction all the same Susan No response He got up looked at his pants and Cort  a visitor he never would have expected in such a romantic bower as this  spoke up gruffly in his mind No time maggot He walked naked to the bank and looked down Susan was there all right also naked her back to him She had unbraided her hair It hung loose gold almost all the way to the lyre other hips The chill air rising from the surface of the stream shivered the tips of it like mist She was down on one knee at the edge of the running water One arm was plunged into it almost to the elbow she searched for something it seemed Susan No answer And now a cold thought came to him Shes been infested by a demon While I slept heedless beside her shes been infested by a demon Yet he did not think he really believed that If there had been a demon near this clearing he would have felt it Likely both of them would have felt it the horses too But something was wrong with her She brought an object up from the streambed and held it before her eyes in her dripping hand A stone She examined it then tossed it back  plunk She reached in again head bent two sheafs of her hair now actually floating on the water the stream prankishly tugging them in the direction it flowed Susan No response She plucked another stone out of the stream This one was a triangular white quartz shattered into a shape that was almost like the head of a spear Susan tilted her head to the left and took a sheaf of her hair in her hand like a woman who means to comb out a nest of tangles But there was no comb only the rock with its sharp edge and for a moment longer Roland remained on the bank frozen with horror sure that she meant to cut her own throat out of shame and guilt over what theyd done In the weeks to come he was haunted by a clear knowledge if it had been her throat shed intended he wouldnt have been in time to stop her Then the paralysis broke and he hurled himself down the bank unmindful of the sharp stones that gouged the soles of his feet Before he reached her she had already used the edge of the quartz to cut off part of the golden tress she held Roland seized her wrist and pulled it back He could see her face clearly now What could have been mistaken for serenity from the top of the bank now looked like what it really was vacuity emptiness When he took hold of her the smoothness of her face was replaced by a dim and fretful smile her mouth quivered as if she felt distant pain and an almost formless sound of negation came from her mouth Nnnnnnnnn   Some of the hair she had cut off lay on her thigh like gold wire most had fallen into the stream and been carried away Susan pulled against Rolands hand trying to get the sharp edge back to her hair wanting to continue her mad barbering The two of them strove together like armwrestlers in a barroom contest And Susan was winning He was physically the stronger but not stronger than the enchantment which held her Little by little the white triangle of quartz moved back toward her hanging hair That frightening sound  Nnnnnnnnnn  kept drifting from her mouth Susan Stop it Wake up Nnnnnnnn   Her bare arm quivering visibly in the air the muscles bunched like hard little rocks And the quartz moving closer and closer to her hair her cheek the socket of her eye Without thinking about it  it was the way he always acted most successfully  Roland moved his face close to the side others giving up another four inches to the fist holding the stone in order to do it He put his lips against the cup of her ear and then clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth Clucked sidemouth in fact Susan jerked back from that sound which must have gone through her head like a spear Her eyelids fluttered rapidly and the pressure she was exerting against Rolands grip eased a little He took the chance and twisted her wrist OwOwwww The stone flew out of her opening hand and splashed into the water Susan gazed at him now fully awake her eyes filled with tears and bewilderment She was rubbing her wrist   which Roland thought was likely to swell Ye hurt me Roland Why did ye hurt m  She trailed off looking around Now not just her face but the whole set other body expressed bewilderment She moved to cover herself with her hands then realized they were still alone and dropped them to her sides She glanced over her shoulder at the footprints  all of them bare  leading down the bank How did I get down here she asked Did thee carry me after I fell asleep And why did thee hurt me Oh Roland I love thee  why did ye hurt me He picked up the strands of hair that still lay on her thigh and held them in front of her You had a stone with a sharp edge You were trying to cut yourself with it and you didnt want to stop I hurt you because I was scared Im just glad I didnt break your wrist  at least I dont think I did Roland took it and rotated it gently in either direction listening for the grate of small bones He heard nothing and the wrist turned freely As Susan watched stunned and confused he raised it to his lips and kissed the inner part above the delicate tracery of veins  Roland had tied Rusher just far enough into the willows so the big gelding could not be seen by anyone who happened to come riding along the Drop Be easy Roland said approaching Be easy a little longer goodheart Rusher stamped and whickered as if to say he could be easy until the end of the age if that was what were required Roland nipped open his saddlebag and took out the steel utensil that served as either a pot or a frypan depending on his needs He started away then turned back His bedroll was tied behind Pushers saddle he had planned to spend the night camped out on the Drop thinking There had been a lot to think about and now there was even more He pulled one of the rawhide ties reached inside the blankets and pulled out a small metal box This he opened with a tiny key he drew from around his neck Inside the box was a small square locket on a fine silver chain inside the locket was a linedrawing of his mother and a handful of extra shells  not quite a dozen He took one closed it in his fist and went back to Susan She looked at him with wide frightened eyes I dont remember anything after we made love the second time she said Only looking up at the sky and thinking how good I felt and going to sleep Oh Roland how bad does it look Not bad I should think but youll know better than I Here He dipped his cooker full of water and set it on the bank Susan bent over it apprehensively laying the hair on the left side of her head across her forearm then moving the arm slowly outward extending the tress in a band of bright gold She saw the ragged cut at once She examined it carefully then let it drop with a sigh more relieved than rueful I can hide it she said When its braided no one will know And after all tis only hair  no more than womans vanity My aunt has told me so often enough certainly But Roland why Why did I do it Roland had an idea If hair was a womans vanity then hairchopping would likely be a womans bit of nastiness  a man would hardly think of it at all The Mayors wife had it been her He thought not It seemed more likely that Rhea up there on her height of land looking north toward the Bad Grass Hanging Rock and Eyebolt Canyon had set this ugly trap Mayor Thorin had been meant to wake up on the morning after the Reap with a hangover and a baldheaded gilly Susan can I try something She gave him a smile Something ye didnt try already up yonder Aye what ye will Nothing like that He opened the hand he had held closed showing the shell I want to try and find out who did this to you and why And other things too He just didnt know what they were yet She looked at the shell Roland began to move it along the back of his hand dancing it back and forth in a dexterous weaving His knuckles rose and fell like the heddles of a loom She watched this with a childs fascinated delight Where did ye learn that At home It doesnt matter Yed hypnotize me Aye  and I dont think it would be for the first time He made the shell dance a bit faster  now east along his rippling knuckles now west May I Aye she said If you can  He could all right the speed with which she went under confirmed that this had happened to Susan before and recently Yet he couldnt get what lie wanted from her She was perfectly cooperative some sleep eager fort would have said but beyond a certain point she would not go It wasnt decorum or modesty either  as she slept openeyed before the stream she told him in a faroff but calm voice about the old womans examination and the way Rhea had tried to fiddle her up At this Polands fists clenched so tightly his nails bit into his palms But there came a point where she could no longer remember She and Rhea had gone to the door of the hut Susan said and there they had stood with the Kissing Moon shining down on their faces The old woman had been touching her hair Susan remembered that much The touch revolted her especially after the witchs previous touches but Susan had been unable to do anything about it Arms too heavy to raise tongue too heavy to speak She could only stand there while the witch whispered in her ear What Roland asked What did she whisper I dont know Susan said The rest is pink Pink What do you mean Pink she repeated She sounded almost amused as if she believed Roland was being deliberately dense She says Aye lovely just so its a good girl yare then everythings pink Pink and bright Bright Aye like the moon And then    She paused Then I think it becomes the moon The Kissing Moon mayhap A bright pink Kissing Moon as round and full as a grapefruit He tried other ways into her memory with no success  every path he tried ended in that bright pinkness first obscuring her recollection and then coalescing into a full moon It meant nothing to Roland hed heard of blue moons but never pink ones The only thing of which he was sure was that the old woman had given Susan a powerful command to forget He considered taking her deeper  she would go  but didnt dare Most of his experience came from hypnotizing his friends  classroom exercises that were larky and occasionally spooky Always there had been Cort or Vannay present to make things right if they went offtrack Now there were no teachers to step in for better or worse the students had been left in charge of the school What if he took her deep and couldnt get her back up again And he had been told there were demons in the belowmind as well If you went down to where they were they sometimes swam out of their caves to meet you    All other considerations aside it was getting late It wouldnt be prudent to stay here much longer Susan do you hear me Aye Roland I hear you very well Good Im going to say a rhyme Youll wake up as I say it When Im done youll be wide awake and remember everything weve said Do you understand Aye Listen Bird and bear and hare and fish Give my love her fondest wish Her smile as she rose to consciousness was one of the most beautiful things he had ever seen She stretched then put her arms around his neck and covered his face with kisses You you you you she said Youre my fondest wish Roland Youre my only wish You and you forever and ever They made love again there on the bank beside the babbling stream holding each other as tightly as they could breathing into each others mouths and living on each others breath You you you you  Twenty minutes later he boosted her onto Felicias back Susan leaned down took his face in her hands and kissed him soundly When will I see ye again she asked Soon But we must be careful Aye Careful as two lovers ever were I think Thank God thees clever We can use Sheemie if we dont use him too often Aye And Roland  do ye know the pavilion in Green Heart Close to where they serve tea and cakes and things when the weathers fair Roland did Fifty yards or so up Hill Street from the jail and the Town Gathering Hall Green Heart was one of the most pleasant places in town with its quaint paths umbrellashaded tables grassy dancing pavilion and menagerie Theres a rock wall at the back she said Between the pavilion and the menagerie If you need me badly   Ill always need you badly he said She smiled at his gravity Theres a stone on one of the lower courses  a reddish one Youll see it My friend Amy and I used to leave messages there for each other when we were little girls Ill look there when I can Ye do the same Aye Sheemie would work for awhile if they were careful The red rock might also work for awhile if they were careful But no matter how careful they were they would slip eventually because the Big Coffin Hunters now probably knew more about Roland and his friends than Roland ever would have wished But he had to see her no matter what the risks If he didnt he felt he might die And he only had to look at her to know she felt the same Watch special for Jonas and the other two he said I will Another kiss if ye favor He kissed her gladly and would just as gladly have pulled her off the mares back for a fourth goround   but it was time to stop being delirious and start being careful Fare you well Susan I love y   He paused then smiled I love thee And I thee Roland What heart I have is yours She had a great heart he thought as she slipped through the willows and already he felt its burden on his own He waited until he felt sure she must be well away Then he went to Rusher and rode off in the opposite direction knowing that a new and dangerous phase of the game had begun  Not too long after Susan and Roland had parted Cordelia Delgado stepped out of the Hambry Mercantile with a box of groceries and a troubled mind The troubled mind was caused by Susan of course always Susan and Cordelias fear that the girl would do something stupid before Reaping finally came around These thoughts were snatched out of her mind just as hands  strong ones  snatched the box of groceries from her arms Cordelia cawed in surprise shaded her eyes against the sun and saw Eldred Jonas standing there between the Bear and Turtle totems smiling at her His hair long and white and beautiful in her opinion lay over his shoulders Cordelia felt her heart beat a little faster She had always been partial to men like Jonas who could smile and banter their way to the edge of risqueness    but who carried their bodies like blades I startled you I cry your pardon Cordelia Nay she said sounding a little breathless to her own ears Its just the sun  so bright at this time of day   Id help you a bit on your way if you give me leave Im only going up High as far as the comer then I turn up the Hill but may I help you that far With thanks she said They walked down the steps and up the board sidewalk Cordelia looking around in little pecking glances to see who was observing them  she beside the handsome sai Jonas who just happened to be carrying her goods There was a satisfying number of onlookers She saw Millicent Ortega for one looking out of Anns Dresses with a satisfying  of surprise on her stupid cows puss I hope you dont mind me calling you Cordelia Jonas shifted the box which shed needed two hands to carry casually under one arm I feel since the welcoming dinner at Mayor Thorins house that I know you Cordelias fine And may I be Eldred to you I think Mr Jonas will do a bit longer she said then favored him with what she hoped was a coquettish smile Her heart beat faster yet It did not occur to her that perhaps Susan was not the only silly goose in the Delgado family So be it Jonas said with a look of disappointment so comic that she laughed And your niece Is she well Quite well thank yefor asking a bit of a trial sometimes   Was there ever a girl of sixteen who wasnt I suppose not Yet you have additional burdens regarding her this fall I doubt if he realizes that though Cordelia said nothing  twouldnt be discreet  but gave him a meaningful look that said much Give her my best please I will But she wouldnt Susan had conceived a great and irrational in Cordelias view dislike for Mayor Thorins regulators Trying to talk her out of these feelings would likely do no good young girls thought they knew everything She glanced at the star peeking unobtrusively out from beneath the flap of Jonass vest I understand yeve taken on an additional responsibility in our undeserving town sai Jonas Aye Im helping out Sheriff Avery he agreed His voice had a reedy little tremble which Cordelia found quite endearing somehow One of his deputies  Claypool his name is   Frank Claypool aye   fell out of his boat and broke his leg How do you fall out of a boat and break your leg Cordelia She laughed merrily the idea that everyone in Hambry was watching them was surely wrong  but it felt that way and the feeling was not unpleasant and said she didnt know He stopped on the comer of High and Camino Vega looking regretful Heres where I turn He handed the box back to her Are you sure you can carry that I suppose I could go on with you to your house   No need no need Thank you Thank you Eldred The blush which crept up her neck and cheeks felt as hot as fire but his smile was worth every degree of heat He tipped her a little salute with two fingers and sauntered up the hill toward the Sheriffs office Cordelia walked on home The box which had seemed such a burden when she stepped out of the mercantile now seemed to weigh next to nothing This feeling lasted for half a mile or so but by the time her house came into view she was once again aware of the sweat trickling down her sides and the ache in her arms Thank the gods summer was almost over  and wasnt that Susan just leading her mare in through the gate Susan she called now enough returned to earth for her former irritation with the girl to sound clear in her voice Come and help me fore I drop this and break the eggs Susan came leaving Felicia to crop grass in the front yard Ten minutes earlier Cordelia would have noticed nothing of how the girl looked  her thoughts had been too wrapped up in Eldred Jonas to admit of much else But the hot sun had taken some of the romance out of her head and returned her feet to earth And as Susan took the box from her handling it almost as easily as Jonas had done Cordelia thought she didnt much care for the girls appearance Her temper had changed for one thing  from the halfhysterical confusion in which shed left to a pleasant and happyeyed calmness That was the Susan of previous years to the sleeve and seam    but not this years moaning moody breastbeater There was nothing else Cordelia could put her finger on except  But there was actually One thing She reached out and grasped the girls braid which looked uncharacteristically sloppy this afternoon Of course Susan had been riding that could explain the mess But it didnt explain how dark her hair was as if that bright mass of gold had begun to tarnish And she jumped almost guiltily when she felt Cordelias touch Why pray tell was that Yer hairs damp Susan she said Have ye been swimming somewhere Nay I stopped and ducked my head at the pump outside Hockeys barn He doesnt mind  tis a deep well he has Its so hot Perhaps therell be a shower later I hope so I gave Felicia to drink as well The girls eyes were as direct and as candid as ever but Cordelia thought there was something off in them just the same She couldnt say what The idea that Susan might be hiding something large and serious did not immediately cross Cordelias mind she would have said her niece was incapable of keeping a secret any greater than a birthday present or a surprise party    and not even such secrets as those for more than a day or two And yet something was off here Cordelia dropped her fingers to the collar of the girls riding shirt Yet this is dry I was careful she said looking at her aunt with a puzzled eye Dirt sticks worse to a wet shirt You taught me that Aunt Ye flinched when I touched yer hair Susan Aye Susan said so I did The weirdwoman touched it just that same way I havent liked it since Now may I take these groceries in and get my horse out of the hot sun Dont be pert Susan Yet the edginess in her nieces voice actually eased her in some strange way That feeling that Susan had changed somehow  that feeling ofoffness  began to subside Then dont be tiresome Susan Apologize to me Susan took a deep breath held it then let it out Yes Aunt I do But its hot Aye Put those in the pantry And thankee Susan went on toward the house with the box in her arms When the girl had enough of a lead so they wouldnt have to walk together Cordelia followed It was all foolishness on her part no doubt  suspicions brought on by her flirtation with Eldred  but the girl was at a dangerous age and much depended on her good behavior over the next seven weeks After that she would be Thorins problem but until then she was Cordelias Cordelia thought that in the end Susan would be true to her promise but until Reaping Fair she would bear close watching About such matters as a girls virginity it was best to be vigilant INTERLUDE KANSAS SOMEWHERE SOMEWHEN Eddie stirred Around them the thinny still whined like an unpleasant motherinlaw above them the stars gleamed as bright as new hopes    or bad intentions He looked at Susannah sitting with the stumps of her legs curled beneath her he looked at Jake who was eating a burrito he looked at Oy whose snout rested on Jakes ankle and who was looking up at the boy with an expression of calm adoration The fire was low but still it burned The same was true of Demon Moon far in the west Roland His voice sounded old and rusty to his own ears The gunslinger who had paused for a sip of water looked at him with his eyebrows raised How can you know every comer of this story Roland seemed amused I dont think thats what you really want to know Eddie He was right about that  old long tall and ugly made a habit of being right It was as far as Eddie was concerned one of his most irritating characteristics All right How long have you been talking Thats what I really want to know Are you uncomfortable Want to go to bed Hes making fun of me Eddie thought    but even as the idea occurred to him he knew it wasnt true And no he wasnt uncomfortable There was no stiffness in his joints although he had been sitting crosslegged ever since Roland had begun by telling them about Rhea and the glass ball and he didnt need to go to the toilet Nor was he hungry Jake was munching the single leftover burrito but probably for the same reason folks climbed Mount Everest  because it was there And why should he be hungry or sleepyor stiff why when the fire still burned and the moon was not yet down He looked at Rolands amused eyes and saw the gunslinger was reading his thoughts No I dont want to go to bed You know I dont But Roland    youve been talking a long time He paused looked down at his hands then looked up again smiling uneasily Days I would have said But time is different here Ive told you that now you see for yourself Not all nights are the same length just recently Days either    but we notice time more at night dont we Yes I think we do Is the thinny stretching time And now that he had mentioned it Eddie could hear it in all its creepy glory  a sound like vibrating metal or maybe the worlds biggest mosquito It might be helping but mostly its just how things are in my world Susannah stirred like a woman who rises partway from a dream that holds her like sweet quicksand She gave Eddie a look that was both distant and impatient Let the man talk Eddie Yeah Jake said Let the man talk And Oy without raising his snout from Jakes ankle An Awk All right Eddie said No problem Roland swept them with his eyes Are you sure The rest is    He didnt seem able to finish and Eddie realized that Roland was scared Go on Eddie told him quietly Let the rest be what it is What it was He looked around Kansas they were in Kansas Somewhere somewhen Except he felt that Mejis and those people he had never seen  Cordelia and Jonas and Brian Hookey and Sheemie and Pettie the Trotter and Cuthbert Allgood  were very close now That Rolands lost Susan was very close now Because reality was thin here  as thin as the seat in an old pair of blue jeans  and the dark would hold for as long as Roland needed it to hold Eddie doubted if Roland even noticed the dark particularly Why would he Eddie thought it had been night inside of Rolands mind for a long long time    and dawn was still nowhere near He reached out and touched one of those callused killers hands Gently he touched it and with love Go on Roland Tell your tale All the way to the end All the way to the end Susannah said dreamily Cut the vein Her eyes were full of moonlight All the way to the end Jake said End Oy whispered Roland held Eddies hand for a moment then let it go He looked into the guttering fire without immediately speaking and Eddie sensed him trying to find the way Trying doors one after another until he found one that opened What he saw behind it made him smile and look up at Eddie True love is boring he said Say what True love is boring Roland repeated As boring as any other strong and addicting drug And as with any other strong drug    True love like any other strong and addicting drug is boring  once the tale of encounter and discovery is told kisses quickly grow stale and caresses tiresome    except of course to those who share the kisses who give and take the caresses while every sound and color of the world seems to deepen and brighten around them As with any other strong drug true first love is really only interesting to those who have become its prisoners And as is true of any other strong and addicting drug true first love is dangerous  Some called Huntress the last moon of summer some called it the first of fall Whichever it was it signaled a change in the life of the Barony Men put out into the bay wearing sweaters beneath their oilskins as the winds began to turn more and more firmly into autumns eastwest alley and to sharpen as they turned In the great Barony orchards north of Hambry and in smaller orchards owned by John Croydon Henry Wertner Jake White and the morose but wealthy Coral Thorin the pickers began to appear in the rows carrying their odd offkilter ladders they were followed by horsedrawn carts full of empty barrels Downwind of the ciderhouses  especially downwind of the great Barony cidermansion a mile north of Seafront  the breezy air was filled with the sweet tang of blems being pressed by the basketload Away from the shore of the Clean Sea the days remained warm as the Huntress waxed skies were clear day and night but summers real heat had departed with the Peddler The last cutting of hay began and was finished in the run of a week  that last one was always scant and ranchers and freeholders alike would curse it scratching their heads and asking themselves why they even bothered  but come rainy blowsy old March with the bam lofts and bins rapidly emptying they always knew In the Baronys gardens  the great ones of the ranchers the smaller ones of the freeholders and the tiny backyard plots of the townsfolk  men and women and children appeared in their old clothes and boots their sombreros and sombreros They came with the legs of their pants tied down firmly at the ankles for in the time of the Huntress snakes and scorpions in plentiful numbers wandered east from the desert By the time old Demon Moon began to fatten a line of rattlers would hang from the hitching posts of both the Travellers Rest and the mercantile across the street Other businesses would similarly decorate their hitching posts but when the prize for the most skins was given on Reaping Day it was always the inn or the market that won it In the fields and gardens baskets to pick into were cast along the rows by women with their hair tied up in kerchiefs and reapcharms hidden in their bosoms The last of the tomatoes were picked the last of the cucumbers the last of the corn the last of the parey and mingo Waiting behind them as the days sharpened and the autumn storms began to near would come squash sharproot pumpkins and potatoes In Mejis the time of reaping had begun while overhead clearer and clearer on each starry night the Huntress pulled her bow and looked east over those strange watery leagues no man or woman of MidWorld had ever seen  Those in the grip of a strong drug  heroin devil grass true love  often find themselves trying to maintain a precarious balance between secrecy and ecstasy as they walk the tightrope of their lives Keeping ones balance on a tightrope is difficult under the soberest circumstances doing so while in a state of delirium is all but impossible Completely impossible in the long run Roland and Susan were delirious but at least had the thin advantage of knowing it And the secret would not have to be kept forever but only until Reaping Day Fair at the very longest Things might end even sooner than that if the Big Coffin Hunters broke cover The actual first move might be made by one of the other players Roland thought but no matter who moved first Jonas and his men would be there a part of it The part apt to be most dangerous to the three boys Roland and Susan were careful  as careful as delirious people could be at any rate They never met in the same place twice in a row they never met at the same time twice in a row they never skulked on their way to their trysts In Hambry riders were common but skulkers were noticed Susan never tried to cover her riding out by enlisting the help of a friend although she had friends who would have done her this service people who needed alibis were people keeping secrets She had a sense that Aunt Cord was growing increasingly uneasy about her rides  particularly the ones she took in the early evenings  but so far she accepted Susans oftrepeated reason for them she needed time to be solitary to meditate on her promise and to accept her responsibility Ironically these suggestions had originally come from the witch of the Coos They met in the willow grove in several of the abandoned boathouses which stood crumbling at the northern hook of the bay in a herders hut far out in the desolation of the Coos in an abandoned squatters shack hidden in the Bad Grass The settings were by and large as sordid as any of those in which addicts come together to practice their vice but Susan and Roland didnt see the rotting walls of the shack or the holes in the roof of the hut or smell the mouldering nets in the comers of the old soaked boathouses They were drugged stone in love and to them every scar on the face of the world was a beautymark Twice early on in those delirious weeks they used the red rock in the wall at the back of the pavilion to arrange meetings and then some deep voice spoke inside Rolands head telling him there must be no more of it  the rock might have been just the thing for children playing at secrets but he and his love were no longer children if they were discovered banishment would be the luckiest punishment they could hope for The red rock was too conspicuous and writing things down  even messages that were unsigned and deliberately vague  was horribly dangerous Using Sheemie felt safer to both of them Beneath his smiling lightmindedness there was a surprising depth of  well discretion Roland had thought long and hard before settling on that word and it was the right word an ability to keep silent that was more dignified than mere cunning Cunning was out of Sheemies reach in any case and always would be  a man who couldnt tell a lie without shifting his eyes away from yours was a man who would never be considered cunning They used Sheemie half a dozen times over the five weeks when their physical love burned at its hottest  three of those times were to make meetings two were to change meetingplaces and one was to cancel a tryst when Susan spied riders from the Piano Ranch sweeping for strays near the shack in the Bad Grass That deep warning voice never spoke to Roland about Sheemie as it had about the dangers of the red rock    but his conscience spoke to him and when he finally mentioned this to Susan the two of them wrapped in a saddleblanket and lying naked in each others arms he found that her conscience had been troubling her as well It wasnt fair to put the boy in the way of their possible trouble After coming to that conclusion Roland and Susan arranged their meetings strictly between the two of them If she could not meet him Susan said she would hang a red shirt over the sill of her window as if to dry If he could not meet her he was to leave a white stone in the northeast comer of the yard diagonally across the road from Hockeys Livery where the town pump stood As a last resort they would use the red rock in the pavilion risky or not rather than bringing Sheemie into their affairs  their affair  again Cuthbert and Alain watched Rolands descent into addiction first with disbelief envy and uneasy amusement then with a species of silent horror They had been sent to what was supposed to have been safety and had discovered a place of conspiracy instead they had come to take census in a Barony where most of the aristocracy had apparently switched its allegiance to the Affiliations bitterest enemy they had made personal enemies of three hard men who had probably killed enough folks to populate a fairsized graveyard Yet they had felt equal to the situation because they had come here under the leadership of their friend who had attained nearmythic status in their minds by besting Cort  with a hawk as his weapon  and becoming a gunslinger at the unheardof age of fourteen That they had been given guns themselves for this mission had meant a great deal to them when they set out from Gilead and nothing at all by the time they began to realize the scope of what was going on in Hambrytown and the Barony of which it was a part When that realization came Roland was the weapon they counted on And now  Hes like a revolver cast into water Cuthbert exclaimed one evening not long after Roland had ridden away to meet Susan Beyond the bunkhouse porch Huntress rose in her first quarter Gods know if itll ever fire again even if its fished out and dried off Hush wait Alain said and looked toward the porch rail Hoping to jolly Cuthbert out of his bad temper a task that was quite easy under ordinary circumstances Alain said Wheres the lookout Gone to bed early for once has he This only irritated Cuthbert more He hadnt seen the rooks skull in days  he couldnt exactly say how many  and he took its loss as an ill omen Gone but not to bed he replied then looked balefully to the west where Roland had disappeared aboard his big old galoot of a horse Lost I reckon Like a certain fellows mind and heart and good sense Hell be all right Alain said awkwardly You know him as well as I do Bert  known him our whole lives we have Hell be all right Quietly without even a trace of his normal good humor Cuthbert said I dont feel I know him now They had both tried to talk to Roland in their different ways both received a similar response which was no real response at all The dreamy and perhaps slightly troubled look of abstraction in Rolands eyes during these onesided discussions would have been familiar to anyone who has ever tried to talk sense to a drug addict It was a look that said Rolands mind was occupied by the shape of Susans face the smell of Susans skin the feel of Susans body And occupied was a silly word for it one that fell short It wasnt an occupation but an obsession I hate her a little for what shes done Cuthbert said and there was a note in his voice Alain had never heard before  a mixture of jealousy frustration and fear Perhaps more than a little You mustnt Alain tried not to sound shocked but couldnt help it She isnt responsible for   Is she not She went out to Citgo with him She saw what he saw God knows how much else hes told her after theyve finished making the beast with two backs And shes all the way around the world from stupid Just the way shes managed her side of their affair shows that Bert was thinking Alain guessed of her tidy little trick with the corvette She must know shes become part of the problem herself She must know that Now his bitterness was fiighteningly clear Hes jealous of her for stealing his best friend Alain thought but it doesnt stop there Hes jealous of his best friend as well because his best friend has won the most beautiful girl any of us have ever seen Alain leaned over and grasped Cuthberts shoulder When Bert turned away from his morose examination of the dooryard to look at his friend he was startled by the grimness on Alains face Its ka Alain said Cuthbert almost sneered If I had a hot dinner for every time someone blamed theft or lust or some other stupidity on ka   Alains grip tightened until it became painful Cuthbert could have pulled away but didnt He watched Alain closely The joker was temporarily at least gone Blame is exactly what we two cant afford Alain said Dont you see that And if its ka thats swept them away we neednt blame We cant blame We must rise above it We need him And we may need her too Cuthbert looked into Alains eyes for what seemed to be a very long time Alain saw Berts anger at war with his good sense At last and perhaps only for the time being good sense won out All right fine Its ka everybodys favorite whippingboy Thats what the great unseen worlds for after all isnt it So we dont have to take the blame for our acts of stupidity Now let go of me Al before you break my shoulder Alain let go and sat back in his chair relieved Now if we only knew what to do about the Drop If we dont start counting there soon   Ive had an idea about that actually Cuthbert said It just needs a little working out Im sure Roland could help  if either of us can get his attention for a few minutes that is They sat for awhile without speaking looking out at the dooryard Inside the bunkhouse the pigeons  another bone of contention between Roland and Bert these days  cooed Alain rolled himself a smoke It was slow work and the finished product looked rather comical but it held together when he lit it Your father would stripe you raw if he saw that in your hand Cuthbert remarked but he spoke with a certain admiration By the time the following years Huntress came around all three of them would be confirmed smokers tanned young men with most of the boyhood slapped out of their eyes Alain nodded The strong Outer Crescent tobacco made him swimmy in the head and raw in the throat but a cigarette had a way of calming his nerves and right now his nerves could use some calming He didnt know about Bert but these days he smelled blood on the wind Possibly some of it would be their own He wasnt exactly frightened  not yet at least  but he was very very worried  Although they had been honed like hawks toward the guns since early childhood Cuthbert and Alain still carried an erroneous belief common to many boys their age that their elders were also their betters at least in such matters as planning and wit they actually believed that grownups knew what they were doing Roland knew better even in his lovesickness but his friends had forgotten that in the game of Castles both sides wear the blindfold They would have been surprised to find that at least two of the Big Coffin Hunters had grown extremely nervous about the three young men from InWorld and extremely tired of the waiting game both sides had been playing One early morning as the Huntress neared the half Reynolds and Depape came downstairs together from the second floor of the Travellers Rest The main public room was silent except for various snores and phlegmy wheezings In Hambrys busiest bar the party was over for another night Jonas accompanied by a silent guest sat playing Chancellors Patience at Corals table to the left of the batwing doors Tonight he was wearing his duster and his breath smoked faintly as he bent over his cards It wasnt cold enough to frost  not quite yet  but the frost would come soon The chill in the air left no doubt of that The breath of his guest also smoked Kimba Rimers skeletal frame was all but buried in a gray serape lit with faint bands of orange The two of them had been on the edge of getting down to business when Roy and Clay Pinch and Jilly Rimer thought showed up their plowing and planting in the secondfloor cribs also apparently over for another night Eldred Reynolds said and then Sai Rimer Rimer nodded back looking from Reynolds to Depape with thin distaste Long days and pleasant nights gentlemen Of course the world had moved on he thought To find such low culls as these two in positions of importance proved it Jonas himself was only a little better Might we have a word with you Eldred Clay Reynolds asked Weve been talking Roy and I   Unwise Jonas remarked in his wavery voice Rimer wouldnt be surprised to find at the end of his life that the Death Angel had such a voice Talking can lead to thinking and thinkings dangerous for such as you boys Like picking your nose with bulletheads Depape donkeyed his damned heehaw laughter as if he didnt realize the joke was on him Jonas listen Reynolds began and then looked uncertainly at Rimer You can talk in front of sai Rimer Jonas said laying out a fresh line of cards He is after all our chief employer I play at Chancellors Patience in his honor so I do Reynolds looked surprised I thought    that is to say I believed that Mayor Thorin was  Hart Thorin wants to know none of the details of our arrangement with the Good Man Rimer said A share of the profits is all he requires in that line Mr Reynolds The Mayors chief concern right now is that the Reaping Day Fair go smoothly and that his arrangements with the young lady be  smoothly consummated Aye thats a diplomatic turn o speech for ye Jonas said in a broad Mejis accent But since Roy looks a little perplexed Ill translate Mayor Thorin spends most of his time in the jakes these days yanking his willypink and dreaming his fist is Susan Delgados box Im betting that when the shells finally opened and her pearl lies before him hell never pluck it  his heartll explode from excitement and hell drop dead atop her so he will Yar More donkey laughter from Depape He elbowed Reynolds Hes got it down dont he Clay Sounds just like em Reynolds grinned but his eyes were still worried Rimer managed a smile as thin as a scum of November ice and pointed at the seven which had just popped out of the pack Red on black my dear Jonas I aint your dear anything Jonas said putting the seven of diamonds on an eight of shadows and youd do well to remember that Then to Reynolds and Depape Now what do you boys want Rimer n me was just going to have us a little palaver Perhaps we could all put our heads together Reynolds said putting a hand on the back of a chair Kind of see if our thinking matches up I think not Jonas said sweeping his cards together He looked irritated and Clay Reynolds took his hand off the back of the chair in a hurry Say your say and be done with it Its late We was thinking its time to go on out there to the Bar K Depape said Have a look around See if theres anything to back up what the old fella in Ritzy said And see what else theyve got out there Reynolds put in Its getting close now Eldred and we cant afford to take chances They might have   Aye Guns Electric lights Fairywomen in bottles Who knows Ill think about it Clay But   I said Ill think about it Now go on upstairs the both of you back to your own fairywomen Reynolds and Depape looked at him looked at each other then backed away from the table Rimer watched them with his thin smile At the foot of the stairs Reynolds turned back Jonas paused in the act of shuffling his cards and looked at him tufted eyebrows raised We underestimated em once and they made us look like monkeys I dont want it to happen again Thats all Your ass is still sore over that isnt it Well so is mine And I tell you again theyll pay for what they did I have the bill ready and when the time comes Ill present it to them with all interest duly noted In the meantime they arent going to spook me into making the first move Time is on our side not theirs Do you understand that Yes Will you try to remember it Yes Reynolds repeated He seemed satisfied Roy Do you trust me Aye Eldred To the end Jonas had praised him for the work he had done in Ritzy and Depape had rolled in it the way a male dog rolls in the scent of a bitch Then go on up the both of you and let me palaver with the boss and be done with it Im too old for these late nights When they were gone Jonas dealt out a fresh line of cards then looked around the room There were perhaps a dozen folks including Sheb the pianoplayer and Barkie the bouncer sleeping it off No one was close enough to listen to the lowvoiced conversation of the two men by the door even if one of the snoring drunkards was for some reason only shamming sleep Jonas put a red queen on a black knight then looked up at Rimer Say your say Those two said it for me actually Sai Depape will never be embarrassed by a surplus of brains but Reynolds is fairly smart for a gunny isnt he Clays trig when the moons right and hes had a shave Jonas agreed Are you saying you came all the way from Seafront to tell me those three babbies need a closer looking at Rimer shrugged Perhaps they do and Im the man to do it if so  right enough But whats there to find Thats to be seen Rimer said and tapped one of Jonass cards Theres a Chancellor Aye Near as ugly as the one Im sitting with Jonas put the Chancellor  it was Paul  above his run of cards The next draw uncovered Luke whom he put next to Paul That left Peter and Matthew still lurking in the bush Jonas looked at Rimer shrewdly You hide it better than my pals but youre as nervous as they are underneath You want to know whats out at that bunkhouse Ill tell you extra boots pictures of their mommies socks that stink to high heaven stiff sheets from boys whove been taught its lowclass to chase after the sheep    and guns hidden somewhere Under the floorboards like enough You really think they have guns Aye Roy got the straight of that all right Theyre from Gilead theyre likely from the line of Eld or from folk who like to think theyre from it and theyre likely prentices to the trade whove been sent on with guns they havent earned yet I wonder a bit about the tall one with the Idontgiveashit look in his eyes  he might already be a gunslinger I suppose  but is it likely I dont think so Even if he is I could take him in a fair go I know it and he does too Then why have they been sent here Not because those from the Inner Baronies suspect your treason sai Rimer  be easy on that score Rimers head poked out of his serape as he sat up straight and his face stiffened How dare you call me a traitor How dare you Eldred Jonas favored Hambrys Minister of Inventory with an unpleasant smile It made the whitehaired man look like a wolverine Ive called things by their right names my whole life and I wont stop now All that needs matter to you is that Ive never doublecrossed an employer If I didnt believe in the cause of   To hell with what you believe Its late and I want to go to bed The folk in New Canaan and Gilead havent the foggiest idea of what does or doesnt go on out here on the Crescent there arent many of em whove ever been here Id wager Them are too busy trying to keep everything from falling down around their ears to do much travelling these days No what they know is all from the picturebooks they was read out of when they us babbies themselves happy cowboys galloping after stock happy fishermen pulling whoppers into their boats folks clogging at bamraisings and drinking big pots o graf in Green Heart pavilion For the sake of the Man Jesus Rimer dont go dense on me  I deal with that day in and day out They see Mejis as a place of quiet and safety Aye bucolic splendor just so no doubt about it They know that their whole way o life  all that nobility and chivalry and ancestorworship  is on fire The final battle may take place as much as two hundred wheels northwest of their borders but when Farson uses his firecarriages and robots to wipe out their army trouble will come south fast There are those from the Inner Baronies whove smelled this coming for twenty years or more They didnt send these brats here to discover your secrets Rimer folks such as these dont send their babbies into danger on purpose They sent em here to get em out of the way thats all That doesnt make em blind or stupid but for the sake of the gods lets be sane Theyre kiddies What else might you find should you go out there Some way of sending messages mayhap A heliographs the most likely And out beyond Eyebolt a shepherd or maybe a freeholder susceptible to a bribe  someone theyve trained to catch the message and either flash it on or carry it afoot But before long itll be too late for messages to do any good wont it Perhaps but its not too late yet And youre right Kiddies or not they worry me Youve no cause I tell you Soon enough Ill be wealthy and youll be downright rich Mayor yourself if you want Whod stand to stop you Thorin Hes a joke Coral Shed help you string him up I wot Or perhaps youd like to be a Baron if such offices be revived He saw a momentary gleam in Rimers eyes and laughed Matthew came out of the deck and Jonas put him up with the other Chancellors Yar I see thats what youve got your heart set on Gems is nice and for gold that goes twice but theres nothing like having folk bow and scrape before ye is there Rimer said They should have been on the cowboy side by now Jonass hands stopped above the layout of cards It was a thought that had crossed his own mind more than once especially over the last two weeks or so How long do you think it takes to count our nets and boats and chart out the fishhauls Rimer asked They should be over on the Drop counting cows and horses looking through barns studying the foalcharts They should have been there two weeks ago in fact Unless they already know what theyd find Jonas understood what Rimer was implying but couldnt believe it Wouldnt believe it Not such a depth of slyness from boys who only had to shave once a week No he said Thats your own guilty heart talking to you Theyre just so determined to do it right that theyre creeping along like old folks with bad eyes Theyll be over on the Drop soon enough and counting their little hearts out And if theyre not A good question Get rid of them somehow Jonas supposed An ambush perhaps Three shots from cover no more babbies Thered be ill feeling afterward  the boys were well liked in town  but Rimer could handle that until Fair Day and after the Reap it wouldnt matter Still  Ill have a look around out at the Bar K Jonas said at last By myself  I wont have Clay and Roy tramping along behind me That sounds fine Perhaps youd like to come and lend a hand Kimba Rimer smiled his icy smile I think not Jonas nodded and began to deal again Going out to the Bar K would be a bit risky but he didnt expect any real problem  especially if he went alone They were only boys after all and gone for much of each day When may I expect a report sai Jonas When Im ready to make it Dont crowd me Rimer lifted his thin hands and held them palms out to Jonas Cry your pardon sai he said Jonas nodded slightly mollified He flipped up another card It was Peter Chancellor of Keys He put the card in the top row and then stared at it combing his fingers through his long white hair as he did He looked from the card to Rimer who looked back eyebrows raised You smile Rimer said Yar Jonas said and began to deal again Im happy All the Chancellors are out  think Im going to win this game  For Rhea the time of the Huntress had been a time of frustration and unsatisfied craving Her plans had gone awry and thanks to her cats hideously mistimed leap she didnt know how or why The young cull whod taken Susan Delgados cherry had likely stopped her from chopping her scurf   but how And who was he really She wondered that more and more but her curiosity was secondary to her fury Rhea of the Coos wasnt used to being balked She looked across the room to where Musty crouched and watched her carefully Ordinarily he would have relaxed in the fireplace he seemed to like the cool drafts that swirled down the chimney but since she had singed his fur Musty preferred the woodpile Given Rheas mood that was probably wise Youre lucky I let ye live ye warlock the old woman grumbled She turned back to the ball and began to make passes above it but the glass only continued to swirl with bright pink light  not a single image appeared Rhea got up at last went to the door threw it open and looked out on the night sky Now the moon had waxed a little past the half and the Huntress was coming clear on its bright face Rhea directed the stream of foul language she didnt quite dare to direct at the glass who knew what entity might lurk inside it waiting to take offense at such talk up at the woman in the moon Twice she slammed her bony old fist into the doorlintel as she cursed dredging up every dirty word she could think of even the pottymouth words children throw at each other in the dust of the play yard Never had she been so angry She had given the girl a command and the girl for whatever reasons had disobeyed For standing against Rhea of the Coos the bitch deserved to die But not right away the old woman whispered First she should be rolled in the dirt then pissed on until the dirts mud and her fine blonde hairs full of it Humiliated  hurt    spat on    She slammed her fist against the doors side again and this time blood flew from the knuckles It wasnt just the girls failure to obey the hypnotic command There was another matter related but much more serious Rhea herself was now too upset to use the glass except for brief and unpredictable periods of time The handpasses she made over it and the incantations she muttered to it were she knew useless the words and gestures were just the way she focused her will That was what the glass responded to  will and concentrated thought Now thanks to the trollop of a girl and her boy lover Rhea was too angry to summon the smooth concentration needed to part the pink fog which swirled inside the ball She was in fact too angry to see How can I make it like it was Rhea asked the halfglimpsed woman in the moon Tell me Tell me But the Huntress told her nothing and at last Rhea went back inside sucking at her bleeding knuckles Musty saw her coming and squeezed into the cobwebby space between the woodpile and the chimney Now the Huntress filled her belly as the oldtimers said  even at noon she could be glimpsed in the sky a pallid vampire woman caught in bright autumn sunlight In front of businesses such as the Travellers Rest and on the porches of such large ranch houses as Lengylls Rocking B and Renfrews Lazy Susan stuffyguys with heads full of straw above their old overalls began to appear Each wore his sombrero each held a basket of produce cradled in his arms each looked out at the emptying world with stitched whitecross eyes Wagons filled with squashes clogged the roads bright orange drifts of pumpkins and bright magenta drifts of sharproot lay against the sides of barns In the fields the potatocarts rolled and the pickers followed behind In front of the Hambry Mercantile reapcharms appeared like magic hanging from the carved Guardians like windchimes All over Mejis girls sewed their Reaping Night costumes and sometimes wept over them if the work went badly as they dreamed of the boys they would dance with in the Green Heart pavilion Their little brothers began to have trouble sleeping as they thought of the rides and the games and the prizes they might win at the carnival Even their elders sometimes lay awake in spite of their sore hands and aching backs thinking about the pleasures of the Reap Summer had slipped away with a final flirt of her greengown harvesttime had arrived  Rhea cared not a fig for Reaping dances or carnival games but she could no more sleep than those who did Most nights she lay on her stinking pallet until dawn her skull thudding with rage On a night not long after Jonass conversation with Chancellor Rimer she determined to drink herself into oblivion Her mood was not improved when she found that her graf barrel was almost empty she blistered the air with her curses She was drawing in breath for a fresh string of them when an idea struck her A wonderful idea A brilliant idea She had wanted Susan Delgado to cut off her hair That hadnt worked and she didnt know why   but she did know something about the girl didnt she Something interesting aye so it was wery interesting indeed Rhea had no desire to go to Thorin with what she knew she had a fond and foolish likely hope that the Mayor had forgotten about his wonderful glass ball But the girls aunt now    suppose Cordelia Delgado were to discover that not only was her nieces virginity lost the girl was well on her way to becoming a practiced trollop Rhea didnt think Cordelia would go to the Mayor either  the woman was a prig but not a fool  yet it would set the cat among the pigeons just the same wouldnt it Waow Thinking of cats there was Musty standing on the stoop in the moonlight looking at her with a mixture of hope and mistrust Rhea grinning hideously opened her arms Come to me my precious Come my sweet one Musty understanding all was forgiven rushed into his mistresss arms and began to purr loudly as Rhea licked along his sides with her old and yellowing tongue That night the Coos slept soundly for the first time in a week and when she took the glass ball into her arms the following morning its mists cleared for her at once She spent the day in thrall to it spying on people she detested drinking little and eating nothing Around sunset she came out of her trance enough to realize she had as yet done nothing about the saucy little jade But that was all right she saw how it could be done   and she could watch all the results in the glass All the protests all the shouting and recriminations She would see Susans tears That would be the best to see her tears A little harvest of my own she said to Ermot who now came slithering up her leg toward the place where she liked him best There werent many men who could do you like Ermot could do you no indeed Sitting there with a lapful of snake Rhea began to laugh  Remember your promise Alain said nervously as they heard the approaching beat of Rushers hoofs Keep your temper I will Cuthbert said but he had his doubts As Roland rode around the long wing of the bunkhouse and into the yard his shadow trailing out in the sunset light Cuthbert clenched his hands nervously He willed them to open and they did Then as he watched Roland dismount they rolled themselves closed again the nails digging into his palms Another goround Cuthbert thought Gods but Im sick of them Sick to death Last nights had been about the pigeons  again Cuthbert wanted to use one to send a message back west about the oil tankers Roland still did not So they had argued Except here was another thing which infuriated him that rubbed against his nerves like the sound of the thinny Roland did not argue These days Roland did not deign to argue His eyes always kept that distant look as if only his body was here The rest of him  mind soul spirit ka  was with Susan Delgado No he had said simply Its too late for such You cant know that Cuthbert had argued And even if its too late for help to come from Gilead its not too late for advice to come from Gilead Are you so blind you cant see that What advice can they send us Roland hadnt seemed to hear the rawness in Cuthberts voice His own voice was calm Reasonable And utterly disconnected Cuthbert thought from the urgency of the situation If we knew that he had replied we wouldnt have to ask Roland would we We can only wait and stop them when they make their move Its comfort youre looking for Cuthbert not advice You mean wait while you fuck her in as many ways and in as many places as you can imagine Cuthbert thought Inside outside rightside up and upside down Youre not thinking clearly about this Cuthbert had said coldly Hed heard Alains gasp Neither of them had ever said such a thing to Roland in their lives and once it was out hed waited uneasily for whatever explosion might follow None did Yes Roland replied I am And he had gone into the bunkhouse without another word Now watching Roland uncinch Rushers girths and pull the saddle from his back Cuthbert thought You re not you know But you better think clearly about this By all the gods you d better Hile he said as Roland carried the saddle over to the porch and set it on the step Busy afternoon He felt Alain kick his ankle and ignored it Ive been with Susan Roland said No defense no demur no excuse And for a moment Cuthbert had a vision of shocking clarity he saw the two of them in a hut somewhere the late afternoon sun shining through holes in the roof and dappling their bodies She was on top riding him Cuthbert saw her knees on the old spongy boards and the tension in her long thighs He saw how tanned her arms were how white her belly He saw how Rolands hands cupped the globes of her breasts squeezing them as she rocked back and forth above him and he saw how the sun lit her hair turning it into a finespun net Why do you always have to be first he cried at Roland in his mind Why does it always have to be you Gods damn you Roland Gods damn you We were on the docks Cuthbert said his tone a thin imitation of his usual brightness Counting boots and marine tools and what are called clamdrags What an amusing time of it weve had eh Al Did you need me to help you do that Roland asked He went back to Rusher and took off the saddleblanket Is that why you sound angry If I sound angry its because most of the fishermen are laughing at us behind our backs We keep coming back and coming back Roland they think were fools Roland nodded All to the good he said Perhaps Alain said quietly but Rimer doesnt think were fools  its in the way he looks at us when we pass Nor does Jonas And if they dont think were fools Roland what do they think Roland stood on the second step the saddleblanket hanging forgotten over his arm For once they actually seemed to have his attention Cuthbert thought Glory be and will wonders never cease They think were avoiding the Drop because we already know whats there Roland said And if they dont think it they soon will Cuthbert has a plan Rolands gaze  mild interested already starting to be not there again  shifted to Cuthbert Cuthbert the joker Cuthbert the prentice who had in no way earned the gun hed carried east to the Outer Crescent Cuthbert the virgin and eternal second Gods I dont want to hate him I dont but now its so easy We two should go and see Sheriff Avery tomorrow Cuthbert said We will present it as a courtesy visit We have already established ourselves as three courteous if slightly stupid young fellows have we not To a fault Roland agreed smiling Well say that weve finally finished with the seacoast side of Hambry and we hope to be every bit as meticulous on the farm and cowboy side But we certainly dont want to cause trouble or be in anyones way It is after all the busiest time of year  for ranchers as well as farmers  and even citified fools such as ourselves will be aware of that So well give the good Sheriff a list   Rolands eyes lit up He tossed the blanket over the porch rail grabbed Cuthbert around the shoulders and gave him a rough hug Cuthbert could smell a lilac scent around Rolands collar and felt an insane but powerful urge to clamp his hands around Rolands throat and try to strangle him Instead he gave him a perfunctory clap on the back in return Roland drew away grinning widely A list of the ranches well be visiting he said Aye And with forewarning they can move any stock theyd like us not to see on to the next ranch or the last one The same for tack feed equipment   its masterful Cuthbert Youre a genius Far from that Cuthbert said Ive just spared a little time to think about a problem that concerns us all That concerns the entire Affiliation mayhap We need to think Wouldnt you say Alain winced but Roland didnt seem to notice He was still grinning Even at fourteen such an expression on his face was troubling The truth was that when Roland grinned he looked slightly mad Do you know they may even move in a fair number of muties for us to look at just so well continue to believe the lies theyve already told about the impurity of their stocklines He paused seeming to think and then said Why dont you and Alain go and see the Sheriff Bert That would do very well I think At this point Cuthbert nearly threw himself at Roland wanting to scream Yes why not Then you could spend tomorrow morning pronging her as well as tomorrow afternoon You idiot You thoughtless lovestruck idiot It was Al who saved him  saved them all perhaps Dont be a fool he said sharply and Roland wheeled toward him looking surprised He wasnt used to sharpness from that quarter Youre our leader Roland  seen that way by Thorin by Avery by the townsfolk Seen that way by us as well No one appointed me   No one needed to Cuthbert shouted You won your guns These folk would hardly believe it  I hardly believe it myself just lately  but you are a gunslinger You have to go Plain as the nose on your face It doesnt matter which of us accompanies you but you have to go He could say more much more but if he did where would it end With their fellowship broken beyond repair likely So he clamped his mouth shut  no need for Alain to kick him this time  and once again waited for the explosion Once again none came All right Roland said in his new way  that mild itdoesntmuchmatter way that made Cuthbert feel like biting him to wake him up Tomorrow morning You and I Bert Will eight suit you Down to the ground Cuthbert said Now that the discussion was over and the decision made Berts heart was beating wildly and the muscles in his upper thighs felt like rubber It was the way hed felt after their confrontation with the Big Coffin Hunters Well be at our prettiest Roland said Nice boys from the Inners with good intentions but not many brains Fine And he went inside no longer grinning which was a relief but smiling gently Cuthbert and Alain looked at each other and let out their breath in a mutual rush Cuthbert cocked his head toward the yard and went down the steps Alain followed and the two boys stood in the center of the dirt rectangle with the bunkhouse at their backs To the east the rising full moon was hidden behind a scrim of clouds  Shes tranced him Cuthbert said Whether she means to or not shell kill us all in the end Wait and see if she dont You shouldnt say such even in jest All right shell crown us with the jewels of Eld and well live forever You have to stop being angry at him Bert You have to Cuthbert looked at him bleakly I cant  The great storms of autumn were still a month or more distant but the following morning dawned drizzly and gray Roland and Cuthbert wrapped themselves in scrapes and headed for town leaving Alain to the few home place chores Tucked in Rolands belt was the schedule of farms and ranches  beginning with the three small spreads owned by the Barony  the three of them had worked out the previous evening The pace this schedule suggested was almost ludicrously slow  it would keep them on the Drop and in the orchards almost until Years End Fair  but it conformed to the pace they had already set on the docks Now the two of them rode silently toward town both lost in their own thoughts Their way took them past the Delgado house Roland looked up and saw Susan sitting in her window a bright vision in the gray light of that fall morning His heart leaped up and although he didnt know it then it was how he would remember her most clearly forever after  lovely Susan the girl at the window So do we pass the ghosts that haunt us later in our lives they sit undramatically by the roadside like poor beggars and we see them only from the comers of our eyes if we see them at all The idea that they have been waiting there for us rarely if ever crosses our minds Yet they do wait and when we have passed they gather up their bundles of memory and fall in behind treading in our footsteps and catching up little by little Roland raised a hand to her It went toward his mouth at first wanting to send her a kiss but that would be madness He lifted the hand before it could touch his lips and ticked a finger off his forehead instead offering a saucy little salute Susan smiled and returned it in kind None saw Cordelia who had gone out in the drizzle to check on the last of her squash and sharproot That lady stood where she was a sombrero yanked down on her head almost to the eyeline halfhidden by the stuffyguy guarding the pumpkin patch She watched Roland and Cuthbert pass Cuthbert she barely saw her interest was in the other one From the boy on horseback she looked up to Susan sitting there in her window humming as blithely as a bird in a gilded cage A sharp splinter of suspicion whispered its way into Cordelias heart Susans change of temperament  from alternating bouts of sorrow and fearful anger to a kind of dazed but mainly cheerful acceptance  had been so sudden Mayhap it wasnt acceptance at all Yere mad she whispered to herself but her hand remained tight on the haft of the machete she held She dropped to her knees in the muddy garden and abruptly began chopping sharproot vines tossing the roots themselves toward the side of the house with quick accurate throws Theres nothing between em Id know Children of such an age have no more discretion than    than the drunks in the Rest But the way they had smiled The way they had smiled at each other Perfectly normal she whispered chopping and throwing She cut a sharproot nearly in half ruining it not noticing The whispering was a habit shed picked up only recently as Reap Day neared and the stresses of coping with her brothers troublesome daughter mounted Folks smile at each other thats all The same for the salute and Susans returning wave Below the handsome cavalier acknowledging the pretty maid above the maid herself pleased to be acknowledged by such as he It was youth calling to youth that was all And yet The look in his eyes    and the look in hers Nonsense of course But  But you saw something else Yes perhaps For a moment it had seemed to her that the young man was going to blow Susan a kiss    then had remembered himself at the last moment and turned it into a salute instead Even if ye did see such a thing it means nothing Young cavaliers are saucy especially when out from beneath the gaze of their fathers And these three already have a history as ye well know All true enough but none of it removed that chilly splinter from her heart  Jonas answered Rolands knock and let the two boys into the Sheriffs office He was wearing a Deputys star on his shirt and looked at them with expressionless eyes Boys he said Come in out of the wet He stepped back to allow them entrance His limp was more pronounced than Roland had ever seen it the wet weather was playing it up he supposed Roland and Cuthbert stepped in There was a gas heater in the corner  tilled from the candle at Citgo no doubt  and the big room which had been cool on the day they had first come here was stuporously hot The three cells held five woefullooking drunks two pairs of men and a woman in the center cell by herself sitting on the bunk with her legs spread wide displaying a broad expanse of red drawers Roland feared that if she got her finger any farther up her nose she might never retrieve it Clay Reynolds was leaning against the noticeboard picking his teeth with a broomstraw Sitting at the rolltop desk was Deputy Dave stroking his chin and frowning through his monocle at the board which had been set up there Roland wasnt at all surprised to see that he and Bert had interrupted a game of Castles Well look here Eldred Reynolds said Its two of the InWorld boys Do your mommies know youre out fellas They do Cuthbert said brightly And youre looking very well sai Reynolds The wet weathers soothed your pox has it Without looking at Bert or losing his pleasant little smile Roland shot an elbow into his friends shoulder Pardon my friend sai His humor regularly transgresses the bounds of good taste he doesnt seem able to help it Theres no need for us to scratch at one another  weve agreed to let bygones be bygones havent we Aye certainly all a misunderstanding Jonas said He limped back across to the desk and the gameboard As he sat down on his side of it his smile turned to a sour little grimace Im worse than an old dog he said Someone ought to put me down so they should Earths cold but painless eh boys He looked back at the board and moved a man around to the side of his Hillock He had begun to Castle and was thus vulnerable    although not very in this case Roland thought Deputy Dave didnt look like much in the way of competition I see youre working for the Barony salt now Roland said nodding at the star on Jonass shirt Salts what it amounts to Jonas said companionably enough A fellow went legbroke Im helping out thats all And sai Reynolds Sai Depape Are they helping out as well Yar I reckon Jonas said How goes your work among the fisherfolk Slow I hear Done at last The work wasnt so slow as we were But coming here in disgrace was enough for us  we have no intention of leaving that way Slow and steady wins the race they say So they do Jonas agreed Whoever they are From somewhere deeper in the building there came the whoosh of a waterstool flushing All the comforts of home in the Hambry Sheriffs Roland thought The flush was soon followed by heavy footsteps descending a staircase and a few moments later Herk Avery appeared With one hand he was buckling his belt with the other he mopped his broad and sweaty forehead Roland admired the mans dexterity Whew the Sheriff exclaimed Them beans I ate last night took the shortcut I tell ye He looked from Roland to Cuthbert and then back to Roland Why boys Too wet for netcounting is it Sai Dearborn was just saying that their netcounting days are at an end Jonas said He combed back his long hair with the tips of his fingers Beyond him Clay Reynolds had resumed his slouch against the noticeboard looking at Roland and Cuthbert with open dislike Aye Well thats fine thats fine Whats next youngsters And is there any way we here can help ye For thats what we like to do best lend a hand where a hands needed So it is Actually you could help us Roland said He reached into his belt and pulled out the list We have to move on to the Drop but we dont want to inconvenience anyone Grinning hugely Deputy Dave slid his Squire all the way around his own Hillock Jonas Castled at once ripping open Daves entire left flank The grin faded from Daves face leaving a puzzled emptiness Howd ye manage that Easy Jonas smiled then pushed back from the desk to include the others in his regard You want to remember Dave that I play to win I cant help it its just my nature He turned his full attention to Roland His smile broadened Like the scorpion said to the maiden as she lay dying You knowed I was poison when you picked me up   When Susan came in from feeding the livestock she went directly to the coldpantry for the juice which was her habit She didnt see her aunt standing in the chimney comer and watching her and when Cordelia spoke Susan was startled badly It wasnt just the unexpectedness of the voice it was the coldness of it Do ye know him The juicejug slipped in her fingers and Susan put a steadying hand beneath it Orange juice was too precious to waste especially this late in the year She turned and saw her aunt by the woodbox Cordelia had hung her sombrero on a hook in the entryway but she still wore her serape and muddy boots Her cuchillo lay on top of the stacked wood with green strands of sharproot vine still trailing from its edge Her tone was cold but her eyes were hot with suspicion A sudden clarity filled Susans mind and all of her senses If you say No  youre damned she thought If you even ask who you may be damned You must say  I know them both she replied in offhand fashion I met them at the party So did you Ye frightened me Aunt Why did he salute ye so How can I know Perhaps he just felt like it Her aunt bolted forward slipped in her muddy boots regained her balance and seized Susan by the arms Now her eyes were blazing Bent insolent with me girl Bent haughty with me Miss Oh So Young and Pretty or Ill   Susan pulled backward so hard that Cordelia staggered and might have fallen again if the table had not been handy to grab Behind her muddy foottracks stood out on the clean kitchen floor like accusations Call me that again and Ill    Ill slap thee Susan cried So I will Cordelias lips drew back from her teeth in a dry ferocious smile Yed slap your fathers only living blood kin Would ye be so bad Why not Do ye not slap me Aunt Some of the heat went out of her aunts eyes and the smile left her mouth Susan Hardly ever Not half a dozen times since ye were a toddler who would grab anything her hands could reach even a pot of boiling water on the   Its with thy mouth thee mostly hits nowadays Susan said Ive put up with it  more fool me  but am done with it now Ill have no more If Im old enough to be sent to a mans bed for money Im old enough for ye to keep a civil tongue when ye speak to me Cordelia opened her mouth to defend herself  the girls anger had startled her and so had her accusations  and then she realized how cleverly she was being led away from the subject of the boys Of the boy Ye only know him from the party Susan Its Dearborn I mean As I think ye well know Ive seen him about town Susan said She met her aunts eyes steadily although it cost her an effort lies would follow halftruths as dark followed dusk Ive seen all three of them about town Are ye satisfied No Susan saw with mounting dismay she was not Do ye swear to me Susan  on your fathers name  that yeve not been meeting this boy Dearborn All the rides in the late afternoon Susan thought All the excuses All the care that no one should see us And it all comes down to a careless wave on a rainy morning That easily alls put at risk Did we think it could be otherwise Were we that foolish Yes  and no The truth was they had been mad And still were Susan kept remembering the look of her fathers eyes on the few occasions when he had caught her in a fib That look of halfcurious disappointment The sense that her fibs innocuous as they might be had hurt him like the scratch of a thorn I will swear to nothing she said Yeve no right to ask it of me Swear Cordelia cried shrilly She groped out for the table again and grasped it as if for balance Swear it Swear it This is no game of jacks or tag or Johnnyjumpmypony Thees not a child any longer Swear to me Swear that theere still pure No Susan said and turned to leave Her heart was beating madly but still that awful clarity informed the world Roland would have known it for what it was she was seeing with gunslingers eyes There was a glass window in the kitchen looking out toward the Drop and in it she saw the ghostly reflection of Aunt Cord coming toward her one arm raised the hand at the end of it knotted into a fist Without turning Susan put up her own hand in a halting gesture Raise that not to me she said Raise it not ye bitch She saw the reflections ghosteyes widen in shock and dismay She saw the ghostfist relax become a hand again fall to the ghostwomans side Susan Cordelia said in a small hurt voice How can ye call me so Whats so coarsened your tongue and your regard for me Susan went out without replying She crossed the yard and entered the bam Here the smells she had known since childhood  horses lumber hay  filled her head and drove the awful clarity away She was tumbled back into childhood lost in the shadows of her confusion again Pylon turned to look at her and whickered Susan put her head against his neck and cried  There Sheriff Avery said when sais Dearborn and Heath were gone Its as ye said  just slow is all they are just creeping careful He held the meticulously printed list up studied it a moment then cackled happily And look at this What a beauty Har We can move anything we dont want em to see days in advance so we can Theyre fools Reynolds said    but he pined for another chance at them just the same If Dearborn really thought bygones were bygones over that little business in the Travellers Rest he was way past foolishness and dwelling in the land of idiocy Deputy Dave said nothing He was looking disconsolately through his monocle at the Castles board where his white army had been laid waste in six quick moves Jonass forces had poured around Red Hillock like water and Daves hopes had been swept away in the flood Im tempted to wrap myself up dry and go over to Seafront with this Avery said He was still gloating over the paper with its neat list of farms and ranches and proposed dates of inspection Up to Years End and beyond it ran Gods Why dont ye do that Jonas said and got to his feet Pain ran up his leg like bitter lightning Another game sai Jonas Dave asked beginning to reset the pieces Id rather play a weedeating dog Jonas said and took malicious pleasure at the flush that crept up Daves neck and stained his guileless fools face He limped across to the door opened it and went out on the porch The drizzle had become a soft steady rain Hill Street was deserted the cobbles gleaming wetly Reynolds had followed him out Eldred   Get away Jonas said without turning Clay hesitated a moment then went back inside and closed the door What the hells wrong with you Jonas asked himself He should have been pleased at the two young pups and their list  as pleased as Avery was as pleased as Rimer would be when he heard about this mornings visit After all hadnt he told Rimer not three days ago that the boys would soon be over on the Drop counting their little hearts out Yes So why did he feel so unsettled So fucking jittery Because there Bt still hadnt been any contact from Parsons man Latigo Because Reynolds came back empty from Hanging Rock on one day and Depape came back empty the next Surely not Latigo would come along with a goodly troop of men but it was still too soon for them and Jonas knew it Reaping was still almost a month away So is it just the bad weather working on your leg stirring up that old wound and making you ugly No The pain was bad but it had been worse before The trouble was his head Jonas leaned against a post beneath the overhang listened to the rain plinking on the tiles and thought how sometimes in a game of Castles a clever player would peek around his Hillock for just a moment then duck back That was what this felt like  it was so right it smelled wrong Crazy idea but somehow not crazy at all Are you trying to play Castles with me sprat Jonas murmured If so youll soon wish youd stayed home with your mommy So you will  Roland and Cuthbert headed back to the Bar K along the Drop  there would be no counting done today At first in spite of the rain and the gray skies Cuthberts good humor was almost entirely restored Did you see them he asked with a laugh Did you see them Roland    Will I mean They bought it didnt they Swallowed that honey whole they did Yes What do we do next Whats our next move Roland looked at him blankly for a moment as if startled out of a doze The next move is theirs We count And we wait Cuthberts good cheer collapsed in a puff and he once more found himself having to restrain a flood of recrimination all whirling around two basic ideas that Roland was shirking his duty so he could continue to wallow in the undeniable charms of a certain young lady and  more important  that Roland had lost his wits when all of MidWorld needed them the most Except what duty was Roland shirking And what made him so sure Roland was wrong Logic Intuition Or just shitty old catbox jealousy Cuthbert found himself thinking of the effortless way Jonas had ripped up Deputy Daves army when Deputy Dave had moved too soon But life was not like Castles  was it He didnt know But he thought he had at least one valid intuition Roland was heading for disaster And so they all were Wake up Cuthbert thought Please Roland wake up before its too late There followed a week of the sort of weather that makes folk apt to crawl back into bed after lunch take long naps and wake feeling stupid and disoriented It was far from floodweather but it made the final phase of the applepicking dangerous there were several broken legs and in SevenMile Orchard a young woman fell from the top of her ladder breaking her back and the potatofields became difficult to work almost as much time was spent freeing wagons stuck in the gluey rows as was spent actually picking In Green Heart what decorations had been done for the Reaping Fair grew sodden and had to be pulled down The work volunteers waited with increasing nervousness for the weather to break so they could begin again It was bad weather for young men whose job it was to take inventory although they were at least able to begin visiting barns and counting stock It was good weather for a young man and young woman who had discovered the joys of physical love you would have said but Roland and Susan met only twice during the run of gray weather The danger of what they were doing was now almost palpable The first time was in an abandoned boathouse on the Seacoast Road The second was in the far end of the crumbling building below and to the east of Citgo  they made love with furious intensity on one of Rolands saddleblankets which was spread on the floor of what had once been the oil refinerys cafeteria As Susan climaxed she shrieked his name over and over Startled pigeons filled the old shadowy rooms and crumbling hallways with their soft thunder  Just as it seemed that the drizzle would never end and the grinding sound of the thinny in the still air would drive everyone in Hambry insane a strong wind  almost a gale  blew in off the ocean and puffed the clouds away The town awoke one day to a sky as bright as blue steel and a sun that turned the bay to gold in the morning and white fire in the afternoon That sense of lethargy was gone In the potato fields the carts rolled with new vigor In Green Heart an army of women began once more to bedeck with flowers the podium where Jamie McCann and Susan Delgado would he acclaimed this years Reaping Lad and Girl Out on the part of the Drop closest to Mayors House Roland Cuthbert and Alain rode with renewed purpose counting the horses which ran with the Barony brand on their flanks The bright skies and brisk winds filled them with energy and good cheer and for a course of days  three or perhaps four  they galloped together in a whooping shouting laughing line their old good fellowship restored On one of these brisk and sunny days Eldred Jonas stepped out of the Sheriffs office and walked up Hill Street toward Green Heart He was free of both Depape and Reynolds this morning  they had ridden out to Hanging Rock together looking for Latigos outriders who must come soon now  and Jonass plan was simple to have a glass of beer in the pavilion and watch the preparations that were going on there the digging of the roastingpits the laying of faggots for the bonfire the arguments over how to set the mortars that would shoot off the fireworks the ladies flowering the stage where this years Lad and Girl would be offered for the towns adulation Perhaps Jonas thought he might take a likelylooking flowergirl off for an hour or two of recreation The maintenance of the saloon whores he left strictly to Roy and Clay but a fresh young flowergirl of seventeen or so was a different matter The pain in his hip had faded with the damp weather the painful lurching stride with which he had moved for the last week or so had become a mere limp again Perhaps just a beer or two in the open air would be enough but the thought of a girl wouldnt quite leave his head Young clearskinned highbreasted Fresh sweet breath Fresh sweet lips  Mr Jonas Eldred He turned smiling to the owner of the voice No dewycomplexioned flowergirl with wide eyes and moist parted lips stood there but a skinny woman edging into late middle age  flat chest flat bum tight pale lips hair scrooped so tight against her skull that it fair screamed Only the wide eyes corresponded with his daydream Ibelieve Ive made a conquest Jonas thought sardonically Why Cordelia he said reaching out and taking one of her hands in both of his How lovely you look this morning Thin color came up in her cheeks and she laughed a little For a moment she looked fortyfive instead of sixty And shes not sixty Jonas thought The lines around her mouth and the shadows under her eyes    those are new Youre very kind she said but I know better I havent been sleeping and when women my age dont sleep they grow old rapidly Im sorry to hear youre sleeping badly he said But now that the weathers changed perhaps   Its not the weather Might I speak to you Eldred Ive thought and thought and youre the only one I dare turn to for advice His smile widened He placed her hand through his arm then covered it with his own Now her blush was like fire With all that blood in her head she might talk for hours And Jonas had an idea that every word would be interesting  With women of a certain age and temperament tea was more effective than wine when it came to loosening the tongue Jonas gave up his plans for a lager and perhaps a flowergirl without so much as a second thought He seated sai Delgado in a sunny comer of the Green Heart pavilion it was not far from a red rock Roland and Susan knew well and ordered a large pot of tea cakes too They watched the Reaping Fair preparations go forward as they waited for the food and drink The sunswept park was full of hammering and sawing and shouts and bursts of laughter All FairDays are pleasant but Reaping turns us all into children again dont you find Cordelia asked Yes indeed said Jonas who hadnt felt like a child even when he had been one What I still like best is the bonfire she said looking toward the great pile of sticks and boards that was being constructed at the far end of the park eatercorner from the stage It looked like a large wooden tepee I love it when the townsfolk bring their stuffyguys and throw them on Barbaric but it always gives me such a pleasant shiver Aye Jonas said and wondered if it would give her a pleasant shiver to know that three of the stuffyguys thrown onto the Reap Night bonfire this year were apt to smell like pork and scream like harpies as they burned If his luck was in the one that screamed the longest would be the one with the pale blue eyes The tea and cakes came and Jonas didnt so much as glance at the girls full bosom when she bent to serve He had eyes only for the fascinating sai Delgado with her nervous little shifting movements and odd desperate look When the girl was gone he poured out put the teapot back on its trivet then covered her hand with his Now Cordelia he said in his warmest tone I can see something troubles you Out with it Confide in your friend Eldred Her lips pressed so tightly together that they almost disappeared but not even that effort could stop their trembling Her eyes filled with tears swam with them overspilled He took his napkin and leaning across the table wiped the tears away Tell me he said tenderly I will I must tell somebody or go mad But you must make one promise Eldred Of course molly He saw her blush more furiously than ever at this harmless endearment and squeezed her hand Anything You mustnt tell Hart That disgusting spider of a Chancellor either but especially not the Mayor If Im right in what I suspect and he found out he could send her west She almost moaned this as if comprehending it as a real fact for the first time He could send us both west Maintaining his sympathetic smile he said Not a word to Mayor Thorin not a word to Kimba Rimer Promise For a moment he thought that she wouldnt take the plunge  or perhaps couldnt Then in a low gaspy voice that sounded like ripping cloth she said a single word Dearborn He felt his heart take a bump as the name that had been so much in his mind now passed her lips and although he continued to smile he could not forbear a single hard squeeze of her fingers that made her wince Im sorry he said Its just that you startled me a little Dearborn  a wellspoken enough lad but  wonder if hes entirely trustworthy I fear hes been with my Susan Now it was her turn to squeeze but Jonas didnt mind He hardly felt it in fact He continued to smile hoping he did not look as flabbergasted as he felt I fear hes been with her as a man is with a woman Oh how horrible this is She wept with a silent bitterness taking little pecking peeks around as she did to make sure they were not being observed Jonas had seen coyotes and wild dogs look around from their stinking dinners in just that fashion He let her get as much of it out of her system as he could  he wanted her calm incoherencies wouldnt help him  and when he saw her tears slackening he held out a cup of tea Drink this Yes Thank you The tea was still hot enough to steam but she drank it down greedily Her old throat must be lined with slate Jonas thought She set the cup down and while he poured out fresh she used her frilly panuelo to scrub the tears almost viciously from her face I dont like him she said Dont like him dont trust him none of those three with their fancy InWorld bows and insolent eyes and strange ways of talking but him in particular Yet if anythings gone on betwixt the two of em and Im so afraid it has it comes back to her doesnt it Its the woman after all who must refuse the bestial impulses He leaned over the table looking at her with warm sympathy Tell me everything Cordelia She did  Rhea loved everything about the glass ball but what she especially loved was the way it unfailingly showed her people at their vilest Never in its pink reaches did she see one child comforting another after a fall at play or a tired husband with his head in his wifes lap or old people supping peacefully together at the end of the day these things held no more interest for the glass it seemed than they did for her Instead she had seen acts of incest mothers beating children husbands beating wives She had seen a gang of boys out westrds of town it would have amused Rhea to know these swaggering eightyearolds called themselves the Big Coffin Hunters go about enticing stray dogs with a bone and then cutting off their tails for a lark She had seen robberies and at least one murder a wandering man who had stabbed his companion with a pitchfork after some sort of trivial argument That had been on the first drizzly night The body still lay mouldering in a ditch beside the Great Road West covered with a layer of straw and weeds It might be discovered before the autumn storms came to drown another year it might not She also glimpsed Cordelia Delgado and that hard gun Jonas sitting in Green Heart at one of the outside tables and talking about    well of course she didnt know did she But she could see the look in the spinster bitchs eyes Infatuated with him she was all pink in the face Gone all hot and sweet over a backshooter and failed gunslinger It was comical aye and Rhea thought she would keep an eye on them from time to time Wery entertaining it would likely be After showing her Cordelia and Jonas the glass veiled itself once more Rhea put it back in the box with the eye on the lock Seeing Cordelia in the glass had reminded the old woman that she had unfinished business regarding Cordelias sluttish niece That Rhea still hadnt done that business was ironic but understandable  as soon as she had seen how to fix the young sais wagon Rheas mind and emotions had settled again the images in the ball had reappeared and in her fascination with them Rhea had temporarily forgotten that Susan Delgado was alive Now however she remembered her plan Set the cat among the pigeons And speaking of cats  Musty Yoohoo Musty where are ye The cat came oiling out of the woodpile eyes glowing in the dirty dimness of the hut when the weather turned fine again Rhea had pulled her shutters to forked tail waving He jumped into her lap Ive an errand for ye she said bending over to lick the cat The entrancing taste of Mustys fur filled her mouth and throat Musty purred and arched his back against her lips For a sixlegged mutie cat life was good  Jonas got rid of Cordelia as soon as he could  although not as soon as he would have liked because he had to keep the scrawny bint sweetened up She might come in handy another time In the end he had kissed her on the comer of her mouth which caused her to turn so violently red he feared she might have a brainstorm and told her that he would check into the matter which so concerned her But discreetly she said alarmed Yes he said walking her home he would be discreet discretion was his middle name He knew Cordelia wouldnt  couldnt  be eased until she knew for sure but he guessed it would turn out to be nothing but vapor Teenagers loved to dramatize didnt they And if the young lass saw that her aunt was afraid of something she might well feed aunties fears instead of allaying them Cordelia had stopped by the white picket fence that divided her gardenplot from the road an expression of sublime relief coming over her face Jonas thought she looked like a mule having its back scratched with a stiff brush Why I never thought of that yet its likely isnt it Likely enough Jonas had said but Ill still check into it most carefully Better safe than sorry He kissed the comer of her mouth again And not a word to the fellows at Seafront Not a hint Thankee Eldred Oh thankee And she had hugged him before hurrying in her tiny breasts pressing like stones against the front of his shirt Mayhap Ill sleep tonight after all She might but Jonas wondered if he would He walked toward Hockeys stable where he kept his horse with his head down and his hands locked behind his back A gaggle of boys came racing up the other side of the street two of them were waving severed dogs tails with blood clotted at the ends Coffin Hunters Were Big Coffin Hunters just like you one called impudently across to him Jonas drew his gun and pointed it at them  it was done in a flash and for a moment the terrified boys saw him as he really was with his eyes blazing and his lips peeled back from his teeth Jonas looked like a whitehaired wolf in mans clothes Get on you little bastards he snarled Get on before I blow you loose of your shoes and give your fathers cause to celebrate For a moment they were frozen and then they fled in a howling pack One had left his trophy behind the dogs tail lay on the board sidewalk like a grisly fan Jonas grimaced at the sight of it bolstered his gun locked his hands behind him again and walked on looking like a parson meditating on the nature of the gods And what in gods name was he doing pulling iron on a bunch of young hellions like that Being upset he thought Being worried He was worried all right The titless old biddys suspicions had upset him greatly Not on Thorins account  as far as Jonas was concerned Dearborn could fuck the girl in the town square at high noon of Reaping Fair Day  but because it suggested that Dearborn might have fooled him about other things Crept up behind you once he did and you swore it d never happen again But if hes been diddling that girl it has happened again Hasnt it Aye as they said in these parts If the boy had had the impertinence to begin an affair with the Mayors gillyinwaiting and the incredible slyness to get away with it what did that do to Jonass picture of three InWorld brats who could barely find their own behinds with both hands and a candle We underestimated em once and they made us look like monkeys Clay had said Idont want it to happen again Had it happened again How much really did Dearborn and his friends know How much had they found out And who had they told If Dearborn had been able to get away with pronging the Mayors chosen  to put something that large over on Eldred Jonas  on everyone    Good day sai Jonas Brian Hookey said He was grinning widely all but kowtowing before Jonas with his sombrero crushed against his broad blacksmiths chest Would ye care for fresh graf sai Ive just gotten the new pressing and   All I want is my horse Jonas said curtly Bring it quick and stop your quacking Aye so I will happy to oblige thankeesai He hurried off on the errand taking one nervous grinning look back over his shoulder to make sure he wasnt going to be shot out of hand Ten minutes later Jonas was headed west on the Great Road He felt a ridiculous but nevertheless strong desire to simply kick his horse into a gallop and leave all this foolishness behind him Thorin the graying goatboy Roland and Susan with their nodoubt mawkish teenage love Roy and Clay with their fast hands and slow wits Rimer with his ambitions Cordelia Delgado with her ghastly visions of the two of them in some bosky dell him likely reciting poetry while she wove a garland of flowers for his brow He had ridden away from things before when intuition whispered plenty of things But there would be no riding away this time He had vowed vengeance on the brats and while he had broken a bushel of promises made to others hed never broken one made to himself And there was John Farson to consider Jonas had never spoken to the Good Man himself and never wanted to Farson was reputed to be whimsically dangerously insane but he had had dealings with George Latigo who would probably be leading the troop of Farsons men that would arrive any day now It was Latigo who had hired the Big Coffin Hunters in the first place paying a huge cash advance which Jonas hadnt yet shared with Reynolds and Depape and promising an even larger piece of warspoil if the Affiliations major forces were wiped out in or around the Shaved Mountains Latigo was a goodsized bug all right but nothing to the size of the bug trundling along behind him And besides no large reward was ever achieved without risk If they delivered the horses oxen wagons of fresh vegetables the tack the oil the glass  most of all the wizards glass  all would be well If they failed it was very likely that their heads would end up being whacked about by Farson and his aides in their nightly polo games It could happen and Jonas knew it No doubt someday it would happen But when his head finally parted company from his shoulders the divorce wouldnt be caused by any such smarms as Dearborn and his friends no matter whose bloodline they had descended from But if hes been having an affair with Thorin s autumn treat    if hes been able to keep such a secret as that what others has he been keeping Perhaps he is playing Castles with you If so he wouldnt play for long The first time young Mr Dearborn poked his nose around his Hillock Jonas would be there to shoot it off for him The question for the present was where to go first Out to the Bar K to take a long overdue look at the boys living quarters He could they would be counting Barony horses on the Drop all three of them But it wasnt over horses that he might lose his head was it No the horses were just a small added attraction as far as the Good Man was concerned Jonas rode for Citgo instead  First he checked the tankers They were just as had been and should be  lined up in a neat row with their new wheels ready to roll when the time came and hidden behind their new camouflage Some of the screening pine branches were turning yellow at the tips but the recent spell of rain had kept most admirably fresh There had been no tampering that Jonas could see Next he climbed the hill walking beside the pipeline and pausing more and more frequently to rest by the time he reached the rotting gate between the slope and the oilpatch his bad leg was paining him severely He studied the gate frowning over the smudges he saw on the top rung They might mean nothing but Jonas thought someone might have climbed over the gate rather than risk opening it and having it fall off its hinges He spent the next hour strolling around the derricks paying especially close attention to those that still worked looking for sign He found plenty of tracks but it was impossible especially after a week of wet weather to read them with any degree of accuracy The InWorld boys might have been out here that ugly little band of brats from town might have been out here Arthur Eld and the whole company of his knights might have been out here The ambiguity put Jonas in a foul temper as ambiguity other than on a Castles board always did He started back the way hed come meaning to descend the slope to his horse and ride back to town His leg was aching like fury and he wanted a stiff drink to quiet it down The bunkhouse at the Bar K could wait another day He got halfway to the gate saw the weedy spur track tying Citgo to the Great Road and sighed There would be nothing on that little strip of road to see but now that hed come all the way out here he supposed he should finish the job Bugger finishing the job I want a damned drink But Roland wasnt the only one who sometimes found his wishes overruled by training Jonas sighed rubbed at his leg then walked back to the weedy twin ruts Where it seemed there was something to find after all It lay in the grassy ditch less than a dozen paces from the place where the old road joined the Great Road At first he saw only a smooth white shape in the weeds and thought it was a stone Then he saw a black roundness that could only be an eyehole Not a stone then a skull Grunting Jonas knelt and fished it out while the few living derricks continued to squeal and thump behind him A rooks skull He had seen it before Hell he suspected most of the town had It belonged to the showoff Arthur Heath  who like all showoffs needed his little props He called it the lookout Jonas murmured Put it on the horn of his saddle sometimes didnt he And sometimes wore it around his neck like a pendant Yes The youngster had been wearing it so that night in the Travellers Rest when  Jonas turned the birds skull Something rattled inside like a last lonely thought Jonas tilted it shook it over his open palm and a fragment of gold chain dropped out That was how the boy had been wearing it At some point the chain had broken the skull had fallen in the ditch and sai Heath had never troubled to go looking for it The thought that someone might find it had probably never crossed his mind Boys were careless It was a wonder any ever grew up to be men Jonass face remained calm as he knelt there examining the birds skull but behind the unlined brow he was as furious as he had ever been in his life They had been out here all right  it was another thing he would have scoffed at just yesterday He had to assume they had seen the tankers camouflage or no camouflage and if not for the chance of finding this skull he never would have known for sure one way or the other When I finish with em their eyesocketsll be as empty as yours Sir Rook Ill gouge em clean myself He started to throw the skull away then changed his mind It might come in handy Carrying it in one hand he started back to where hed left his horse  Coral Thorin walked down High Street toward the Travellers Rest her head thumping rustily and her heart sour in her breast She had been up only an hour but her hangover was so miserable it felt like a day already She was drinking too much of late and she knew it  almost every night now  but she was very careful not to take more than one or two and always light ones where folks could see So far she thought no one suspected And as long as no one suspected she supposed she would keep on How else to bear her idiotic brother This idiotic town And of course the knowledge that all of the ranchers in the Horsemens Association and at least half of the large landowners were traitors Fuck the Affiliation she whispered Better a bird in the hand But did she really have a bird in the hand Did any of them Would arson keep his promises  promises made by a man named Latigo and passed on by their own inimitable Kimba Rimer Coral had her doubts despots had such a convenient way of forgetting their promises and birds in the hand such an irritating way of pecking your fingers shitting in your palm and then flying away Not that it mattered now she had made her bed Besides folks would always want to drink and gamble and rut regardless of who they bowed their knees to or in whose name their taxes were collected Still when the voice of old demon conscience whispered a few drinks helped to still its lips She paused outside Cravens Undertaking Parlor looking upstreet at the laughing boys on their ladders hanging paper lanterns from high poles and building eaves These gay lamps would be lit on the night of the Reap Fair filling Hambrys main street with a hundred shades of soft conflicting light For a moment Coral remembered the child she had been looking at the colored paper lanterns with wonder listening to the shouts and the rattle of fireworks listening to the dancemusic coming from Green Heart as her father held her hand    and on his other side her big brother Harts hand In this memory Hart was proudly wearing his first pair of long trousers Nostalgia swept her sweet at first then bitter The child had grown into a sallow woman who owned a saloon and whorehouse not to mention a great deal of land along the Drop a woman whose only sexual partner of late was her brothers Chancellor a woman whose chief goal upon arising these days was getting to the hair of the dog that bit her as soon as possible How exactly had things turned out so This woman whose eyes she used was the last woman the child she had been would have expected to become Where did I go wrong she asked herself and laughed Oh dear Man Jesus where did this straying sinnerchild go wrong Can you say hallelujah She sounded so much like the wandering preacherwoman that had come through town the year before  Pittston her name had been Sylvia Pittston  that she laughed again this time almost naturally She walked on toward the Rest with a better will Sheemie was outside tending to the remains of his silkflowers He waved to her and called a greeting She waved back and called something in return A good enough lad Sheemie and although she could have found another easily enough she supposed she was glad Depape hadnt killed him The bar was almost empty but brilliantly lit all the gasjets flaring It was clean as well Sheemie would have emptied the spittoons but Coral guessed it was the plump woman behind the bar who had done all the rest The makeup couldnt hide the sallowness of that womans cheeks the hollowness of her eyes or the way her neck had started to go all crepey seeing that sort of lizardy skin on a womans neck always made Coral shiver inside It was Pettie the Trotter tending bar beneath The Romps stem glass gaze and if allowed to do so she would continue until Stanley appeared and banished her Pettie had said nothing out loud to Coral  she knew better  but had made her wants clear enough just the same Her whoring days were almost at an end She desperately desired to go to work tending bar There was precedent for it Coral knew  a female bartender at Forest Trees in Pass o the River and there had been another at Glencove up the coast in Tavares until she had died of the pox What Pettie refused to see was that Stanley Ruiz was younger by fifteen years and in far better health He would be pouring drinks under The Romp long after Pettie was rotting instead of Trotting in a paupers grave Good even sai Thorin Pettie said And before Coral could so much as open her mouth the whore had put a shot glass on the bar and filled it full of whiskey Coral looked at it with dismay Did they all know then I dont want that she snapped Why in Elds name would I Sun isnt even down Pour it back into the bottle for yer fathers sake and then get the hell out of here Who dye think yer serving at five o the clock anyway Ghosts Petties face fell a foot the heavy coat other makeup actually seemed to crack apart She took the funnel from under the bar stuck it in the neck of the bottle and poured the shot of whiskey back in Some went onto the bar in spite of the funnel her plump hands now ringless her rings had been traded for food at the mercantile across the street long since were shaking Im sorry sai So I am I was only   I dont care what ye was only Coral said then turned a bloodshot eye on Sheb who had been sitting on his pianobench and leafing through old sheetmusic Now he was staring toward the bar with his mouth hung open And what are you looking at ye frog Nothing sai Thorin I   Then go look at it somewhere else Take this pig withee Give her a bounce why dont ye Itll be good for her skin It might even be good for yer own I Get out Are ye deaf Both of ye Pettie and Sheb went away toward the kitchen instead of the cribs upstairs but it was all the same to Coral They could go to hell as far as she was concerned Anywhere as long as they were out of her aching face She went behind the bar and looked around Two men playing cards over in the far comer That hardcase Reynolds was watching them and sipping a beer There was another man at the far end of the bar but he was staring off into space lost in his own world No one was paying any especial attention to sai Coral Thorin and what did it matter if they were If Pettie knew they all knew She ran her finger through the puddle of whiskey on the bar sucked it ran it through again sucked it again She grasped the bottle but before she could pour a spidery monstrosity with graygreen eyes leaped hissing onto the bar Coral shrieked and stepped back dropping the whiskey bottle between her feet    where for a wonder it didnt break For a moment she thought her head would break instead  that her swelling throbbing brain would simply split her skull like a rotten eggshell There was a crash as the cardplayers overturned their table getting up Reynolds had drawn his gun Nay she said in a quavering voice she could hardly recognize Her eyeballs were pulsing and her heart was racing People could die of fright she realized that now Nay gentlemen alls well The sixlegged freak standing on the bar opened its mouth bared its needle fangs and hissed again Coral bent down and as her head passed below the level of her waist she was once more sure it was going to explode picked up the bottle saw that it was still a quarter full and drank directly from the neck no longer caring who saw her do it or what they thought As if hearing her thought Musty hissed again He was wearing a red collar this afternoon  on him it looked baleful rather than jaunty Beneath it was tucked a white scrap of paper Want me to shoot it a voice drawled I will if you like One slug and wont be nothing left but claws It was Jonas standing just inside the batwings and although he looked not a whole lot better than she felt Coral had no doubt he could do it Nay The old bitchll turn us all into locusts or something like if ye kill her familiar What bitch Jonas asked crossing the room Rhea Dubativo Rhea of the Coos shes called Ah Not the bitch but the witch Shes both Jonas stroked the cats back It allowed itself to be petted even arching against his hand but he only gave it the single caress Its fur had an unpleasant damp feel Would you consider sharing that he asked nodding toward the bottle Its early but my leg hurts like a devil sick of sin Your leg my head early or late On the house Jonas raised his white eyebrows Count yer blessings and have at it cully She reached toward Musty He hissed again but allowed her to draw the note out from under his collar She opened it and read the five words that were printed there Might I see Jonas asked With the first drink down and warming his belly the world looked better Why not She handed him the note Jonas looked then handed it back He had almost forgotten Rhea and that wouldnt have done at all Ah but it was hard to remember everything wasnt it Just lately Jonas felt less like a hired gun than a cook trying to make all nine courses of a state dinner come out at the same time Luckily the old hag had reminded him of her presence herself Gods bless her thirst And his own since it had landed him here at the right time Sheemie Coral bawled She could also feel the whiskey working she felt almost human again She even wondered if Eldred Jonas might be interested in a dirty evening with the Mayors sister  who knew what might speed the hours Sheemie came in through the batwings hands grimy pink sombrera bouncing on his back at the end of its cuerda Aye Coral Thorin Here I be She looked past him calculating the sky Not tonight not even for Rhea she wouldnt send Sheemie up there after dark and that was the end of it Nothing she said in a voice that was gentler than usual Go back to yer flowers and see that ye cover them well It bids frosty She turned over Rheas note and scrawled a single word on it tomorrow This she folded and handed to Jonas Stick it under that stinks collar for me will ye I dont want to touch him Jonas did as he was asked The cat favored them with a final wild green look then leaped from the bar and vanished beneath the batwings Time is short Coral said She hadnt the slightest idea what she meant but Jonas nodded in what appeared to be perfect understanding Would you care to go upstairs with a closet drunk Im not much in the looks department but I can still spread em all the way to the edge of the bed and I dont just lie there He considered then nodded His eyes were gleaming This one was as thin as Cordelia Delgado  but what a difference eh What a difference All right Ive been known to say some nasty things  fair warning Dear lady I shall be all ears She smiled Her headache was gone Aye Ill just bet ye will Give me a minute Dont move a step He walked across to where Reynolds sat Drag up a chair Eldred I think not Theres a lady waiting Reynoldss gaze flicked briefly toward the bar Youre joking I never joke about women Clay Now mark me Reynolds sat forward eyes intent Jonas was grateful this wasnt Depape Roy would do what you asked and usually well enough but only after youd explained it to him half a dozen times Go to Lengyll he said Tell him we want to put about a dozen men  no less than ten  out at yon oilpatch Good men who can get their heads down and keep them down and not snap the trap too soon on an ambush if ambushings required Tell him Brian Hockeys to be in chargeHes got a level head which is more than can be said for most of these poor things Reynoldss eyes were hot and happy You expect the brats Theyve been out there once mayhap theyll be out again If so theyre to be crossfired and knocked down dead At once and with no warning You understand Yar And the tale after Why that the oil and the tankers must have been their business Jonas said with a crooked smile To be taken to Farson at their command and by confederates unknown Well be carried through the streets on the towns shoulders come Reap Hailed as the men who rooted out the traitors Wheres Roy Gone back to Hanging Rock I saw him at noon He says theyre coming Eldred says when the wind swings into the east he can hear approaching horse Maybe he only hears what he wants to hear But he suspected Depape was right Jonass mood at rock bottom when he stepped into the Travellers Rest was now very much on the rebound Well start moving the tankers soon whether the brats come or not At night and two by two like the animals going on board Old Pas Ark He laughed at this But well leave some eh Like cheese in a trap Suppose the mice dont come Jonas shrugged If not one way another I intend to press them a little more tomorrow I want them angry and I want them confused Now go on about your business I have yon lady waiting Better you than me Eldred Jonas nodded He guessed that half an hour from now he would have forgotten all about his aching leg Thats right he said You shed eat like fudge He walked back to the bar where Coral stood with her arms folded Now she unfolded them and took his hands The right she put on her left breast The nipple was hard and erect under his fingers The forefinger of his left hand she put in her mouth and bit down lightly Shall we bring the bottle Jonas asked Why not said Coral Thorin  If shed gone to sleep as drunk as had been her habit over the last few months the creak of the bedsprings wouldnt have awakened her  a bombblast wouldnt have awakened her But although theyd brought the bottle it still stood on the nighttable of the bedroom she maintained at the Rest it was as big as any three of the whores cribs put together the level of the whiskey unchanged She felt sore all over her body but her head was clear sex was good for that much anyway Jonas was at the window looking out at the first gray traces of daylight and pulling his pants up His bare back was covered with crisscrossed scars She thought to ask him who had administered such a savage flogging and how hed survived it then decided shed do better to keep quiet Where are ye off to she asked I believe Im going to start by finding some paint  any shade will do  and a streetmutt still in possession of its tail After that sai I dont think you want to know Very well She lay down and pulled the covers up to her chin She felt she could sleep for a week Jonas yanked on his boots and went to the door buckling his gunbelt He paused with his hand on the knob She looked at him grayish eyes already halffilled with sleep again Ive never had better Jonas said Coral smiled No cully she said Nor I Roland Cuthbert and Alain came out onto the porch of the Bar K bunkhouse almost two hours after Jonas had left Corals room at the Travellers Rest By then the sun was well up over the horizon They werent late risers by nature but as Cuthbert put it We have a certain InWorld image to maintain Not laziness but lounginess Roland stretched arms spread toward the sky in a wide Y then bent and grasped the toes of his boots This caused his back to crackle I hate that noise Alain said He sounded morose and sleepy In fact he had been troubled by odd dreams and premonitions all night  things which of the three of them only he was prey to Because of the touch perhaps  with him it had always been strong Thats why he does it Cuthbert said then clapped Alain on the shoulder Cheer up old boy Youre too handsome to be downhearted Roland straightened and they walked across the dusty yard toward the stables Halfway there he came to a stop so sudden that Alain almost ran into his back Roland was looking east Oh he said in a funny bemused voice He even smiled a little Oh Cuthbert echoed Oh what great leader Oh joy I shall see the perfumed lady anon or oh rats I must work with my smelly male companions all the livelong day Alain looked down at his boots new and uncomfortable when they had left Gilead now sprung trailworn a little down at the heels and as comfortable as workboots ever got Looking at them was better than looking at his friends for the time being There was always an edge to Cuthberts teasing these days the old sense of fun had been replaced by something that was mean and unpleasant Alain kept expecting Roland to flash up at one of Cuthberts jibes like steel that has been struck by sharp flint and knock Bert sprawling In a way Alain almost wished for it It might clear the air But not the air of this morning Just oh Roland said mildly and walked on Cry your pardon for I know youll not want to hear it but Id speak a further word about the pigeons Cuthbert said as they saddled their mounts I still believe that a message   Ill make you a promise Roland said smiling Cuthbert looked at him with some mistrust Aye If you still want to send by flight tomorrow morning well do so The one you choose shall be sent west to Gilead with a message of your devising banded to its leg What do you say Arthur Heath Is it fair Cuthbert looked at him for a moment with a suspicion that hurt Alains heart Then he also smiled Fair he said Thank you And then Roland said something which struck Alain as odd and made that prescient part of him quiver with disquiet Dont thank me yet  I dont want to go up there sai Thorin Sheemie said An unusual expression had creased his normally smooth face  a troubled and fearful frown Shes a scary lady Scary as a beary she is Got a wart on her nose right here He thumbed the tip of his own nose which was small and smooth and well molded Coral who might have bitten his head off for such hesitation only yesterday was unusually patient today So true she said But Sheemie she asked for ye special and she tips Ye know she does and well Wont help if she turns me into a beetle Sheemie said morosely Beetles cant spend coppers Nevertheless he let himself be led to where Caprichoso the inns packmule was tied Barkie had loaded two small tuns over the mules back One filled with sand was just there for balance The other held a fresh pressing of the graf Rhea had a taste for FairDays coming Coral said brightly Why its not three weeks now Aye Sheemie looked happier at this He loved FairDays passionately  the lights the firecrackers the dancing the games the laughter When FairDay came everyone was happy and no one spoke mean A young man with coppers in his pocket is sure to have a good time at the Fair Coral said Thats true sai Thorin Sheemie looked like someone who has just discovered one of lifes great principles Aye trueytrue so it is Coral put Caprichosos rope halter into Sheemies palm and closed the fingers over it Have a nice trip lad Be polite to the old crow bow yer best bow   and make sure yere back down the hill before dark Long before aye Sheemie said shivering at the very thought of still being up in the Coos after nightfall Long before sure as loaves n fishes Good lad Coral watched him off his pink sombrero now clapped on his head leading the grumpy old packmule by its rope And as he disappeared over the brow of the first mild hill she said it again Good lad  Jonas waited on the flank of a ridge bellydown in the tall grass until the brats were an hour gone from the Bar K He then rode to the ridgetop and picked them out three dots four miles away on the brown slope Off to do their daily duty No sign they suspected anything They were smarter than he had at first given them credit for  but nowhere near as smart as they thought they were He rode to within a quarter mile of the Bar K  except for the bunkhouse and stable a burnedout hulk in the bright sunlight of this early autumn day  and tethered his horse in a copse of cottonwoods that grew around the ranch house spring Here the boys had left some washing to dry Jonas stripped the pants and shirts off the low branches upon which they had been hung made a pile of them pissed on them and then went back to his horse The animal stamped the ground emphatically when Jonas pulled the dogs tail from one of his saddlebags as if saying he was glad to be rid of it Jonas would be glad to be rid of it too It had begun giving off an unmistakable aroma From the other saddlebag he took a small glass jar of red paint and a brush These he had obtained from Brian Hockeys eldest son who was minding the livery stable today Sai Hookey himself would be out to Citgo by now no doubt Jonas walked to the bunkhouse with no effort at concealment    not that there was much in the way of concealment to be had out here And no one to hide from anyway now that the boys were gone One of them had left an actual book  Mercers Homilies and Meditations on the seat of a rocking chair on the porch Books were things of exquisite rarity in MidWorld especially as one travelled out from the center This was the first one except for the few kept in Seafront that Jonas had seen since coming to Mejis He opened it In a firm womans hand he read To my dearest son from his loving MOTHER Jonas tore j Ins page out opened his jar of paint and dipped the tips of his last two lingers inside He blotted out the word MOTHER with the pad of his third linger then using the nail of his pinky as a makeshift pen printed CUNT above MOTHER He poked this sheet on a rusty nailhead where it was sure to be seen then tore the book up and stamped on the pieces Which boy had it belonged to He hoped it was Dearborns but it didnt really matter The first thing Jonas noticed when he went inside was the pigeons cooing in their cages He had thought they might be using a helio to send heir messages but pigeons My That was ever so much more trig Ill get to you in a few minutes he said Be patient darlings peck and shit while you still can He looked around with some curiosity the soft coo of the pigeons soothing in his ears Lads or lords Roy had asked the old man in Ritzy The old man had said maybe both Neat lads at the very least from the way they kept their quarters Jonas thought Well trained Three bunks all made Three piles of goods at the foot of each stacked up just as neat In each pile he found a picture of a mother  oh such good fellows they were  and in one he found a picture of both parents He had hoped for names possibly documents of some kind even love letters from the girl mayhap but there was nothing like that Lads or lords they were careful enough Jonas removed the pictures from their frames and shredded them The goods he scattered to all points of the compass destroying as much as he could in the limited time he had When he found a linen handkerchief in the pocket of a pair of dress pants he blew his nose on it and then spread it carefully on the toes of the boys dress boots so that the green splat would show to good advantage What could be more aggravating  more unsettling  than to come home after a hard day spent tallying stock and find some strangers snot on one of your personals The pigeons were upset now they were incapable of scolding like jays or rooks but they tried to flutter away from him when he opened their cages It did no good of course He caught them one by one and twisted their heads off That much accomplished Jonas popped one bird beneath the strawtick pillow of each boy Beneath one of these pillows he found a small bonus paper strips and a storagepen undoubtedly kept for the composition of messages He broke the pen and flung it across the room The strips he put in his own pocket Paper always came in handy With the pigeons seen to he could hear better He began walking slowly back and forth on the board floor head cocked listening  When Alain came riding up to him at a gallop Roland ignored the boys strained white face and burning frightened eyes I make it thirtyone on my side he said all with the Barony brand crown and shield You We have to go back Alain said Somethings wrong Its the touch Ive never felt it so clear Your count Roland asked again There were times such as now when he found Alains ability to use the touch more annoying than helpful Forty Or fortyone I forget And what does it matter Theyve moved what they dont want us to count Roland didnt you hear me We have to go back Somethings wrong Somethings wrong at our place  Roland glanced toward Bert riding peaceably some five hundred yards away Then he looked back at Alain his eyebrows raised in a silent question Bert Hes numb to the touch and always has been  you know it Im not You know Im not Roland please Whoever it is will see the pigeons Maybe find our guns The normally phlegmatic Alain was nearly crying in his excitement and dismay If you wont go back with me give me leave to go back by myself Give me leave Roland for your fathers sake For your fathers sake I give you none Roland said My count is thirtyone Yours is forty Yes well say forty Fortys a good number  good as any I wot Now well change sides and count again Whats wrong with you Alain almost whispered He was looking at Roland as if Roland had gone mad Nothing You knew You knew when we left this morning Oh I might have seen something Roland said A reflection perhaps but  do you trust me Al Thats what matters I think Do you trust me or do you think I lost my wits when I lost my heart As he does He jerked his head in Cuthberts direction Roland was looking at Alain with a faint smile on his lips but his eyes were ruthless and distant it was Rolands overthehorizon look Alain wondered if Susan Delgado had seen that expression yet and if she had what she made of it I trust you By now Alain was so confused that he didnt know for Mire if that was a lie or the truth Good Then switch sides with me My count is thirtyone mind Thirtyone Alain agreed He raised his hands then dropped them hack to his thighs with a slap so sharp his normally stolid mount laid his cars back and jigged a bit under him Thirtyone I think we may go back early today if thats any satisfaction to you Roland said and rode away Alain watched him Hed always wondered what went on in Rolands head but never more than now  Creak Creakcreak Here was what hed been listening for and just as Jonas was about to give up the hunt He had expected to find their hideyhole a little closer to their beds but they were trig all right He went to one knee and used the blade of his knife to pry up the board which had creaked Under it were three bundles each swaddled in dark strips of cotton cloth These strips were damp to the touch and smelled fragrantly of gunoil Jonas took the bundles out and unwrapped each curious to see what sort of calibers the youngsters had brought The answer turned out to be serviceable but undistinguished Two of the bundles contained single fiveshot revolvers of a type then called for no reason I know carvers The third contained two guns sixshooters of higher quality than the carvers In fact for one heartstopping moment Jonas thought he had found the big revolvers of a gunslinger  trueblue steel barrels sandalwood grips bores like mineshafts Such guns he could not have left no matter what the cost to his plans Seeing the plain grips was thus something of a relief Disappointment was never a thing you looked for but it had a wonderful way of clearing the mind He rewrapped the guns and put them back put the board back as well A gang of neerdowell clots from town might possibly come out here and might possibly vandalize the unguarded bunkhouse scattering what they didnt tear up but find a hiding place such as this No my son Not likely Do you really think theyll believe it was hooligans from town that did this They might just because he had underestimated them to start with didnt mean he should turn aboutface and begin overestimating them now And he had the luxury of not needing to care Either way it would make them angry Angry enough to rush fulltilt around their Hillock perhaps To throw caution to the wind    and reap the whirlwind Jonas poked the end of the severed dogs tail into one of the pigeoncages so it stuck up like a huge mocking feather He used the paint to write such charmingly boyish slogans as and on the walls Then he left standing on the porch for a moment to verify he still had the Bar K to himself Of course he did Yet for a blink or two there at the end hed felt uneasy  almost as though hed been scented By some sort of InWorld telepathy mayhap There is such you know it The touch its called Aye but that was the tool of gunslingers artists and lunatics Not of boys be they lords or just lads Jonas went back to his horse at a neartrot nevertheless mounted and rode toward town Things were reaching the boil and there would be a lot to do before Demon Moon rose full in the sky  Rheas hut its stone walls and the cracked guijarros of its roof slimed with moss huddled on the last hill of the Coos Beyond it was a magnificent view northwest  the Bad Grass the desert Hanging Rock Eyebolt Canyon  but scenic vistas were the last thing on Sheemies mind as he led Capriccioso cautiously into Rheas yard not long after noon Hed been hungry for the last hour or so but now the pangs were gone He hated this place worse than any other in Barony even more than Citgo with its big towers always going creakedycreak and clangetyclang Sai he called leading the mule into the yard Capi balked as they neared the hut planting his feet and lowering his neck but when Sheemie tugged the halter he came on again Sheemie was almost sorry Maam Nice old lady that wouldnt hurt a fly You thereyair Its good old Sheemie with your graf He smiled and held out his free hand palm up to demonstrate his exquisite harmlessness but from the hut there was still no response Sheemie felt his guts first coil then cramp For a moment he thought he was going to shit in his pants just like a babby then he passed wind and felt a little better In his bowels at least He walked on liking this less at every step The yard was rocky and the straggling weeds yellowish as if the huts resident had blighted the very earth with her touch There was a garden and Sheemie saw that the vegetables still in it  pumpkins and sharproot mostly  were muties Then he noticed the gardens stuffyguy It was also a mutie a nasty thing with two straw heads instead of one and what appeared to be a stuffed hand in a womans satin glove poking out of the chest area Sai Thorinll never talk me up here again he thought Not for all the pennies in the world The huts door stood open To Sheemie it looked like a gaping mouth A sickish dank smell drifted out Sheemie stopped about fifteen paces from the house and when Capi nuzzled his bottom as if to ask what was keeping them the boy uttered a brief screech The sound of it almost set him running and it was only by exercising all his willpower that he was able to stand his ground The day was bright but up here on this hill the sun seemed meaningless This wasnt his first trip up here and Rheas hill had never been pleasant but it was somehow worse now It made him feel the way the sound of the thinny made him feel when he woke and heard it in the middle of the night As if something awful was sliding toward him  something that was all insane eyes and red reaching claws SSSai Is anyone here Is   Come closer The voice drifted out of the open door Come to where I can see you idiot boy Trying not to moan or cry Sheemie did as the voice said He had an idea that he was never going back down the hill again Capriccioso perhaps but not him Poor old Sheemie was going to end up in the cookpot  hot dinner tonight soup tomorrow cold snacks until Years End Thats what he would be He made his reluctant way to Rheas stoop on rubbery legs  if his knees had been closer together they would have knocked like castanets She didnt even sound the same SSai Im afraid So I aaam So ye should be the voice said It drifted and drifted slipping out into the sunlight like a sick puff of smoke Never mind though  just do as I say Come closer Sheemie son of Stanley Sheemie did so although terror dragged at every step he took The mule followed head down Capi had honked like a goose all the way up here  honked ceaselessly  but now he had fallen silent So here ye be the voice buried in those shadows whispered Here ye be indeed She stepped into the sunlight falling through the open door wincing for a moment as it dazzled her eyes Clasped in her arms was the empty graf barrel Coiled around her throat like a necklace was Ermot Sheemie had seen the snake before and on previous occasions had never failed to wonder what sort of agonies he might suffer before he died if he happened to be bitten by such Today he had no such thoughts Compared to Rhea Ermot looked normal The old womans face had sunken at the cheeks giving the rest of her head the look of a skull Brown spots swarmed out of her thin hair and over her bulging brow like an army of invading insects Below her left eye was an open sore and her grin showed only a few remaining teeth Dont like the way I look doee she asked Makes yer heart cold dont it NNo Sheemie said and then because that didnt sound right I mean yes But gods that sounded even worse Youre beautiful sai he blurted She chuffed nearly soundless laughter and thrust the empty tun into his arms almost hard enough to knock him on his ass The touch of her fingers was brief but long enough to make his flesh crawl Welladay They say handsome is as handsome does dont they And that suits me Aye right down to the ground Bring me my graf idiot child Yyes sai Right away sai He took the empty tun back to the mule set it down then fumbled loose the cordage holding the little barrel of graf  He was very aware of her watching him and it made him clumsy hut finally he got the barrel loose It almost slid through his grasp and there was a nightmarish moment when he thought it would fall to the stony ground and smash but he caught his grip again at the last second He took it to her had just a second to realize she was no longer wearing the snake then felt it crawling on his boots Ermot looked up at him hissing and baring a double set of fangs in an eerie grin Dont move too fast my boy Twouldnt be wise  Ermots grumpy today Set the barrel just inside the door here Its too heavy for me Missed a few meals of late I have Sheemie bent from the waist bow yer best bow Sai Thorin had said and here he was doing just that grimacing not daring to ease the pressure on his back by moving his feet because the snake was still on them When he straightened Rhea was holding out an old and stained envelope The flap had been sealed with a blob of red wax Sheemie dreaded to think what might have been rendered down to make wax such as that Take this and give it to Cordelia Delgado Do ye know her AAye Sheemie managed Susansais auntie Thats right Sheemie reached tentatively for the envelope but she held it back a moment Cant read can ye idiot boy Nay Words n letters go right out of my head Good Mind ye show this to no one who can or some night yell find Ermot waiting under yer pillow I see far Sheemie dye mark me I see far It was just an envelope but it felt heavy and somehow dreadful in Sheemies fingers as if it were made out of human skin instead of paper And what sort of letter could Rhea be sending Cordelia Delgado anyway Sheemie thought back to the day hed seen sai Delgados face all covered with cobwebbies and shivered The horrid creature lurking before him in the doorway of her hut could have been the very creature whod spun those webs Lose it and Ill know Rhea whispered Show my business to another and Ill know Remember son of Stanley I see far Ill be careful sai It might be better if he did lose the envelope but he wouldnt Sheemie was dim in the head everyone said so but not so dim that he didnt understand why he had been called up here not to deliver a barrel ofgraf but to receive this letter and pass it on Would ye care to come in for a bit she whispered and then pointed a ringer at his crotch If I give ye a little bit of mushroom to eat  special to me it is  I can look like anyone ye fancy Oh I cant he said clutching his trousers and smiling a huge broad smile that felt like a scream trying to get out of his skin That pesky thing fell off last week that did For a moment Rhea only gawped at him genuinely surprised for one of the few times in her life and then she once more broke out in chuffing bursts of laughter She held her stomach in her waxy hands and rocked back and forth with glee Ermot startled streaked into the house on his lengthy green belly From somewhere in its depths her cat hissed at it Go on Rhea said still laughing She leaned forward and dropped three or four pennies into his shirt pocket Get out of here ye great galoophus Dont ye linger either looking at flowers No sai   Before he could say more the door clapped to so hard that dust puffed out of the cracks between the boards  Roland surprised Cuthbert by suggesting at two o the clock that they go back to the Bar K When Bert asked why Roland only shrugged and would say nothing more Bert looked at Alain and saw a queer musing expression on the boys face As they drew closer to the bunkhouse a sense of foreboding filled Cuthbert They topped a rise and looked down at the Bar K The bunkhouse door stood open Roland Alain cried He was pointing to the cottonwood grove where the ranchs spring was Their clothes neatly hung to dry when they left were now scattered helltobreakfast Cuthbert dismounted and ran to them Picked up a shirt sniffed it flung it away Pissed on he cried indignantly Come on Roland said Lets look at the damage  There was a lot of damage to look at As you expected Cuthbert thought gazing at Roland Then he turned to Alain who appeared gloomy but not really surprised As you both expected Roland bent toward one of the dead pigeons and plucked at something so fine Cuthbert at first couldnt see what it was Then he straightened up and held it out to his friends A single hair Very long very white He opened the pinch of his thumb and forefinger and let it waft to the floor There it lay amid the shredded remains of Cuthbert Allgoods mother and father If you knew that old corbie was here why didnt we come back and end his breath Cuthbert heard himself ask Because the time was wrong Roland said mildly He would have done it had it been one of us in his place destroying his things Were not like him Roland said mildly Im going to find him and blow his teeth out the back of his head Not at all Roland said mildly If Bert had to listen to one more mild word from Rolands mouth he would run mad All thoughts of fellowship and katet left his mind which sank back into his body and was at once obliterated by simple red fury Jonas had been here Jonas had pissed on their clothes called Alains mother a cunt torn up their most treasured pictures painted childish obscenities on their walls killed their pigeons Roland had known    done nothing    intended to continue doing nothing Except fuck his gillygirl He would do plenty of that aye because now that was all he cared about But she wont like the look of your face the next time you climb into the saddle Cuthbert thought Ill see to that He drew back his fist Alain caught his wrist Roland turned away and began picking up scattered blankets as if Cuthberts furious face and cocked fist were simply of no account to him Cuthbert balled up his other fist meaning to make Alain let go of him one way or the other but the sight of his friends round and honest face so guileless and dismayed quieted his rage a little His argument wasnt with Alain Cuthbert was sure the other boy had known something bad was happening here but he was also sure that Roland had insisted Alain do nothing until Jonas was gone Come with me Alain muttered slinging an arm around Berts shoulders Outside For your fathers sake come You have to cool off This is no time to be fighting among ourselves Its no time for our leaders brains to drain down into his prick either Cuthbert said making no effort to lower his voice But the second time Alain tugged him Bert allowed himself to be led toward the door Ill stay my rage at him this one last time he thought but I think  I know  that is all I can manage Ill have Alain tell him so The idea of using Alain as a gobetween to his best friend  of knowing that things had come to such a pass  filled Cuthbert with an angry despairing rage and at the door to the porch he turned back to Roland She has made you a coward  he said in the High Speech Beside him Alain drew in his breath sharply Roland stopped as if suddenly turned to stone his back to them his arms full of blankets In that moment Cuthbert was sure Roland would turn and rush toward him They would fight likely until one of them was dead or blind or unconscious Likely that one would be him but he no longer cared But Roland never turned Instead in the same speech he said He came to steal our guile and our caution With you he has succeeded  No Cuthbert said lapsing back into the low speech I know that part of you really believes that but its not so The truth is youve lost your compass Youve called your carelessness love and made a virtue of irresponsibility I   For gods sake come Alain nearly snarled and yanked him out the door  With Roland out of sight Cuthbert felt his rage veering toward Alain in spite of himself it turned like a weathervane when the wind shifts The two of them stood facing each other in the sunshiny dooryard Alain looking unhappy and distracted Cuthbert with his hands knotted into fists so tight they trembled at his sides Why do you always excuse him Why Out on the Drop he asked if I trusted him I said I did And I do Then youre a fool And hes a gunslinger It he says we must wait longer we must Hes a gunslinger by accident A freak A mutie Alain stared at him in silent shock Come with me Alain Its time to end this mad game Well find Jonas and kill him Our katet is broken Well make a new one you and I Its not broken If it does break itll be you responsible And for that Ill never forgive you Now it was Cuthberts turn to be silent Go for a ride why dont you A long one Give yourself time to cool off So much depends on our fellowship   Tell him that No Im telling you Jonas wrote a foul word about my mother Dont you think Id go with you just to avenge that if I didnt think that Roland was right That its what Jonas wants For us to lose our wits and come charging blindly around our Hillock Thats right but its wrong too Cuthbert said Yet his hands were slowly unrolling fists becoming fingers again You dont see and I dont have the words to explain If I say that Susan has poisoned the well of our katet you would call me jealous Yet I think she has all unknowing and unmeaning Shes poisoned his mind and the door to hell has opened Roland feels the heat from that open door and thinks its only his feeling for her    but we must do better Al We must think better For him as well as for ourselves and our fathers Are you calling her our enemy No It would be easier if she was He took a deep breath let it out took another let it out took a third and let it out With each one he felt a little saner a little more himself Never mind Theres no more to say ont for now Your advice is good  I think I will take a ride A long one Bert started toward his horse then turned back Tell him hes wrong Tell him that even if hes right about waiting hes right for the wrong reasons and that makes him all the way wrong He hesitated Tell him what I said about the door to hell Say thats my piece of the touch Will you tell him Yes Stay away from Jonas Bert Cuthbert mounted up I promise nothing Youre not a man Alain sounded sorrowful on the point of tears in fact None of us are men You better be wrong about that Cuthbert said because mens work is coming He turned his mount and rode away at a gallop  He went far up the Seacoast Road to begin with trying not to think at all Hed found that sometimes unexpected things wandered into your head if you left the door open for them Useful things often This afternoon that didnt happen Confused miserable and without a fresh idea in his head or even the hope of one Bert at last turned back to Hambry He rode the High Street from end to end waving or speaking to people who hiled him The three of them had met a lot of good people here Some he counted as friends and he rather felt the common folk of Hambrytown had adopted them  young fellows who were far from their own homes and families And the more Bert knew and saw of these common folk the less he suspected that they were a part of Rimers and Jonass nasty little game Why else had the Good Man chosen Hambry in the first place if not because it provided such excellent cover There were plenty of folk out today The farmers market was booming the streetstalls were crowded children were laughing at a Pinch and Jilly show Jilly was currently chasing Pinch back and forth and bashing the poor old longsuffering fellow with her broom and the Reaping Fair decorations were going forward at speed Yet Cuthbert felt only a little joy and anticipation at the thought of the Fair Because it wasnt his own wasnt Gilead Reaping Perhaps    but mostly just because his mind and heart were so heavy If this was what growing up was like he thought he could have skipped the experience He rode on out of town the ocean now at his back the sun full in his face his shadow growing ever longer behind him He thought hed soon veer off the Great Road and ride across the Drop to the Bar K But before he could here came his old friend Sheemie leading a mule Sheemies head was down his shoulders slumped his pink brera askew his boots dusty To Cuthbert he looked as though he had walked all the way from the tip of the earth Sheemie Cuthbert cried already anticipating the boys cheery grin and loony patter Long days and pleasant nights How are y   Sheemie lifted his head and as the brim of his sombrero came up Cuthbert fell silent He saw the dreadful fear on the boys face  the pale checks the haunted eyes the trembling mouth  Sheemie could have been at the Delgado place two hours ago if hed wanted but he had trudged along at a turtles pace the letter inside his shirt seeming to drag at his every step It was awful so awful He couldnt even think about it because his thinker was mostly broken so it was Cuthbert was off his horse in a flash and hurrying to Sheemie He put his hands on the boys shoulders Whats wrong Tell your old pal He wont laugh not a bit At the sound of Arthur Heaths kind voice and the sight of his concerned face Sheemie began to weep Rheas strict command that he should tell no one flew out of his head Still sobbing he recounted everything that had happened since that morning Twice Cuthbert had to ask him to slow down and when Bert led the boy to a tree in whose shade the two of them sat together Sheemie was finally able to do so Cuthbert listened with growing unease At the end of his tale Sheemie produced an envelope from inside his shirt Cuthbert broke the seal and read what was inside his eyes growing large  Roy Depape was waiting for him at the Travellers Rest when Jonas returned in good spirits from his trip to the Bar K An outrider had finally shown up Depape announced and Jonass spirits rose another notch Only Roy didnt look as happy about it as Jonas would have expected Not happy at all Fellows gone on to Seafront where I guess hes expected Depape said He wants you right away I wouldnt linger here to eat not even a popkin if I were you I wouldnt take a drink either Youll want a clear head to deal with this one Free with your advice today aint you Roy Jonas said He spoke in a heavily sarcastic tone but when Pettie brought him a tot of whiskey he sent it back and asked for water instead Roy had a bit of a look to him Jonas decided Too pale by half was good old Roy And when Sheb sat down at his pianobench and struck a chord Depape jerked in that direction one hand dropping to the butt of his gun Interesting And a little disquieting Spill it son  whats got your back hair up Roy shook his head sullenly Dont rightly know Whats this fellows name I didnt ask he didnt say He showed me Farsons sigul though You know Depape lowered his voice a little The eye Jonas knew all right He hated that wideopen staring eye couldnt imagine what had possessed Farson to pick it in the first place Why not a mailed fist Crossed swords Or a bird A falcon for instance  a falcon would have made a fine sigul But that eye  All right he said finishing the glass of water It went down better than whiskey would have done anyway  dry as a bone hed been Ill find out the rest for myself shall I As he reached the batwing doors and pushed them open Depape called his name Jonas turned back He looks like other people Depape said What do you mean I dont hardly know Depape looked embarrassed and bewildered but dogged too Sticking to his guns We only talked five minutes in all but once I looked at him and thought it was the old bastard from Ritzy  the one I shot Little bit later I thow him a glance and think Hellfire its my old pa standin there Then that went by too and he looked like himself again And hows that Youll see for yourself I reckon I dont know if youll like it much though Jonas stood with one batwing pushed open thinking Roy twasnt Farson himself was it The Good Man in some sort of disguise Depape hesitated frowning and then shook his head No Are you sure We only saw him the once remember and not closeto Latigo had pointed him out Sixteen months ago that had been give or take Im sure You remember how big he was Jonas nodded Farson was no Lord Perth but he was six feet or more and broad across at both brace and basket This mans Clays height or less And he stays the same height no matter who he looks like Depape hesitated a moment and said He laughs like a dead person  could barely stand to hear him do it What do you mean like a dead person Roy Depape shook his head Cant rightly say  Twenty minutes later Eldred Jonas was riding beneath come in peace mid into the courtyard of Seafront uneasy because he had expected Latigo    and unless Roy was very much mistaken it wasnt Latigo he was getting Miguel shuffled forward grinning his gummy old grin and took the reins of Jonass horse Reconocimiento Por nada jefe Jonas went in saw Olive Thorin sitting in the front parlor like a forlorn ghost and nodded to her She nodded back and managed a wan smile Sai Jonas how well you look If you see Hart   Cry your pardon lady but its the Chancellor Ive come to see Jonas said He went on quickly upstairs toward the Chancellors suite of rooms then down a narrow stone hall lit and not too well with gasjets When he reached the end of the corridor he rapped on the door waiting there  a massive thing of oak and brass set in its own arch Rimer didnt care for such as Susan Delgado but he loved the trappings of power that was what took the curve out of his noodle and made it straight Jonas rapped Come in my friend a voice  not Rimers  called It was followed by a tittery laugh that made Jonass flesh creep He laughs like a dead person Roy had said Jonas pushed open the door and stepped in Rimer cared for incense no more than he cared for the hips and lips of women but there was incense burning in here now  a woody smell that made Jonas think of court at Gilead and functions of state in the Great Hall The gasjets were turned high The draperies  purple velvet the color of royalty Rimers absolute favorite  trembled minutely in the breath of sea breeze coming in through the open windows Of Rimer there was no sign Or of anyone else come to that There was a little balcony but the doors giving on it were open and no one was out there Jonas stepped a little farther into the room glancing into a giltframed mirror on the far side to check behind him without turning his head No one there either Ahead and to the left was a table with places set for two and a cold supper in place but no one in either chair Yet someone had spoken to him Someone whod been directly on the other side of the door from the sound Jonas drew his gun Come now said the voice which had bid him enter It came from directly behind Jonass left shoulder No need for that were all friends here All on the same side you know Jonas whirled on his heels suddenly feeling old and slow Standing there was a man of medium height powerfully built from the look of him with bright blue eyes and the rosy cheeks of either good health or good wine His parted smiling lips revealed cunning little teeth which must have been filed to points  surely such points couldnt be natural He wore a black robe like the robe of a holy man with the hood pushed back Jonass first thought that the fellow was bald had been wrong he saw The hair was simply cropped so stringently that it was nothing but fuzz Put the beanshooter away the man in black said Were friends here I tell you  absolutely palsywalsy Well break bread and speak of many things  oxen and oiltankers and whether or not Frank Sinatra really was a better crooner than Der Bingle Who A better what No one you know nothing that matters The man in black tittered again It was Jonas thought the sort of sound one might expect to hear drifting through the barred windows of a lunatic asylum He turned Looked into the mirror again This time he saw the man in black standing there and smiling at him big as life Gods had he been there all along Yes but you couldnt see him until he was ready to be seen I dont know if hes a wizard but hes a glamorman all right Mayhap even Farson s sorcerer He turned back The man in the priests robe was still smiling No pointed teeth now But they had been pointed Jonas would lay his watch and warrant on it Wheres Rimer I sent him away to work with young sai Delgado on her Reaping Day catechisms the man in black said He slung a chummy arm around Jonass shoulders and began leading him toward the table Best we palaver alone I think Jonas didnt want to offend Farsons man but he couldnt bear the touch of that arm He couldnt say why but it was unbearable Pestilential He shrugged it off and went on to one of the chairs trying not to shiver No wonder Depape had come back from Hanging Rock looking pale No damned wonder Instead of being offended the man in black tittered again Yes Jonas thought he does laugh like the dead very like so he does For one moment Jonas thought it was Fardo Corts father in this room with him  that it was the man who had sent him west all those years ago  and he reached for his gun again Then it was just the man in black smiling at him in an unpleasantly knowing way those blue eyes dancing like the flame from the gasjets See something interesting sai Jonas Aye Jonas said sitting down Eats He took a piece of bread and popped it into his mouth The bread stuck to his dry tongue but he chewed determinedly all the same Good boy The other also sat and poured wine filling Jonass glass first Now my friend tell me everything youve done since the three troublesome boys arrived and everything you know and everything you have planned I would not have you leave out a single jot First show me your sigul Of course How prudent you are The man in black reached inside his robe and brought out a square of metal  silver Jonas guessed He tossed it onto the table and it clattered across to Jonass plate Engraved on it was what he had expected  that hideous staring eye Satisfied Jonas nodded Slide it back to me Jonas reached for it but for once his normally steady hand resembled his reedy unstable voice He watched the fingers tremble for a moment then lowered the hand quickly to the table I I dont want to No He didnt want to Suddenly he knew that if he touched it the engraved silver eye would roll and look directly at him The man in black tittered and made a comealong gesture with the fingers of his right hand The silver buckle that was what it looked like to Jonas slid back to him    and up the sleeve of his homespun robe Abracadabra Bool The end Now the man in black went on sipping his wine delicately if we have finished the tiresome formalities One more Jonas said You know my name I would know yours Call me Walter the man in black said and the smile suddenly fell off his lips Good old Walter thats me Now let us see where we are and where were going Let us in short palaver  When Cuthbert came back into the bunkhouse night had fallen Roland and Alain were playing cards They had cleaned the place up so that it looked almost as it had thanks to turpentine found in a closet of the old foremans office even the slogans written on the walls were just pink ghosts of their former selves and now were deeply involved in a game of Casa Fuerte or Hotpatch as it was known in their own part of the world Either way it was basically a twoman version of Watch Me the cardgame which had been played in barrooms and bunkhouses and around campfires since the world was young Roland looked up at once trying to read Berts emotional weather Outwardly Roland was as impassive as ever had even played Alain to a draw across four difficult hands but inwardly he was in a turmoil of pain and indecision Alain had told him what Cuthbert had said while the two of them stood talking in the yard and they were terrible things to hear from a friend even when they came at second hand Yet what haunted him more was what Bert had said just before leaving Youve called your carelessness love and made a virtue of irresponsibility Was there even a chance he had done such a thing Over and over he told himself no  that the course he had ordered them to follow was hard but sensible the only course that made sense Cuthberts shouting was just so much angry wind brought on by nerves   and his fury at having their private place defiled so outrageously Still   Tell him hes right for the  wrong reasons and that makes him all the way wrong That couldnt be Could it Cuthbert was smiling and his color was high as if he had galloped most of the way back He looked young handsome and vital He looked happy in fact almost like the Cuthbert of old  the one whod been capable of babbling happy nonsense to a rooks skull until someone told him lo please please shut up But Roland didnt trust what he saw There was something wrong with the smile the color in Berts cheeks could have been anger rather than good health and the sparkle in his eyes looked like fever instead of humor Roland showed nothing on his own face but his heart sank Hed hoped the storm would blow itself out given a little time but he didnt think it had He shot a glance at Alain and saw that Alain felt the same Cuthbert it will be over in three weeks If only I could tell you that The thought which returned was stunning in its simplicity Why cant you He realized he didnt know Why had he been holding back keeping his own counsel For what purpose Had he been blind Gods had he Hello Bert he said did you have a nice r   Yes very nice a very nice ride an instructive ride Come outside I want to show you something Roland liked the thin glaze of hilarity in Berts eyes less and less but he laid his cards in a neat facedown fan on the table and got up Alain pulled at his sleeve No His voice was low and panicky Do you not see how he looks I see Roland said And felt dismay in his heart For the first time as he walked slowly toward the friend who no longer looked like a friend it occurred to Roland that he had been making decisions in a state close akin to drunkenness Or had he been making decisions at all He was no longer sure What is it youd show me Bert Something wonderful Bert said and laughed There was hate in the sound Perhaps murder Youll want a good close look at this I know you will Bert whats wrong with you Alain asked Wrong with me Nothing wrong with me Al  Im as happy as a dart at sunrise a bee in a flower a fish in the ocean And as he turned away to go back through the door he laughed again Dont go out there Alain said Hes lost his wits If our fellowship is broken any chance we might have of getting out of Mejis alive is gone Roland said That being the case Id rather die at the hands of a friend than an enemy He went out After a moment of hesitation Alain followed On his face was a look of purest misery  Huntress had gone and Demon had not yet begun to show his face but the sky was powdered with stars and they threw enough light to see by Cuthberts horse still saddled was tied to the hitching rail Beyond it the square of dusty dooryard gleamed like a canopy of tarnished silver What is it Roland asked They werent wearing guns any of them That was to be grateful for at least What would you show me Its here Cuthbert stopped at a point midway between the bunkhouse and the charred remains of the home place He pointed with great assurance but Roland could see nothing out of the ordinary He walked over to Cuthbert and looked down I dont see   Brilliant light  starshine times a thousand  exploded in his head as Cuthberts fist drove against the point of his chin It was the first time except in play and as very small boys that Bert had ever struck him Roland didnt lose consciousness but he did lose control over his arms and legs They were there but seemingly in another country flailing like the limbs of a rag doll He went down on his back Dust puffed up around him The stars seemed strangely in motion running in arcs and leaving milky trails behind them There was a high ringing in his ears From a great distance he heard Alain scream Oh you fool You stupid fool By making a tremendous effort Roland was able to turn his head He saw Alain start toward him and saw Cuthbert no longer smiling push him away This is between us Al You stay out of it You suckerpunched him you bastard Alain slow to anger was now building toward a rage Cuthbert might well regret Ihave to get up Roland thought Ihave to get between them before something even worse happens His arms and legs began to swim weakly in the dust Yes  thats how hes played us Cuthbert said I only returned the favor He looked down Thats what I wanted to show you Roland That particular piece of ground That particular puff of dust in which you are now lying Get a good taste of it Mayhap itll wake you up Now Rolands own anger began to rise He felt the coldness that was seeping into his thoughts fought it and realized he was losing Jonas ceased to matter the tankers at Citgo ceased to matter the supply conspiracy they had uncovered ceased to matter Soon the Affiliation and the katet he had been at such pains to preserve would cease to matter as well The surface numbness was leaving his feet and legs and he pushed himself to a sitting position He looked up calmly at Bert his tented hands on the ground his face set Starshine swam in his eyes I love you Cuthbert but Ill have no more insubordination and jealous tantrums If I paid you back for all I reckon youd finish in pieces so Im only going to pay you for hitting me when I didnt know it was coming And Ive no doubt ye can cully Cuthbert said falling effortlessly into the Hambry patois But first ye might want to have a peek at this Almost contemptuously he tossed a folded sheet of paper It hit Rolands chest and bounced into his lap Roland picked it up feeling the fine point of his developing rage lose its edge What is it Open and see Theres enough starlight to read by Slowly with reluctant fingers Roland unfolded the sheet of paper and read what was printed there He read it twice The second time was actually harder because his hands had begun to tremble He saw every place he and Susan had met  the boathouse the hut the shackand now he saw them in a new light knowing someone else had seen them too How clever he had believed they were being How confident of their secrecy and their discretion And yet someone had been watching all the time Susan had been right Someone had seen Ive put everything at risk Her life as well as our lives Tell him what I said about the doorway to hell And Susans voice too Ka like a wind    if you love me then love me So he had done believing in his youthful arrogance that everything would turn out all right for no other reason  yes at bottom he had believed this  than that he was he and ka must serve his love Ive been a fool he said His voice trembled like his hands Yes indeed Cuthbert said So you have He dropped to his knees in the dust facing Roland Now if you want to hit me hit away Hard as you want and as many as you can manage Ill not hit back Ive done all I can to wake you up to your responsibilities If you still sleep so be it Either way I still love you Bert put his hands on Rolands shoulders and briefly kissed his friends cheek Roland began to cry They were partly tears of gratitude but mostly those of mingled shame and confusion there was even a small dark part of him that hated Cuthbert and always would That part hated Cuthbert more on account of the kiss than because of the unexpected punch on the jaw more for the forgiveness than the awakening He got to his feet still holding the letter in one dusty hand the other ineffectually brushing his cheeks and leaving damp smears there When he staggered and Cuthbert put out a hand to steady him Roland pushed him so hard that Cuthbert himself would have fallen if Alain hadnt caught hold of his shoulders Then slowly Roland went back down again  this time in front of Cuthbert with his hands up and his head down Roland no Cuthbert cried Yes Roland said I have forgotten the face of my father and cry your pardon Yes all right for gods sake yes Cuthbert now sounded as if he were crying himself Just please get up It breaks my heart to see you so And mine to be so Roland thought To be humbled so But I brought it on myself didnt I This dark yard with my head throbbing and my heart full of shame and fear This is mine bought and paid for They helped him up and Roland let himself be helped Thats quite a left Bert he said in a voice that almost passed for normal Only when its going toward someone who doesnt know its coming Cuthbert replied This letter  how did you come by it Cuthbert told of meeting Sheemie who had been dithering along in his own misery as if waiting for ka to intervene  and in the person of Arthur Heath ka had From the witch Roland mused Yes but how did she know For she never leaves the Coos or so Susan has told me I cant say Nor do I much care What Im most concerned about right now is making sure that Sheemie isnt hurt because of what he told me and gave me After that Im concerned that what old witch Rhea has tried to tell once she doesnt try to tell again Ive made at least one terrible mistake Roland said but I dont count loving Susan as another That was beyond me to change As it was beyond her Do you believe that Yes Alain said at once and after a moment almost reluctantly Cuthbert said Aye Roland Ive been arrogant and stupid If this note had reached her aunt she could have been sent into exile And we to the devil by way of hangropes Cuthbert added dryly Although I know thats a minor matter to you by comparison What about the witch Alain asked What do we do about her Roland smiled a little and turned toward the northwest Rhea he said Whatever else she is shes a firstclass troublemaker is she not And troublemakers must be put on notice He started back toward the bunkhouse trudging with his head down Cuthbert looked at Alain and saw that Al was also a little tearyeyed Bert put out his hand For a moment Alain only looked at it Then he nodded  to himself rather than to Cuthbert it seemed  and shook it You did what you had to Alain said I had my doubts at first but not now Cuthbert let out his breath And I did it the way I had to If I hadnt surprised him     he would have beaten you black and blue So many more colors than that Cuthbert said I would have looked like a rainbow The Wizards Rainbow even Alain said Extra colors for your penny That made Cuthbert laugh The two of them walked back toward the bunkhouse where Roland was unsaddling Berts horse Cuthbert turned in that direction to help but Alain held him back Leave him alone for a little while he said Its best you do They went on ahead and when Roland came in ten minutes later he found Cuthbert playing his hand And winning with it Bert he said Cuthbert looked up We have a spot of business tomorrow you and I Up on the Coos Are we going to kill her Roland thought and thought hard At last he looked up biting his lip We should Aye We should But are we going to Not unless we have to I reckon Later he would regret this decision  if it was a decision  bitterly but there never came a time when he did not understand it He had been a boy not much older than Jake Chambers during that Mejis fall and the decision to kill does not come easily or naturally to most boys Not unless she makes us Perhaps it would be best if she did Cuthbert said It was hard gunslinger talk but he looked troubled as he said it Yes Perhaps it would Its not likely though not in one as sly as her Be ready to get up early All right Do you want your hand back When youre on the verge of knocking him out Not at all Roland went past them to his bunk There he sat looking at his folded hands in his lap He might have been praying he might only have been thinking hard Cuthbert looked at him for a moment then turned back to his cards  The sun was just over the horizon when Roland and Cuthbert left the next morning The Drop still drenched with morning dew seemed to bum with orange fire in the early light Their breath and that of their horses puffed frosty in the air It was a morning neither of them ever forgot For the first time in their lives they went forth wearing bolstered revolvers for the first time in their lives they went into the world as gunslingers Cuthbert said not a word  he knew that if he started hed do nothing but babble great streams of his usual nonsense  and Roland was quiet by nature There was only one exchange between them and it was brief I said I made at least one very bad mistake Roland told him One that this note  he touched his breast pocket  brought home to me Do you know what that mistake was Not loving her  not that Cuthbert said You called that ka and I call it the same It was a relief to be able to say this and a greater one to believe it Cuthbert thought he could even accept Susan herself now not us his best friends lover a girl he had wanted himself the first time he saw her but as a part of their entwined fate No Roland said Not loving her but thinking that love could somehow be apart from everything else That I could live two lives  one with you and Al and our job here one with her I thought that love could lilt me above ka the way a birds wings can take it above all the things that would kill it and eat it otherwise Do you understand It made you blind Cuthbert spoke with a gentleness quite foreign to the young man who had suffered through the last two months Yes Roland said sadly It made me blind    but now I see Come on a little faster if you please I want to get this over  They rode up the rutty carttrack along which Susan a Susan who had known a good deal less about the ways of the world had come singing Careless Love beneath the light of the Kissing Moon Where the track opened into Rheas yard they stopped Wonderful view Roland murmured You can see the whole sweep of the desert from here Not much to say about the view right here in front of us though That was true The garden was full of unpicked mutie vegetables the stuffyguy presiding over them either a bad joke or a bad omen The yard supported just one tree now moulting sicklylooking fall leaves like an old vulture shedding its feathers Beyond the tree was the hut itself made of rough stone and topped by a single sooty pot of a chimney with a hexsign painted on it in sneering yellow At the rear comer beyond one overgrown window was a woodpile Roland had seen plenty of huts like it  the three of them had passed any number on their way here from Gilead  but never one that felt as powerfully wrong as this He saw nothing untoward yet there was a feeling too strong to be denied of a presence One that watched and waited Cuthbert felt it too Do we have to go closer lie swallowed Do we have to go in Because    Roland the door is open Do you see He saw As if she expected them As if she was inviting them in wanting them to sit down with her to some unspeakable breakfast Stay here Roland gigged Rusher forward No Im coming No cover my back If I need to go inside Ill call you to join me  but if I need to go inside the old woman who lives here will breathe no more As you said that might be for the best At every slow step Rusher took the feeling of wrongness grew in Rolands heart and mind There was a stench to the place a smell like rotten meat and hot putrefied tomatoes It came from the hut he supposed but it also seemed to come wafting out of the very ground And at every step the whine of the thinny seemed louder as if the atmosphere of this place somehow magnified it Susan came up here alone and in the dark he thought Gods Im not sure I could have come up here in the dark with my friends for company He stopped beneath the tree looking through the open door twenty paces away He saw what could have been a kitchen the legs of a table the back of a chair a filthy hearthstone No sign of the lady of the house But she was there Roland could feel her eyes crawling on him like loathsome bugs I cant see her because shes used her art to make herself dim but shes there And just perhaps he did see her The air had a strange shimmer just inside the door to the right as if it had been heated Roland had been told that you could see someone who was dim by turning your head and looking from the comer of your eye He did that now Roland Cuthbert called from behind him Fine so far Bert Barely paying attention to the words he was saying because  yes That shimmer was clearer now and it had almost the shape of a woman It could be his imagination of course but But at that moment as if understanding hed seen her the shimmer moved farther back into the shadows Roland glimpsed the swinging hem of an old black dress there and then gone No matter He had not come to see her but only to give her her single warning    which was one more than any of their fathers would have given her no doubt Rhea His voice rolled in the harsh tones of old stem and commanding Two yellow leaves fell from the tree as if shivered loose by that voice and one fell in his black hair From the hut came only a waiting listening silence    and then the discordant jeering yowl of a cat Rhea daughter of none Ive brought something back to you woman Something you must have lost From his shirt he took the folded letter and tossed it to the stony ground Today Ive been your friend Rhea  if this had gone where you had intended it to go you would have paid with your life He paused Another leaf drifted down from the tree This one landed in Pushers mane Hear me well Rhea daughter of none and understand me well I have come here under the name of Will Dearborn but Dearborn is not my name and it is the Affiliation I serve More tis all which lies behind the Affiliation  tis the power of the White You have crossed the way of our ka and I warn you only this once do not cross it again Do you understand Only that waiting silence Do not touch a single hair on the head of the boy who carried your hadnatured mischief hence or youll die Speak not another word of those things you know or think you know to anyone  not to Cordelia Delgado nor to Jonas nor to Rimer nor to Thorin  or youll die Keep your peace and we will keep ours Break it and well still you Do you understand More silence Dirty windows peering at him like eyes A puff of breeze sent more leaves showering down around him and caused the stuffyguy to creak nastily on his pole Roland thought briefly of the cook Hax twisting at the end of his rope Do you understand No reply Not even a shimmer could he see through the open door now Very well Roland said Silence gives consent He gigged his horse around As he did his head came up a little and he saw something green shift above him among the yellow leaves There was a low hissing sound Roland look out Snake Cuthbert screamed but before the second word had left his mouth Roland had drawn one of his guns He fell sideways in the saddle holding with his left leg and heel as Rusher jigged and pranced He fired three times the thunder of the big gun smashing through the still air and then rolling back from the nearby hills With each shot the snake flipped upward again its blood dotting red across a background of blue sky and yellow leaves The last bullet tore off its head and when the snake fell for good it hit the ground in two pieces From within the hut came a wail of grief and rage so awful that Rolands spine turned to a cord of ice You bastard screamed a womans voice from the shadows Oh you murdering cull My friend My friend  If it was your friend you oughtnt to have set it on me Roland said Remember Rhea daughter of none The voice uttered one more shriek and fell silent Roland rode back to Cuthbert bolstering his gun Berts eyes were round and amazed Roland what shooting Gods what shooting Lets get out of here But we still dont know how she knew Do you think shed tell There was a small but minute shake in Rolands voice The way the snake had come out of the tree like that right at him  he could still barely believe he wasnt dead Thank gods for his hand which had taken matters over We could make her talk Cuthbert said but Roland could tell from his voice that Bert had no taste for such Maybe later maybe after years of trailriding and gunslinging but now he had no more stomach for torture than for killing outright Even if we could we couldnt make her tell the truth Such as her lies as other folks breathe If weve convinced her to keep quiet weve done enough for today Come on I hate this place  As they rode back toward town Roland said Weve got to meet The four of us Thats what you mean isnt it Yes I want to tell everything I know and surmise I want to tell you my plan such as it is What weve been waiting for That would be very good indeed Susan can help us Roland seemed to be speaking to himself Cuthbert was amused to see that the lone crown like leaf was still caught in his dark hair Susan was meant to help us Why didnt I see that Because love is blind Cuthbert said He snorted laughter and clapped Roland on the shoulder Love is blind old son  When she was sure the boys were gone Rhea crept out of her door and into the hateful sunshine She hobbled across to the tree and fell on her knees by the tattered length of her snake weeping loudly Ermot Ermot she cried See whats become of ye There was his head the mouth frozen open the double fangs still dripping poison  clear drops that shone like prisms in the days strengthening light The glazing eyes glared She picked Ermot up kissed the scaly mouth licked the last of the venom from the exposed needles crooning and weeping all the while Next she picked up the long and tattered body with her other hand moaning at the holes which had been torn into Ermots satiny hide the holes and the ripped red flesh beneath Twice she put the head against the body and spoke incantations but nothing happened Of course not Ermot had gone beyond the aid of her spells Poor Ermot She held his head to one flattened old dug and his body to the other Then with the last of his blood wetting the bodice of her dress she looked in the direction the hateful boys had gone Ill pay ye back she whispered By all the gods that ever were Ill pay ye back When ye least expect it there Rhea will be and your screams will break your throats Do you hear me Your screams will break your throats She knelt a moment longer then got up and shuffled back toward her hut holding Ermot to her bosom On an afternoon three days after Rolands and Cuthberts visit to the Coos Roy Depape and Clay Reynolds walked along the upstairs hallway of the Travellers Rest to the spacious bedroom Coral Thorin kept there Clay knocked Jonas called for them to come in it was open The first thing Depape saw upon entering was sai Thorin herself in a rocker by the window She wore a foamy nightdress of white silk and a red bufanda on her head She had a lapful of knitting Depape looked at her in surprise She offered him and Reynolds an enigmatic smile said Hello gents and returned to her needlework Outside there was a rattle of firecrackers young folks could never wait until the big day if they had crackers in their hands they had to set match to them the nervous whinny of a horse and the raucous laughter of boys Depape turned to Reynolds who shrugged and then crossed his arms to hold the sides of his cloak In this way he expressed doubt or disapproval or both Problem Jonas was standing in the doorway to the bathroom wiping shaving soap from his face with the end of the towel laid over his shoulder He was bare to the waist Depape had seen him that way plenty of times but the old white crisscrossings of scars always made him feel a little sick to his stomach Well I knew we was using the ladys room I just didnt know the lady came with it She does Jonas tossed the towel into the bathroom crossed to the bed and took his shirt from where it hung on one of the footposts Beyond him Coral glanced up gave his naked back a single greedy look then went back to her work once more Jonas slipped into his shirt How arc things at Citgo Clay Quiet But itll get noisy if certain young vagabundos poke their nosy noses in How many are out there and how do they set Ten in the days A dozen at night Roy or I are out once every shift but like I say its been quiet Jonas nodded but he wasnt happy Hed hoped to draw the boys out to Citgo before now just as hed hoped to draw them into a confrontation by vandalizing their place and killing their pigeons Yet so far they still hid behind their damned Hillock He felt like a man in a field with three young bulls Hes got a red rag this wouldbe torero and hes napping it for all hes worth and still the toros refuse to charge Why The moving operation How goes that Like clockwork Reynolds said Four tankers a night in pairs the last four nights Renfrews in charge him of the Lazy Susan Do you still want to leave half a dozen as bait Yar Jonas said and there was a knock at the door Depape jumped Is that   No Jonas said Our friend in the black robe has decamped Perhaps he goes to offer comfort to the Good Mans troops before battle Depape barked laughter at that By the window the woman in the nightgown looked down at her knitting and said nothing Its open Jonas called The man who stepped in was wearing the sombrero scrape and sandalias of a farmer or vaquero but the face was pale and the lock of hair peeking out from beneath the sombreros brim was blond It was Latigo A hard man and no mistake but a great improvement over the laughing man in the black robe just the same Good to see you gentlemen he said coming in and closing the door His face  dour frowning  was that of a man who hasnt seen anything good in years Maybe since birth Jonas Are you well Do things march I am and they do Jonas said He offered his hand Latigo gave it a quick dry shake He didnt do the same for Depape or Reynolds but glanced at Coral instead Long days and pleasant nights lady And may you have twice the number sai Latigo she said without looking up from her knitting Latigo sat on the end of the bed produced a sack of tobacco from beneath his scrape and began rolling a cigarette I wont stay long he said He spoke in the abrupt clipped tones of northern InWorld where  or so Depape had heard  reindeerfucking was still considered the chief sport If you ran slower than your sister that was It wouldnt be wise I dont quite fit in if one looks closely No Reynolds said sounding amused You dont Latigo gave him a sharp glance then returned his attention to Jonas Most of my party is camped thirty wheels from here in the forest west of Eyebolt Canyon    what is that wretched noise inside the canyon by the way It frightens the horses A thinny Jonas said It scares the men too if they get too close Reynolds said Best to stay away capn How many are you Jonas asked A hundred And well armed So its said were Lord Perths men Dont be an ass Have they seen any fighting Enough to know what it is Latigo said and Jonas knew he was lying Farson had kept his veterans in their mountain boltholes Here was a little expeditionary force where no doubt only the sergeants were able to do more with their cocks than run water through them There are a dozen at Hanging Rock guarding the tankers your men have brought so far Latigo said More than needed likely I didnt risk coming into this godforsaken shitsplat of a town in order to discuss my arrangements with you Jonas Cry your pardon sai Jonas replied but perfunctorily He sat on the floor next to Corals rocker and began to roll a smoke of his own She put her knitting aside and began to stroke his hair Depape didnt know what there was about her that Eldred found so fascinating  when he himself looked he saw only an ugly bitch with a big nose and mosquitobump tittles As to the three young men Latigo said with the air of a fellow going directly to the heart of the matter The Good Man was extremely disturbed to learn there were visitors from InWorld in Mejis And now you tell me they arent what they claim to be So just what are they Jonas brushed Corals hand away from his hair as though it were ii troublesome insect Undisturbed she returned to her knitting Theyre not young men but mere boys and if their coming here is ka  about which I know Farson concerns himself deeply  then it may be our ka rather than the Affiliations Unfortunately well have to forgo enlightening the Good Man with your theological conclusions Latigo said Weve brought radios but theyre either broken or cant work at this distance No one knows which I hate all such toys anyway The gods laugh at them Were on our own my friend For good or ill No need for Farson to worry unnecessarily Jonas said The Good Man wants these lads treated as a threat to his plans I expect Walter told you the same thing Aye And I havent forgotten a word Sai Walter is an unforgettable sort of man Yes Latigo agreed Hes the Good Mans underliner The chief reason he came to you was to underline these boys And so he did Roy tell sai Latigo about your visit to the Sheriff day before yesterday Depape cleared his throat nervously The sheriff    Avery   I know him fat as a pig in Full Earth he is Latigo said Go on One of Averys deputies carried a message to the three boys as they counted horse on the Drop What message Stay out of town on Reaping Day stay off the Drop on Reaping Day best to stay close to your quarters on Reaping Day as Barony folk dont enjoy seeing outlanders even those they like when they keep their festivals And how did they take it They agreed straight away to keep to themselves on Reaping Depape said Thats been their habit all along to be just as agreeable as pie when somethings asked of em They know better course they do  theres no more a custom here against outlanders on Reaping than there is anyplace else In fact its quite usual to make strangers a part of the merrymaking as Im sure the boys know The idea     is to make them believe we plan to move on FairDay itself yes yes Latigo finished impatiently What I want to know is are they convinced Can you take them on the day before Reaping as youve promised or will they be waiting Depape and Reynolds looked at Jonas Jonas reached behind him and put his hand on Corals narrow but not uninteresting thigh Here it was he thought He would be held to what he said next and without grace If he was right the Big Coffin Hunters would be thanked and paid  perhaps bonused as well If he was wrong they would likely be hung so high and hard that their heads would pop off when they hit the end of the rope Well take them easy as birds on the ground Jonas said Treason the charge Three young men all highbom in the pay of John Parson Shocking stuff What could be more indicative of the evil days we live in One cry of treason and the mob appears Jonas favored Latigo with a wintry smile As a concept treason might be a bit of a reach for the common folk even when the mobs drunk and the cores been bought and paid for by the Horsemens Association Murder though   especially that of a much loved Mayor   Depapes startled eyes flew to the Mayors sister What a pity it will be that lady said and sighed I may be moved to lead the rabble myself Depape thought he finally understood Eldreds attraction here was a woman every bit as coldblooded as Jonas himself One other matter Latigo said A piece of the Good Mans property was sent with you for safekeeping A certain glass ball Jonas nodded Yes indeed A pretty trifle I understand you left it with the local bruja Yes You should take it back Soon Dont teach your grandpa to suck eggs Jonas said a bit testily Im waiting until the brats are jugged Reynolds murmured curiously Have you seen it yourself sai Latigo Not close up but Ive seen men who have Latigo paused One such ran mad and had to be shot The only other time I saw anyone in such condition was thirty years ago on the edge of the big desert Twas a hutdweller whod been bitten by a rabid coyote Bless the Turtle Reynolds muttered and tapped his throat three times He was terrified of rabies You wont bless anything if the Wizards Rainbow gets hold of you Latigo said grimly and swung his attention back to Jonas Youll want to be even more careful taking it back than you were in giving it over The old witchwomans likely under its glam by now I intend to send Rimer and Avery Avery aint much of a shake but Rimers a trig boy Im afraid that wont do Latigo said Wont it Jonas said His hand tightened on Corals leg and he smiled unpleasantly at Latigo Perhaps you could tell your umble servant why it wont do It was Coral who answered Because said she when the piece of the Wizards Rainbow Rhea holds is taken back into custody the Chancellor will be busy accompanying my brother to his final resting place Whats she talking about Eldred Depape asked That Rimer dies too Jonas said He began to grin Another foul crime to lay at the feet of John Farsons filthy spyboys Coral smiled in sweet agreement put her hands over Jonass moved it higher on her thigh and then picked up her knitting again  The girl although young was married The boy although fair was unstable She met him one night in a remote place to tell him their affair sweet as it had been must end He replied that it would never end it was written in the stars She told him that might be but at some point the constellations had changed Perhaps he began to weep Perhaps she laughed  out of nervousness very likely Whatever the cause such laughter was disastrously timed He picked up a stone and dashed out her brains with it Then coming to his senses and realizing what he had done he sat down with his back against a granite slab drew her poor battered head into his lap and cut his own throat as an owl looked on from a nearby tree He died covering her face with kisses and when they were found their lips were sealed together with his lifes blood and with hers An old story Every town has its version The site is usually the local lovers lane or a secluded stretch of riverbank or the town graveyard Once the details of what actually happened have been distorted enough to please the morbidly romantic songs are made These are usually sung by yearning virgins who play guitar or mando badly and cannot quite stay on key Choruses tend to include such lachrymose refrains as MydiIdeIdeo There they died togethero The Hambry version of this quaint tale featured lovers named Robert and Francesca and had happened in the old days before the world had moved on The site of the supposed murdersuicide was the Hambry cemetery the stone with which Francescas brains had been dashed out was a slate marker and the granite wall against which Robert had been leaning when he clipped his blowpipe had been the Thorin mausoleum It was doubtful there had been any Thorins in Hambry or Mejis five generations back but folktales are at best generally no more than lies set in rhyme True or untrue the graveyard was considered haunted by the ghosts of the lovers who could be seen it was said walking handinhand among the markers covered with blood and looking wistful It was thus seldom visited at night and was a logical spot for Roland Cuthbert Alain and Susan to meet By the time the meeting took place Roland had begun to feel increasingly worried    even desperate Susan was the problem  or more properly put Susans aunt Even without Rheas poisonous letter to help the process along Cordelias suspicions of Susan and Roland had hardened into a near certainty On a day less than a week before the meeting in the cemetery Cordelia had begun shrieking at Susan almost as soon as she stepped through the house door with her basket over her arm Yeve been with him Ye have ye bad girl its written all over yer face Susan who had that day been nowhere near Roland could at first only gape at her aunt Been with who Oh be not coy with me Miss Oh So Young and Pretty Be not coy I pray Who does all but wiggle his tongue at ye when he passes our door Dearborn thats who Dearborn Dearborn Ill say it a thousand times Oh shame on ye Shame Look at yer trousers Green from the grass the two of ye have been rolling in they are Im surprised theyre not torn open at the crutch as well By then Aunt Cord had been nearly shrieking The veins in her neck stood out like rope Susan bemused had looked down at the old khaki pants she was wearing Aunt its paint  dont you see it is Chetta and Ive been making FairDay decorations up at Mayors House Whats on my bottom got there when Hart Thorin  not Dearborn but Thorin  came upon me in the shed where the decorations and fireworks are stored He decided it was as good a time and place as any to have another little wrestle He got on top of me shot his squirt into his pants again and went off happy Humming he was She wrinkled her nose although the most she felt for Thorin these days was a kind of sad distaste Her fear of him had passed Aunt Cord meanwhile had been looking at her with glittery eyes For the first time Susan found herself wondering consciously about Cordelias sanity A likely story Cordelia whispered at last There were little beads of perspiration above her eyebrows and the nestles of blue veins at her temples ticked like clocks She even had a smell these days no matter if she bathed or not  a rancid acrid one Did ye work it out together as ye cuddled afterward thee and him Susan had stepped forward grabbed her aunts bony wrist and clapped it to the stain on one of her knees Cordelia cried out and tried to pull away but Susan held fast She then raised the hand to her aunts face holding it there until she knew Cordelia had smelled what was on her palm Does thee smell it Aunt Paint We used it on ricepaper for colored lanterns The tension had slowly gone out of the wrist in Susans hand The eyes looking into hers regained a measure of clarity Aye she had said at last Paint A pause This time Since then Susan had all too often turned her head to see a narrowhipped figure gliding after her in the street or one of her aunts many friends marking her course with suspicious eyes When she rode on the Drop she now always had the sensation of being watched Twice before the four of them came together in the graveyard she had agreed to meet Roland and his friends Both times she had been forced to break off the second at the very last moment On that occasion she had seen Brian Hockeys eldest son watching her in an odd intent way It had only been intuition  but strong intuition What made matters worse for her was that she was as frantic for a meeting as Roland himself and not just for palaver She needed to see his face and to clasp one of his hands between both of hers The rest sweet as it was could wait but she needed to see him and touch him needed to make sure he wasnt Just a dream spun by a lonely frightened girl to comfort herself In the end Maria had helped her  gods bless the little maid who perhaps understood more than Susan could ever guess It was Maria who had gone to Cordelia with a note saying that Susan would be spending the night in the guest wing at Seafront The note was from Olive Thorin and in spite of all her suspicions Cordelia could not quite believe it a forgery As it was not Olive had written it listlessly and without questions when Susan asked Whats wrong with my niece Cordelia had snapped She tired sai And with the dolor de garganta Sore throat So close before FairDay Ridiculous I dont believe it Susans never sick Dolor de garganta Maria repeated impassive as only a peasant woman can be in the face of disbelief and with that Cordelia had to be satisfied Maria herself had no idea what Susan was up to and that was just the way Susan liked it Shed gone over the balcony moving nimbly down the fifteen feet of tangled vines growing up the north side of the building and through the rear servants door in the wall There Roland had been waiting and after two warm minutes with which we need not concern ourselves they rode double on Rusher to the graveyard where Cuthbert and Alain waited full of expectation and nervous hope  Susan looked first at the placid blond one with the round face whose name was not Richard Stockworth but Alain Johns Then at the other one  he from whom she had sensed such doubt of her and perhaps even anger at her Cuthbert Allgood was his name They sat side by side on a fallen gravestone which had been overrun with ivy their feet in a little brook of mist Susan slid from Rushers back and approached them slowly They stood up Alain made an InWorld bow leg out knee locked heel stiffly planted Lady he said Long days   Now the other was beside him  thin and dark with a face that would have been handsome had it not seemed so restless His dark eyes were really quite beautiful   and pleasant nights Cuthbert finished doubling Alains bow I he two of them looked so like comic courtiers in a FairDay sketch that Susan laughed She couldnt help herself Then she curtseyed to them deeply spreading her arms to mime the skirts she wasnt wearing And may you have twice the number gentlemen Then they simply looked at each other three young people who were uncertain exactly how to proceed Roland didnt help he sat astride K usher and only watched carefully Susan took a tentative step forward not laughing now There were still dimples at the comers of her lips but her eyes were anxious I hope you dont hate me she said Id understand it if you did  Ive come into your plans  and between the three of you as well  but I couldnt help it Her hands were still out at her sides Now she raised them to Alain and Cuthbert palms up I love him We dont hate you Alain said Do we Bert For a terrible moment Cuthbert was silent looking over Susans shoulder seeming to study the waxing Demon Moon She felt her heart stop Then his gaze returned to her and he gave a smile of such sweetness that a confused but brilliant thought If Id met this one first   it began shot through her mind like a comet Rolands love is my love Cuthbert said He reached out took her hands and drew her forward so she stood between him and Alain like a sister with her two brothers For we have been friends since we wore cradleclothes and well continue as friends until one of us leaves the path and enters the clearing Then he grinned like a kid Mayhap well all find the end of the path together the way things are going And soon Alain added Just so long Susan Delgado finished as my Aunt Cordelia doesnt come along as our chaperone  We are katet Roland said We are one from many He looked at each in turn and saw no disagreement in their eyes They had repaired to the mausoleum and their breath smoked from their mouths and noses Roland squatted on his hunkers looking at the other three who sat in a line on a stone meditation bench flanked by skeletal bouquets in stone pots The floor was scattered with the petals of dead roses Cuthbert and Alain on either side of Susan had their arms around her in quite unselfconscious fashion Again Roland thought of one sister and two protective brothers Were greater than we were Alain said I feel that very strongly I do too Cuthbert said He looked around And a fine meetingplace as well Especially for such a katet as ours Roland didnt smile repartee had never been his strong suit Lets talk about whats going on in Hambry he said and then well talk about the immediate future We werent sent here on a mission you know Alain said to Susan We were sent by our fathers to get us out of the way thats all Roland excited the enmity of a man who is likely a cohort of John Parsons    Excited the enmity of  Cuthbert said Thats a good phrase Round I intend to remember it and use it at every opportunity Control yourself Roland said Ive no desire to be here all night Cry your pardon O great one Cuthbert said but his eyes danced in a decidedly unrepentant way We came with carrier pigeons for the sending and receiving of messages Alain went on but I think the pigeons were laid on so our parents could be sure we were all right Yes Cuthbert said What Alains trying to say is that weve been caught by surprise Roland and I have had  disagreements  about how to go on He wanted to wait I didnt I now believe he was right But for the wrong reasons Roland said in a dry tone In any case weve settled our differences Susan was looking back and forth between them with something like alarm What her gaze settled upon was the bruise on Rolands lower left jaw clearly visible even in the faint light which crept through the halfopen sepultura door Settled them how It doesnt matter Roland said Farson intends a battle or perhaps a series of them in the Shaved Mountains to the northwest of Gilead To the forces of the Affiliation moving toward him he will seem trapped In a more ordinary course of things that might even have been true Farson intends to engage them trap them and destroy them with the weapons of the Old People These he will drive with oil from Citgo The oil in the tankers we saw Susan Where will it be refined so Farson can use it Someplace west of here along his route Cuthbert said We think very likely the Vi Castis Do you know it Its mining country Ive heard of it but Ive never actually been out of Hambry in my life She looked levelly at Roland I think thats to change soon Theres a good deal of machinery left over from the days of the Old People in those mountains Alain said Most is up in the draws and canyons they say Robots and killer lights  razorbeams such are called because theyll cut you clean in half if you run into them The gods know what else Some of its undoubtedly just legend but where theres smoke theres often fire In any case it seems the most likely spot for refining And then theyd take it on to where Farsons waiting Cuthbert said Not that that part matters to us weve got all we can handle right here in Mejis Ive been waiting in order to get it all Roland said Every bit of their damned plunder In case you havent noticed our friend is just a wee nubbin ambitious Cuthbert said and winked Roland paid no attention He was looking in the direction of Eyebolt Canyon There was no noise from there this night the wind had shifted onto its autumn course and away from town If we can fire the oil the rest will go up with it and the oil is the most important thing anyway I want to destroy it then I want to get the hell out of here The four of us They mean to move on Reaping Day dont they Susan asked Oh yes it seems so Cuthbert said then laughed It was a rich infectious sound  the laughter of a child  and as he did it he rocked back and forth and held his stomach as a child would Susan looked puzzled What What is it I cant tell he said chortling Its too rich for me Ill laugh all the way through it and Roland will be annoyed You do it Al Tell Susan about our visit from Deputy Dave He came out to see us at the Bar K Alain said smiling himself Talked to us like an uncle Told us Hambryfolk dont care for outsiders at their Fairs and wed best keep right to our place on the day of the full moon Thats insane Susan spoke indignantly as one is apt to when one hears ones hometown unjustly maligned We welcome strangers to our fairs so we do and always have Were not a bunch of of savages Soft soft Cuthbert said giggling We know that but Deputy Dave dont know we know do he He knows his wife makes the best white tea for miles around and after that Daves pretty much at sea Sheriff Herk knows a leetle more I shd judge but not much The pains theyve taken to warn us off means two things Roland said The first is that they intend to move on Reaping FairDay just as you said Susan The second is that they think they can steal Parsons goods right out from under our noses And then perhaps blame us for it afterward Alain said She looked curiously from one to the other then said What have you planned then To destroy what theyve left at Citgo as bait of our own and then to strike them where they gather Roland said quietly Thats Hanging Rock At least half the tankers they mean to take west are there already Theyll have a force of men As many as two hundred perhaps although I think it will turn out to be less I intend that all these men should die If they dont we will Alain said How can the four of us kill two hundred soldiers We cant But if we can start one or two of the clustered tankers burning we think therell be an explosion  mayhap a fearful one The surviving soldiers will be terrified and the surviving leaders infuriated Theyll see us because well let ourselves be seen  Alain and Cuthbert were watching him breathlessly The rest they had either been told or had guessed but this part was the counsel Roland had until now kept to himself What then she asked frightened What then  I think we can lead them into Eyebolt Canyon Roland said I think we can lead them into the thinny  Thunderstruck silence greeted this Then not without respect Susan said Youre mad No Cuthbert said thoughtfully Hes not Youre thinking about that little cut in the canyon wall arent you Roland The one just before the jog in the canyon floor Roland nodded Four could scramble up that way without too much trouble At the top well pile a fair amount of rock Enough to start a landslide down on any that should try following us Thats horrible Susan said Its survival Alain replied If theyre allowed to have the oil and put it to use theyll slaughter every Affiliation man that gets in range of their weapons The Good Man takes no prisoners I didnt say wrong only horrible They were silent for a moment four children contemplating the murders of two hundred men Except they wouldnt all be men many perhaps even most would be boys roughly their own ages At last she said Those not caught in your rockslide will only ride back out of the canyon again No they wont Alain had seen the lay of the land and now understood the matter almost completely Roland was nodding and there was a trace of a smile on his mouth Why not The brush at the front of the canyon Were going to set it on fire arent we Roland And if the prevailing winds are prevailing that day  the smoke  Itll drive them the rest of the way in Roland agreed Into the thinny How will you set the brushpile alight Susan asked I know its dry but surely you wont have time to use a sulfur match or your flint and steel You can help us there Roland said just as you can help us set the tankers alight We cant count on touching off the oil with just our guns you know crude oil is a lot less volatile than people might think And Sheemies going to help you I hope Tell me what you want  They talked another twenty minutes refining the plan surprisingly little  all of them seemed to understand that if they planned too much and things changed suddenly they might freeze Ka had swept them into this it was perhaps best that they count on ka  and their own courage  to sweep them back out again Cuthbert was reluctant to involve Sheemie but finally went along  the boys part would be minimal if not exactly lowrisk and Roland agreed that they could take him with them when they left Mejis for good A party of rive was as fine as a party of four he said All right Cuthbert said at last then turned to Susan It ought to be you or me who talks to him I will Make sure he understands not to tell Coral Thorin so much as a word Cuthbert said It isnt that the Mayors her brother I just dont trust that bitch I can give ye a better reason than Hart not to trust her Susan said My aunt says shes taken up with Eldred Jonas Poor Aunt Cord Shes had the worst summer of her life Nor will the fall be much better I wot Folk will call her the aunt of a traitor Some will know better Alain said Some always do Mayhap but my Aunt Cordelias the sort of woman who never hears good gossip No more does she speak it She fancied Jonas herself ye ken Cuthbert was thunderstruck Fancied Jonas By all the fiddling gods Can you imagine it Why if they hung folk for bad taste in love your auntie would go early wouldnt she Susan giggled hugged her knees and nodded Its time we left Roland said If something chances that Susan needs to know right away well use the red stone in the rock wall at Green Heart Good Cuthbert said Lets get out of here The cold in this place eats into the bones Roland stirred stretching life back into his legs The important thing is that theyve decided to leave us free while they round up and run Thats our edge and its a good one And now   Alains quiet voice stopped him Theres another matter Very important Roland sank back down on his hunkers looking at Alain curiously The witch Susan started but Roland only barked an impatient laugh She doesnt figure in our business Al  I cant see how she could I dont believe shes a part of Jonass conspiracy   Neither do I Alain said   and Cuthbert and I persuaded her to keep her mouth shut about Susan and me If we hadnt her aunt would have raised the roof by now But dont you see Alain asked Who Rhea might have told isnt really the question The question is how she knew in the first place Its pink Susan said abruptly Her hand was on her hair fingers touching the place where the cut ends had begun to grow out Whats pink Alain asked The moon she said and then shook her head I dont know I dont know what Im talking about Brainless as Pinch and Jilly I am  Roland Whats wrong What ails thee For Roland was no longer hunkering he had collapsed into a loose sitting position on the petalstrewn stone floor He looked like a young man trying not to faint Outside the mausoleum there was a bony rattle of fall leaves and the cry of a nightjar Dear gods he said in a low voice It cant be Itcant be true His eyes met Cuthberts All the humor had washed out of the latter young mans face leaving a ruthless and calculating bedrock his own mother might not have recognized  or might not have wanted to Pink Cuthbert said Isnt that interesting  the same word your father happened to mention just before we left Roland wasnt it He warned us about the pink one We thought it was a joke Almost Oh Alains eyes flew wide open Oh fuck  he blurted He realized what he had said while sitting legtoleg with his best friends lover and clapped his hands over his mouth His cheeks flamed red Susan barely noticed She was staring at Roland in growing fear and confusion What she asked What is it ye know Tell me Tell me Id like to hypnotize you again as I did that day in the willow grove Roland said I want to do it right now before we talk of this more and drag mud across what you remember Roland had reached into his pocket while she was speaking Now he took out a shell and it began to dance across the back of his hand once more Her eyes went to it at once like steel drawn to a magnet May I he asked By your leave dear Aye as ye will Her eyes were widening and growing glassy I dont know why ye think this time should be any different but   She stopped talking her eyes continuing to follow the dance of the shell across Rolands hand When he stopped moving it and clasped it in his fist her eyes closed Her breath was soft and regular Gods she went like a stone Cuthbert whispered amazed Shes been hypnotized before By Rhea I think Roland paused Then Susan do you hear me Aye Roland I hear ye very well I want you to hear another voice too Whose Roland beckoned to Alain If anyone could break through the block in Susans mind or find a way around it it would be him Mine Susan Alain said coming to Rolands side Do you know it She smiled with her eyes closed Aye youre Alain Richard Stockworth that was Thats right He looked at Roland with nervous questioning eyes  What shall I ask her  but for a moment Roland didnt reply He was in two other places both at the same time and hearing two different voices Susan by the stream in the willow grove She says Aye lovely just so its a good girl yare  then everythings pink His father in the yard behind the Great Hall Its the grapefruit By which I mean its the pink one The pink one  Their horses were saddled and loaded the three boys stood before them outwardly stolid inwardly feverish to be gone The road and the mysteries that lie along it calls out to none as it calls to the young They were in the courtyard which lay east of the Great Hall not far from where Roland had bested Cort setting all these things in motion It was early morning the sun not yet risen the mist lying over the green fields in gray ribbons At a distance of about twenty paces Cuthberts and Alains fathers stood sentry with their legs apart and their hands on the butts of their guns It was unlikely that Marten who had for the time being absented himself from the palace and so far as any knew from Gilead itself would mount any sort of attack on them  not here  but it wasnt entirely out of the question either So it was that only Rolands father spoke to them as they mounted up to begin their ride east to Mejis and the Outer Arc One last thing he said as they adjusted their saddle girths I doubt youll see anything that ouches on our interests  not in Mejis  but Id have you keep an eye out for a color of the rainbow The Wizards Rainhow that is He chuckled then added Its the grapefruit By which I mean its the pink one Wizards Rainbow is just a fairytale Cuthbert said smiling in response to Stevens smile Then  perhaps it was something in Steven Deschains eyes  Cuthberts smile faltered Isnt it Not all the old stories are true but I think that of Maerlyns Rainbow is Steven replied Its said that once there were thirteen glass balls in it  one for each of the Twelve Guardians and one representing the nexuspoint of the Beams One for the Tower Roland said in a low voice feeling gooseflesh One for the Dark Tower Aye Thirteen it was called when I was a boy Wed tell stories about the black ball around the fire sometimes and scare ourselves silly    unless our fathers caught us at it My own da said it wasnt wise to talk about Thirteen for it might hear its name called and roll your way But Black Thirteen doesnt matter to you three  not now at least No its the pink one Maerlyns Grapefruit It was impossible to tell how serious he was  or if he was serious at all If the other balls in the Wizards Rainbow did exist most are broken now Such things never stay in one place or one pair of hands for long you know and even enchanted glass has a way of breaking Yet at least three or four bends o the Rainbow may still be rolling around this sad world of ours The blue almost certainly A desert tribe of slow mutants  the Total Hogs they called themselves  had that one less than fifty years ago although its slipped from sight again since The green and the orange are reputed to be in Lud and Dis respectively And just maybe the pink one What exactly do they do Roland asked What are they good for For seeing Some colors of the Wizards Rainbow are reputed to look into the future Others look into the other worlds  those where the demons live those where the Old People are supposed to have gone when they left our world These may also show the location of the secret doors which pass between the worlds Other colors they say can look far in our own world and see things people would as soon keep secret They never see the good only the ill How much of this is true and how much is myth no one knows for sure He looked at them his smile fading But this we do know John Farson is said to have a talisman something that glows in his tent late at night  sometimes before battles sometimes before large movements of troop and horse sometimes before momentous decisions are announced And it glows pink Maybe he has an electric light and puts a pink scarf over it when he prays Cuthbert said He looked around at his friends a little defensively Im not joking there are people who do that Perhaps Rolands father said Perhaps thats all it is or something like But perhaps its a good deal more All I can say of my own knowledge is that he keeps beating us he keeps slipping away from us and he keeps turning up where hes least expected If the magic is in him and not in some talisman he owns gods help the Affiliation Well keep an eye out if you like Roland said but Parsons in the north or west Were going east As if his father did not know this If its a bend o the Rainbow Steven replied it could be anywhere  east or souths as likely as west He cant keep it with him all the time you see No matter how much it would ease his mind and heart to do so No one can Why not Because theyre alive and hungry Steven said One begins using em one ends being used by em If Farson has a piece of the Rainbow hell send it away and call it back only when he needs it He understands the risk of losing it but he also understands the risk of keeping it too long There was a question which the other two constrained by politeness couldnt ask Roland could and did You are serious about this Dad Its not just a legpull is it Im sending you away at an age when many boys still dont sleep well if their mothers dont kiss them goodnight Steven said I expect to see all three of you again alive and well  Mejis is a lovely quiet place or was when I was a boy  but I cant be sure of it As things are these days no one can be sure of anything I wouldnt send you away with a joke and a laugh Im surprised you think it Cry your pardon Roland said An uneasy peace had descended between him and his father and he would not rupture it Still he was wild to be off Pusher jigged beneath him as if seconding that I dont expect you boys to see Maerlyns glass    but I didnt expect to be seeing you off at fourteen with revolvers tucked in your bedrolls either Kas at work here and where ka works anything is possible Slowly slowly Steven took off his hat stepped back and swept them a bow Go in peace boys And return in health Long days and pleasant nights sai Alain said Good fortune Cuthbert said I love you Roland said Steven nodded Thankeesai  I love you too My blessings boys He said this last in a loud voice and the other two men  Robert Allgood and Christopher Johns who had been known in the days of his savage youth as Burning Chris  added their own blessings So the three of them rode toward their end of the Great Road while summer lay all about them breathless as a gasp Roland looked up and saw something that made him forget all about the Wizards Rainbow It was his mother leaning out of her apartments bedroom window the oval of her face surrounded by the timeless gray stone of the castles west wing There were tears coursing down her cheeks but she smiled and lifted one hand in a wide wave Of the three of them only Roland saw her He didnt wave back  Roland An elbow struck him in the ribs hard enough to dispel these memories brilliant as they were and return him to the present It was Cuthbert Do something if you mean to Get us out of this deadhouse before I shiver the skin right off my bones Roland put his mouth close by Alains ear Be ready to help me Alain nodded Roland turned to Susan After the first time we were together antet you went to the stream in the grove Aye You cut some of your hair Aye That same dreaming voice So I did Would you have cut it all Aye every lick and lock Do you know who told you to cut it A long pause Roland was about to turn to Alain when she said Rhea Another pause She wanted to fiddle me up Yes but what happened later What happened while you stood in the doorway Oh and something else happened before What I fetched her wood said she and said no more Roland looked at Cuthbert who shrugged Alain spread his hands Roland thought of asking the latter boy to step forward and judged it still wasnt quite time Never mind the wood for now he said or all that came before Well talk of that later mayhap but not just yet What happened as you were leaving What did she say to you about your hair Whispered in my ear And she had a Jesusman Whispered what I dont know That part is pink Here it was He nodded to Alain Alain bit his lip and stepped forward He looked frightened but as he took Susans hands in his own and spoke to her his voice was calm and soothing Susan Its Alain Johns Do you know me Aye  Richard Stockworth that was What did Rhea whisper in your ear A frown faint as a shadow on an overcast day creased her brow I cant see Its pink You dont need to see Alain said Seeings not what we want right now Close your eyes so you cant do it at all They are closed she said a trifle pettishly Shes frightened Roland thought He felt an urge to tell Alain to stop to wake her up and restrained it The ones inside Alain said The ones that look out from memory Close those Susan Close them for your fathers sake and tell me not what you see but what you hear Tell me what she said Chillingly unexpectedly the eyes in her face opened as she closed those in her mind She stared at Roland and through him with the eyes of an ancient statue Roland bit back a scream You were in the doorway Susan Alain asked Aye So we both were Be there again Aye A dreaming voice Faint but clear Even with my eyes closed I can seethe moons light Tis as big as a grapefruit Its the grapefruit Roland thought By which I mean its the pink one And what do you hear What does she say No I say The faintly petulant voice of a little girl First I say Alain I say And is our business done and she says Mayhap theres one more little thing and then  then Alain squeezed gently down on her hands using whatever it was he had in his own his touch sending it into her She tried feebly to pull back but he wouldnt let her Then what What next She has a little silver medal Yes She leans close and asks if I hear her I can smell her breath It reeks o garlic And other things even worse Susans face wrinkled in distaste I say I hear her Now I can see I see the medal she has Very well Susan Alain said What else do you see Rhea She looks like a skull in the moonlight A skull with hair Gods Cuthbert muttered and crossed his arms over his chest She says I should listen I say I will listen She says I should obey I say I will obey She says Aye lovely just so its a good girl yare Shes stroking my hair All the time My braid Susan raised a dreaming drowning hand pale in the shadows of the crypt to her blonde hair And then she says theres something Im to do when my virginitys over Wait she says until hes asleep beside ye then cut yer hair off yer head Every strand Right down to yer very skull  The boys looked at her in mounting horror as her voice became Rheas  the growling whining cadences of the old woman of the Coos Even the face  except for the coldly dreaming eyes  had become a hags face  Cut it all girl every whores strand of it aye and go back to him as bald as ye came from yer mother See how he likes ye then  She fell silent Alain turned his pallid face to Roland His lips were trembling but still he held her hands Why is the moon pink Roland asked Why is the moon pink when you try to remember Its her glam Susan seemed almost surprised almost gay Confiding She keeps it under her bed so she does She doesnt know I saw it Are you sure Aye Susan said then added simply She would have killed me if she knew She giggled shocking them all Rhea has the moon in a box under her bed She lilted this in the singsong voice of a small child A pink moon Roland said Aye Under her bed Aye This time she did pull her hands free of Alains She made a circle with them in the air and as she looked up at it a dreadful expression of greed passed over her face like a cramp I should like to have it Roland So I should Lovely moon I saw it when she sent me for the wood Through her window She looked  young Then once again I shd like to have such a thing No  you wouldnt But its under her bed Aye in a magic place she makes with passes She has a piece of Maerlyns Rainbow Cuthbert said in a wondering voice The old bitch has what your da told us about  no wonder she knows all she does Is there more we need Alain asked Her hands have gotten very cold I dont like having her this deep Shes done well but   I think were done Shall I tell her to forget Roland shook his head at once  they were katet for good or ill He took hold of her fingers and yes they were cold Susan Aye dear Im going to say a rhyme When I finish youll remember everything as you did before All right She smiled and closed her eyes again Bird and bear and hare and fish  Smiling Roland finished Give my love her fondest wish Her eyes opened She smiled You she said again and kissed him Still you Roland Still you my love Unable to help himself Roland put his arms around her Cuthbert looked away Alain looked down at his boots and cleared his throat  As they rode back toward Seafront Susan with her arms around Rolands waist she asked Will you take the glass from her Best leave it where it is for now It was left in her safekeeping by Jonas on behalf of Parson I have no doubt Its to be sent west with the rest of the plunder Ive no doubt of that either Well deal with it when we deal with the tankers and Parsons men Yed take it with us Take it or break it I suppose Id rather take it back to my father but that has its own risks Well have to be careful Its a powerful glam Suppose she sees our plans Suppose she warns Jonas or Kimba Rimer If she doesnt see us coming to take away her precious toy I dont think shell mind our plans one way or the other I think weve put a scare into her and if the ball has really gotten a hold on her watching in its what shell mostly want to do with her time now And hold onto it Shell want to do that too Aye Rusher was walking along a path through the seacliff woods Through the thinning branches they could glimpse the ivied gray wall surrounding Mayors House and hear the rhythmic roar of waves breaking on the shingle below You can get in safe Susan No fear And you know what you and Sheemie are to do Aye I feel better than I have in ages Its as if my mind is finally clear of some old shadow If so its Alain you have to thank I couldnt have done it on my own Theres magic in his hands Yes They had reached the servants door Susan dismounted with fluid ease He stepped down himself and stood beside her with an arm around her waist She was looking up at the moon Look its fattened enough so you can see the beginning of the Demons face Does thee see it A blade of nose a bone of grin No eye yet but yes he saw it It used to terrify me when I was little Susan was whispering now mindful of the house behind the wall Id pull the blind when the Demon was full I was afraid that if he could see me hed reach down and take me up to where he was and eat me Her lips were trembling Children are silly arent they Sometimes He hadnt been afraid of Demon Moon himself as a small child but he was afraid of this one The future seemed so dark and the way through to the light so slim I love thee Susan With all my heart I do I know And I love thee She kissed his mouth with gentle open lips Put his hand on her breast for a moment then kissed the warm palm He held her and she looked past him at the ripening moon A week until the Reap she said Fin de ano is what the vaqueros and labradoros call it Do they call it so in your land Near enough Roland said Its called closing the year Women go about giving preserves and kisses She laughed softly against his shoulder Perhaps Ill not find things so different after all You must save all your best kisses for me I will Whatever comes well be together he said but above them Demon Moon grinned into the starry dark above the Clean Sea as if he knew a different future So now comes to Mejisfin de ano known in toward the center of MidWorld as closing the year It comes as it has a thousand times before  or ten thousand or a hundred thousand No one can tell for sure the world has moved on and time has grown strange In Mejis their saying is Time is a face on the water In the fields the last of the potatoes are being picked by men and women who wear gloves and their heaviest scrapes for now the wind has turned firmly blowing east to west blowing hard and always theres the smell of salt in the chilly air  a smell like tears Los campesinos harvest the final rows cheerfully enough talking of the things theyll do and the capers theyll cut at Reaping Fair but they feel all of autumns old sadness in the wind the going of the year It runs away from them like water in a stream and although none speak of it all know it very well In the orchards the last and highest of the apples are picked by laughing young men in these notquitegales the final days of picking belong only to them who bob up and down like crows nest lookouts Above them in skies which hold a brilliant cloudless blue squadrons of geese fly south calling their rusty adieux The small fishing boats are pulled from the water their hulls are scraped and painted by singing owners who mostly work stripped to the waist in spite of the chill in the air They sing the old songs as they work  I am a man of the bright blue sea All I see all I see I am a man of the Barony All I see is mineo Iam a man of the bright blue hay All I say all I say Until my nets are full I stay All I say is fineo  and sometimes a little cask ofgraf is tossed from dock to dock On the bay itself only the large boats now remain pacing about the big circles which mark their dropped nets as a working dog may pace around a flock of sheep At noon the bay is a rippling sheet of autumn fire and the men on the boats sit crosslegged eating their lunches and know that all they see is theirso  at least until the gray gales of autumn come swarming over the horizon coughing out their gusts of sleet and snow Closing closing the year Along the streets of Hambry the Reaplights now bum at night and the hands of the stuffyguys are painted red Reapcharms hang everywhere and although women often kiss and are kissed in the streets and in both marketplaces  often by men they do not know  sexual intercourse has come to an almost complete halt It will resume with a bang you might say on ReapNight There will be the usual crop of Full Earth babies the following year as a result On the Drop the horses gallop wildly as if understanding very likely they do that their time of freedom is coming to an end They swoop and then stand with their faces pointing west when the wind gusts showing their asses to winter On the ranches porchnets are taken down and shutters rehung In the huge ranch kitchens and smaller farmhouse kitchens no one is stealing Reapkisses and no one is even thinking about sex This is the time of putting up and laying by and the kitchens fume with steam and pulse with heat from before dawn until long after dark There is the smell of apples and beets and beans and sharproot and curing strips of meat Women work ceaselessly all day and then sleepwalk to bed where they lie like corpses until the next dark morning calls them back to their kitchens Leaves are burned in town yards and as the week goes on and Old Demons face shows ever more clearly redhanded stuffyguys are thrown on the pyres more and more frequently In the fields cornshucks flare like torches and often stuffies bum with them their red hands and whitecross eyes rippling in the heat Men stand around these fires not speaking their faces solemn No one will say what terrible old ways and unspeakable old gods are being propitiated by the burning of the stuffyguys but they all know well enough From time to time one of these men will whisper two words under his breath charyou tree They are closing closing closing the year The streets rattle with firecrackers  and sometimes with a heftier bighang that makes even placid carthorses rear in their traces  and echo with the laughter of children On the porch of the mercantile and across the street at the Travellers Rest kisses  sometimes humidly open and with much sweet lashing of tongues  are exchanged but Coral Thorins whores cottongillies is what the airyfairy ones like Gert Moggins like to call themselves are bored They will have little custom this week This is not Years End when the winterlogs will bum and Mejis will be bamdances from one end to the other    and yet it is This is the real years end charyou tree and everyone from Stanley Ruiz standing at the bar beneath The Romp to the farthest of Fran Lengylls vaqueros out on the edge of the Bad Grass knows it There is a kind of echo in the bright air a yearning for other places in the blood a loneliness in the heart that sings like the wind But this year theres something else as well a sense of wrongness that no one can quite voice Folks who never had a nightmare in their lives will awake screaming with them during the week offin de ano men who consider themselves peaceful will find themselves not only in fistfights but instigating them discontented boys who would only have dreamed of running away in other years will this year actually do it and most will not come back after the first night spent sleeping raw There is a sense  inarticulate but very much there  that things have gone amiss this season It is the closing of the year it is also the closing of the peace For it is here in the sleepy OutWorld Barony of Mejis that MidWorlds last great conflict will shortly begin it is from here that the blood will begin to flow In two years no more the world as it has been will be swept away It starts here From its field of roses the Dark Tower cries out in its beasts voice Time is a face on the water  Coral Thorin was coming down the High Street from the Bayview Hotel when she spied Sheemie leading Caprichoso and heading in the opposite direction The boy was singing Careless Love in a voice both high and sweet His progress was slow the barrels slung over Capis back were half again as large as the ones he had carried up to the Coos not long before Coral hailed her boyofallwork cheerily enough She had reason to be cheery Eldred Jonas had no use forfin de ano abstinence And for a man with a bad leg he could be very inventive Sheemie she called Where go ye Seafront Aye Sheemie said Ive got the graf them asked for All parties come Reaping Fair aye tons of em Dance a lot get hot a lot drink graf to cool off a lot How pretty you look sai Thorin cheeks all pinkypink so they are Oh law How kind of you to say Sheemie She favored him with a dazzling smile Go on now you flatterer  dont linger Noeyno off I go Coral stood watching after him and smiling Dance a lot get hot a lot Sheemie had said About the dancing Coral didnt know but she was sure this years Reaping would be hot all right Very hot indeed  Miguel met Sheemie at Seafronts archway gave him the look of lofty contempt he reserved for the lower orders then pulled the cork from first one barrel and then the other With the first he only sniffed from the bung at the second he stuck his thumb in and then sucked it thoughtfully With his wrinkled cheeks hollowed inward and his toothless old mouth working he looked like an ancient bearded baby Tasty aint it Sheemie asked Tasty as a pasty aint it good old Miguel been here a thousand years Miguel still sucking his thumb favored Sheemie with a sour look Andale Andale simplon  Sheemie led his mule around the house to the kitchen Here the breeze off the ocean was sharp and shiversome He waved to the women in the kitchen but not a one waved back likely they didnt even see him A pot boiled on every trink of the enormous stove and the women  working in loose longsleeved cotton garments like shifts and wearing their hair tied up in brightly colored clouts  moved about like phantoms glimpsed in fog Sheemie took first one barrel from Capis back then the other Grunting he carried them to the huge oak tank by the back door He opened the tanks lid bent over it and then backed away from the eyewateringly strong smell of elderly graf Whew he said hoisting the first barrel Ye could get drunk just on the smell o that lot He emptied in the fresh graf careful not to spill When he was finished the tank was pretty well topped up That was good for on Reaping Night applebeer would flow out of the kitchen taps like water He slipped the empty barrels into their carriers looked into the kitchen once more to be sure he wasnt being observed he wasnt Corals simpleminded tavernboy was the last thing on anyones minds that morning and then led Capi not back the way theyd come but along a path which led to Seafronts storage sheds There were three of them in a row each with its own redhanded stuffyguy sitting in front The guys appeared to be watching Sheemie and that gave him the shivers Then he remembered his trip to crazy old bitchlady Rheas house She had been scary These were just old duds stuffed full of straw Susan he called low Are ye here The door of the center shed was ajar Now it trundled open a little Come in she called also low Bring the mule Hurry He led Capi into a shed which smelled of straw and beans and tack  and something else Something sharper Fireworks he thought Shootingpowder too Susan who had spent the morning enduring final fittings was dressed in a thin silk wrapper and large leather boots Her hair was done up in curling papers of bright blue and red Sheemie tittered You look quite amusing Susan daughter of Pat Quite a chuckle for me I think Yes Im a picture for an artist to paint all right Susan said looking distracted We have to hurry I have twenty minutes before Im missed Ill be missed before if that randy old goat is looking for me lets be quick They lifted the barrels from Capis back Susan took a broken horsebit from the pocket of her wrapper and used the sharp end to pry off one of the tops She tossed the bit to Sheemie who pried off the other The appletart smell of graf filled the shed Here She tossed Sheemie a soft cloth Dry it out as well as you can Doesnt have to be perfect theyre wrapped but its best to be safe They wiped the insides of the barrels Susan stealing nervous glances at the door every few seconds All right she said Good Now  theres two kinds Im sure they wont be missed theres enough stuff back there to blow up half the world She hurried back into the dimness of the shed holding the hem of her wrapper up with one hand her boots clomping When she came back her arms were full of wrapped packages These are the bigger ones she said He stored them in one of the casks There were a dozen packages in all and Sheemie could feel round things inside each about the size of a childs fist Bigbangers By the time he had finished packing and putting the top back on the barrel she had returned with an armload of smaller packages These he stored in the other barrel They were the little uns from the feel the ones that not only banged but flashed colored fire She helped him resling the barrels on Capis back still shooting those little glances at the shed door When the barrels were secured to Caprichosos sides Susan sighed with relief and brushed her sweaty forehead with the backs of her hands Thank the gods that parts over she said Now ye know where yere to take them Aye Susan daughter of Pat To the Bar K My friend Arthur Heath will put em safe And if anyone asks what yere doing out that way Taking sweet graf to the InWorld boys cause theyve decided not to come to town for the Fair    why wont they Susan Dont they like Fairs Yell know soon enough Dont mind it now Sheemie Go on  best be on your way Yet he lingered What she asked trying not to be impatient Sheemie what is it Id like to take afin de ano kiss from ye so I would Sheemies face had gone an alarming shade of red Susan laughed in spite of herself then stood on her toes and kissed the comer of his mouth With that Sheemie floated out to the Bar K with his load of fire  Reynolds rode out to Citgo the following day galloping with a scarf wrapped around his face so only his eyes peered out He would be very glad to get out of this damned place that couldnt decide if it was ranchland or seacoast The temperature wasnt all that low but after coming in over the water the wind cut like a razor Nor was that all  there was a brooding quality to Hambry and all of Mejis as the days wound down toward the Reap a haunted feeling he didnt care for a bit Roy felt it too Reynolds could see it in his eyes No hed be glad to have those three baby knights so much ash in the wind and this place just a memory He dismounted in the crumbling refinery parking lot tied his horse to the bumper of a rusty old hulk with the mysteryword chevrolet barely readable on its tailboard then walked toward the oilpatch The wind blew hard chilling him even through the ranchstyle sheepskin coat he wore and twice he had to yank his hat down around his ears to keep it from blowing off On the whole he was glad he couldnt see himself he probably looked like a fucking farmer The place seemed fine though    which was to say deserted The wind made a lonely soughing sound as it combed through the firs on either side of the pipe Youd never guess that there were a dozen pairs of eyes looking out at you as you strolled Hai he called Come on out here pard and lets have some palaver For a moment there was no response then Hiram Quint of the Piano Ranch and Barkie Callahan of the Travellers Rest came ducking their way out through the trees Holy shit Reynolds thought somewhere between awe and amusement There aint that much beef in a butcher shop There was a wretched old musketoon stuck into the waistband of Quints pants Reynolds hadnt seen one in years He thought that if Quint was lucky it would only misfire when he pulled the trigger If he was unlucky it would blow up in his face and blind him All quiet he asked Quint replied in Mejis bibblebabble Barkie listened then said All well sai He say he and his men grow impatient Smiling cheerfully his face giving no indication of what he was saying Barkie added If brains was blackpowder this ijit couldnt blow his nose But hes a trustworthy idiot Barkie shrugged It might have been assent They went through the trees Where Roland and Susan had seen almost thirty tankers there were now only half a dozen and of those six only two actually had oil in them Men sat on the ground or snoozed with their sombreros over their faces Most had guns that looked about as trustworthy as the one in Quints waistband A few of the poorer vaqs had bolas On the whole Reynolds guessed they would be more effective Tell Lord Perth here that if the boys come its got to be an ambush and theyll only have one chance to do the job right Reynolds said to Barkie Barkie spoke to Quint Quints lips parted in a grin revealing a scarifying picket of black and yellow fangs He spoke briefly then put his hands out in front of them and closed them into huge scarred fists one above the other as if wringing the neck of an invisible enemy When Barkie began to translate Clay Reynolds waved it away He had caught only one word but it was enough muerto  All that preFair week Rhea sat in front of the glass peering into its depths She had taken time to sew Ermots head back onto his body with clumsy stitches of black thread and she sat with the decaying snake around her neck as she watched and dreamed not noticing the stench that began to arise from the reptile as time passed Twice Musty came nigh mewing for food and each time Rhea batted the troublesome thing away without so much as a glance She herself grew more and more gaunt her eyes now looking like the sockets of the skulls stored in the net by the door to her bedroom She dozed occasionally as she sat with the ball in her lap and the stinking snakeskin looped about her throat her head down the sharp point of her chin digging at her chest runners of drool hanging from the loose puckers of her lips but she never really slept There was too much to see far too much to see And it was hers for the seeing These days she didnt even have to pass her hands above the glass to open its pink mists All the Baronys meanness all its petty and not so petty cruelties all its cozening and lying lay before her Most of what she saw was small and demeaning stuff  masturbating boys peeking through knotholes at their undressed sisters wives going through husbands pockets looking for extra money or tobacco Sheb the pianoplayer licking the seat of the chair where his favorite whore had sat for awhile a maid at Seafront spitting into Kimba Rimers pillowcase after the Chancellor had kicked her for being slow in getting out of his way These were all things which confirmed her opinion of the society she had left behind Sometimes she laughed wildly sometimes she spoke to the people she saw in the glass ball as if they could hear her By the third day of the week before Reaping she had ceased her trips to the privy even though she could carry the ball with her when she went and the sour stench of urine began to rise from her By the fourth day Musty had ceased coming near her Rhea dreamed in the ball and lost herself in her dreams as others had done before her deep in the petty pleasures of far seeing she was unaware that the pink ball was stealing the wrinkled remains of her anima She likely would have considered it a fair trade if she had known She saw all the things people did in the shadows and they were the only things she cared for and for them she almost certainly would have considered her lifes force a fair trade  Here the boy said let me light it gods damn you Jonas would have recognized the speaker he was the lad who had waved a severed dogs tail across the street at Jonas and called Were Big Coffin Hunters just like you The boy to whom this charming child had spoken tried to hold onto the piece of liver they had copped from the knackers behind the Low Market The first boy seized his ear and twisted The second boy howled and held the chunk of liver out dark blood running down his grimy knuckles as he did Thats better the first boy said taking it You want to remember who the capataz is round here They were behind a bakery stall in the Low Market Nearby drawn by the smell of hot fresh bread was a mangy mutt with one blind eye He stared at them with hungry hope There was a slit in the chunk of raw meat Poking out of it was a green bigbang fuse Below the fuse the liver bulged like the stomach of a pregnant woman The first boy took a sulfur match stuck it between his protruding front teeth and lit it He wont never said a third boy in an agony of hope and anticipation Thin as he is the first boy said Oh yes he will Bet ye my deck of cards against yer hosstail The third boy thought it over and shook his head The first boy grinned Its a wise child ye are he said and lit the bigbangs fuse Hey cully he called to the dog Want a bite o sumpin good Here ye go He threw the chunk of raw liver The scrawny dog never hesitated at the hissing fuse but lunged forward with its one good eye fixed on the first decent food it had seen in days As it snatched the liver out of the air the bigbang the boys had slipped into it went off There was a roar and a flash The dogs head disintegrated from the jaws down For a moment it continued to stand there dripping staring at them with its one good eye and then it collapsed Toadjer the first boy jeered Toadjer hed take it Happy Reap to us eh What are you boys doing a womans voice called sharply Get out of there ye ravens The boys fled cackling into the bright afternoon They did sound like ravens  Cuthbert and Alain sat their horses at the mouth of Eyebolt Even with the wind blowing the sound of the thinny away from them it got inside your head and buzzed there rattling your teeth I hate it Cuthbert said through clenched teeth Gods lets be quick Aye Alain said They dismounted bulky in their ranchcoats and tied their horses to the brush which lay across the front of the canyon Ordinarily tethering wouldnt have been necessary but both boys could see the horses hated the whining grinding sound as much as they did Cuthbert seemed to hear the thinny in his mind speaking words of invitation in a groaning horribly persuasive voice Come on Bert Leave all this foolishness behind the drums the pride the fear of death the loneliness you laugh at because laughings all you can think to do And the girl leave her too You love her dont you And even if you dont you want her Its sad that she loves your friend instead of you but if you come to me all that will stop bothering you very soon So come on What are you waiting for What am I waiting for he muttered Huh I said what are we waiting for Lets get this done and get the holy hell out of here From their saddlebags they each took a small cotton bag These contained gunpowder extracted from the smaller firecrackers Sheemie had brought them two days before Alain dropped to his knees pulled his knife and began to crawl backward digging a trench as far under the roll of brush as he could Dig it deep Cuthbert said We dont want the wind to blow it away Alain gave him a look which was remarkably hot Do you want to do it Just so you can make sure its done right Its the thinny Cuthbert thought Its working on him too No Al he said humbly Youre doing fine for someone whos both blind and soft in the head Go on Alain looked at him fiercely a moment longer then grinned and resumed the trench under the brush Youll die young Bert Aye likely Cuthbert dropped to his own knees and began to crawl after Alain sprinkling gunpowder into the trench and trying to ignore the buzzy cajoling voice of the thinny No the gunpowder probably wouldnt blow away not unless there was a full gale But if it rained even the rolls of brush wouldnt be much protection If it rained  Dont think of that he told himself Thats ka They finished loading gunpowder trenches under both sides of the brush barrier in only ten minutes but it felt longer To the horses as well it seemed they were stamping impatiently at the far end of their tethers their ears laid back and their eyes rolling Cuthbert and Alain untied them and mounted up Cuthberts horse actually bucked twice    except it felt more to Cuthbert as if the poor old thing were shuddering In the middle distance bright sunshine twanged of bright steel The tankers at Hanging Rock They had been pulled in as light to the sandstone outcrop as possible but when the sun was high most of the shadow disappeared and concealment disappeared with it I really cant believe it Alain said as they started back It would be a long ride including a wide swing around Hanging Rock to make sure they werent seen They must think were blind Its stupid they think we are Cuthbert said but I suppose it comes to the same Now that Eyebolt Canyon was falling behind them he felt almost giddy with relief Were they going in there a few days from now Actually going in riding to within mere yards of where that cursed puddle started He couldnt believe it  and he made himself stop thinking about it before he could start believing it More riders heading out to Hanging Rock Alain said pointing back toward the woods beyond the canyon Do you see them They were small as ants from this distance but Bert saw them very well Changing the guard The important thing is that they dont see us  you dont think they can do you Over here Not likely Cuthbert didnt think so either Theyll all be down come Reap wont they Alain asked It wont do us much good to only catch a few Yes  Im pretty sure they all will Jonas and his pals Them too Ahead of them the Bad Grass grew closer The wind blew hard in their faces making their eyes water but Cuthbert didnt mind The sound of the thinny was down to a faint drone behind him and would soon be gone completely Right now that was all he needed to make him happy Do you think well get away with it Bert Dunno Cuthbert said Then he thought of the gunpowder trenches lying beneath the dry rolls of brush and grinned But Ill tell you one thing Al theyll know we were here  In Mejis as in every other Barony of MidWorld the week before a FairDay was a political week Important people came in from the farther corners of the Barony and there were a good many Conversationals leading up to the main Conversational on Reaping Day Susan was expected to be present at these  mostly as a decorative testimony to the Mayors continuing puissance Olive was also present and in a cruelly comic dumbshow that only the women truly appreciated they sat on either side of the aging cockatoo Susan pouring the coffee Olive passing the cake both of them gracefully accepting compliments on food and drink theyd had no hand in preparing Susan found it almost impossible to look at Olives smiling unhappy face Her husband would never lie with Pat Delgados daughter    but sai Thorin didnt know that and Susan couldnt tell her She had only to glimpse the Mayors wife from the comer other eye to remember what Roland had said that day on the Drop For a moment I thought she was my mother But that was the problem wasnt it Olive Thorin was nobodys mother That was what had opened the door to this horrible situation in the first place There had been something much on Susans mind to do but with the round of activities at Mayors House it was but three days to Reaping before she got the chance Finally following this latest Conversational she was able to slip out of Pink Dress with Applique how she hated it how she hated them all and jump back into jeans a plain riding shirt and a ranchcoat There was no time to braid her hair as she was expected back for Mayors Tea but Maria tied it back for her and off she had gone to the house she would shortly be leaving forever Her business was in the back room of the stable  the room her father had used as an office  but she went into the house first and heard what shed hoped to hear her aunts ladylike whistling snores Lovely Susan got a slice of bread and honey and took it out to the barnstable protecting it as best she could from the clouds of dust that blew across the yard in the wind Her aunts stuffyguy rattled on his post in the garden She ducked into the sweetsmelling shadows of the barn Pylon and Felicia nickered hello and she divided what she hadnt eaten between them They seemed pleased enough to get it She made especially of Felicia whom she would soon be leaving behind She had avoided the little office since her father died afraid of exactly the sort of pang that struck her when she lifted the latch and went in The narrow windows were now covered with cobwebs but they still let in autumns bright light more than enough for her to be able to see the pipe in the ashtray  the red one his favorite the one he called his thinkingpipe  and a bit of tack laid over the back of his desk chair He had probably been mending it by gaslight had put it by thinking to finish the next day  then the snake had done its dance under Foams hoofs and there had never been a next day Not for Pat Delgado Oh Da she said in a small and broken voice How I do miss thee She crossed to the desk and ran her fingers along its surface leaving trails of dust She sat down in his chair listened to it creak under her as it had always creaked under him and that pushed her over the edge For the next five minutes she sat there and wept screwing her fists into her eyes as she had as a wee shim Only now of course there was no Big Pat to come upon her and jolly her out of it taking her on his lap and kissing her in that sensitive place under her chin especially sensitive to the bristles on his upper lip it had been until her tears turned to giggles Time was a face on the water and this time it was the face of her father At last her tears tapered to sniffles She opened the desk drawers one after another finding more pipes many rendered useless by his constant stemchewing a hat one of her own dolls it had a broken arm Pat had apparently never gotten around to putting right quillpens a little flask  empty but with a faint smell of whiskey still present around its neck The only item of interest was in the bottom drawer a pair of spurs One still had its star rowel but the other had been broken off These were she was almost positive the spurs he had been wearing on the day he died If my da was here she had begun that day on the Drop But hes not Roland had said Hes dead A pair of spurs a brokenoff rowel She bounced them in her hand in her minds eye seeing Ocean Foam rear spilling her father one spur catches in a stirrup the rowel breaks free then stumbling sideways and falling atop him She saw this clearly but she didnt see the snake Fran Lengyll had told them about That she didnt see at all She put the spurs back where she had found them got up and looked at the shelf to the right of the desk handy to Pat Delgados smart hand Here was a line of leatherbound ledgers a priceless trove of books in a society that had forgotten how to make paper Her father had been the man in charge of the Baronys horse for almost thirty years and here were his stockline books to prove it Susan took down the last one and began to page through it This time she almost welcomed the pang that struck her as she saw her fathers familiar hand  the labored script the steep and somehow more confident numbers Born of HENRIETTA  foals both well Stillborn of DELIA a roan MUTANT Born of YOLANDA a THOROUGHBRED a GOOD MALE COLT And following each the date So neat he had been So thorough So  She stopped suddenly aware that she had found what she was looking for even without any clear knowledge of what she was doing in here I he last dozen pages of her das final stockline book had been torn out Who had done it Not her father a largely selftaught man he revered paper the way some people revered gods or gold And why had it been done That she thought she knew horses of courses There were too many on the Drop And the ranchers  Lengyll Croydon Renfrew  were lying about the threaded quality of the stockline So was Henry Wertner the man who had succeeded to her fathers job If my da was here  But hes not Hes dead She had told Roland she couldnt believe Fran Lengyll would lie about her fathers death    but she could believe it now Gods help her she could believe it now What are ye doing in here She gave a little scream dropped the book and whirled around Cordelia stood there in one of her rusty black dresses The top three buttons were undone and Susan could see her aunts collarbones sticking out above the plain white cotton of her shift It was only on seeing those protruding bones that Susan realized how much weight Aunt Cord had lost over the last three months or so She could see the red imprint of the pillow on her aunts left cheek like the mark of a slap Her eyes glittered from dark bruisedlooking hollows of flesh Aunt Cord You startled me You   What are ye doing in here Aunt Cord repeated Susan bent and picked up the book I came to remember my father she said and put the book back on the shelf Who had torn those pages out Lengyll Rimer She doubted it She thought it more likely that the woman standing before her right now had done it Perhaps for as little as a single piece of red gold Nothing asked nothing told so all is well she would have thought popping the coin into her moneybox after first biting its edge to make sure it was true Remember him Its ask his forgiveness ye should do For yeve forgotten his face so ye have Most grievous have ye forgotten it Sue Susan only looked at her Have ye been with him today Cordelia asked in a brittle laughing voice Her hand went to the red pillowmark on her cheek and began rubbing it She had been getting bad by degrees Susan realized but had become ever so much worse since the gossip about Jonas and Coral Thorin had started Have ye been with sai Dearborn Is yer crack still dewy from his spend Here let me see for myself Her aunt glided forward  spectral in her black dress her bodice open her slippered feet peeping  and Susan pushed her back In her fright and disgust she pushed hard Cordelia struck the wall beside the cobwebbed window Ye should ask forgiveness yerself Susan said To speak to his daughter so in this place In this place She let her eyes turn to the shelf of ledgers then return to her aunt The look of frightened calculation she saw on Cordelia Delgados face told her all she wanted or needed to know She hadnt been a party to her brothers murder that Susan could not believe but she had known something of it Yes something Ye faithless bitch Cordelia whispered No Susan said I have been true And so she realized she had been A great weight seemed to slip off her shoulders at the thought She walked to the door of the office and turned back to her aunt Ive slept my last night here she said Ill not listen to more such as this Nor look at ye as ye are now It hurts my heart and steals the love Ive kept for ye since I was little when ye did the best ye could to be my ma Cordelia clapped her hands over her face as if looking at Susan hurt her Get out then she screamed Go back to Seafront or wherever it is thee rolls with that boy If I never see thy trollops face again Ill count my life good Susan led Pylon from the stable When she got him into the yard she was sobbing almost too hard to mount up Yet mount she did and she couldnt deny that there was relief in her heart as well as sorrow When she turned onto the High Street and booted Pylon into a gallop she didnt look back  In a dark hour of the following morning Olive Thorin crept from the room where she now slept to the one she had shared for almost forty years with her husband The floor was cold under her bare feet and she was shivering by the time she reached the bed  but the chilly floor wasnt the only reason she was shivering She slid in beside the gaunt snoring man in the nightcap and when he turned away from her his knees and back crackling loudly as he did she pressed against him and hugged him tightly There was no passion in this but only a need to share a bit of his warmth His chest  narrow but almost as wellknown to her as her own plump one  rose and fell under her hands and she began to quiet a little He stirred and she thought for a moment he would wake and find her sharing his bed for the first time in gods knew how long Yes wake she thought do She didnt dare wake him of her own  all her courage had been exhausted just getting here creeping through the dark following one of the worst dreams she had ever had in her life  but if he woke she would take it as a sign and tell him she had dreamed of a vast bird a cruel goldeneyed roc that flew above the Barony on wings that dripped blood Wherever its shadow fell there was blood she would tell him and its shadow fell everywhere The Barony ran with it from Hambry all the way out to Eyebolt And I swelled big fire in the wind I ran to tell you and you were dead in your study sitting by the hearth with your eyes gouged out and a skull in your lap But instead of waking in his sleep he took her hand as he had used to do before he had begun to look at the young girls  even the servingwenches  when they passed and Olive decided she would only lie here and be still and let him hold her hand Let it be like the old days for a bit when everything had been right between them She slept a little herself When she woke dawns first gray light was creeping in through the windows He had dropped her hand  had in fact scooted away from her entirely to his edge of the bed It wouldnt do for him to wake and find her here she decided and the urgency of her nightmare was gone She turned back the covers swung her feet out then looked at him once more His nightcap had come askew She put it right her hands smoothing the cloth and the bony brow beneath He stirred again Olive waited until he had quieted then got up She slipped back to her own room like a phantom  The midway booths opened in Green Heart two days before ReapingFair and the first folks came to try their luck at the spinning wheel and the bottletoss and the basketring There was also a ponytrain  a cart filled with laughing children pulled along a figure eight of narrowgauge rails Was the pony named Charlie Eddie Dean asked Roland I think not Roland said We have a rather unpleasant word that sounds like that in the High Speech What word Jake asked The one said the gunslinger that means death Roy Depape stood watching the pony plod its appointed rounds for a couple of turns remembering with some nostalgia his own rides in such a cart as a child Of course most of his had been stolen When he had looked his fill Depape sauntered on down to the Sheriffs office and went in Herk Avery Dave and Frank Claypool were cleaning an odd and fantastical assortment of guns Avery nodded at Depape and went back to what he was doing There was something strange about the man and after a moment or two Depape realized what it was the Sheriff wasnt eating It was the first time hed ever come in here that the Sheriff didnt have a plate of grub close at hand All ready for tomorrow Depape asked Avery gave him a halfirritated halfsmiling look What the hell kind of question is that One that Jonas sent me to ask Depape said and at that Averys queer nervy smile faltered a little Aye were ready Avery swept a meaty arm over the guns Dont ye see we are Depape could have quoted the old saying about how the proof of the pudding was in the eating but what was the point Things would work out if the three boys were as fooled as Jonas thought they were if they werent fooled they would likely carve Herk Averys fat butt off the top of his legs and feed it to the handiest pack of wolverines It didnt make much never mind to Roy Depape one way or the other Jonas also ast me to remind you its early Aye aye well be there early Avery agreed These two and six more good men Fran Lengylls asked to go along and hes got a machinegun Avery spoke this last with ringing pride as if he himself had invented the machinegun Then he looked at Depape slyly What about you coffinhand Want to go along Wont take me moren an eyeblink to deputize ye I have another chore Reynolds too Depape smiled Theres plenty of work for all of us Sheriff  after all its Reaping  That afternoon Susan and Roland met at the hut in the Bad Grass She told him about the book with the tornout pages and Roland showed her what hed left in the huts north corner secreted beneath a mouldering pile of skins She looked first at this then at him with wide and frightened eyes Whats wrong What does thee suspect is wrong He shook his head Nothing was wrong  not that he could tell anyway And yet he had felt a strong need to do what hed done to leave what hed left It wasnt the touch nothing like it but only intuition I think everything is all right  or as right as things can be when the odds may turn out fifty of them for each of us Susan our only chance is to take them by surprise Youre not going to risk that are you Not planning to go to Lengyll waving your fathers stockline book around She shook her head If Lengyll had done what she now suspected hed get his payback two days from now There would be reaping all right Reaping aplenty But this  this frightened her and she said so Listen Roland took her face in his hands and looked into her eyes Im only trying to be careful If things go badly  and they could  youre the one most likely to get away clean You and Sheemie If that happens Susan you  thee  must come here and take my guns Take them west to Gilead Find my father Hell know thee are who thee says by what thee shows Tell him what happened here Thats all If anything happens to thee Roland I wont be able to do anything Except die His hands were still on her face Now he used them to make her head shake slowly from side to side You wont die he said There was a coldness in his voice and eyes that struck her not with fear but awe She thought of his blood  of how old it must be and how cold it must sometimes flow Not with this job undone Promise me I I promise Roland I do Tell me aloud what you promise Ill come here Get yer guns Take them to yer da Tell him what happened He nodded and let go of her face The shapes of his hands were printed faintly on her cheeks Ye frightened me Susan said and then shook her head That wasnt right Ye do frighten me I cant help what I am And I wouldnt change it She kissed his left cheek his right cheek his mouth She put her hand inside his shirt and caressed his nipple It grew instantly hard beneath the tip of her finger Bird and bear and hare and fish she said now making soft butterfly kisses all over his face Give your love her fondest wish After they lay beneath a bearskin Roland had brought along and listened to the wind sough through the grass I love that sound she said It always makes me wish I could be part of the wind  go where it goes see what it sees This year if ka allows you will Aye And with thee She turned to him up on one elbow Light fell through the ruined roof and dappled her face Roland I love thee She kissed him    and then began to cry He held her concerned What is it Sue what troubles thee I dont know she said crying harder All I know is that theres a shadow on my heart She looked at him with tears still flowing from her eyes Theed not leave me would ye dear Theed not go without Sue would ye No For Ive given all I have to ye so I have And my virginitys the very least of it thee knows Id never leave you But he felt cold in spite of the bearskin and the wind outside  so comforting a moment ago  sounded like beasts breath Never I swear Im frightened though Indeed I am You neednt be he said speaking slowly and carefully  for suddenly all the wrong words wanted to come tumbling out of his mouth We II leave this Susan  not day after tomorrow on Reaping but now this minute Dress and well go crosswise to the wind its south well ride and never look back Well be   haunted Thats what they would be Haunted by the faces of Alain and Cuthbert haunted by the faces of all the men who might die in the Shaved Mountains massacred by weapons torn from the armorycrypts where they should have been left Haunted most of all by the faces of their fathers for all the rest of their lives Not even the South Pole would be far enough to escape those faces All you need do day after tomorrow is claim indisposition at lunch They had gone over all this before but now in his sudden pointless fright it was all he could think of to say Go to your room then leave as you did on the night we met in the graveyard Hide up a little Then when its three o the clock ride here and look under the skins in yon comer If my guns are gone  and they will be I swear they will  then everythings all right Youll ride to meet us Come to the place above the canyon the one we told you of Well   Aye I know all that but somethings wrong She looked at him touched the side of his face I fear for thee and me Roland and know not why All will work out he said Ka   Speak not to me of ka  she cried Oh please dont Ka like a wind my father said it takes what it will and minds the plea of no man or woman Greedy old ka how I hate it Susan   No say no more She lay back and pushed the bearskin down to her knees exposing a body that far greater men than Hart Thorin might have given away kingdoms for Beads of sunlight ran over her bare skin like rain She held her arms out to him Never had she looked more beautiful to Roland than she did then with her hair spread about her and that haunted look on her face He would think later She knew Some part of her knew No more talking she said Talkings done If you love me then love me And for the last time Roland did They rocked together skin to skin and breath to breath and outside the wind roared into the west like a tidal wave  That evening as the grinning Demon rose in the sky Cordelia left her house and walked slowly across the lawn to her garden detouring around the pile of leaves she had raked that afternoon In her arms was a bundle of clothes She dropped them in front of the pole to which her stuffyguy was bound then looked raptly up at the rising moon the knowing wink of the eye the ghouls grin silver as bone was that moon a white button against violet silk It grinned at Cordelia Cordelia grinned back Finally with the air of a woman awakening from a trance she stepped forward and pulled the stuffyguy off its pole His head lolled limply against her shoulder like the head of a man who has found himself too drunk to dance His red hands dangled She stripped off the guys clothes uncovering a bulging vaguely humanoid shape in a pair of her dead brothers longhandles She took one of the things she had brought from the house and held it up to the moonlight A red silk riding shirt one of Mayor Thorins presents to Miss Oh So Young and Pretty One of those she wouldnt wear Whores clothes she had called them And what did that make Cordelia Delgado who had taken care of her even after her bullheaded da had decided he must stand against the likes of Fran Lengyll and John Croydon It made her a whorehouse madam she supposed This thought led to an image of Eldred Jonas and Coral Thorin naked and striving while a honkytonk piano planked out Red Dirt Boogie below them and Cordelia moaned like a dog She yanked the silk shirt over the stuffys head Next came one of Susans split riding skirts After the skirt a pair of her slippers And last replacing the sombrero one of Susans spring bonnets Presto The stuffyguy was now a stuffygal And caught redhanded ye are she whispered I know Oh yes I know I wasnt born yesterday She carried the stuffy from the garden to the pile of leaves on the lawn She laid it close by the leaves then scooped some up and pushed them into the bodice of the riding shirt making rudimentary breasts That done she took a match from her pocket and struck it alight The wind as if eager to cooperate dropped Cordelia touched the match to the dry leaves Soon the whole pile was blazing She picked the stuffygal up in her arms and stood with it in front of the fire She didnt hear the rattling firecrackers from town or the wheeze of the steamorgan in Green Heart or the mariachi band playing in the Low Market when a burning leaf rose and swirled past her hair threatening to set it alight she didnt seem to notice Her eyes were wide and blank When the fire was at its height she stepped to its edge and threw the stuffy on Flame whumped up around it in bright orange gusts sparks and burning leaves swirled skyward in a funnel So let it be done Cordelia cried The firelight on her face turned her tears to blood Charyou tree Aye just so The thing in the riding clothes caught fire its face charring its red hands blazing its whitecross eyes turning black Its bonnet flared the face began to bum Cordelia stood and watched fists clenching and unclenching heedless of the sparks that lit on her skin heedless of the blazing leaves that swirled toward the house Had the house caught tire she would likely have ignored that as well She watched until the stuffy dressed in her nieces clothes was nothing but ashes lying atop more ashes Then as slowly as a robot with rust in its works she walked back to the house lay down on the sofa and slept like the dead  It was threethirty in the morning of the day before Reaping and Stanley Ruiz thought he was finally done for the night The last music had quit twenty minutes ago  Sheb had outlasted the mariachis by an hour or so and now lay snoring with his face in the sawdust Sai Thorin was upstairs and there had been no sign of the Big Coffin Hunters Stanley had an idea those were up to Seafront tonight He also had an idea there was black work on offer although he didnt know that for sure He looked up at the glassy twoheaded gaze of The Romp Nor want to old pal he said All I want is about nine hours of sleep  tomorrow comes the real party and they wont leave till dawn So   A shrill scream rose from somewhere behind the building Stanley jerked backward thumping into the bar Beside the piano Sheb raised his head briefly muttered Wuzzat and dropped it back with a thump Stanley had absolutely no urge to investigate the source of the scream but he supposed he would just the same It had sounded like that sad old bitch Pettie the Trotter Id like to trot your saggy old ass right out of town he muttered then bent down to look under the bar There were two stout ashwood clubs here The Calmer and The Killer The Calmer was smooth buried wood guaranteed to put out the lights for two hours any time you tapped some boisterous culls head in the right place with it Stanley consulted his feelings and took the other club It was shorter than The Calmer wider at the top And the business end of The Killer was studded with nails Stanley went down to the end of the bar through the door and across a dim supplyroom stacked with barrels smelling of graf and whiskey At the rear was a door giving on the back yard Stanley approached it took a deep breath and unlocked it He kept expecting Pettie to voice another headbursting scream but none came There was only the sound of the wind Maybe you got lucky and shes kilt Stanley thought He opened the door stepping back and raising the nailstudded club at the same time Pettie wasnt kilt Dressed in a stained shift a Pettieskirt one might say the whore was standing on the path which led to the back privy her hands clutched together above the swell of her bosom and below the drooping turkeywattles of her neck She was looking up at the sky What is it Stanley asked hurrying down to her Near scared ten years off my life ye did The moon Stanley she whispered Oh look at the moon would ye He looked up and what he saw set his heart thumping but he tried to speak reasonably and calmly Come now Pettie its dust thats all Be reasonable dear ye know how the winds blown these last few days and no rain to knock down what it carries its dust thats all Yet it didnt look like dust I know what I see whispered Pettie Above them Demon Moon grinned and winked one eye through what appeared to be a shifting scrim of blood While a certain whore and certain bartender were still gaping up at the bloody moon Kimba Rimer awoke sneezing Damn a cold for Reaping he thought As much as I have to be out over the next two days Ill be lucky if it doesnt turn into  Something fluffed the end of his nose and he sneezed again Coming out of his narrow chest and dry slot of a mouth it sounded like a smallcaliber pistolshot in the black room Whos there he cried No answer Rimer suddenly imagined a bird something nasty and badtempered that had gotten in here in daylight and was now flying around in the dark fluttering against his face as he slept His skin crawled  birds bugs bats he hated them all  and he fumbled so energetically for the gaslamp on the table by his bed that he almost knocked it off onto the floor As he drew it toward him that flutter came again This time puffing at his cheek Rimer screamed and recoiled against the pillows clutching the lamp to his chest He turned the switch on the side heard the hiss of gas then pushed the spark The lamp lit and in the thin circle of its radiance he saw not a fluttering bird but Clay Reynolds sitting on the edge of the bed In one hand Reynolds held the feather with which he had been tickling Mejias Chancellor His other was hidden in his cloak which lay in his lap Reynolds had disliked Rimer from their first meeting in the woods far west of town  those same woods beyond Eyebolt Canyon where Farsons man Latigo now quartered the main contingent of his troops It had been a windy night and as he and the other Coffin Hunters entered the little glade where Rimer accompanied by Lengyll and Croydon were sitting by a small fire Reynoldss cloak swirled around him Sai Manto Rimer had said and the other two had laughed It had been meant as a harmless joke but it hadnt seemed harmless to Reynolds In many of the lands where he had travelled manto meant not cloak but leaner or bender It was in fact a slang term for homosexual That Rimer a provincial man under his veneer of cynical sophistication didnt know this never crossed Reynoldss mind He knew when people were making small of him and if he could make such a person pay he did so For Kimba Rimer payday had come Reynolds What are you doing How did you get in h   You got to be thinking of the wrong cowboy the man sitting on the bed replied No Reynolds here Just Senor Manto He took out the hand which had been under his cloak In it was a keenly honed cuchillo Reynolds had purchased it in Low Market with this chore in mind He raised it now and drove the twelveinch blade into Rimers chest It went all the way through pinning him like a bug A bedbug Reynolds thought The lamp fell out of Rimers hands and rolled off the bed It landed on the footrunner but did not break On the far wall was Kimba Rimers distorted struggling shadow The shadow of the other man bent over it like a hungry vulture Reynolds lifted the hand which had held the knife He turned it so the small blue tattooed coffin between thumb and forefinger was in front of Rimers eyes He wanted it to be the last thing Rimer saw on this side of the clearing Lets hear you make fun of me now Reynolds said He smiled Come on Lets just hear you  Shortly before five oclock Mayor Thorin woke from a terrible dream In it a bird with pink eyes had been cruising slowly back and forth above the Barony Wherever its shadow fell the grass turned yellow the leaves fell shocked from the trees and the crops died The shadow was turning his green and pleasant Barony into a waste land It may be my Barony but its my bird too he thought just before awakening huddled into a shuddery ball on one side of his bed My bird I brought it here I let it out of its cage There would be no more sleep for him this night and Thorin knew it He poured himself a glass of water drank it then walked into his study absently picking his nightgown from the cleft of his bony old ass as he went The puff on the end of his nightcap bobbed between his shoulder blades his knees cracked at every step As for the guilty feelings expressed by the dream    well what was done was done Jonas and his friends would have what theyd come for and paid so handsomely for in another day a day after that theyd be gone Fly away bird with the pink eyes and pestilent shadow fly away to wherever you came from and take the Big Coffin Boys with you He had an idea that by Years End hed be too busy dipping his wick to think much about such things Or to dream such dreams Besides dreams without visible sign were just dreams not omens The visible sign might have been the boots beneath the study drapes  just the scuffed tips of them showing  but Thorin never looked in that direction His eyes were fixed on the bottle beside his favorite chair Drinking claret at five in the morning was no sort of habit to get into but this once wouldnt hurt Hed had a terrible dream for gods sake and after all  Tomorrows Reaping he said sitting in the wingchair on the edge of the hearth I guess a man can jump a fence or two come Reap He poured himself a drink the last hed ever take in this world and coughed as the fire hit his belly and then climbed back up his throat warming it Better aye much No giant birds now no plaguey shadows He stretched out his arms laced his long and bony fingers together and cracked them viciously I hate it when you do that you scrawny git spoke a voice directly into Thorins left ear Thorin jumped His heart took its own tremendous leap in his chest The empty glass flew from his hand and there was no footrunner to cushion its landing It smashed on the hearth Before Thorin could scream Roy Depape brushed off the mayoral nightcap seized the gauzy remains of the mayoral mane and yanked the mayoral head back The knife Depape held in his other hand was much humbler than the one Reynolds had used but it cut the old mans throat efficiently enough Blood sprayed scarlet in the dim room Depape let go of Thorins hair went back to the drapes he had been hiding behind and picked something up off the floor It was Cuthberts lookout Depape brought it back to the chair and put it in the dying Mayors lap Bird   Thorin gargled through a mouthful of blood Bird Yar old fella and trig o you to notice at a time like this I will say Depape pulled Thorins head back again and took the old mans eyes out with two quick flips of his knife One went into the dead fireplace the other hit the wall and slid down behind the firetools Thorins right foot trembled briefly and was still One more job to do Depape looked around saw Thorins nightcap and decided the ball on the end would serve He picked it up dipped it in the puddle of blood in the Mayors lap and drew the Good Mans sigul   on the wall There he murmured standing back If that dont finish em nothing on earth will True enough The only question left unanswered was whether or not Rolands katet could be taken alive  Jonas had told Fran Lengyll exactly where to place his men two inside the stable and six more out three of these latter gents hidden behind rusty old implements two hidden in the burntout remains of the home place one  Dave Hollis  crouched on top of the stable itself spying over the roofpeak Lengyll was glad to see that the men in the posse took their job seriously They were only boys it was true but boys who had on one occasion come off ahead of the Big Coffin Hunters Sheriff Avery gave a fair impression of being in charge of things until they got within a good shout of the Bar K Then Lengyll machinegun slung over one shoulder and as straighthacked in the saddle as he had been at twenty took command Avery who looked nervous and sounded out of breath seemed relieved rather than offended Ill tell ye where to go as was old to me for its a good plan and Ive no quarrel with it Lengyll had told his posse In the dark their faces were little more than dim blurs Only one thing Ill say to ye on my own hook We dont need em alive but its best we have em so  its the Barony we want to put paid to em the common folk and so put paid to this whole business as well Shut the door on it if ye will So I say this if theres cause to shoot shoot But Ill flay the skin off the face of any man who shoots without cause Do ye understand No response It seemed they did All right Lengyll had said His face was stony Ill give ye a minute to make sure your gears muffled and then on we go Not another word from here on out  Roland Cuthbert and Alain came out of the bunkhouse at quarter past six that morning and stood arow on the porch Alain was finishing his coffee Cuthbert was yawning and stretching Roland was buttoning his shirt and looking southwest toward the Bad Grass He was thinking not of ambushes but of Susan Her tears Greedy old ka how I hate it she had said His instincts did not awake Alains touch which had sensed Jonas on the day Jonas had killed the pigeons did not so much as quiver As for Cuthbert  One more day of quiet that worthy exclaimed to the dawning sky One more day of grace One more day of silence broken only by the lovers sigh and the tattoo of horses hoofs One more day of your bullshit Alain said Come on They set off across the dooryard sensing the eight pairs of eyes on them not at all They walked into the stable past the two men flanking the door one hidden behind an ancient harrow the other tucked behind an untidy stack of hay both with guns drawn Only Rusher sensed something was wrong He stamped his feet rolled his eyes and as Roland backed him out of his stall tried to rear Hey boy he said and looked around Spiders I reckon He hates them Outside Lengyll stood up and waved both hands forward Men moved silently toward the front of the stable On the roof Dave Hollis stood with his gun drawn His monocle was tucked away in his vest pocket so it should blink no badly timed reflection Cuthbert led his mount out of the stable Alain followed Roland came last shortleading the nervous prancy gelding Look Cuthbert said cheerily still unaware of the men standing directly behind him and his friends He was pointing north A cloud in the shape of a bear Good luck for   Dont move cullies Fran Lengyll called Dont so much as shuffle yer godpounding feet Alain did begin to turn  in startlement more than anything else  and there was a ripple of small clicking sounds like many dry twigs all snapping at once The sound of cocking pistols and musketoons No Al Roland said Dont move Dont In his throat despair rose like poison and tears of rage stung at the comers of his eyes  yet he stood quiet Cuthbert and Alain must stand quiet too If they moved theyd be killed Dont move he called again Either of you Wise cully Lengylls voice was closer now and accompanied by several pairs of footfalls Put yer hands behind ye Two shadows flanked Roland long in the first light Judging by the bulk of the one on his left he guessed it was being thrown by Sheriff Avery He probably wouldnt be offering them any white tea this day Lengyll would belong to the other shadow Hurry up Dearborn or whatever yer name may be Get em behind ye Small of yer back Theres guns pointed at your pards and if we end up taking in only two of yer instead of three lifell go on Not taking any chances with us Roland thought and felt a moment of perverse pride With it came a taste of something that was almost amusement Bitter though that taste continued very bitter Roland It was Cuthbert and there was agony in his voice Roland dont But there was no choice Roland put his hands behind his back Rusher uttered a small reproving whinny as if to say all this was highly improper  and trotted away to stand beside the bunkhouse porch Youre going to feel metal on your wrists Lengyll said Esposas  Two cold circles slipped over Rolands hands I here was a click and suddenly the arcs of the handcuffs were tight against his wrists All right said another voice Now you son Be damned if I will Cuthberts voice wavered on the edge of hysteria There was a thud and a muffled cry of pain Roland turned around and saw Alain down on one knee the heel of his left hand pressed against his forehead Blood ran down his face Ye want me to deal him another un Jake White asked He had an old pistol in his hand reversed so the butt was forward I can you know my arm is feeling wery limber for this early in the day No Cuthbert was twitching with horror and something like grief Ranged behind him were three armed men looking on with nervous avidity Then be a good boy an get yer hands behind yer Cuthbert still fighting tears did as he was told Esposas were put on him by Deputy Bridger The other two men yanked Alain to his feet He reeled a little then stood firm as he was handcuffed His eyes met Rolands and Al tried to smile In some ways it was the worst moment of that terrible ambush morning Roland nodded back and made himself a promise he would never be taken like this again not if he lived to be a thousand years old Lengyll was wearing a trailscarf instead of a string tie this morning but Roland thought he was inside the same boxtail coat hed worn to the Mayors welcoming party all those weeks ago Standing beside him puffing with excitement anxiety and selfimportance was Sheriff Avery Boys the Sheriff said yere arrested for transgressing the Barony The specific charges are treason and murder Who did we murder Alain asked mildly and one of the posse uttered a laugh either shocked or cynical Roland couldnt tell which The Mayor and his Chancellor as ye know quite well Avery said Now   How can you do this Roland asked curiously It was Lengyll to whom he spoke Mejis is your home place Ive seen the line of your fathers in the town cemetery How can you do this to your home place sai Lengyll Ive no intention of standing out here and making palaver with ye Lengyll said He glanced over Rolands shoulder Alvarez Get his horse Boys as trig as this bunch should have no problem riding with their hands behind their   No tell me Roland interposed Dont hold back sai Lengyll  these are your friends youve come with and not a one who isnt inside your circle How can you do it Would you rape your own mother if you came upon her sleeping with her dress up Lengylls mouth twitched  not with shame or embarrassment but momentary prudish distaste and then the old rancher looked at Avery They teach em to talk pretty in Gilead dont they Avery had a rifle Now he stepped toward the handcuffed gunslinger with the butt raised Ill teach im how to talk proper to a man of the gentry so I will Knock the teef straight out of his head if you say aye Fran Lengyll held him back looking tired Dont be a fool I dont want to bring him back laying over a saddle unless hes dead Avery lowered his gun Lengyll turned to Roland Yere not going to live long enough to profit from advice Dearborn he said but Ill giveee some anyway stick with the winners in this world And know how the wind blows so ye can tell when it changes direction Youve forgotten the face of your father you scurrying little maggot Cuthbert said clearly This got to Lengyll in a way Rolands remark about his mother had not  it showed in the sudden bloom of color in his weathered cheeks Get em mounted he said I want em locked up tight within the hour  Roland was boosted into Rushers saddle so hard he almost flew off on the other side  would have if Dave Hollis had not been there to steady him and then to wedge Rolands boot into the stirrup Dave offered the gunslinger a nervous halfembarrassed smile Im sorry to see you here Roland said gravely Its sorry I am to be here the deputy said If murder was your business I wish youd gotten to it sooner And your friend shouldnt have been so arrogant as to leave his callingcard He nodded toward Cuthbert Roland hadnt the slightest idea what Deputy Dave was referring to but it didnt matter It was just part of the frame and none of these men believed much of it Dave likely included Although Roland supposed they would come to believe it in later years and tell it to their children and grandchildren as gospel The glorious day theyd ridden with the posse and taken down the traitors The gunslinger used his knees to turn Rusher    and there standing by the gate between the Bar Ks dooryard and the lane leading to the Great Road was Jonas himself He sat astride a deepchested bay wearing a green felt drovers hat and an old gray duster There was a rifle in the scabbard beside his right knee The left side of the duster was pulled back to expose the butt of his revolver Jonass white hair untied today lay over his shoulders He doffed his hat and held it out to Roland in courtly greeting A good game he said You played very well for someone who was taking his milk out of a tit not so long ago Old man Roland said youve lived too long Jonas smiled Youd remedy that if you could wouldnt you Yar I reckon He flicked his eyes at Lengyll Get their toys Fran Look specially sharp for knives Theyve got guns but not with em Yet I know a bit more about those shooting irons than they might think And funny boys slingshot Dont forget that for gods sake He like to take Roys head off with it not so long ago Are you talking about the carrottop Cuthbert asked His horse was dancing under him Bert swayed back and forth and from side to side like a circus rider to keep from tumbling off He never would have missed his head His balls maybe but not his head Probably true Jonas agreed watching as the spears and Rolands shortbow were taken into custody The slingshot was on the back of Cuthberts belt tucked into a holster he had made for it himself It was very well for Roy Depape that he hadnt tried Bert Roland knew  Bert could take a bird on the wing at sixty yards A pouch holding steel shot hung at the boys left side Bridger took it as well While this was going on Jonas fixed Roland with an amiable smile Whats your real name brat Fess up  no harm in telling now youre going to ride the handsome and we both know it Roland said nothing Lengyll looked at Jonas eyebrows raised Jonas shrugged then jerked his head in the direction of town Lengyll nodded and poked Roland with one hard chapped finger Come on boy Lets ride Roland squeezed Rushers sides the horse trotted toward Jonas And suddenly Roland knew something As with all his best and truest intuitions it came from nowhere and everywhere  absent at one second all there and fully dressed at the next Who sent you west maggot he asked as he passed Jonas Couldnt have been Cort  youre too old Was it his father The look of slightly bored amusement left Jonass face  flew from his face as if slapped away For one amazing moment the man with the white hair was a child again shocked shamed and hurt Yes Corts da  I see it in your eyes And now youre here on the Clean Sea  except youre really in the west The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west Jonass gun was out and cocked in his hand with such speed that only Rolands extraordinary eyes were capable of marking the movement There was a murmur from the men behind them  partly shock mostly awe Jonas dont be a fool Lengyll snarled You aint killin em after we took the time and risk to hood em and tie their hooks are ye Jonas seemed to take no notice His eyes were wide the comers of his seamed mouth were trembling Watch your words Will Dearborn he said in a low hoarse voice You want to watch em ever so close I got two pounds of pressure on a threepound trigger right this second Fine shoot me Roland said He lifted his head and looked down at Jonas Shoot exile Shoot worm Shoot you failure Youll still live in exile and die as you lived For a moment he was sure Jonas would shoot and in that moment Roland felt death would be enough an acceptable end after the shame of being caught so easily In that moment Susan was absent from his mind Nothing breathed in that moment nothing called nothing moved The shadows of the men watching this confrontation both on foot and on horseback were printed depthless on the dirt Then Jonas dropped the hammer of his gun and slipped it back into its holster Take em to town and jug em he said to Lengyll And when I show up I dont want to see one hair harmed on one head If I could keep from killing this one you can keep from hurting the rest Now go on Move Lengyll said His voice had lost some of its bluff authority It was now the voice of a man who realizes too late that he has bought chips in a game where the stakes are likely much too high They rode As they did Roland turned one last time The contempt Jonas saw in those cool young eyes stung him worse than the whips that had scarred his back in Garlan years ago  When they were out of sight Jonas went into the bunkhouse pulled up the board which concealed their little armory and found only two guns The matched set of sixshooters with the dark handles  Dearborns guns surely  were gone You re in the west The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west Youll live in exile and die as you lived Jonass hands went to work disassembling the revolvers Cuthbert and Alain had brought west Alains had never even been worn save on the practicerange Outside Jonas threw the pieces scattering them every which way He threw as hard as he could trying to rid himself of that cool blue gaze and the shock of hearing what hed believed no man had known Roy and Clay suspected but even they hadnt known for sure Before the sun went down everyone in Mejis would know that Eldred Jonas the whitehaired regulator with the tattooed coffin on his hand was nothing but a failed gunslinger Youll live in exile and die as you lived Praps he said looking at the burnedout ranch house without really seeing it But Ill live longer than you young Dearborn and die long after your bones are rusting in the ground He mounted up and swung his horse around sawing viciously at the reins He rode for Citgo where Roy and Clay would be waiting and he rode hard but Rolands eyes rode with him  Wake up Wake up sai Wake up Wake up At first the words seemed to be coming from far away drifting down by some magical means to the dark place where she lay Even when the voice was joined by a rudely shaking hand and Susan knew she must wake up it was a long hard struggle It had been weeks since shed gotten a decent nights sleep and she had expected more of the same last night   especially last night She had lain awake in her luxurious bedchamber at Seafront tossing from side to side possibilities  none good  crowding her mind The nightgown she wore crept up to her hips and bunched at the small of her back When she got up to use the commode she took the hateful thing off hurled it into a comer and crawled back into bed naked Being out of the heavy silk nightgown had done the trick She dropped off almost at once    and in this case dropped off was exactly right it was less like falling asleep than falling into some thoughtless dreamless crack in the earth Now this intruding voice This intruding arm shaking her so hard that her head rolled from side to side on the pillow Susan tried to slide away from it pulling her knees up to her chest and mouthing fuzzy protests but the arm followed The shaking recommenced the nagging calling voice never stopped Wake up sai Wake up In the name of the Turtle and the Bear wake up Marias voice Susan hadnt recognized it at first because Maria was so upset Susan had never heard her so or expected to Yet it was so the maid sounded on the verge of hysteria Susan sat up For a moment so much input  all of it wrong  crashed in on her that she was incapable of moving The duvet beneath which she had slept tumbled into her lap exposing her breasts and she could do no more than pluck weakly at it with the tips of her fingers The first wrong thing was the light It flooded through the windows more strongly than it ever had before    because she realized she had never been in this room so late before Gods it had to be ten o the clock perhaps later The second wrong thing was the sounds from below Mayors House was ordinarily a peaceful place in the morning until noon one heard little but casa vaqueros leading the horses out for their morning exercise the whickerwhickerwhick of Miguel sweeping the courtyard and the constant boom and shush of the waves This morning there were shouts curses galloping horses the occasional burst of strange jagged laughter Somewhere outside her room  perhaps not in this wing but close  Susan heard the running thud of booted feet The wrongest thing of all was Maria herself cheeks ashy beneath her olive skintone and her usually neat hair tangled and unbound Susan would have guessed only an earthquake could make her look so if that Maria what is it You have to go sai Seafront maybe not safe for you just now Your own house maybe better When I dont see you earlier I think you gone there already You chose a bad day to sleep late Go Susan asked Slowly she pulled the duvet all the way up to her nose and stared at Maria over it with wide puffy eyes What do you mean go Out the back Maria plucked the duvet from Susans sleepnumbed hands again and this time stripped it all the way down to her ankles Like you did before Now missy now Dress and go Those boys put away aye but what if they have friends What if they come back kill you too Susan had been getting up Now all the strength ran out of her legs and she sat back down on the bed again Boys she whispered Boys kill who Boys kill who This was a good distance from grammatical but Maria took her meaning Dearborn and his pinboys she said Who are they supposed to have killed The Mayor and the Chancellor She looked at Susan with a kind of distracted sympathy Now get up I tell you And get gone This place gone loco They didnt do any such thing Susan said and only just restrained herself from adding It wasnt in the plan Sai Thorin and sai Rimer jus as dead whoever did it There were more shouts below and a sharp little explosion that didnt sound like a firecracker Maria looked in that direction then began to throw Susan her clothes The Mayors eyes they gouged right out of his head They couldnt have Maria I know them   Me I dont know nothing about them and care less  but I care about you Get dressed and get out I tell you Quick as you can Whats happened to them A terrible thought came to Susan and she leaped to her feet clothes falling all around her She seized Maria by the shoulders They havent been killed Susan shook her Say they havent been killed I dont think so Theres been a tousan shouts and ten tousan rumors go the rounds but I think jus jailed Only   There was no need for her to finish her eyes slipped from Susans and that involuntary shift along with the confused shouts from below told all the rest Not killed yet but Hart Thorin had been greatly liked and from an old family Roland Cuthbert and Alain were strangers Not killed yet  but tomorrow was Reaping and tomorrow night was Reaping Bonfire Susan began to dress as fast as she could  Reynolds who had been with Jonas longer than Depape took one look at the figure cantering toward them through the skeletal oil derricks and turned to his partner Dont ask him any questions  hes not in any mood for silly questions this morning How do you know Never mind Just keep your everfucking gob shut Jonas reined up before them He sat slumped in his saddle pale and thoughtful His look prompted one question from Roy Depape in spite of Reynoldss caution Eldred are you all right Is anyone Jonas responded then fell silent again Behind them Citgos few remaining pumpers squalled tiredly At last Jonas roused himself and sat a little straighter in the saddle The cubsll be stored supplies by now I told Lengyll and Avery to fire a double set of pistolshots if anything went wrong and there hasnt been any shooting like that We didnt hear none either Eldred Depape said eagerly Nothing atall like that Jonas grimaced You wouldnt would you Not out in this noise Fool Depape bit his lip saw something in the neighborhood of his left stirrup that needed adjusting and bent to it Were you boys seen at your business Jonas asked This morning I mean when you sent Rimer and Thorin off Even a chance either of you was seen Reynolds shook his head for both of them  Twas clean as could be Jonas nodded as if the subject had been of only passing interest to him then turned to regard the oilpatch and the rusty derricks Mayhap folks are right he said in a voice almost too low to hear Mayhap the Old People were devils He turned back to them Well were the devils now Aint we Clay Whatever you think Eldred Reynolds said I said what I think Were the devils now and by God thats how well behave What about Quint and that lot down there He cocked his head toward the forested slope where the ambush had been laid Still there pending your word Reynolds said No need of em now He favored Reynolds with a dark look That Dearborns a coozey brat I wish I was going to be in Hambry tomorrow night just so I could lay a torch between his feet I almost left him cold and dead at the Bar K Wouldve if not for Lengyll Coozey little brat is what he is Slumping as he spoke Face growing blacker and blacker like storm clouds drifting across the sun Depape his stirrup fixed tossed Reynolds a nervous glance Reynolds didnt answer it What point If Eldred went crazy now and Reynolds had seen it happen before there was no way they could get out of his killingzone in time Eldred we got quite a spot more to do Reynolds spoke quietly but it got through Jonas straightened He took off his hat hung it on his saddle as if the horn were a coathook and brushed absently through his hair with his fingers Yar  quite a spot is right Ride down there Tell Quint to send for oxen to pull those last two full tankers out to Hanging Rock He shd keep four men with him to hook em up and take em on to Latigo The rest can go on ahead Reynolds now judged it safe to ask a question When do the rest of Latigos men get there Men Jonas snorted Dont we wish cully The rest of Latigos boysll ride out to Hanging Rock by moonlight pennons no doubt flying for all the coyotes and other assorted desertdogs to see and be awed by Theyll be ready to do escort duty by ten tomorrow I shd think  although if theyre the sort of lads Im expecting fuckups are apt to be the rule of the day The good news is that we dont much need em anyway Things look well in hand Now go down there get them about their business and then ride back to me just as fasts you can Jonas turned and looked toward the lumpy swell of hills to the northwest We have business of our own he said Soonest begun boys soonest done I want to shake the dust of fucking Mejis off my hat and boots as soon as I can I dont like the way it feels anymore Not at all  The woman Theresa Maria Dolores OShyven was forty years old plump pretty mother of four husband of Peter a vaquero of laughing temperament She was also a seller of rugs and draperies in the Upper Market many of the prettier and more delicate appointments at Seafront had passed through Theresa OShyvens hands and her family was quite welltodo Although her husband was a rangerider the OShyven clan was what would have been called middleclass in another place and time Her two oldest children were grown and gone one right out o Barony The third eldest was sparking and hoping to marry his hearts delight at Years End Only the youngest suspected something was wrong with Ma and this one had no idea how close Theresa was to complete obsessional madness Soon Rhea thought watching Theresa avidly in the ball She II start doing it soon but first shes got to get rid of the brat There was no school at Reaptide and the stalls opened only for a few hours in the afternoon so Theresa sent her youngest daughter off with a pie A Reaptide gift to a neighbor Rhea surmised although she couldnt hear the soundless instructions the woman gave her daughter as she pulled a knitted cap down over the girls ears And twouldnt be a neighbor too close either shed want time would Theresa Maria Dolores OShyven time to be achoring It was a goodsized house and there were a lot of corners in it that needed cleaning Rhea chuckled the chuckle turned into a hollow gust of coughing In the corner Musty looked at the old woman hauntedly Although far from the emaciated skeleton that his mistress had become Musty didnt look good at all The girl was shown out with the pie under her arm she paused to give her mother a single troubled look and then the door was shut in her face Now Rhea croaked Them comers is waitin Down on yer knees woman and get to business First Theresa went to the window When she was satisfied with what she saw  her daughter out the gate and down the High Street likely  she turned back to her kitchen She walked to the table and stood there looking dreamyeyed into space No none o that now Rhea cried impatiently She no longer saw her own filthy hut she no longer smelled either its rank aromas or her own She had gone into the Wizards Rainbow She was with Theresa OShyven whose cottage had the cleanest comers in all Mejis Mayhap in all MidWorld Hurry woman Rhea halfscreamed Get to yer housework As if hearing Theresa unbuttoned her housedress stepped out of it and laid it neatly over a chair She pulled the hem of her clean mended shift up over her knees went to the comer and got down on all fours Thats it my corazon Rhea cried nearly choking on a phlegmy mixture of coughing and laughter Do yer chores now and do em wery pert Theresa OShyven poked her head forward to the full length of her neck opened her mouth stuck out her tongue and began to lick the corner She lapped it as Musty lapped his milk Rhea watched this slapping her knee and whooping her face growing redder and redder as she rocked from side to side Oh Theresa was her favorite aye No doubt For hours now she would crawl about on her hands and knees with her ass in the air licking into the comers praying to some obscure god  not even the ManJesus God  for forgiveness of who knew what as she did this her penance Sometimes she got splinters in her tongue and had to pause to spit blood into the kitchen basin Up until now some sixth sense had always gotten her to her feet and back into her dress before any of her family returned but Rhea knew that sooner or later the womans obsession would take her too far and she would be surprised Perhaps today would be the day  the little girl would come back early perhaps for a coin to spend in town and discover her mother down on her knees and licking the comers Oh what a spin and raree How Rhea wanted to see it How she longed to  Suddenly Theresa OShyven was gone The interior of her neat little cottage was gone Everything was gone lost in curtains of shifting pink light For the first time in weeks the wizards glass had gone blank Rhea picked the ball up in her scrawny longnailed fingers and shook it Whats wrong with you plaguey thing Whats wrong The ball was heavy and Rheas strength was fading After two or three hard shakes it slipped in her grip She cradled it against the deflated remains of her breasts trembling No no lovey she crooned Come back when yere ready aye Rhea lost her temper a bit but shes got it back now she never meant to shake ye and shed never ever drop ye so ye just   She broke off and cocked her head listening Horses approaching No not approaching here Three riders by the sound They had crept up on her while she was distracted The boys Those plaguey boys Rhea held the ball against her bosom eyes wide lips wet Her hands were now so thin that the balls pink glow shone through them faintly illuminating the dark spokes that were her bones Rhea Rhea of the Coos No not the boys Come out here and bring what you were given Worse Farson wants his property Weve come to take it Not the boys but the Big Coffin Hunters Never ye dirty old whitehaired prick she whispered Yell never take it Her eyes moved from side to side in small shooting peeks Scraggleheaded and tremblemouthed she looked like a diseased coyote driven into its final arroyo She looked down at the ball and a whining noise began to escape her Now even the pink glow was gone The sphere was as dark as a corpses eyeball  A shriek came from the hut Depape turned to Jonas with wide eyes his skin prickling The thing which had uttered that cry hardly sounded human Rhea Jonas called again Bring it out here now woman and hand it over Ive no time to play games with you The door of the hut swung open Depape and Reynolds drew their guns as the old crone stepped out blinking against the sunlight like something thats spent its whole life in a cave She was holding John Farsons favorite toy high over her head There were plenty of rocks in the dooryard she could throw it against and even if her aim was bad and she missed them all it might smash anyway This could be bad and Jonas knew it  there were some people you just couldnt threaten He had focused so much of his attention on the brats who ironically had been taken as easy as milk that it had never occurred to him to worry much about this part of it And Kimba Rimer the man who had suggested Rhea as the perfect custodian for Maerlyns Rainbow was dead Couldnt lay it at Rimers doorstep if things went wrong up here could he Then just to make things a little worse when hed have thought theyd gone as far west as they could without dropping off the cold end of the earth he heard the cocking sound of Depape drawing the hammer of his gun Put that away you idiot he snarled But look at her Depape almost moaned Look at her Eldred He was The thing inside the black dress appeared to be wearing the corpse of a putrefying snake around its throat for a necklace She was so scrawny that she resembled nothing so much as a walking skeleton Her peeling skull was only tufted with hair the rest had fallen out Sores clustered on her cheeks and brow and there was a mark like a spiderbite on the left side of her mouth Jonas thought that last might be a scurvybloom but he didnt really care one way or another What he cared about was the ball upraised in the dying womans long and shivering claws  The sunlight so dazzled Rheas eyes that she didnt see the gun pointed at her and when her vision cleared Depape had put it away again She looked at the men lined up across from her  the bespectacled redhead the one in the cloak and Old WhiteHair Jonas  and uttered a dusty croak of laughter Had she been afraid of them these mighty Coffin Hunters She supposed she had but for gods sake why They were men that was all just more men and she had been beating such all her life Oh they thought they ruled the roost all right  nobody in MidWorld accused anyone of forgetting the face of his mother  but they were poor things at bottom moved to tears by a sad song utterly undone by the sight of a bare breast and all the more capable of being manipulated simply because they were so sure they were strong and tough and wise The glass was dark and as much as she hated that darkness it had cleared her mind Jonas she cried Eldred Jonas Im here old mother he said Long days and pleasant nights Never mind yer sops times too short for em She came four steps farther and stopped with the ball still held over her head Near her a gray chunk of stone jutted from the weedy ground She looked at it then back at Jonas The implication was unspoken but unmistakable What do you want Jonas asked The balls gone dark she said answering from the side All the time I had it in my keeping it was lively  aye even when it showed nothing I could make out it was passing lively bright and pink  but it fell dark almost at the sound of yer voice It doesnt want to go with ye Nevertheless Im under orders to take it Jonass voice became soft and conciliating It wasnt the tone he used when he was in bed with Coral but it was close Think a minute and youll see my situation Farson wants it and who am I to stand against the wants of a man wholl be the most powerful in MidWorld when Demon Moon rises next year If I come back without it and say Rhea of the Coos refused me it Ill be killed If ye come back and tell him I broke it in yer ugly old face yell be killed too Rhea said She was close enough for Jonas to see how far her sickness had eaten into her Above the few remaining tufts of her hair the wretched ball was trembling back and forth She wouldnt be able to hold it much longer A minute at most Jonas felt a dew of sweat spring out on his forehead Aye mother But dyou know given a choice of deaths Id choose to take the cause of my problem with me Thats you darling She croaked again  that dusty replica of laughter  and nodded appreciatively  Twont do Farson any good without me in any case she said Its found its mistress I wot  thats why it went dark at the sound of yer voice Jonas wondered how many others had believed the ball was just for them He wanted to wipe the sweat from his brow before it ran in his eyes but kept his hands in front of him folded neatly on the horn of his saddle He didnt dare look at either Reynolds or Depape and could only hope they would leave the play to him She was balanced on both a physical and mental knifeedge the smallest movement would send her tumbling off in one direction or the other Found the one it wants has it He thought he saw a way out of this If he was lucky And it might be lucky for her as well What should we do about that Take me with ye Her face twisted into an expression of gruesome greed she looked like a corpse that is trying to sneeze She doesnt realize shes dying Jonas thought Thank the gods for that Take the ball but take me as well Ill go with ye to Farson Ill become his soothsayer and nothing will stand before us not with me to read the ball for him Take me with ye All right Jonas said It was what he had hoped for Although what Farson decides is none o mine You know that Aye Good Now give me the ball Ill give it back into your keeping if you like but I need to make sure its whole She slowly lowered it Jonas didnt think it was entirely safe even cradled in her arms but he breathed a little easier when it was all the same She shuffled toward him and he had to control an urge to gig his horse back from her He bent over in the saddle holding his hands out for the glass She looked up at him her old eyes still shrewd behind their crusted lids One of them actually drew down in a conspirators wink I know yer mind Jonas Ye think Ill take the ball then draw my gun and kill her what harm Isnt that true Yet there would be harm and all to you and yours Kill me and the ball will never shine for Farson again For someone aye someday mayhap but not for him    and will he let ye live if ye bring his toy back and he discovers its broken Jonas had already considered this We have a bargain old mother You go west with the glass  unless you die beside the trail some night Youll pardon me for saying so but you dont look well She cackled Im bettern I look oh yar Years left fore this clock o mine runs down Ithink you may be wrong about that old mother Jonas thought But he kept his peace and only held his hands out for the ball For a moment longer she held it Their arrangement was made and agreed to on both sides but in the end she could barely bring herself to ungrasp the ball Greed shone in her eyes like moonlight through fog He held his hands out patiently saying nothing waiting for her mind to accept reality  if she let go there was some chance If she held on very likely everyone in this stony weedy yard would end up riding the handsome before long With a sigh of regret she finally put the ball in his hands At the instant it passed from her to him an ember of pink light pulsed deep in the depths of the glass A throb of pain drove into Jonass head    and a shiver of lust coiled in his balls As from a great distance he heard Depape and Reynolds cocking their pistols Put those away Jonas said But   Reynolds looked confused They thoughtee was going to doublecross Rhea the old woman said cackling Good thing yere in charge rather than them Jonas  mayhap you know summat they dont He knew something all right  how dangerous the smooth glassy thing in his hands was It could take him in a blink if it wanted And in a month he would be like the witch scrawny raddled with sores and too obsessed to know or care Put them away he shouted Reynolds and Depape exchanged a glance then reholstered their guns There was a bag for this thing Jonas said A drawstring bag laid inside the box Get it Aye Rhea said grinning unpleasantly at him But it wont keep the ball from takin ye if it wants to Ye neednt think it will She surveyed the other two and her eye fixed on Reynolds Theres a cart in my shed and a pair of good gray goats to pull it She spoke to Reynolds but her eyes kept turning back to the ball Jonas noticed   and now his damned eyes wanted to go there too You dont give me orders Reynolds said No but I do Jonas said His eyes dropped to the ball both wanting and fearing to see that pink spark of life deep inside Nothing Cold and dark He dragged his gaze back up to Reynolds again Get the cart  Reynolds heard the buzzing of flies even before he slipped through the sheds sagging door and knew at once that Rheas goats had finished their days of pulling They lay bloated and dead in their pen legs sticking up and the sockets of their eyes squirming with maggots It was impossible to know when Rhea had last fed and watered them but Reynolds guessed at least a week from the smell Too busy watching what goes on in that glass ball to bother he thought And whats she wearing that dead snake around her neck for I dont want to know he muttered from behind his pulledup neckerchief The only thing he did want right now was to get the hell out of here He spied the cart which was painted black and overlaid with cabalistic designs in gold It looked like a medicineshow wagon to Reynolds it also looked a bit like a hearse He seized it by the handles and dragged it out of the shed as fast as he could Depape could do the rest by gods Hitch his horse to the cart and haul the old womans stinking freight to  where Who knew Eldred maybe Rhea came tottering out of her hut with the drawstring bag theyd brought the ball in but she stopped head cocked listening when Reynolds asked his question Jonas thought it over then said Seafront to begin I guess Yar thatll do for her and this glass bauble as well I reckon until the partys over tomorrow Aye Seafront Ive never been there Rhea said moving forward again When she reached Jonass horse which tried to shy away from her she opened the bag After a moments further consideration Jonas dropped the ball in It bulged round at the bottom making a shape like a teardrop Rhea wore a sly smile Mayhap well meet Thorin If so I might have something to show him in the Good Mans toy thatd interest him ever so much If you meet him Jonas said getting down to help hitch Depapes horse to the black cart itll be in a place where no magic is needed to see far She looked at him frowning and then the sly smile slowly resurfaced Why I blieve our Mayors met wiv a accident Could be Jonas agreed She giggled and soon the giggle turned into a fullthroated cackle She was still cackling as they drew out of the yard cackling and sitting in the little black cart with its cabalistic decorations like the Queen of Black Places on her throne Panic is highly contagious especially in situations when nothing is known and everything is in flux It was the sight of Miguel the old mozo that started Susan down its greased slope He was in the middle of Seafronts courtyard clutching his broom of twigs against his chest and looking at the riders who passed to and fro with an expression of perplexed misery His sombrero was twisted around on his back and Susan observed with something like horror that Miguel  usually brushed and clean and neat as a pin  was wearing his serape inside out There were tears on his cheeks and as he turned this way and that following the passing riders trying to hile those he recognized she thought of a child she had once seen toddle out in front of an oncoming stage The child had been pulled back in time by his father who would pull Miguel back She started for him and a vaquero aboard a wildeyed spotted roan galloped so close by her that one stirrup ticked off her hip and the horses tail flicked her forearm She voiced a strangesounding little chuckle She had been worried about Miguel and had almost been run down herself Funny She looked both ways this time started forward then drew back again as a loaded wagon came careering around the comer tottering on two wheels at first What it was loaded with she couldnt see  the goods in the wagonbed were covered with a tarp  but she saw Miguel move toward it still clutching his broom Susan thought of the child in front of the stage again and shrieked an inarticulate cry of alarm Miguel cringed back at the last moment and the cart flew by him bounded and swayed across the courtyard and disappeared out through the arch Miguel dropped his broom clapped both hands to his cheeks fell to his knees and began to pray in a loud lamenting voice Susan watched him for a moment her mouth working and then sprinted for the stables no longer taking care to keep against the side of the building She had caught the disease that would grip almost all of Hambry by noon and although she managed to do a fairly apt job of saddling Pylon on any other day there would have been three stableboys vying for the chance to help the pretty sai any ability to think had left her by the time she heelkicked the startled horse into a run outside the stable door When she rode past Miguel still on his knees and praying to the bright sky with his hands upraised she saw him no more than any other rider had before her  She rode straight down the High Street thumping her spurless heels at Pylons sides until the big horse was fairly flying Thoughts questions possible plans of action  none of those had a place in her head as she rode She was but vaguely aware of the people milling in the street allowing Pylon to weave his own path through them The only thing she was aware of was his name  Roland Roland Roland  ringing in her head like a scream Everything had gone upside down The brave little katet they had made that night at the graveyard was broken three of its members jailed and with not long to live if they even were still alive the last member lost and confused as crazy with terror as a bird in a barn If her panic had held things might have turned out in a much different fashion But as she rode through the center of town and out the other side her way took her toward the house she had shared with her father and her aunt That lady had been watching for the very rider who now approached As Susan neared the door flew open and Cordelia dressed in black from throat to toe rushed down the front walk to the street shrieking with either horror or laughter Perhaps both The sight of her cut through the foreground haze of panic in Susans mind   but not because she recognized her aunt Rhea she cried and drew back on the reins so violently that the horse skidded reared and almost tilted them over backward That would likely have crushed the life out of his mistress but Pylon managed to keep at least his back feet pawing at the sky with his front ones and whinnying loudly Susan slung an arm around his neck and hung on for dear life Cordelia Delgado wearing her best black dress and a lace mantilla over her hair stood in front of the horse as if in her own parlor taking no notice of the hooves cutting the air less than two feet in front other nose In one gloved hand she held a wooden box Susan belatedly realized that this wasnt Rhea but the mistake really wasnt that odd Aunt Cord wasnt as thin as Rhea not yet anyway and more neatly dressed except for her dirty gloves  why her aunt was wearing gloves in the first place Susan didnt know let alone why they looked so smudged but the mad look in her eyes was horribly similar Good day tye Miss Oh So Young and Pretty Aunt Cord greeted her in a cracked vivacious voice that made Susans heart tremble Aunt Cord curtseyed onehanded holding the little box curled against her chest with the other Where go ye on this fine autumn day Where go ye so speedy To no lovers arms that seems sure for ones dead and the other taen Cordelia laughed again thin lips drawing back from big white teeth Horse teeth almost Her eyes glared in the sunlight Her minds broken Susan thought Poor thing Poor old thing Did thee put Dearborn up to it Aunt Cord asked She crept to Pylons side and looked up at Susan with luminous liquid eyes Thee did didnt thee Aye Perhaps thee even gave him the knife he used after runnin yer lips oer it for good luck Yere in it together  why not admit it At least admit thees lain with that boy for I know its true I saw the way he looked at ye the day ye were sitting in the window and the way ye looked back at him Susan said If yell have truth Ill give it to ye Were lovers And well be man and wife ere Years End Cordelia raised one dirty glove to the blue sky and waved it as if saying hello to the gods She screamed with mingled triumph and laughter as she waved And tbe wed she thinks Ooooo Yed no doubt drink the blood of your victims on the marriage altar too would ye not Oh wicked It makes me weep But instead of weeping she laughed again a howl of mirth into the blind blue face of the sky We planned no murders Susan said drawing  if only in her own mind  a line of difference between the killings at Mayors House and the trap they had hoped to spring on Parsons soldiers And he did no murders No this is the business of your friend Jonas I wot His plan his filthy work Cordelia plunged her hand into the box she held and Susan understood at once why the gloves she wore were dirty she had been grubbing in the stove I curse thee with the ashes Cordelia cried flinging a black and gritty cloud of them at Susans leg and the hand which held Pylons reins Icurse thee to darkness both of thee Be ye happy together ye faithless Ye murderers Ye cozeners Ye liars Ye fornicators Ye lost and renounced With each cry Cordelia Delgado threw another handful of ashes And with each cry Susans mind grew clearer colder She held fast and allowed her aunt to pelt her in fact when Pylon feeling the gritty rain against his side attempted to pull away Susan gigged him set There were spectators now avidly watching this old ritual of renunciation Sheemie was among them eyes wide and mouth quivering but Susan barely noticed Her mind was her own again she had an idea of what to do and for that alone she supposed she owed her aunt some sort of thanks I forgive ye Aunt she said The box of stoveashes now almost empty tumbled from Cordelias hands as if Susan had slapped her What she whispered What does thee say For what ye did to yer brother and my father Susan said For what ye were a part of She rubbed a hand on her leg and bent with the hand held out before her Before her aunt could pull away Susan had wiped ashes down one of her cheeks The smudge stood out there like a wide dark scar But wear that all the same she said Wash it off if ye like but I think yell wear it in yer heart yet awhile She paused I think ye already do Goodbye Where does thee think thees going Aunt Cord was pawing at the sootmark on her face with one gloved hand andwhen she lunged forward in an attempt to grasp Pylons reins she stumbled over the box and almost fell It was Susan still bent over to her aunts side who grasped her shoulder and held her up Cordelia pulled back as if from the touch of an adder Not to him Yell not go to him now ye mad goose Susan turned her horse away None of yer business Aunt This is the end between us But mark what I say well be married by Years End Our firstborn is already conceived Theell be married tomorrow night if thee goes nigh him Joined in smoke wedded in fire bedded in the ashes Bedded in the ashes do ye hear me The madwoman advanced on her railing but Susan had no more time to listen The day was fleeting There would be time to do the things that needed doing but only if she moved at speed Goodbye she said again and then galloped away Her aunts last words followed her In the ashes do ye hear me  On her way out of town along the Great Road Susan saw riders coming toward her and got off the highway This would not she felt be a good time to meet pilgrims There was an old granary nearby she rode Pylon behind it stroked his neck murmured for him to be quiet It took the riders longer to reach her position than she would have expected and when they finally got there she saw why Rhea was with them sitting in a black cart covered with magical symbols The witch had been scary when Susan had seen her on the night of the Kissing Moon but still recognizably human what the girl saw passing before her now rocking from side to side in the black cart and clutching a bag in her lap was an unsexed soreraddled creature that looked more like a troll than a human being With her were the Big Coffin Hunters To Seafront the thing in the cart screamed Hie you on and at full speed Ill sleep in Thorins bed tonight or know the reason why Sleep in it and piss in it if I take a notion Hie you on I say Depape  it was to his horse that the cart had been harnessed  turned around and looked at her with distaste and fear Still your mouth Her answer was a fresh burst of laughter She rocked from side to side holding a bag on her lap with one hand and pointing at Depape with the twisted longnailed index finger of the other Looking at her made Susan feel weak with terror and she felt the panic around her again like some dark fluid that would happily drown her brain if given half a chance She worked against the feeling as best she could holding onto her mind refusing to let it turn into what it had been before and would be again if she let it  a brainless bird trapped in a barn bashing into the walls and ignoring the open window through which it had entered Even when the cart was gone below the next hill and there was nothing left of them but dust hanging in the air she could hear Rheas wild cackling  She reached the hut in the Bad Grass at one o the clock For a moment she just sat astride Pylon looking at it Had she and Roland been here hardly twentyfour hours ago Making love and making plans It was hard to believe but when she dismounted and went in the wicker basket in which she had brought them a cold meal confirmed it It still sat upon the rickety table Looking at the hamper she realized she hadnt eaten since the previous evening  a miserable supper with Hart Thorin that shed only picked at too aware of his eyes on her body Well theyd done their last crawl hadnt they And shed never have to walk down another Seafront hallway wondering what door he was going to come bursting out of like Jack out of his box all grabbing hands and stiff randy prick Ashes she thought Ashes and ashes But not us Roland I swear my darling not us She was frightened and tense trying to put everything she now must do in order  a process to be followed just as there was a process to be followed when saddling a horse  but she was also sixteen and healthy One look at the hamper and she was ravenous She opened it saw there were ants on the two remaining cold beef sandwiches brushed them off and gobbled the sandwiches down The bread had gotten rather stiff but she hardly noticed There was a half jar of sweet cider and part of a cake as well When she had finished everything she went to the north comer of the hut and moved the hides someone had begun to cure and then lost interest in There was a hollow beneath Within it wrapped in soft leather were Rolands guns If things go badly thee must come here and take them west to Gilead Find my father With faint but genuine curiosity Susan wondered if Roland had really expected she would ride blithely off to Gilead with his unborn child in her belly while he and his friends were roasted screaming and redhanded on the ReapNight bonfire She pulled one of the guns out of its holster It took her a moment or two to sec how to get the revolver open hut then the cylinder rolled out and she saw that each chamber was loaded She snapped it back into place and checked the other one She concealed them in the blanketroll behind her saddle just as Roland had then mounted up and headed east again But not toward town Not yet She had one more stop to make first  At around two o the clock word that Fran Lengyll would be speaking at the Town Gathering Hall began to sweep through the town of Mejis No one could have said where this news it was too firm and specific to be a rumor began and no one much cared they simply passed it on By three o the clock the Gathering Hall was full and two hundred or more stood outside listening as Lengylls brief address was relayed back to them in whispers Coral Thorin who had begun passing the news of Lengylls impending appearance at the Travellers Rest was not there She knew what Lengyll was going to say had in fact supported Jonass argument that it should be as simple and direct as possible There was no need for rabblerousing the townsfolk would be a mob by sundown of Reaping Day a mob always picked its own leaders and it always picked the right ones Lengyll spoke with his hat held in one hand and a silver reapcharm hanging from the front of his vest He was brief he was rough and he was convincing Most folks in the crowd had known him all their lives and didnt doubt a word he said Hart Thorin and Kimba Rimer had been murdered by Dearborn Heath and Stockworth Lengyll told the crowd of men in denim and women in faded gingham The crime had come home to them because of a certain item  a birds skull  left in Mayor Thorins lap Murmurs greeted this Many of Lengylls listeners had seen the skull either mounted on the horn of Cuthberts saddle or worn jauntily around his neck They had laughed at his prankishness Now they thought of how he had laughed back at them and realized he must have been laughing at a different joke all along Their faces darkened The weapon used to slit the Chancellors throat Lengyll continued had belonged to Dearborn The three young men had been taken that morning as they prepared to flee Mejis Their motivations were not entirely clear but they were likely after horses If so they would be for John Farson who was known to pay well for good nags and in cash They were in other words traitors to their own lands and to the cause of the Affiliation Lengyll had planted Brian Hockeys son Rufus three rows back Now exactly on time Rufus Hookey shouted out Has they confessed Aye Lengyll said Confessed both murders and spoke it most proud so they did A louder murmur at this almost a rumble It ran backward like a wave to the outside where it went from mouth to mouth most proud most proud they had murdered in the dark of night and spoke it most proud Mouths were tucked down Fists clenched Dearborn said that Jonas and his friends had caught on to what they were doing and took the word to Rimer They killed Chancellor Rimer to shut him up while they finished their chores and Thorin in case Rimer had passed word on This made little sense Latigo had argued Jonas had smiled and nodded No he had said not a mite of sense but it doesnt matter Lengyll was prepared to answer questions but none were asked There was only the murmur the dark looks the muted click and clink of reapcharms as people shifted on their feet The boys were in jail Lengyll made no statement concerning what would happen to them next and once again he was not asked He said that some of the activities scheduled for the next day  the games the rides the turkeyrun the pumpkincarving contest the pigscramble the riddling competition and the dance  had been cancelled out of respect for the tragedy The things that really mattered would go on of course as they always had and must the cattle and livestock judging the horsepull the sheepshearing the stockline meetings and the auctions horse pig cow sheep And the bonfire at moonrise The bonfire and the burning of the guys Charyou tree was the end of Reaping FairDay and had been since time out of mind Nothing would stop it save the end of the world The bonfire will bum and the stuffyguys will bum on it Eldred Jonas had told Lengyll Thats all youre to say Its all you need to say And hed been right Lengyll saw It was on every face Not just the determination to do right but a kind of dirty eagerness There were old ways old rites of which the redhanded stuffyguys were one surviving remnant There were los ceremoniosos Charyou tree It had been generations since they had been practiced except every once and again in secret places out in the hills but sometimes when the world moved on it came back to where it had been Keep it brief Jonas had said and it had been fine advice fine advice indeed He wasnt a man Lengyll would have wanted around in more peaceful times but a useful one in times such as these Gods give you peace he said now stepping back and folding his arms with his hands on his shoulders to show he had finished Gods give us all peace Long days and peaceful nights they returned in a low automatic chorus And then they simply turned and left to go wherever folks went on the afternoon before Reaping For a good many of them Lengyll knew it would be the Travellers Rest or the Bayview Hotel He raised a hand and mopped his brow He hated to be out in front of people and never so much as today but he thought it had gone well Very well indeed  The crowd streamed away without speaking Most as Lengyll had foreseen headed for the saloons Their way took them past the jail but few looked at it and those few who did did so in tiny furtive glances The porch was empty save for a plump redhanded stuffy sprawled in Sheriff Averys rocker and the door stood ajar as it usually did on warm and sunny afternoons The boys were inside no doubt about that but there was no sign that they were being guarded with any particular zeal If the men passing on their way downhill to the Rest and the Bayview had banded together into one group they could have taken Roland and his friends with no trouble whatsoever Instead they went by with their heads down walking stolidly and with no conversation to where the drinks were waiting Today was not the day Nor tonight Tomorrow however   Not too far from the Bar K Susan saw something on the Baronys long slope of grazingland that made her rein up and simply sit in the saddle with her mouth open Below her and much farther east of her position at least three miles away a band of a dozen cowboys had rounded up the biggest herd of Droprunners she had ever seen perhaps four hundred head in all They ran lazily going where the vaqs pointed them with no trouble Probably think theyre going in for the winter Susan thought But they werent headed in toward the ranches running along the crest of the Drop the herd so large it flowed on the grass like a cloudshadow was headed west toward Hanging Rock Susan had believed everything Roland said but this made it true in a personal way one she could relate directly to her dead father Horses of courses You bastards she murmured You horsethieving bastards She turned Pylon and rode for the burnedout ranch To her right her shadow was growing long Overhead the Demon Moon glimmered ghostly in the daylight sky  She had worried that Jonas might have left men at the Bar K  although why he wouldve she didnt really know and the fear turned out to be groundless in any case The ranch was as empty as it had been for the five or six years between the fire that had put paid to it and the arrival of the boys from InWorld She could see signs of that mornings confrontation however and when she went into the bunkhouse where the three of them had slept she at once saw the gaping hole in the floorboards Jonas had neglected to close it up again after taking Alains and Cuthberts guns She went down the aisle between the bunks dropped to one knee and looked into the hole Nothing Yet she doubted if what she had come for had been there in the first place  the hole wasnt big enough She paused looking at the three cots Which was Rolands She supposed she could find out  her nose would tell her she knew the smell of his hair and skin very well  but she thought she would do better to put such soft impulses behind her What she needed now was to be hard and quick  to move without pausing or looking back Ashes Aunt Cord whispered in her head almost too faintly to hear Susan shook her head impatiently as if to clear that voice away and walked out back There was nothing behind the bunkhouse nothing behind the privy or to either side of it She went around to the back of the old cookshack next and there she found what shed come looking for placed casually and with no attempt at concealment the two small barrels she had last seen slung over Caprichosos back The thought of the mule summoned the thought of Sheemie looking down at her from his mans height and with his hopeful boys face Id like to take a fin de ano kiss from ye so I would Sheemie whose life had been saved by Mr Arthur Heath Sheemie who had risked the wrath of the witch by giving Cuthbert the note meant for her aunt Sheemie who had brought these barrels up here They had been smeared with soot to partially camouflage them and Susan got some on her hands and the sleeves of her shirt as she took off the tops  more ashes But the firecrackers were still inside the round fistsized bigbangers and the smaller ladyfingers She took plenty of both stuffing her pockets until they bulged and carrying more in her arms She stowed them in her saddlebags then looked up at the sky Threethirty She wanted to get back to Hambry no earlier than twilight and that meant at least an hour to wait There was a little time to be soft after all Susan went back into the bunkhouse and found the bed which had been Rolands easily enough She knelt beside it like a child saying bedtime prayers put her face against his pillow and inhaled deeply Roland she said her voice muffled How I love thee How I love thee dear She lay on his bed and looked toward the window watching the light drain away Once she raised her hands in front of her eyes examining the barrelsoot on her fingers She thought of going to the pump in front of the cookhouse and washing but decided not to Let it stay They were katet one from many  strong in purpose and strong in love Let the ashes stay and do their worst  My Susie haser faults but shes alwayson time Pat Delgado used to say Fearful punctual that girl It was true on the night before Reap She skirted her own house and rode up to the Travellersrest not ten minutes after the sun had finally gone behind the hills filling the High Street with thick mauve shadows The street was eerily deserted considering it was the night before Reap the band which had played in Green Heart every night for the last week was silent there were periodic rattles of firecrackers but no yelling laughing children only a few of the many colored lamps had been lit Stuffyguys seemed to peer from every shadowthickened porch Susan shivered at the sight of their blank whitecross eyes Doings at the Rest were similarly odd The hitchingrails were crowded even more horses had been tied at the rails of the mercantile across the street and light shone from every window  so many windows and so many lights that the inn looked like a vast ship on a darkened sea  but there was none of the usual riot and jubilation all set to the jagtime tunes pouring out of Shebs piano She found she could imagine the customers inside all too well  a hundred men maybe more  simply standing around and drinking Not talking not laughing not chucking the dice down Satans Alley and cheering or groaning at the result No bottoms stroked or pinched no Reapkisses stolen no arguments started out of loose mouths and finished with hard fists Just men drinking not three hundred yards from where her love and his friends were locked up The men who were here wouldnt do anything tonight but drink though And if she was lucky    brave and lucky As she drew Pylon up in front of the saloon with a murmured word a shape rose out of the shadows She tensed and then the first orangey light of the rising moon caught Sheemies face She relaxed again  even laughed a little mostly at herself He was a part of their katet she knew he was Was it surprising that he should know as well Susan he murmured taking off his sombrero and holding it against his chest I been waiting foree Why she asked  Cause I knew yed come He looked back over his shoulder at the Rest a black bulk spraying crazy light toward every point of the compass Were going to let Arthur and them free aint we I hope so she said We have to The folks in there they dont talk but they dont have to talk I knows Susan daughter of Pat I knows She supposed he did Is Coral inside Sheemie shook his head Gone up to Mayors House She told Stanley she was going to help lay out the bodies for the funeral day after tomorrow but I dont think shell be here for the funeral I think the Big Coffin Hunters is going and shell go with em He raised a hand and swiped at his leaking eyes Your mule Sheemie   All saddled and I got the long halter She looked at him openmouthed How did ye know   Same way I knew yed be coming Susansai I just knew He shrugged then pointed vaguely Capis around the back I tied him to the cooks pump Thats good She fumbled in the saddlebag where she had put the smaller firecrackers Here Take some of these Doee have a sulfur or two Aye He asked no questions simply stuffed the firecrackers into his front pocket She however who had never been through the batwing doors of the Travellers Rest in her whole life had another question for him What do they do with their coats and hats and scrapes when they come in Sheemie They must take em off drinkings warm work Oh aye They puts em on a long table just inside the door Some fights about whose is whose when theyre ready to go home She nodded thinking hard and fast He stood before her still holding his sombrero against his chest letting her do what he could not  at least not in the conventionally understood way At last she raised her head again Sheemie if you help me youre done in Hambry  done in Mejis   done in the Outer Arc You go with us if we get away You have to understand that Do you She saw he did his face fairly shone with the idea Aye Susan Go with you and Will Dearborn and Richard Stockworth and my best friend Mr Arthur Heath Go to InWorld Well see buildings and statues and women in gowns like fairy princesses and   If were caught well be killed He stopped smiling but his eyes didnt waver Aye killed well be if taen most like Will you still help me Capis all saddled he repeated Susan reckoned that was answer enough She took hold of the hand pressing the sombrero to Sheemies chest the hats crown was pretty well crushed and not for the first time She bent holding Sheemies fingers with one hand and the horn of her saddle with the other and kissed his cheek He smiled up at her Well do our best wont we she asked him Aye Susan daughter of Pat Well do our best for our friends Our very best Yes Now listen Sheemie Very carefully She began to talk and Sheemie listened  Twenty minutes later as the bloated orange moon struggled above the buildings of the town like a pregnant woman climbing a steep hill a lone vaquero led a mule along Hill Street in the direction of the Sheriffs office This end of Hill Street was a pit of shadows There was a little light around Green Heart but even the park which would have been thronged noisy and brilliantly lit in any other year was mostly empty Nearly all the booths were closed and of those few that remained open only the fortuneteller was doing any business Tonight all fortunes were bad but still they came  dont they always The vaquero was wearing a heavy serape if this particular cowboy had the breasts of a woman they were concealed The vaq wore a large sweatstained sombrero if this cowboy had the face of a woman it was likewise concealed Low from beneath that hats broad brim came a voice singing Careless Love The mules small saddle was buried under the large bundle which had been roped to it  cloth or clothes of some kind it might have been although the deepening shadows made it impossible to say for sure Most amusing of all was what hung around the mules neck like some peculiar reapcharm two sombreros and a drovers hat strung on a length of rope As the vaq neared the Sheriffs office the singing ceased The place might have been deserted if not for the single dim light shining through one window In the porch rocker was a comical stuffyguy wearing one of Herk Averys embroidered vests and a tin star There were no guards absolutely no sign that the threemost hated men in mejis were sequestered within and now very faintly thevaquero could hear the strum of a guitar It was blotted out by a thin rattle of firecrackers The vaq looked over one shoulder and saw a dim figure It waved The vaquero nodded waved back then tied the mule to the hitchingpost  the same one where Roland and his friends had tied their horses when they had come to introduce themselves to the Sheriff on a summer day so long ago  The door opened  no one had bothered to lock it  while Dave Hollis was trying for about the two hundredth time to play the bridge of Captain Mills You Bastard Across from him Sheriff Avery sat rocked back in his desk chair with his hands laced together on his paunch The room flickered with mild orange lamplight You keep it up Deputy Dave and there wont have to be any execution Cuthbert Allgood said He was standing at the door of one of the cells with his hands wrapped around the bars Well kill ourselves In selfdefense Shut up maggot Sheriff Avery said He was halfdozing in the wake of a fourchop dinner thinking of how he would tell his brother and his brothers wife who was killing pretty in the next Barony about this heroic day He would be modest but he would still get it across to them that hed played a central role that if not for him these three young ladrones might have  Just dont sing Cuthbert said to Dave Ill confess to the murder of Arthur Eld himself if you just dont sing To Berts left Alain was sitting crosslegged on his bunk Roland was lying on his with his hands behind his head looking up at the ceiling But at the moment the doors latch clicked he swung to a sitting position As if hed only been waiting Thatll be Bridger Deputy Dave said gladly putting his guitar aside He hated this duty and couldnt wait to be relieved Heaths jokes were the worst That he could continue to joke in the face of what was going to happen to them tomorrow I think its likely one of them Sheriff Avery said meaning the Big Coffin Hunters In fact it was neither It was a cowboy all but buried in a serape that looked much too big for him the ends actually dragged on the boards as he clumped in and shut the door behind him and wearing a hat that came way down over his eyes To Herk Avery the fellow looked like somebodys idea of a cowboy stuffy Say stranger he said beginning to smile  for this was surely someones joke and Herk Avery could take a joke as well as any man Especially after four chops and a mountain of mashed Howdy What business do ye   The hand which hadnt closed the door had been under the scrape When it came out it was clumsily holding a gun all three of the prisoners recognized at once Avery stared at it his smile slowly fading His hands unlaced themselves His feet which had been propped up on his desk came down to the floor Whoa partner he said slowly Lets talk about it Get the keys off the wall and unlock the cells the vaq said in a hoarse artificially deep voice Outside unnoticed by all save Roland more firecrackers rattled in a dry popping string I cant hardly do that Avery said easing open the bottom drawer of his desk with his foot There were several guns left over from that morning inside Now I dont know if that things loaded but I dont hardly think a traildog like you   The newcomer pointed the gun at the desk and pulled the trigger The report was deafening in the little room but Roland thought  hoped  that with the door shut it would sound like just another firecracker Bigger than some smaller than others Good girl he thought Oh good girl  but be careful For gods sake Sue be careful All three of them standing in a line at the cell doors now eyes wide and mouths tight The bullet struck the comer of the Sheriffs rolltop and tore off a huge splinter Avery screamed tilted back in his chair again and went sprawling His foot remained hooked under the drawerpull the drawer shot out and overturned spilling three ancient firearms across the board floor Susan look out Cuthbert shouted and then No Dave At the end of his life it was duty and not fear of the Big Coffin Hunters which propelled Dave Hollis who had hoped to be Sheriff of Mejis himself when Avery retired and he sometimes told his wife Judy a better one than Fatso had ever dreamed of being He forgot that he had serious questions about the way the boys had been taken as well as about what they might or might not have done All he thought of then was that they were prisoners o the Baronyand such would not be taken if he could help it He lunged for the cowboy in the toobig clothes meaning to tear the gun out of his hands And shoot him with it if necessary  Susan was staring at the yellow blaze of fresh wood on the comer of the Sheriffs desk forgetting everything in her amazement  so much damage inflicted by the single twitch of a finger  when Cuthberts desperate shout awakened her to her position She shrank back against the wall avoiding Daves first swipe at the oversized serape and without thinking pulled the trigger again There was another loud explosion and Dave Hollis  a young man only two years older than she herself  was flung backward with a smoking hole in his shirt between two points of the star he wore His eyes were wide and unbelieving His monocle lay by one outstretched hand on its length of black silk ribbon One of his feet struck his guitar and knocked it to the floor with a thrum nearly as musical as the chords he had been trying to make Dave she whispered Oh Dave Im sorry what did I do Dave tried once to get up then collapsed forward on his face The hole going into the front of him was small but the one she was looking at now the one coming out the back was huge and hideous all black and red and charred edges of cloth  as if she had run him through with a blazing hot poker instead of shooting him with a gun which was supposed to be merciful and civilized and was clearly neither one Dave she whispered Dave I Susan look out Roland shouted It was Avery He scuttled forward on his hands and knees seized her around the calves and yanked her feet out from under her She came down on her bottom with a toothrattling crash and was face to face with him  his frogeyed largepored face his garlicsmelling hole of a mouth Gods yere a girl he whispered and reached for her She pulled the trigger of Rolands gun again setting the front of her serape on fire and blowing a hole in the ceiling Plaster dust drifted down Averys ham sized hands settled around her throat cutting off her wind Somewhere far away Roland shrieked her name She had one more chance Maybe Ones enough Sue her father spoke inside of her head Ones all ye need my dear She cocked Rolands pistol with the side of her thumb socked the muzzle deep into the flab hanging from the underside of Sheriff Herk Averys head and pulled the trigger The mess was considerable  Averys head dropped into her lap as heavy and wet as a raw roast Above it she could feel growing heat At the bottom edge of her vision was the yellow flicker of fire On the desk Roland shouted yanking the door of his cell so hard it rattled in its frame Susan the waterpitcher For your fathers sake She rolled Averys head out of her lap got to her feet and staggered to the desk with the front of the serape burning She could smell its charred stench and was grateful in some far comer of her mind that shed had time while waiting for dusk to tie her hair behind her The pitcher was almost full but not with water she could smell the sweetsour tang of graf She doused herself with it and there was a brisk hissing as the liquid hit the flames She stripped the serape off the oversized sombrero came with it and threw it on the floor She looked at Dave again a boy she had grown up with one she might even have kissed behind the door of Hockeys once upon an antique time Susan It was Rolands voice harsh and urgent The keys Hurry Susan grabbed the keyring from the nail on the wall She went to Rolands cell first and thrust the ring blindly through the bars The air was thick with smells of gunsmoke burned wool blood Her stomach clenched helplessly at every breath Roland picked the right key reached back through the bars with it and plunged it into the lockbox A moment later he was out and hugging her roughly as her tears broke A moment after that Cuthbert and Alain were out as well Youre an angel Alain said hugging her himself Not I she said and began to cry harder She thrust the gun at Roland It felt filthy in her hand she never wanted to touch one again Him and me played together when we were berries He was one of the good ones  never a braidpuller or a bully  and he grew up a good one Now Ive ended him and wholl tell his wife Roland took her back into his arms and held her there for a moment You did what you had to If not him then us Does thee not know it She nodded against his chest Avery him I dont mind so much but Dave    Come on Roland said Someone might recognize the gunshots for what they were Was it Sheemie throwing firecrackers She nodded Ive got clothes for you Hats and scrapes Susan hurried back to the door opened it peeked out in either direction then slipped into the growing dark Cuthbert took the charred serape and put it over Deputy Daves face Tough luck partner he said You got caught in between didnt you I reckon you wasnt so bad Susan came back in burdened with the stolen gear which had been tied to Capis saddle Sheemie was already off on his next errand without having to be told If the innboy was a halfwit shed known a lot of folks in her time who were running on quarters and eighths Whered you get this stuff Alain asked The Travellers Rest And I didnt Sheemie did She held the hats out Come on hurry Cuthbert took the headgear and passed it out Roland and Alain had already slipped into the scrapes with the hats added and pulled well down over their faces they could have been any Drop  vaqs in Barony Where are we going Alain asked as they stepped out onto the porch The street was still dark and deserted at this end the gunshots had attracted no attention Hockeys to start with Susan said Thats where your horses are They went down the street together in a little group of four Capi was gone Sheemie had taken the mule along Susans heart was thudding rapidly and she could feel sweat standing out on her brow but she still felt cold Whether or no what she had done was murder she had ended two lives this evening and crossed a line that could never be recrossed in the other direction She had done it for Roland for her love and simply knowing she could have done no different now offered some consolation Be happy together ye faithless ye cozeners ye murderers I curse thee with the ashes Susan seized Rolands hand and when he squeezed she squeezed back And as she looked up at Demon Moon its wicked face now draining from choleric redorange to silver she thought that when she had pulled the trigger on poor earnest Dave Hollis she had paid for her love with the dearest currency of all  had paid with her soul If he left her now her aunts curse would be fulfilled for only ashes would remain As they stepped into the stable which was lit by one dim gas lamp a shadow moved out of one of the stalls Roland who had belted on both guns now drew them Sheemie looked at him with an uncertain smile holding a stirrup in one hand Then the smile broadened his eyes flashed with happiness and he ran toward them Roland bolstered his guns and made ready to embrace the boy but Sheemie ran past him and threw himself into Cuthberts arms Whoa whoa Cuthbert said first staggering back comically and then lifting Sheemie off his feet You like to knock me over boy She got ye out Sheemie cried Knew she would so I did Good old Susan Sheemie looked around at Susan who stood beside Roland She was still pale but now seemed composed Sheemie turned back to Cuthbert and planted a kiss directly in the center of Berts forehead Whoa Bert said again Whats that for  Cause I love you good old Arthur Heath You saved my life Well maybe I did Cuthbert said laughing in an embarrassed way his borrowed sombrero too large to begin with now sat comically askew on his head but if we dont get a move on I wont have saved it for long Horses are all saddled Sheemie said Susan told me to do it and I did I did it just right I just have to put this stirrup on Mr Richard Stockworths horse because the one on theres bout worn through Thats a job for later Alain said taking the stirrup He put it aside then turned to Roland Where do we go Rolands first thought was that they should return to the Thorin mausoleum Sheemie reacted with instant horror The boneyard And with Demon Moon at the full He shook his head so violently that his sombrero came off and his hair flew from side to side Theyre dead in there sai Dearborn but if ye tease em during the time of the Demon theys apt to get up and walk Its no good anyway Susan said The women of the townll be lining the way from Seafront with flowers and filling the mausoleum too Olive will be in charge if shes able but my aunt and Coral are apt to be in the company Those arent ladies we want to meet All right Roland said Lets mount up and ride Think about it Susan You too Sheemie We want a place where we can hide up until dawn at least and it should be a place we can get to in less than an hour Off the Great Road and in any direction from Hambry but northwest Why not northwest Alain asked Because thats where were going now Weve got a job to do  and were going to let them know were doing it Eldred Jonas most of all He offered a thin blade of smile I want him to know the game is over No more Castles The real gunslingers are here Lets see if he can deal with them  An hour later with the moon well above the trees Rolands katet arrived at the Citgo oilpatch They rode out parallel to the Great Road for safetys sake but as it happened the caution was wasted they saw not one rider on the road going in either direction Its as if Reapings been cancelled this year Susan thought   then she thought of the redhanded stuffies and shivered They would have painted Rolands hands red tomorrow night and still would if they were caught Not just him either All of us Sheemie too They left the horses and Caprichoso who had trotted illtemperedly but nimbly behind them on a tether tied to some longdead pumping equipment in the southeastern comer of the patch and then walked slowly toward the working derricks which were clustered in the same area They spoke in whispers when they spoke at all Roland doubted if that was necessary but whispers here seemed natural enough To Roland Citgo was far spookier than the graveyard and while he doubted that the dead in that latter place awoke even when Old Demon was full there were some very unquiet corpses here squalling zombies that stood rustyweird in the moonlight with their pistons going up and down like marching feet Roland led them into the active part of the patch nevertheless past a sign which read hows your hardhat and another reading we produce oil we refine safety They stopped at the foot of a derrick grinding so loudly that Roland had to shout in order to be heard Sheemie Give me a couple of those bigbangers Sheemie had taken a pocketful from Susans saddlebag and now handed a pair of them over Roland took Bert by the arm and pulled him forward There was a square of rusty fencing around the derrick and when the boys tried to climb it the horizontals snapped like old bones They looked at each other in the running shadows combined of machinery and moonlight nervous and amused Susan twitched Rolands arm Be careful she shouted over the rhythmic whumpawhumpawhumpa of the derrick machinery She didnt look frightened he saw only excited and alert He grinned pulled her forward and kissed the lobe of her ear Be ready to run he whispered If we do this right theres going to be a new candle here at Citgo A hellacious big one He and Cuthbert ducked under the lowest strut of the rusty derrick tower and stood next to the equipment wincing at the cacophony Roland wondered that it hadnt torn itself apart years ago Most of the works were housed in rusty metal blocks but he could see a gigantic turning shaft of some kind gleaming with oil that must be supplied by automated jets Up this close there was a gassy smell that reminded him of the jet that flared rhythmically on the other side of the oilpatch Giantfarts Cuthbert shouted What I said it smells like    aw never mind Lets do it ifwe can  can we  Roland didnt know He walked toward the machinery crying out beneath metal cowls which were painted a faded rusting green Bert followed with some reluctance The two of them slid into a short aisle smelly and baking hot that took them almost directly beneath the derrick Ahead of them the shaft at the end of the piston turned steadily shedding oily teardrops down its smooth sides Beside it was a curved pipe  almost surely an overflow pipe Roland thought An occasional drop of crude oil fell from its lip and there was a black puddle on the ground beneath He pointed at it and Cuthbert nodded Shouting would do no good in here the world was a roaring squealing din Roland curled one hand around his friends neck and pulled Cuthberts ear to his lips he held a bigbang up in front of Berts eyes with the other Light it and run he said Ill hold it give you as much time as I can Thats for my benefit as much as for yours I want a clear path back through that machinery do you understand Cuthbert nodded against Rolands lips then turned the gunslingers head so he could speak in the same fashion What if theres enough gas here to bum the air when I make a spark Roland stepped back Raised his palms in a HowdoIknow gesture Cuthbert laughed and drew out a box of sulfur matches which he had scooped off Averys desk before leaving He asked with his eyebrows if Roland was ready Roland nodded The wind was blowing hard but under the derrick the surrounding machinery cut it off and the flame from the sulfur rose straight Roland held out the bigbanger and had a momentary painful memory of his mother how she had hated these things how she had always been sure that he would lose an eye or a finger to one Cuthbert tapped his chest above his heart and kissed his palm in the universal gesture of good luck Then he touched the flame to the fuse It began to sputter Bert turned pretended to bang off a covered block of machinery  that was Bert Roland thought he would joke on the gallows  and then dashed back down the short corridor theyd used to get here Roland held the round firework as long as he dared then lobbed it into the overflow pipe He winced as he turned away halfexpecting what Bert was afraid of that the very air would explode It didnt He ran down the short aisle came into the clear and saw Cuthbert standing just outside the broken bit of fencing Roland flapped both hands at him  Go you idiot go  and then the world blew up behind him The sound was a deep belching thud that seemed to shove his eardrums inward and suck the breath out of his throat The ground rolled under his feet like a wave under a boat and a large warm hand planted itself in the center of his back and shoved him forward He thought he ran with it for a step  maybe even two or three steps  and then he was lifted off his feet and hurled atthe fence where cuthbert was no longer standing Cuthbert was sprawled on his back staring up at something behind Roland The boys eyes were wide and wondering his mouth hung open Roland could see all this very well because Citgo was now as bright as in full daylight They had lit their own Reaping bonfire it seemed a night early and much brighter than the one in town could ever hope to be He went skidding on his knees to where Cuthbert lay and grabbed him under one arm From behind them came a vast ripping roar and now chunks of metal began to fall around them They got up and ran toward where Alain stood in front of Susan and Sheemie trying to protect them Roland took a quick look back over his shoulder and saw that the remains of the derrick  about half of it still stood  were glowing blackish red like a heated horseshoe around a flaring yellow torch that ran perhaps a hundred and fifty feet into the sky It was a start He didnt know how many other derricks they could fire before folk began arriving from town but he was determined to do as many as possible no matter what the risks might be Blowing up the tankers at Hanging Rock was only half the job Farsons source had to be wiped out Further firecrackers dropped down further overflow pipes turned out not to be necessary There was a network of interconnected pipes under the oilpatch most filled with natural gas that had leaked in through ancient decaying seals Roland and Cuthbert had no more than reached the others when there was a fresh explosion and a fresh tower of flame erupted from a derrick to the right of the one they had set afire A moment later a third derrick  this one sixty full yards away from the first two  exploded with a dragons roar The ironwork tore free of its anchoring concrete pillars like a tooth pulled from a decayed gum It rose on a cushion of blazing blue and yellow attained a height of perhaps seventy feet then heeled over and came crashing back down spewing sparks in every direction Another Another And yet another The five young people stood in their comer stunned holding their hands up to shield their eyes from the glare Now the oilpatch flared like a birthday cake and the heat baking toward them was enormous Gods be kind Alain whispered If they lingered here much longer Roland realized they would be popped like corn There were the horses to consider too they were well away from the main focus of the explosions but there was no guarantee that the focus would stay where it was already he saw two derricks that hadnt even been working engulfed in flames The horses would be terrified Hell he was terrified Come on he shouted They ran for the horses through shifting yelloworange brilliance  At first Jonas thought it was going on in his own head  that the explosions were part of their lovemaking Lovemaking yar Lovemaking horseshit He and Coral made love no more than donkeys did sums But it was something Oh yes indeed it was Hed been with passionate women before ones who took you into a kind of ovenplace and then held you there staring with greedy intensity as they pumped their hips but until Coral hed never been with a woman that sparked such a powerfully harmonic chord in himself With sex he had always been the kind of man who took it when it came and forgot it when it didnt But with Coral he only wanted to take it take it and take it some more When they were together they made love like cats or ferrets twisting and hissing and clawing they bit at each other and cursed at each other and so far none of it was even close to enough When he was with her Jonas sometimes felt as if he were being fried in sweet oil Tonight there had been a meeting with the Horsemens Association which had pretty much become the Farson Association in these latter days Jonas had brought them up to date had answered their idiotic questions and had made sure they understood what theyd be doing the next day With that done he had checked on Rhea who had been installed in Kimba Rimers old suite She hadnt even noticed Jonas peering in at her She sat in Rimers highceilinged booklined study  behind Rimers ironwood desk in Rimers upholstered chair looking as out of place as a whores bloomers on a church altar On Rimers desk was the Wizards Rainbow She was passing her hands back and forth above it and muttering rapidly under her breath but the ball remained dark Jonas had locked her in and had gone to Coral She had been waiting for him in the parlor where tomorrows Conversational would have been held There were plenty of bedrooms in that wing but it was to her dead brothers that she had led him  and not by accident either Jonas was sure There they made love in the canopied bed Hart Thorin would never share with his gilly It was fierce as it had always been and Jonas was approaching his orgasm when the first oil derrick blew Christ shes something he thought Theres never in the whole damned world been a woman like  Then two more explosions in rapid succession and Coral froze for a moment beneath him before beginning to thrust her hips again Citgo she said in a hoarse panting voice Yar he growled and began to thrust with her He had lost all interest in making love but they had reached the point where it was impossible to stop even under threat of death or dismemberment Two minutes later he was striding naked toward Thorins little lick of a balcony his halferect penis wagging from side to side ahead of him like some halfwits idea of a magic wand Coral was a step behind him as naked as he was Why now she burst out as Jonas thrust open the balcony door I could have come three more times Jonas ignored her The countryside looking northwest was a moongilded darkness    except where the oilpatch was There he saw a fierce yellow core of light It was spreading and brightening even as he watched one thudding explosion after another hammered across the intervening miles He felt a curious darkening in his mind  that feeling had been there ever since the brat Dearborn by the some febrile leap of intuition had recognized him for who and what he was Making love to the energetic Coral melted that feeling a little but now looking at the burning tangle of fire which had five minutes ago been the Good Mans oil reserves it came back with debilitating intensity like a swampfever that sometimes quits the flesh but hides in the bones and never really leaves You re in the west Dearborn had said The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west Of course it was true and he hadnt needed any such titmonkey as Will Dearborn to tell him  but now that it had been said there was a part of his mind that couldnt stop thinking about it Fucking Will Dearborn Where exactly was he now him and his pair of goodmannered mates In Averys culabozo Jonas didnt think so Not anymore Fresh explosions ripped the night Down below men who had run and shouted in the wake of the early mornings assassinations were running and shouting again Its the biggest Reaping firework that ever was Coral said in a low voice Before Jonas could reply there was a hard hammering on the bedroom door It was thrown open a second later and Clay Reynolds came clumping across the room wearing a pair of blue jeans and nothing else His hair was wild his eyes were wilder Bad news from town Eldred he said Dearborn and the other two InWorld brats Three more explosions falling almost on top of each other From the blazing Citgo oilpatch a great redorange fireball rose lazily into the black of night faded disappeared Reynolds walked out onto the balcony and stood between them at the railing unmindful of their nakedness He stared at the fireball with wide wondering eyes until it was gone As gone as the brats Jonas felt that curious debilitating gloom trying to steal over him again How did they get away he asked Do you know Does Avery Averys dead The deputy who was with him too Twas another deputy found em Todd Bridger    Eldred whats going on out there What happened Oh thats your boys Coral said Didnt take em long to start their own Reaping party did it How much heart do they have Jonas asked himself It was a good question  maybe the only one that mattered Were they now done making trouble  or just getting started He once more wanted to be out of here  out of Seafront out of Hambry out of Mejis Suddenly more than anything he wanted to be miles and wheels and leagues away He had bounded around his Hillock it was too late to go back and now he felt horribly exposed Clay Yeseldred But the mans eyes  and his mind  were still on the conflagration at Citgo Jonas took his shoulder and turned Reynolds toward him Jonas felt his own mind starting to pick up speed ticking past points and details and welcomed the feeling That queer dark sense of fatalism faded and disappeared How many men are here he asked Reynolds frowned thought about it Thirtyfivehe said maybe How many armed With guns No with peablowers you damned fool Probably    Reynolds pulled his lower lip frowning more fiercely than ever Probably a dozen Thats guns likely to work you ken The big boys from the Horsemens Association Still all here I think so Get Lengyll and Renfrew At least you wont have to wake em up theyll all be up and most of em right down there Jonas jerked a thumb at the courtyard Tell Renfrew to put together an advance party Armed men Id like eight or ten but Ill take five Have that old womans cart harnessed to the strongest hardiest pony this place has got Tell that old fuck Miguel that if the pony he chooses dies in the traces between here and Hanging Rock hell be using his wrinkled old balls for earplugs Coral Thorin barked brief harsh laughter Reynolds glanced at her did a doubletake at her breasts then looked back at Jonas with an effort Wheres Roy Jonas asked Reynolds looked up Third floor With some little serving maid Kick him out Jonas said Its his job to get the old bitch ready to ride Were going Soon as we can You and me first with Renfrews boys and Lengyll behind with the rest of the men You just make sure Hash Renfrews with us Clay that mans got sand in his craw What about the horses out on the Drop Never mind the everfucking horses There was another explosion at Citgo another fireball floated into the sky Jonas couldnt see the dark clouds of smoke which must be rushing up or smell the oil the wind out of the east and into the west would be carrying both away from town But   Just do as I say Jonas now saw his priorities in clear ascending order The horses were on the bottom  Farson could find horses damned near anywhere Above them were the tankers gathered at Hanging Rock They were more important than ever now because the source was gone Lose the tankers and the Big Coffin Hunters could forget going home Yet most important of all was Parsons little piece of the Wizards Rainbow It was the one truly irreplaceable item If it was broken let it be broken in the care of George Latigo not that of Eldred Jonas Get moving he told Reynolds Depape rides after with Lengylls men You with me Go on Make it happen And me Coral asked He reached out and tugged her toward him I aint forgot you darlin he said Coral nodded and reached between his legs oblivious of the staring Clay Reynolds Aye she said And I aint forgot you  They escaped Citgo with ringing ears and slightly singed around the edges but not really hurt Sheemie riding double behind Cuthbert and Caprichoso clattering after at the end of his long lead It was Susan who came up with the place they should go and like most solutions it seemed completely obvious    once someone had thought of it And so not long after Reaping Eve had become Reaping Mom the five of them came to the hut in the Bad Grass where Susan and Roland had on several occasions met to make love Cuthbert and Alain unrolled blankets then sat on them to examine the guns they had liberated from the Sheriffs office They had also found Berts slingshot Thesere hard calibers Alain said holding one up with the cylinder sprung and peering oneeyed down the barrel If they dont throw too high or wide Roland I think we can do some business with them I wish we had that ranchers machinegun Cuthbert said wistfully You know what Cort would say about a gun like that Roland asked and Cuthbert burst out laughing So did Alain Whos Cort Susan asked The tough man Eldred Jonas only thinks he is Alain said He was our teacher Roland suggested that they catch an hour or two of sleep  the next day was apt to be difficult That it might also be their last was something he didnt feel he had to say Alain are you listening Alain who knew perfectly well that Roland wasnt speaking of his ears or his attentionspan nodded Do you hear anything Not yet Keep at it I will    but I cant promise anything The touch is flukey You know that as well as I do Just keep trying Sheemie had carefully spread two blankets in the comer next to his proclaimed best friend Hes Roland    and hes Alain    who are you good old Arthur Heath Who are you really Cuthberts my name He stuck out his hand Cuthbert Allgood How do ydo and how do ydo and how do ydo again Sheemie shook the offered hand then began giggling It was a cheerful unexpected sound and made them all smile Smiling hurt Roland a little and he guessed that if he could see his own face hed observe a pretty good bum from being so close to the exploding derricks Keyyouthbert Sheemie said giggling Oh my Keyyouthbert thats a funny name no wonder youre such a funny fellow Keyyouthbert ohahahaha thats a pip a real pip Cuthbert smiled and nodded Can I kill him now Roland if we dont need him any longer Save him a bit why dont you Roland said then turned to Susan his own smile fading Will thee walk out with me a bit Sue Id talk to thee She looked up at him trying to read his face All right She held out her hand Roland took it they walked into the moonlight together and beneath its light Susan felt dread take hold of her heart  They walked out in silence through sweetsmelling grass that tasted good to cows and horses even as it was expanding in their bellies first bloating and then killing them It was high  at least a foot taller than Rolands head  and still green as summer Children sometimes got lost in the Bad Grass and died there but Susan had never feared to be here with Roland even when there were no skymarkers to steer by his sense of direction was uncannily perfect Sue thee disobeyed me in the matter of the guns he said at last She looked at him smiling halfamused and halfangry Does thee wish to be back in thy cell then Thee and thy friends No of course not Such bravery He held her close and kissed her When he drew back they were both breathing hard He took her by the arms and looked into her eyes But thee mustnt disobey me this time She looked at him steadily saying nothing Thee knows he said Thee knows what Id tell thee Aye perhaps Say Better you than me maybe Im to stay at the hut while you and the others go Sheemie and I are to stay He nodded Will you Will thee She thought of how unfamiliar and wretched Rolands gun had felt in her hand as she held it beneath the serape of the wide unbelieving look in Daves eyes as the bullet shed fired into his chest flung him backward of how the first time shed tried to shoot Sheriff Avery the bullet had only succeeded in setting her own clothing afire although he had been right there in front of her They didnt have a gun for her unless she took one of Rolands she couldnt use one very well in any case  and more important she didnt want to use one Under those circumstances and with Sheemie to think about too it was best she just stay out of the way Roland was waiting patiently She nodded Sheemie and Ill wait for thee Its my promise He smiled relieved Now pay me back with honesty Roland If I can She looked up at the moon shuddered at the illomened face she saw and looked back at Roland What chance theell come back to me He thought about this very carefully still holding to her arms Far better than Jonas thinks he said at last Well wait at the edge of the Bad Grass and should be able to mark his coming well enough Aye the herd o horses I saw   He may come without the horses Roland said not knowing how well he had matched Jonass thinking but his folk will make noise even if they come without the herd If theres enough of them well see them as well  theyll cut a line through the grass like a part in hair Susan nodded She had seen this many times from the Drop  the mysterious parting of the Bad Grass as groups of men rode through it If theyre looking for thee Roland If Jonas sends scouts ahead I doubt hell bother Roland shrugged If they do whywell kill them Silent if we can Killings what we were trained to do well do it She turned her hands over and now she was gripping his arms instead of the other way around She looked impatient and afraid Thee hasnt answered my question What chance Ill see thee back He thought it over Even toss he said at last She closed her eyes as if struck drew in a breath let it out opened her eyes again Bad she said yet maybe not as bad as I thought And if thee doesnt come back Sheemie and I go west as thee said before Aye to Gilead Therell be a place of safety and respect for you there dear no matter what    but its especially important that you go if you dont hear the tankers explode Thee knows that doesnt thee To warn yer people  thy katet Roland nodded Ill warn them no fear And keep Sheemie safe too Hes as much the reason weve got this far as anything Ive done Roland was counting on Sheemie for more than she knew If he and Bert and Alain were killed it was Sheemie who would stabilize her give her reason to go on When does thee leave Susan asked Do we have time to make love We have time but perhaps its best we dont he said Its going to be hard enough to leave thee again without Unless you really want to    His eyes halfpleaded with her to say yes Lets just go back and lie down a bit she said and took his hand For a moment it trembled on her lips to tell him that she was kindled with his child but at the last moment she kept silent There was enough for him to think about without that added mayhap  and she didnt want to pass such happy news beneath such an ugly moon It would surely be bad luck They walked back through high grass that was already springing together along their path Outside the hut he turned her toward him put his hands on her cheeks and softly kissed her again I will love thee forever Susan he said Come whatever storms She smiled The upward movement of her cheeks spilled a pair of tears from her eyes Come whatever storms she agreed She kissed him again and they went inside  The moon had begun to descend when a party of eight rode out beneath the arch with come in peace writ upon it in the Great Letters Jonas and Reynolds were in the lead Behind them came Rheas black wagon drawn by a trotting pony that looked strong enough to go all night and half the next day Jonas had wanted to give her a driver but Rhea refused  Never was an animal I didnt get on with better than any man ever could shed told him and that seemed to be true The reins lay limp in her lap the pony worked smart without them The other five men consisted of Hash Renfrew Quint and three of Renfrews best vaqueros Coral had wanted to come as well but Jonas had different ideas If were killed you can go on more or less as before hed said Therell be nothing to tie you to us Without ye Im not sure thered be any reason to go on she said Ar quit that schoolgirl shit it dont become you Youd find plenty of reasons to keep staggerin down the path if you had to put your mind to it If all goes well  as I expect it will  and you still want to be with me ride out of here as soon as you get word of our success Theres a town west of here in the Vi Castis Mountains Ritzy Go there on the fastest horse you can swing a leg over Youll be there ahead of us by days no matter how smart were able to push along Find a respectable inn thatll take a woman on her own    if there is such a thing in Ritzy Wait When we get there with the tankers you just fall into the column at my right hand Have you got it She had it One woman in a thousand was Coral Thorin  sharp as Lord Satan and able to fuck like Satans favorite harlot Now if things only turned out to be as simple as hed made them sound Jonas fell back until his horse was pacing alongside the black cart The ball was out of its bag and lay in Rheas lap Anything he asked He both hoped and dreaded to see that deep pink pulse inside it again Nay Itll speak when it needs to though  count on it Then what good are you old woman Yell know when the time comes Rhea said looking at him with arrogance and some fear as well he was happy to see Jonas spurred his horse back to the head of the little column He had decided to take the ball from Rhea at the slightest sign of trouble In truth it had already inserted its strange addicting sweetness into his head he thought about that single pink pulse of light hed seen far too much Balls he told himself Battlesweats all Ive got Once this business is over Ill be my old self again Nice if true but  but he had in truth begun to wonder Renfrew was now riding with Clay Jonas nudged his horse in between them His dicky leg was aching like a bastard another bad sign Lengyll he asked Renfrew Putting together a good bunch Renfrew said dont you fear Fran Lengyll Thirty men Thirty God Harrys body I told you I wanted forty Forty at least Renfrew measured him with a paleeyed glance then winced at a particularly vicious gust of the freshening wind He pulled his neckerchief up over his mouth and nose The vaqs riding behind had already done so How afraid of these three boys are you Jonas Afraid for both of us I guess since youre too stupid to know who they are or what theyre capable of He raised his own neckerchief then forced his voice into a more reasonable timbre It was best he do so he needed these bumpkins yet awhile longer Once the ball was turned over to Latigo that might change Though mayhap well never see them Its likely theyre already thirty miles from here and riding west as fast as their horsesll take em Renfrew agreed Id give a crown to know how they got loose What does it matter you idiot Jonas thought but said nothing As for Lengylls men theyll be the hardest boys he can lay hands on  if it comes to a fight those thirty will fight like sixty Jonass eyes briefly met Clays Ill believe it when I see it Clays brief glance said and Jonas knew again why he had always liked this one better than Roy Depape How many armed With guns Maybe half Theyll be no more than an hour behind us Good At least their back door was covered It would have to do And he couldnt wait to be rid of that thricecursed ball Oh whispered a sly halfmad voice from a place much deeper than his heart Oh cant you Jonas ignored the voice until it stilled Half an hour later they turned off the road and onto the Drop Several miles ahead moving in the wind like a silver sea was the Bad Grass  Around the time that Jonas and his party were riding down the Drop Roland Cuthbert and Alain were swinging up into their saddles Susan and Sheemie stood by the doorway to the hut holding hands and watching them solemnly Theell hear the explosions when the tankers go and smell the smoke Roland said Even with the wind the wrong way I think theell smell it Then no more than an hour later more smoke There He pointed Thatll be the brush piled in front of the canyons mouth And if we dont see those things Into the west But thee will Sue I swear thee will She stepped forward put her hands on his thigh and looked up at him in the latening moonlight He bent put his hand lightly against the back of her head put his mouth on her mouth Go thy course in safety Susan said as she drew back from him Aye Sheemie added suddenly Stand and be true all three He came forward himself and shyly touched Cuthberts boot Cuthbert reached down took Sheemies hand and shook it Take care of her old boy Sheemie nodded seriously I will Come on Roland said He felt that if he looked at her solemn upturned face again he would cry Lets go They rode slowly away from the hut Before the grass closed behind them hiding it from view he looked back a final time Sue I love thee She smiled It was a beautiful smile Bird and bear and hare and fish she said The next time Roland saw her she was caught inside the Wizards glass  What Roland and his friends saw west of the Bad Grass had a harsh lonely beauty The wind was lifting great sheets of sand across the stony desert floor the moonlight turned these into foot racing phantoms At moments Hanging Rock was visible some two wheels distant and the mouth of Eyebolt Canyon two wheels farther on Sometimes both were gone hidden by the dust Behind them the tall grass made a soughing singing sound How do you boys feel Roland asked Alls well They nodded Theres going to be a lot of shooting I think Well remember the faces of our fathers Cuthbert said Yes Roland agreed almost absently Well remember them very well He stretched in the saddle The winds in our favor not theirs  thats one good thing Well hear them coming We must judge the size of the group All right They both nodded If Jonas has still got his confidence hell come soon in a small party  whatever gunnies he can put together on short notice  and hell have the ball In that case well ambush them kill them all and take the Wizards Rainbow Alain and Cuthbert sat quiet listening intently The wind gusted and Roland clapped a hand to his hat to keep it from flying off If he fears more trouble from us I think hes apt to come later on and with a bigger party of riders If that happens well let them pass    then if the wind is our friend and keeps up well fall in behind them Cuthbert began to grin Oh Roland he said Your father would be proud Only fourteen but cozy as the devil Fifteen come next moonrise Roland said seriously If we do it this way we may have to kill their drogue riders Watch my signals all right Were going to cross to Hanging Rock as part of their party Alain asked He had always been a step or two behind Cuthbert but Roland didnt mind sometimes reliability was better than quickness Is that it If the cards fall that way yes If theyve got the pink ball with em youd better hope it doesnt give us away Alain said Cuthbert looked surprised Roland bit his lip thinking that sometimes Alain was plenty quick Certainly he had come up with this unpleasant little idea ahead of Bert    ahead of Roland too Weve got a lot to hope for this morning but well play our cards as they come off the top of the pack They dismounted and sat by their horses there on the edge of the grass saying little Roland watched the silver clouds of dust racing each other across the desert floor and thought of Susan He imagined them married living in a freehold somewhere south of Gilead By then Farson would have been defeated the worlds strange decline reversed the childish part of him simply assumed that making an end to John Farson would somehow see to that and his gunslinging days would be over Less than a year it had been since he had won the right to carry the sixshooters he wore on his hips  and to carry his fathers great revolvers when Steven Deschain decided to pass them on  and already he was tired of them Susans kisses had softened his heart and quickened him somehow had made another life possible A better one perhaps One with a house and kiddies and  Theyre coming Alain said snapping Roland out of his reverie The gunslinger stood up Rushers reins in one fist Cuthbert stood tensely nearby Large party or small Does thee  do you know Alain stood facing southeast hands held out with the palms up Beyond his shoulder Roland saw Old Star just about to slip below the horizon Only an hour until dawn then I cant tell yet Alain said Can you at least tell if the ball   No Shut up Roland let me listen Roland and Cuthbert stood and watched Alain anxiously at the same time straining their ears to hear the hooves of horses the creak of wheels or the murmur of men on the passing wind Time spun out The wind rather than dropping as Old Star disappeared and dawn approached blew more fiercely than ever Roland looked at Cuthbert who had taken out his slingshot and was playing nervously with the pull Bert raised one shoulder in a shrug Its a small party Alain said suddenly Can either of you touch them They shook their heads No more than ten maybe only six Gods Roland murmured and pumped a fist at the sky He couldnt help it And the ball I cant touch it Alain said He sounded almost as though he were sleeping himself But its with them dont you think Roland did A small party of six or eight probably travelling with the ball It was perfect Be ready boys he said Were going to take them  Jonass party made good time down the Drop and into the Bad Grass The guidestars were brilliant in the autumn sky and Renfrew knew them all He had a clickline to measure between the two he called The Twins and he stopped the group briefly every twenty minutes or so to use it Jonas hadnt the slightest doubt the old cowboy would bring them out of the tall grass pointed straight at Hanging Rock Then about an hour after theyd entered the Bad Grass Quint rode up beside him That old lady she want to see you sai She say its important Do she now Jonas asked Aye Quint lowered his voice That ball she got on her lap all glowy Is that so I tell you what Quint  keep my old trailbuddies company while I see whats what He dropped back until he was pacing beside the black cart Rhea raised her face to him and for a moment washed as it was in the pink light he thought it the face of a young girl So she said Here yare big boy I thought yed show up pretty smart She cackled and as her face broke into its sour lines of laughter Jonas again saw her as she really was  all but sucked dry by the thing in her lap Then he looked down at it himself    and was lost He could feel that pink glow radiating into all the deepest passages and hollows of his mind lighting them up in a way theyd never been lit up before Even Coral at her dirty busiest couldnt light him up that way Ye like it dont ye she halflaughed halfcrooned Aye so ye do so would anyone such a pretty glam it is But what do ye see sai Jonas Leaning over holding to the saddlehorn with one hand his long hair hanging down in a sheaf Jonas looked deeply into the ball At first he saw only that luscious labial pink and then it began to draw apart Now he saw a hut surrounded by tall grass The sort of hut only a hermit could love The door  it was painted a peeling but still bright red  stood open And sitting there on the stone stoop with her hands in her lap her blankets on the ground at her feet and her unbound hair around her shoulders was  Ill be damned Jonas whispered He had now leaned so far out of the saddle that he looked like a trick rider in a circus show and his eyes seemed to have disappeared there were only sockets of pink light where they had been Rhea cackled delightedly Aye its Thorins gilly that never was Dearborns lovergirl Her cackling stopped abruptly Lovergirl of the young proddy who killed my Ermot And hell pay for it aye so he will Look closer sai Jonas Look closer He did Everything was clear now and he thought he should have seen it earlier Everything this girls aunt had feared had been true Rhea had known although why she hadnt told anyone the girl had been screwing one of the InWorld boys Jonas didnt know And Susan had done more than just screw Will Dearborn shed helped him escape him and his trailmates and she might well have killed two lawmen for him into the bargain The figure in the ball swam closer Watching that made him feel a little dizzy but it was a pleasant dizziness Beyond the girl was the hut faintly lit by a lamp which had been turned down to the barest core of flame At first Jonas thought someone was sleeping in one comer but on second glance he decided it was only a heap of hides that looked vaguely human Doee spy the boys Rhea asked seemingly from a great distance Doee spy em mlord sai No he said his own voice seeming to come from that same distant place His eyes were pinned to the ball He could feel its light baking deeper and deeper into his brain It was a good feeling like a hot fire on a cold night Shes alone Looks as if shes waiting Aye Rhea gestured above the ball  a curt dustingoff movement of the hands  and the pink light was gone Jonas gave a low protesting cry but no matter the ball was dark again He wanted to stretch his hands out and tell her to make the light return  to beg her if necessary  and held himself back by pure force of will He was rewarded by a slow return of his wits It helped to remind himself that Rheas gestures were as meaningless as the puppets in a Pinch and Jilly show The ball did what it wanted not what she wanted Meanwhile the ugly old woman was looking at him with eyes that were perversely shrewd and clear Waiting for what doee suppose she asked There was only one thing she could be waiting for Jonas thought with rising alarm The boys The three beardless sons of bitches from InWorld And if they werent with her they might well be up ahead doing their own waiting Waiting for him Possibly even waiting for  Listen to me he said Ill only speak once and you best answer true Do they know about that thing Do those three boys know about the Rainbow Her eyes shifted away from his It was answer enough in one way but not in another She had had things her way all too long up there on her hill she had to know who was boss down here He leaned over again and grabbed her shoulder It was horrible  like grabbing a bare bone that somehow still lived  but he made himself hold on all the same And squeeze She moaned and wriggled but he held on Tell me you old bitch Run your fucking gob They might know of it she whined The girl mightve seen something the night she came to be  am let go yere killing me If I wanted to kill you youd be dead He took another longing glance at the ball then sat up straight in the saddle cupped his hands around his mouth and called Clay Hold up As Reynolds and Renfrew reined back Jonas raised a hand to halt the vaqs behind him The wind whispered through the grass bending it rippling it whipping up eddies of sweet smell Jonas stared ahead into the dark even though he knew it was fruitless to look for them They could be anywhere and Jonas didnt like the odds in an ambush Not one bit He rode to where Clay and Renfrew were waiting Renfrew looked impatient Whats the problem Dawnll be breaking soon We ought to get a moveon Do you know the huts in the Bad Grass Ayemost Why   Do you know one with a red door Renfrew nodded and pointed northish Old Soonys place He had some sort of religious conversion  a dream or a vision or something Thats when he painted the door of his hut red Hes gone to the Mannifolk these last five years He no longer asked why at least he had seen something on Jonass face that had shut up his questions Jonas raised his hand looked at the blue coffin tattooed there for a second then turned and called for Quint Youre in charge Jonas told him Quints shaggy eyebrows shot up Me Yar But youre not going on  theres been a change of plan What   Listen and dont open your mouth again unless theres something you dont understand Get that damned black cart turned around Put your men around it and hie on back the way we came Join up with Lengyll and his men Tell them Jonas says wait where you find em until he and Reynolds and Renfrew come Clear Quint nodded He looked bewildered but said nothing Good Get about it And tell the witch to put her toy back in its bag Jonas passed a hand over his brow Fingers which had rarely shaken before had now picked up a minute tremble Its distracting Quint started away then looked back when Jonas called his name I think those InWorld boys are out here Quint Probably ahead of where we are now but if theyre back the way youre going theyll probably set on you Quint looked nervously around at the grass which rose higher than his head Then his lips tightened and he returned his attention to Jonas If they attack theyll try to take the ball Jonas continued And sai mark me well any man who doesnt die protecting it will wish he had He lifted his chin at the vaqs who sat astride their horses in a line behind the black cart Tell them that Aye boss Quint said When you reach Lengylls party youll be safe How long should we wait for yer if ye dont come Til hell freezes over Now go As Quint left Jonas turned to Reynolds and Renfrew Were going to make a little sidetrip boys he said  Roland Alains voice was low and urgent Theyve turned around Are you sure Yes Theres another group coming along behind them A much larger one Thats where theyre headed Safety in numbers thats all Cuthbert said Do they have the ball Roland asked Can you touch it yet Yes they have it It makes them easy to touch even though theyre going the other way now Once you find it it glows like a lamp in a mineshaft Does Rhea still have the keeping of it I think so Its awful to touch her Jonas is afraid of us Roland said He wants more men around him when he comes Thats what it is what it must be Unaware that he was both right and badly out in his reckoning Unaware that for one of the few times since they had left Gilead he had lapsed into a teenagers disastrous certainty What do we do Alain asked Sit here Listen Wait Theyll bring the ball this way again if theyre going to Hanging Rock Theyll have to Susan Cuthbert asked Susan and Sheemie What about them How do we know theyre all right I suppose that we dont Roland sat down crosslegged with Pushers trailing reins in his lap But Jonas and his men will be back soon enough And when they come well do what we must  Susan hadnt wanted to sleep inside  the hut felt wrong to her without Roland She had left Sheemie huddled under the old hides in the comer and taken her own blankets outside She sat in the huts doorway for a little while looking up at the stars and praying for Roland in her own fashion When she began to feel a little better she lay down on one blanket and pulled the other over her It seemed an eternity since Maria had shaken her out of her heavy sleep and the openmouthed glottal snores drifting out of the hut didnt bother her much She slept with her head pillowed on one arm and didnt wake when twenty minutes later Sheemie came to the doorway blinked at her sleepily and then walked off into the grass to urinate The only one to notice him was Caprichoso who stuck out his long muzzle and took a nip at Sheemies butt as the boy passed him Sheemie still mostly asleep reached back and pushed the muzzle away He knew Capis tricks well enough so he did Susan dreamed of the willow grove  bird and bear and hare and fish  and what woke her wasnt Sheemies return from his necessary but a cold circle of steel pressing into her neck There was a loud click that she recognized at once from the Sheriffs office a pistol being cocked The willow grove faded from the eye of her mind Shine little sunbeam said a voice For a moment her bewildered halfwaking mind tried to believe it was yesterday and Maria wanted her to get up and out of Seafront before whoever had killed Mayor Thorin and Chancellor Rimer could come back and kill her as well No good It wasnt the strong light of midmorning that her eyes opened upon but the ashpallid glow of five oclock Not a womans voice but a mans And not a hand shaking her shoulder but the barrel of a gun against her neck She looked up and saw a lined narrow face framed by white hair Lips no more than a scar Eyes the same faded blue as Rolands Eldred Jonas The man standing behind him had bought her own da drinks once upon a happier time Hash Renfrew A third man one of Jonass katet ducked into the hut Freezing terror filled her midsection  some for her some for Sheemie She wasnt sure the boy would even understand what was happening to them These are two of the three men who tried to kill him she thought Hell understand that much Here you are Sunbeam here you come Jonas said companionably watching her blink away the sleepfog Good You shouldnt be napping all the way out here on your own not a pretty sai such as yourself But dont worry Ill see you get back to where you belong His eyes flicked up as the redhead with the cloak stepped out of the hut Alone Whats she got in there Clay Anything Reynolds shook his head All still on the hoss I reckon Sheemie Susan thought Where are you Sheemie Jonas reached out and caressed one of her breasts briefly Nice he said Tender and sweet No wonder Dearborn likes you Get yer filthy bluemarked hand off me you bastard Smiling Jonas did as she bid He turned his head and regarded the mule I know this one it belongs to my good friend Coral Along with everything else youve turned livestock thief Shameful shameful this younger generation Dont you agree sai Renfrew But her fathers old associate said nothing His face was carefully blank and Susan thought he might be just the tiniest tad ashamed of his presence here Jonas turned back to her his thin lips curved in the semblance of a benevolent smile Well after murder I suppose stealing a mule comes easy dont it She said nothing only watched as Jonas stroked Capis muzzle What all were they hauling those boys that it took a mule to put it on Shrouds she said through numb lips For you and all yer friends A fearful heavy load it made too  near broke the poor animals back Theres a saying in the land I come from Jonas said still smiling Clever girls go to hell Ever heard it He went on stroking Capis nose The mule liked it his neck was thrust out to its full length his stupid little eyes halfclosed with pleasure Has it crossed your mind that fellows who unload their pack animal split up what it was carrying and take the goods away usually aint coming back Susan said nothing Youve been left high and dry Sunbeam Fast fucked is usually fast forgot sad to say Do you know where they went Yes she said Her voice was low barely a whisper Jonas looked pleased If you was to tell things might go easier for you Would you agree Renfrew Aye Renfrew said Theyre traitors Susan  for the Good Man If you know where they are or what theyre up to tell us Keeping her eyes fixed on Jonas Susan said Come closer Her numbed lips didnt want to move and it came out sounding like Cung gloser but Jonas understood and leaned forward stretching his neck in a way that made him look absurdly like Caprichoso When he did Susan spat in his face Jonas recoiled lips twisting in surprise and revulsion Arrr BITCH he cried and launched a fullswung openhanded blow that drove her to the ground She landed at full length on her side with black stars exploding across her field of vision She could already feel her right cheek swelling like a balloon and thought If hed hit an inch or two lower he mightve broken my neck Mayhap that wouldve been best She raised her hand to her nose and wiped blood from the right nostril Jonas turned to Renfrew who had taken a single step forward and then stopped himself Put her on her horse and tie her hands in front of her Tight He looked down at Susan then kicked her in the shoulder hard enough to send her rolling toward the hut Spit on me would you Spit on Eldred Jonas would you you bitch Reynolds was holding out his neckerchief Jonas took it wiped the spittle from his face with it then dropped into a hunker beside her He took a handful of her hair and carefully wiped the neckerchief with it Then he hauled her to her feet Tears of pain now peeped from the comers of her eyes but she kept silent I may never see your friend again sweet Sue with the tender little titties but Ive got you aint I Yar And if Dearborn gives us trouble Ill give you double And make sure Dearborn knows You may count on it His smile faded and he gave her a sudden bitter shove that almost sent her sprawling again Now get mounted and do it before I decide to change your face a little with my knife  Sheemie watched from the grass terrified and silently crying as Susan spit in the bad Coffin Hunters face and was knocked to the ground hit so hard the blow might have killed her He almost rushed out then but something  it could have been his friend Arthurs voice in his head  told him that would only get him killed He watched as Susan mounted One of the other men  not a Coffin Hunter but a big rancher Sheemie had seen in the Rest from time to time  tried to help but Susan pushed him away with the sole of her boot The man stood back with a red face Dont make em mad Susan Sheemie thought Oh gods dont do that theyll hit ye some more Oh yer poor face And ye got a nosebleed so you do Last chance Jonas told her Where are they and what do they mean to do Go to hell she said He smiled  a thin hurty smile Likely Ill find you there when I arrive he said Then to the other Coffin Hunter You checked the place careful Whatever they had they took it the redhead answered Only thing they left was Dearborns punchbunny That made Jonas laugh meanymean as he climbed on board his own horse Come on he said lets ride They went back into the Bad Grass It closed around them and it was as if they had never been there    except that Susan was gone and so was Capi The big rancher riding beside Susan had been leading the mule When he was sure they werent going to return Sheemie walked slowly back into the clearing doing up the button on top of his pants as he came He looked from the way Roland and his friends had gone to the one in which Susan had been taken Which A moments thought made him realize there was no choice The grass out here was tough and springy The path Roland and Alain and good old Arthur Heath so Sheemie still thought of him and always would had taken was gone The one made by Susan and her captors on the other hand was still clear And perhaps if he followed her he could do something for her Help her Walking at first then jogging as his fear that they might double back and catch him dissipated Sheemie went in the direction Susan had been taken He would follow her most of that day  Cuthbert  not the most sanguine of personalities in any situation  grew more and more impatient as the day brightened toward true dawn Its Reaping he thought Finally Reaping and here we sit with our knives sharpened and not a thing in the world to cut Twice he asked Alain what he heard The first time Alain only grunted The second time he asked what Bert expected him to hear with someone yapping away in his ear like that Cuthbert who did not consider two enquiries fifteen minutes apart as yapping away wandered off and sat morosely in front of his horse After a bit Roland came over and sat down beside him Waiting Cuthbert said Thats what most of our time in Mejis has been about and its the thing I do worst You wont have to do it much longer Roland said  Jonass company reached the place where Fran Lengylls party had made a temporary camp about an hour after the sun had topped the horizon Quint Rhea and Renfrews vaqs were already there and drinking coffee Jonas was glad to see Lengyll started forward saw Susan riding with her hands tied and actually drew back a step as if he wanted to find a comer to hide in There were no comers out here however so he stood fast He did not look happy about it however Susan nudged her horse forward with her knees and when Reynolds tried to grab her shoulder she dipped it to the side temporarily eluding him Why Francis Lengyll Imagine meeting you here Susan Im sorry to see ye so Lengyll said His flush crept closer and closer to his brow like a tide approaching a seawall Its bad company yeve fallen in with girl    and in the end bad company always leaves ye to face the music alone Susan actually laughed Bad company she said Aye yed know about that wouldnt ye Fran He turned awkward and stiff in his embarrassment She raised one booted foot and before anyone could stop her kicked him squarely between the shoulderblades He went down on his stomach his whole face widening in shocked surprise No ye dont ye bold cunt Renfrew shouted and fetched her a wallop to the side of the head  it was on the left and at least evened things up a bit she would think later when her mind cleared and she was capable of thinking She swayed in the saddle but kept her seat And she never looked at Renfrew only at Lengyll who had now managed to get to his hands and knees He wore a deeply dazed expression Youkilled my father she screamed at him You killed my father you cowardly sneaking excuse for a man She looked at the party of ranchers and vaqs all of them staring at her now There he is Fran Lengyll head of the Horsemens Association as low a sneak as ever walked Low as coyote shit Low as   Thats enough Jonas said watching with some interest as Lengyll scuttled back to his men  and yes Susan was bitterly delighted to see it was a fullfledged scuttle  with his shoulders hunched Rhea was cackling rocking from side to side and making a sound like fingernails on a piece of slate The sound shocked Susan but she wasnt a bit surprised by Rheas presence in this company It could never be enough she said looking from Jonas to Lengyll with an expression of contempt so deep it seemed bottomless For him it could never be enough Well perhaps but you did quite well in the time you had ladysai Few could have done better And listen to the witch cackle Like salt in his wounds I wot    but well shut her up soon enough Then turning his head Clay Reynolds rode up Think you can get Sunbeam back to Seafront all right I think so Reynolds tried not to show the relief he felt at being sent back east instead of west He had begun to have a bad feeling about Hanging Rock Latigo the tankers    about the whole show really God knew why Now Give it another minute Jonas said Mayhap theres going to be a spot of killing right here Who knows But its the unanswered questions that makes it worthwhile getting up in the morning even when a mans leg aches like a tooth with a hole in it Wouldnt you say so I dont know Eldred Sai Renfrew watch our pretty Sunbeam a minute I have a piece of property to take back His voice carried well  he had meant that it should  and Rheas cackles cut off suddenly as if severed out of her throat with a hookingknife Smiling Jonas walked his horse toward the black cart with its jostling show of gold symbols Reynolds rode on his left and Jonas sensed rather than saw Depape fall in on his right Roy was a good enough boy really his head was a little soft but his heart was in the right place and you didnt have to tell him everything For every step forward Jonass horse took Rhea shrank back a little in the cart Her eyes shifted from side to side in their deep sockets looking for a way out that wasnt there Keep away from me ye charry man she cried raising a hand toward him With the other she clutched the sack with the ball in it ever more tightly Keep away or Ill bring the lightning and strike ye dead where ye sit yer horse Yer harrier friends too Jonas thought Roy hesitated briefly at that but Clay never did nor did Jonas himself He guessed there was a great lot she could do  or that there had been at one time But that was before the hungry glass had entered her life Give it up to me he said He reached the side of her wagon and held his hand out for the bag Its not yours and never was One day youll doubtless have the Good Mans thanks for keeping it so well as you have but now you must give it up She screamed  a sound of such piercing intensity that several of the vaqueros dropped their tin coffeecups and clapped their hands over their ears At the same time she knotted her hand through the drawstring and raised the bag over her head The curved shape of the ball swung back and forth at the bottom of it like a pendulum Ill not she howled I llsmash it on the ground before I give it up to the likes o you Jonas doubted if the ball would break not hurled by her weak arms onto the trampled springy mat of the Bad Grass but he didnt think he would have occasion to find out one way or the other Clay he said Draw your gun He didnt need to look at Clay to see that hed done it he saw the frantic way her eyes shifted to the left where Clay sat his horse Im going to have a count Jonas said Just a short one if I get to three and she hasnt passed that bag over blow her ugly head off Aye One Jonas said watching the ball pendulum back and forth at the bottom of the upheld bag It was glowing he could see dull pink even through the cloth Two Enjoy hell Rhea goodbye Thr   Here she screamed thrusting it out toward him and shielding her face with the crooked hook of her free hand Here take it And may it damn you the way its damned me Thankeesai He grabbed the bag just below the draw top and yanked Rhea screamed again as the string skinned her knuckles and tore off one of her nails Jonas hardly heard His mind was a white explosion of exultation For the first time in his long professional life he forgot his job his surroundings and the six thousand things that could get him killed on any day He had it he had it by all the graves of all the gods he had the fucking thing Mine he thought and that was all He somehow restrained the urge to open the bag and stick his head inside it like a horse sticking its head into a bag of oats and looped the drawstring over the pommel of his saddle twice instead He took in a breath as deep as his lungs would allow then expelled it Better A little Roy Aye Jonas It would be good to get out of this place Jonas thought and not for the first time To get away from these hicks He was sick of aye and ye and so it is sick to his bones Roy well give the bitch a tencount this time If she isnt out of my sight by then you have my permission to blow her ass off Now lets see if you can do the counting Ill be listening close so mind you dont skip any One Depape said eagerly Two Three Four Spitting curses Rhea snatched up the reins of the cart and spanked the ponys back with them The pony laid its ears back and jerked the cart forward so vigorously that Rhea went tumbling backward off the cantboard her feet up her white and bony shins showing above her anklehigh black shoes and mismatched wool stockings The vaqueros laughed Jonas laughed himself It was pretty funny all right seeing her on her back with her pins in the air Fuhfuhfive  Depape said laughing so hard he was hiccupping Sihsihsix  Rhea climbed back up flopped onto the cantboard again with all the grace of a dying fish and peered around at them walleyed and sneering Icurse ye all she screamed It cut through them stilling their laughter even as the cart bounced toward the edge of the trampled clearing Every last one of ye Ye and ye and ye Her crooked finger pointed last at Jonas Thief Miserable thief As though it was yours Jonas marveled although Mine was the first word to occur to him once he had taken possession of it As though such a wonder could ever belong to a backcountry reader of roosterguts such as you The cart bounced its way into the Bad Grass the pony pulling hard with its ears laid back the old womans screams served to drive it better than any whip could have done The black slipped into the green They saw the cart flicker like a conjurers trick and then it was gone For a long time yet however they heard her shrieking her curses calling death down upon them beneath the Demon Moon  Go on Jonas told Clay Reynolds Take our Sunbeam back And if you want to stop on the way and make some use of her why be my guest He glanced at Susan as he said this to see what effect it might be having but he was disappointed  she looked dazed as if the last blow Renfrew had dealt her had scrambled her brains at least temporarily Just make sure she gets to Coral at the end of all the fun I will Any message for sai Thorin Tell her to keep the wench someplace safe until she hears from me And    why dont you stay with her Clay Coral I mean  come tomorrow I dont think well have to worry about this un anymore but Coral    ride with her to Ritzy when she goes Be her escort like Reynolds nodded Better and better Seafront it would be and that was fine He might like a little taste of the girl once he got her there but not on the way Not under the ghostlyfull daytime Demon Moon Go on then Get started Reynolds led her across the clearing aiming for a point well away from the bent swath of grass where Rhea had made her exit Susan rode silently downcast eyes fixed on her bound wrists Jonas turned to face his men The three young fellows from InWorld have broken their way out of jail with that haughty young bitchs help he said pointing at Susans departing back There was a low growling murmur from the men That Will Dearborn and his friends were free they had known that sai Delgado had helped them escape they had not    and it was perhaps just as well for her that Reynolds was at that moment leading her into the Bad Grass and out of sight Never mind Jonas shouted pulling their attention back to him He reached out a stealthy hand and caressed the curve at the bottom of the drawstring bag Just touching the ball made him feel as if he could do anything and with one hand tied behind his back at that Never mind her and never mind them His eyes moved from Lengyll to Wertner to Croydon to Brian Hookey to Roy Depape Were close to forty men going to join another hundred and fifty Theyre three and not one a day over sixteen Are you afraid of three little boys No they cried If we run on em my cullies what will we do KILL THEM The shout so loud that it sent rooks rising up into the morning sun cawing their displeasure as they commenced the hunt for more peaceful surroundings Jonas was satisfied His hand was still on the sweet curve of the ball and he could feel it pouring strength into him Pink strength he thought and grinned Come on boys I want those tankers in the woods west of Eyebolt before the home folks light their ReapNight Bonfire  Sheemie crouched down in the grass and peering into the clearing was nearly run over by Rheas black wagon the screaming gibbering witch passed so close to him that he could smell her sour skin and dirty hair If she had looked down she couldnt have missed seeing him and undoubtedly would have turned him into a bird or a bumbler or maybe even a mosquito The boy saw Jonas pass custody of Susan to the one in the cloak and began working his way around the edge of the clearing He heard Jonas haranguing the men many of whom Sheemie knew it shamed him to know how many Mejis cowboys were doing that bad Coffin Hunters bidding but paid no attention to what he was saying Sheemie froze in place as they mounted up momentarily scared they would come in his direction but they rode the other way west The clearing emptied almost as if by magic    except it wasnt entirely empty Caprichoso had been left behind his lead trailing on the beaten grass Capi looked after the departing riders brayed once  as if to tell them they could all go to hell  then turned and made eyecontact with Sheemie who was peering out into the clearing The mule flicked his ears at the boy then tried to graze He lipped the Bad Grass a single time raised his head and brayed at Sheemie as if to say this was all the innboys fault Sheemie stared thoughtfully at Caprichoso thinking of how much easier it was to ride than to walk Gods yes  but that second bray decided him against it The mule might give one of his disgusted cries at the wrong time and alert the man who had Susan Youll find your way home I reckon Sheemie said So long pal So long good old Capi See you farther down the path He found the path made by Susan and Reynolds and began to trot after them once more  Theyre coming again Alain said a moment before Roland sensed it himself  a brief flicker in his head like pink lightning All of them Roland hunkered in front of Cuthbert Cuthbert looked back at him without even a suggestion of his usual foolish good humor Much of its on you Roland said then tapped the slingshot And on that I know How much have you got in the armory Almost four dozen steel balls Bert held up a cotton bag which had in more settled times held his fathers tobacco Plus assorted fireworks in my saddlebag How many bigbangers Enough Roland Unsmiling With the laughter gone from them he had the hollow eyes of just one more killer Enough Roland ran a hand down the front of the serape he wore letting his palm reacquaint itself with the rough weave He looked at Cuthberts then at Alains telling himself again that it could work yes as long as they held their nerve and didnt let themselves think of it in terms of three against forty or fifty it could work The ones out at Hanging Rock will hear the shooting once it starts wont they Al asked Roland nodded With the wind blowing from us to them theres no doubt of that Well have to move fast then Well go as best we can Roland thought of standing between the tangled green hedges behind the Great Hall David the hawk on his arm and a sweat of terror trickling down his back I think you die today he had told the hawk and he had told it true Yet he himself had lived and passed his test and walked out of the testing corridor facing east Today it was Cuthbert and Alains turn to be tested  not in Gilead in the traditional place of proving behind the Great Hall but here in Mejis on the edge of the Bad Grass in the desert and in the canyon Eyebolt Canyon Prove or die Alain said as if reading the run of the gunslingers thoughts Thats what it comes down to Yes Thats what it always comes down to in the end How long before they get here do you think An hour at least Id say Likely two Theyll be running a watchandgo  Alain nodded I think so yes Thats not good Cuthbert said Jonas is afraid of being ambushed in the grass Roland said Maybe of us setting fire to it around him Theyll loosen up when they get into the clear You hope Cuthbert said Roland nodded gravely Yes I hope  At first Reynolds was content to lead the girl along the broken backtrail at a fast walk but about thirty minutes after leaving Jonas Lengyll and the rest he broke into a trot Pylon matched Reynoldss horse easily and just as easily when ten minutes later he upped their speed to a light but steady run Susan held to the horn of her saddle with her bound hands and rode easily at Reynoldss right her hair streaming out behind her She thought her face must be quite colorful the skin of her cheeks felt raised at least two inches higher than usual welted and tender Even the passing wind stung a little At the place where the Bad Grass gave way to the Drop Reynolds stopped to give the horses a blow He dismounted himself turned his back to her and took a piss As he did Susan looked up along the rise of land and saw the great herd now untended and unravelling at the edges They had done that much perhaps It wasnt much but it was something Do you need to do the necessary Reynolds asked Ill help you down if you do but dont say no now and whine about it later Yere afraid Big brave regulator that ye are yere scared aint ye Aye coffin tattoo and all Reynolds tried a contemptuous grin It didnt fit his face very well this morning You ort to leave the fortunetelling to those that are good at it missy Now do you need a necessary stop or not No And ye are afraid Of what Reynolds who only knew that his bad feeling hadnt left him when he left Jonas as hed hoped it would bared his tobaccostained teeth at her If you cant talk sensible just shut up Why dont ye let me go Perhaps my friends will do the same for you when they catch us up This time Reynolds grunted laughter which was almost genuine He swung himself into his saddle hawked spat Overhead Demon Moon was a pale and bloated ball in the sky You can dream misssai he said dreamings free But you aint never going to see those three again Theyre for the worms they are Now lets ride They rode  Cordelia hadnt gone to bed at all on Reaping Eve She sat the night through in her parlor chair and although there was sewing on her lap she had put not a single stitch in nor picked one out Now as mornings light brightened toward ten o the clock she sat in the same chair looking out at nothing What was there to look at anyway Everything had come down with a smash  all her hopes of the fortune Thorin would settle on Susan and Susans child perhaps while he still lived certainly in his deadletter all her hopes of ascending to her proper place in the community all her plans for the future Swept away by two wilful young people who couldnt keep their pants up She sat in her old chair with her knitting on her lap and the ashes Susan had smeared on her cheek standing out like a brand and thought Theyll find me dead in this chair someday  old poor and forgotten That ungrateful child After all I did for her What roused her was a weak scratching at the window She had no idea how long it had been going on before it finally intruded on her consciousness but when it did she laid her needlework aside and got up to see A bird perhaps Or children playing Reaping jokes unaware that the world had come to an end Whatever it was she would shoo it away Cordelia saw nothing at first Then as she was about to turn away she spied a pony and cart at the edge of the yard The cart was a little disquieting  black with gold symbols overpainted  and the pony in the shafts stood with its head lowered not grazing looking as if it had been run half to death She was still frowning out at this when a twisted filthy hand rose in the air directly in front of her and began to scratch at the glass again Cordelia gasped and clapped both hands to her bosom as her heart took a startled leap in her chest She backed up a step and gave a little shriek as her calf brushed the tender of the stove The long dirty nails scratched twice more then fell away Cordelia stood where she was for a moment irresolute then went to the door stopping at the woodbox to pick up a chunk of ash which fitted her hand Just in case Then she jerked the door open went to the comer of the house drew in a deep steadying breath and went around to the garden side raising the ashchunk as she did Get out whoever ye are Scat before I   Her voice was stilled by what she saw an incredibly old woman crawling through the frostkilled flowerbed next to the house  crawling toward her The crones stringy white hair what remained of it hung in her face Sores festered on her cheeks and brow her lips had split and drizzled blood down her pointed warty chin The corneas of her eyes had gone a filthy grayyellow and she panted like a cracked bellows as she moved Good woman help me this specter gasped Help me if ye will for Im about done up The hand holding the chunk of ash sagged Cordelia could hardly believe what she was seeing Rhea she whispered Is it Rhea Aye Rhea whispered crawling relentlessly through the dead silkflowers dragging her hands through the cold earth Help me Cordelia retreated a step her makeshift bludgeon now hanging at her knee No I I cant have such as thee in my house  Im sorry to see ye so but    but I have a reputation ye ken    folk watch me close so they do  She glanced at the High Street as she said this as if expecting to see a line of townspeople outside her gate watching eagerly avid to fleet their wretched gossip on its lying way but there was no one there Hambry was quiet its walks and byways empty the customary joyous noise of Reaping FairDay stilled She looked back at the thing which had fetched up in her dead flowers Yer niece  did this    the thing in the dirt whispered All    her fault    Cordelia dropped the chunk of wood It clipped the side of her ankle but she hardly noticed Her hands curled into fists before her Help me Rhea whispered I know  where she is  we  we have work us two  womens    work  Cordelia hesitated a moment then went to the woman knelt got an arm around her and somehow got her to her feet The smell coming off her was reeky and nauseating  the smell of decomposing flesh Bony fingers caressed Cordelias cheek and the side of her neck as she helped the hag into the house Cordelias flesh crawled but she didnt pull away until Rhea collapsed into a chair gasping from one end and farting from the other Listen to me the old woman hissed I am Cordelia drew a chair over and sat beside her At deaths door she might be but once her eye fell on you it was strangely hard to look away Now Rheas fingers dipped inside the bodice of her dirty dress brought out a silver charm of some kind and began to move it back and forth rapidly as if telling beads Cordelia who hadnt felt sleepy all night began to feel that way now The others are beyond us Rhea said and the ball has slipped my grasp But she   Back to Mayors House shes been taen and mayhap we could see to her  we could do that much aye You cant see to anything Cordelia said distantly Youre dying Rhea wheezed laughter and a trickle of yellowish drool Dying Nay Just done up and in need of a refreshment Now listen to me Cordelia daughter of Hiram and sister of Pat She hooked a bony and surprisingly strong arm around Cordelias neck and drew her close At the same time she raised her other hand twirling the silver medallion in front of Cordelias wide eyes The crone whispered and after a bit Cordelia began to nod her understanding Do it then the old woman said letting go She slumped back in her chair exhausted Now for I cant last much longer as I am And Ill need a bit o time after mind ye To revive like Cordelia moved across the room to the kitchen area There on the counter beside the handpump was a wooden block in which were sheathed the two sharp knives of the house She took one and came back Her eyes were distant and far as Susans had been when she and Rhea stood in the open doorway of Rheas hut in the light of the Kissing Moon Would ye pay her back Rhea asked For thats why Ive come to ye Miss Oh So Young and Pretty Cordelia murmured in a barely audible voice The hand not holding the knife floated up to her face and touched her ashsmeared cheek Yes Id be repaid of her so I would To the death Aye Hers or mine  Twill be hers Rhea said never fear it Now refresh me Cordelia Give me what I need Cordelia unbuttoned her dress down the front pushing it open to reveal an ungenerous bosom and a middle which had begun to curve out in the last year or so making a tidy little potbelly Yet she still had the vestige of a waist and it was here she used the knife cutting through her shift and the top layers of flesh beneath The white cotton began to bloom red at once along the slit Aye Rhea whispered Like roses I dream of them often enough roses in bloom and what stands black among em at the end of the world Come closer She put her hand on the small of Cordelias back urging her forward She raised her eyes to Cordelias face then grinned and licked her lips Good Good enough Cordelia looked blankly over the top of the old womans head as Rhea of the Coos buried her face against the red cut in the shift and began to drink  Roland was at first pleased as the muted jingle of harness and buckle drew closer to the place where the three of them were hunkered down in the high grass but as the sounds drew closer still  close enough to hear murmuring voices as well as softthudding hooves  he began to be afraid For the riders to pass close was one thing but if they were through foul luck to come right upon them the three boys would likely die like a nest of moles uncovered by the blade of a passing plow Ka surely hadnt brought them all this way to end in such fashion had it In all these miles of Bad Grass how could that party of oncoming riders possibly strike the one point where Roland and his friends had pulled up But still they closed in the sound of tack and buckle and mens voices growing ever sharper Alain looked at Roland with dismayed eyes and pointed to the left Roland shook his head and patted his hands toward the ground indicating they would stay put They had to stay put it was too late to move without being heard Roland drew his guns Cuthbert and Alain did the same In the end the plow missed the moles by sixty feet The boys could actually see the horses and riders flashing through the thick grass Roland easily made out that the party was led by Jonas Depape and Lengyll riding three abreast They were followed by at least three dozen others glimpsed as roan flashes and the bright red and green of serapes through the grass They were strung out pretty well and Roland thought he and his friends could reasonably hope theyd string out even more once they reached open desert The boys waited for the party to pass holding their horses heads in case one of them took it in mind to whicker a greeting to the nags so close by When they were gone Roland turned his pale and unsmiling face to his friends Mount up he said Reapings come  They walked their horses to the edge of the Bad Grass meeting the path of Jonass party where the grass gave way first to a zone of stunted bushes and then to the desert itself The wind howled high and lonesome carrying big drifts of gritty dust under a cloudless dark blue sky Demon Moon stared down from it like the filmed eye of a corpse Two hundred yards ahead the drogue riders backing Jonass party were spread out in a line of three their sombreros jammed down tight on their heads their shoulders hunched their scrapes blowing Roland moved so that Cuthbert rode in the middle of their trio Bert had his slingshot in his hand Now he handed Alain half a dozen steel balls and Roland another halfdozen Then he raised his eyebrows questioningly Roland nodded and they began to ride Dust blew past them in rattling sheets sometimes turning the drogue riders into ghosts sometimes obscuring them completely but the boys closed in steadily Roland rode tense waiting for one of the drogues to turn in his saddle and see them but none did  none of them wanted to put his face into that cutting gritfilled wind Nor was there sound to warn them there was sandy hardpack under the horses hooves now and it didnt give away much When they were just twenty yards behind the drogues Cuthbert nodded  they were close enough for him to work Alain handed him a ball Bert sitting ramrod straight in the saddle dropped it into the cup of his slingshot pulled waited for the wind to drop then released The rider ahead on the left jerked as if stung raised one hand a little then toppled out of his saddle Incredibly neither of his two companeros seemed to notice Roland saw what he thought was the beginning of a reaction from the one on the right when Bert drew again and the rider in the middle collapsed forward onto his horses neck The horse startled reared up The rider flopped bonelessly backward his sombrero tumbling off and fell The wind dropped enough for Roland to hear his knee snap as his foot caught in one of his stirrups The third rider now began to turn Roland caught a glimpse of a bearded face  a dangling cigarette unlit because of the wind one astonished eye  and then Cuthberts sling thupped again The astonished eye was replaced by a red socket The rider slid from his saddle groping for the horn and missing it Three gone Roland thought He kicked Rusher into a gallop The others did the same and the boys rode forward into the dust a stirrups width apart The horses of the ambushed drogue riders veered off to the south in a group and that was good Riderless horses ordinarily didnt raise eyebrows in Mejis but when they were saddled  More riders up ahead a single then two side by side then another single Roland drew his knife and rode up beside the fellow who was now drogue and didnt know it What news he asked conversationally and when the man turned Roland buried his knife in his chest The vaqs brown eyes widened above the bandanna hed pulled up outlawstyle over his mouth and nose and then he tumbled from his saddle Cuthbert and Alain spurred past him and Bert not slowing took the two riding ahead with his slingshot The fellow beyond them heard something in spite of the wind and swivelled in his saddle Alain had drawn his own knife and now held it by the tip of the blade He threw hard in the exaggerated fullarm motion they had been taught and although the range was long for such work  twenty feet at least and in windy air  his aim was true The hilt came to rest protruding from the center of the mans bandanna The vaq groped for it making choked gargling sounds around the knife in his throat and then he too dropped from the saddle Seven now Like the story of the shoemaker and the flies Roland thought His heart was beating slow and hard in his chest as he caught up with Alain and Cuthbert The wind gusted a lonely whine Dust flew swirled then dropped with the wind Ahead of them were three more riders and ahead of them the main party Roland pointed at the next three then mimed the slingshot Pointed beyond them and mimed firing a revolver Cuthbert and Alain nodded They rode forward once again stirruptostirrup closing in  Bert got two of the three ahead of them clean but the third jerked at the wrong moment and the steel ball meant for the back of his head only clipped his earlobe on the way by Roland had drawn his gun by then however and put a bullet in the mans temple as he turned That made ten a full quarter of Jonass company before the riders even realized trouble had begun Roland had no idea if it would be enough of an advantage but he knew that the first part of the job was done No more stealth now it was a matter of raw killing Hile Hile he screamed in a ringing carrying voice To me gunslingers To me Ride them down No prisoners They spurred toward the main party riding into battle for the first time closing like wolves on sheep shooting before the men ahead of them had any slight idea of who had gotten in behind them or what was happening The three boys had been trained as gunslingers and what they lacked in experience they made up for with the keen eyes and reflexes of the young Under their guns the desert east of Hanging Rock became a killingfloor Screaming not a single thought among them above the wrists of their deadly hands they sliced into the unprepared Mejis party like a threesided blade shooting as they went Not every shot killed but not a one went entirely wild either Men flew out of their saddles and were dragged by boots caught in stirrups as their horses bolted other men some dead some only wounded were trampled beneath the feet of their panicky rearing mounts Roland rode with both guns drawn and tiring Rushers reins gripped in his teeth so they wouldnt fall overside and trip the horse up Two men dropped beneath his fire on his left two more on the right Ahead of them Brian Hookey turned in his saddle his beardstubbly face long with amazement Around his neck a reapcharm in the shape of a bell swung and tinkled as he grabbed for the shotgun which hung in a scabbard over one burly blacksmiths shoulder Before he could do more than get a hand on the gunstock Roland blew the silver bell off his chest and exploded the heart which lay beneath it Hookey pitched out of his saddle with a grunt Cuthbert caught up with Roland on the right side and shot two more men off their horses He gave Roland a fierce and blazing grin Al was right he shouted These are hard calibers Rolands talented fingers did their work rolling the cylinders of the guns he held and reloading at a full gallop  doing it with a ghastly supernatural speed  and then beginning to fire again Now they had come almost all the way through the group riding hard laying men low on both sides and straight ahead as well Alain dropped back a little and turned his horse covering Roland and Cuthbert from behind Roland saw Jonas Depape and Lengyll reining around to face their attackers Lengyll was clawing at his machinegun but the strap had gotten tangled in the wide collar of the duster he wore and every time he grabbed for the stock it bobbed out of his reach Beneath his heavy grayblond mustache Lengylls mouth was twisted with fury Now riding between Roland and Cuthbert and these three holding a huge bluedsteel fiveshot in one hand came Hash Renfrew Gods damn you Renfrew cried Oh you rotten sisterfuckers He dropped his reins and laid the fiveshot in the crook of one elbow to steady it The wind gusted viciously wrapping him in an envelope of swirling brown grit Roland had no thought of retreating or perhaps jigging to one side or the other He had in fact no thoughts at all The fever had descended over his mind and he burned with it like a torch inside a glass sleeve Screaming through the reins caught in his teeth he galloped toward Hash Renfrew and the three men behind him  Jonas had no clear idea of what was happening until he heard Will Dearborn screaming Hile To me No prisoners a battlecry he knew of old Then it fell into place and the rattle of gunfire made sense He reined around aware of Roy doing the same beside him    but most aware of the ball in its bag a thing both powerful and fragile swinging back and forth against the neck of his horse Its those kids Roy exclaimed His total surprise made him look more stupid than ever Dearborn you bastard Hash Renfrew spat and the gun in his hand thundered a single time Jonas saw Dearborns sombrero rise from his head its brim chewed away Then the kid was firing and he was good  better than anyone Jonas had ever seen in his life Renfrew was hammered back out of his saddle with both legs kicking still holding onto his monster gun firing it twice at the dustyblue sky before hitting the ground on his back and rolling dead on his side Lengylls hand dropped away from the elusive wire stock of his speedshooter and he only stared unable to believe the apparition bearing down on him out of the dust Get back he cried In the name of the Horsemens Association I tell you   Then a large black hole appeared in the center of his forehead just above the place where his eyebrows tangled together His hands flew up to his shoulders palms out as if he were declaring surrender That was how he died Son of a bitch oh you little sisterfucking son of a bitch Depape howled He tried to draw and his revolver got caught in his scrape He was still trying to pull it free when a bullet from Rolands gun opened his mouth in a red scream almost all the way down to his adams apple This cant be happening Jonas thought stupidly It cant there are too many of us But it was happening The InWorld boys had struck unerringly at the fractureline were performing what amounted to a textbook example of how gunslingers were supposed to attack when the odds were bad And Jonass coalition of ranchers cowboys and town toughboys had shattered Those not dead were fleeing to every point of the compass spurring their horses as if a hundred devils paroled from hell were in pursuit They were far from a hundred but they fought like a hundred Bodies were scattered in the dust everywhere and as Jonas watched he saw the one serving as their back door  Stockworth  ride down another man bump him out of his saddle and put a bullet in his head as he fell Gods of the earth he thought that was Croydon him that owns the Piano Ranch Except he didnt own it anymore And now Dearborn was bearing down on Jonas with his gun drawn Jonas snatched the drawstring looped around the horn of his saddle and unwound it with two fast hard snaps of the wrist He held the bag up in the windy air his teeth bared and his long white hair streaming Come any closer and Ill smash it I mean it you damned puppy Stay where you are Roland never hesitated in his headlong gallop never paused to think his hands did his thinking for him now and when he remembered all this later it was distant and silent and queerly warped like something seen in a flawed mirror  or a wizards glass Jonas thought Gods its him Its Arthur Eld himself come to take me And as the barrel of Rolands gun opened in his eye like the entrance to a tunnel or a mineshaft Jonas remembered what the brat had said to him in the dusty dooryard of that burnedout ranch The soul of a man such as you can never leave the west I knew Jonas thought Even then I knew my ka had pretty well run out But surely he wont risk the ball    he cant risk the ball hes the dinh of this katet and he cant risk it To me Jonas screamed To me boys Theyre only three for gods sake To me you cowards But he was alone  Lengyll killed with his idiotic machinegun lying by his side Roy a corpse glaring up at the bitter sky Quint fled Hookey dead the ranchers who had ridden with them gone Only Clay still lived and he was miles from here Ill smash it he shrieked at the coldeyed boy bearing down on him like deaths sleekest engine Before all the gods Ill   Roland thumbed back the hammer of his revolver and fired The bullet struck the center of the tattooed hand holding the drawstring cord and vaporized the palm leaving only fingers that twitched their random way out of a spongy red mass For just a moment Roland saw the blue coffin and then it was covered by downspilling blood The bag dropped And as Rusher collided with Jonass horse and slewed it tothe side roland caught the bag deftly in the crook of one arm Jonas screaming in dismay as the prize left him grabbed at Roland caught his shoulder and almost succeeded in turning the gunslinger out of his saddle Jonass blood rained across Rolands face in hot drops Give it back you brat Jonas clawed under his serape and brought out another gun Give it back its mine Not anymore Roland said And as Rusher danced around quick and delicate for such a large animal Roland fired two pointblank rounds into Jonass face Jonass horse bolted out from under him and the man with the white hair landed spreadeagled on his back with a thump His arms and legs spasmed jerked trembled then stilled Roland looped the bags drawstring over his shoulder and rode back toward Alain and Cuthbert ready to give aid  but there was no need They sat their horses side by side in the blowing dust at the end of a scattered road of dead bodies their eyes wide and dazed  eyes of boys who have passed through fire for the first time and can hardly believe they have not been burned Only Alain had been wounded a bullet had opened his left cheek a wound that healed clean but left a scar he bore until his dying day He could not remember who had shot him he said later on or at what point of the battle He had been lost to himself during the shooting and had only vague memories of what had happened after the charge began Cuthbert said much the same Roland Cuthbert said now He passed a shaky hand down his face Hile gunslinger Hile Cuthberts eyes were red and irritated from the sand as if he had been crying He took back the unspent silver slingshot balls when Roland handed them to him without seeming to know what they were Roland were alive Yes Alain was looking around dazedly Where did the others go Id say at least twentyfive of them are back there Roland said gesturing at the road of dead bodies The rest   He waved his hand still with a revolver in it in a wide halfcircle Theyve gone Had their fill of MidWorlds wars I wot Roland slipped the drawstring bag off his shoulder held it before him on the bridge of his saddle for a moment and then opened it For a moment the bags mouth was black and then it filled with the irregular pulse of a lovely pink light It crept up the gunslingers smooth cheeks like fingers and swam in his eyes Roland Cuthbert said suddenly nervous I dont think you should play with that Especially not now Theyll have heard the shooting out at Hanging Rock If were going to finish what we started we dont have time for   Roland ignored him He slipped both hands into the bag and lifted the wizards glass out He held it up to his eyes unaware that he had smeared it with droplets of Jonass blood The ball did not mind this was not the first time it had been bloodtouched It flashed and swirled formlessly for a moment and then its pink vapors opened like curtains Roland saw what was there and lost himself within it Corals grip on Susans arm was firm but not painful There was nothing particularly cruel about the way she was moving Susan along the downstairs corridor but there was a relentlessness about it that was disheartening Susan didnt try to protest it would have been useless Behind the two women were a pair of vaqueros armed with knives and bolas rather than guns the available guns had all gone west with Jonas Behind the vaqs skulking along like a sullen ghost which lacks the necessary psychic energy to fully materialize itself came the late Chancellors older brother Laslo Reynolds his taste for a spot of journeysend rape blunted by his growing sense of disquiet had either remained above or gone off to town Im going to put ye in the cold pantry until I know better what to do withee dear Coral said Yell be quite safe there  and warm How fortunate ye wore a serape Then    when Jonas gets back  Yell never see sai Jonas again Susan said He wont ever   Fresh pain exploded in her sensitive face For a moment it seemed the entire world had blown up Susan reeled back against the dressed stone wall of the lower corridor her vision first blurred then slowly clearing She could feel blood flowing down her cheek from a wound opened by the stone in Corals ring when Coral had backhanded her And her nose That cussed thing was bleeding again too Coral was looking at her in a chilly thisisallbusinesstome fashion but Susan believed she saw something different in the womans eyes Fear mayhap Dont talk to me about Eldred missy Hes sent to catch the boys who killed my brother The boys you set loose Get off it Susan wiped her nose grimaced at the blood pooled in her palm and wiped it on the leg of her pants I know who killed Hart as well as ye do yerself so dont pull mine and I wont yank yer own She watched Corals hand rise ready to slap and managed a dry laugh Go on Cut my face open on the other side if ye like Will that change how ye sleep tonight with no man to warm the other side of the bed Corals hand came down fast and hard but instead of slapping it seized Susans arm again Hard enough to hurt this time but Susan barely felt it She had been hurt by experts this day and would suffer more hurt gladly if that would hasten the moment when she and Roland could be together again Coral hauled her the rest of the way down the corridor through the kitchen that great room which would have been all steam and bustle on any other Reaping Day now stood uncannily deserted and to the ironbound door on the far side This she opened A smell of potatoes and gourds and sharproot drifted out Get in there Go smart before I decide to kick yer winsome ass square Susan looked her in the eye smiling Id damn ye for a murderers bedbitch sai Thorin but yeve already damned yerself Ye know it too  tis written in yer face to be sure So Ill just drop ye a curtsey  still smiling she suited action to the words  and wish ye a very good day Get in and shut up yer saucy mouth Coral cried and pushed Susan into the cold pantry She slammed the door ran the bolt and turned her blazing eyes upon the vaqs who stood prudently away from her Keep her well muchachos Mind ye do She brushed between them not listening to their assurances and went up to her late brothers suite to wait for Jonas or word of Jonas The wheyfaced bitch sitting down there amongst the carrots and potatoes knew nothing but her words yell never see sai Jonas again were in Corals head now they echoed and would not leave  Twelve o the clock sounded from the squat belltower atop the Town Gathering Hall And if the unaccustomed silence which hung over the rest of Hambry seemed strange as that Reap morning passed into afternoon the silence in the Travellers Rest was downright eerie Better than two hundred souls were packed together beneath the dead gaze of The Romp all of them drinking hard yet there was hardly a sound among them save for the shuffle of feet and the impatient rap of glasses on the bar indicating that another drink was wanted Sheb had tried a hesitant tune on the piano  Big Bottle Boogie everyone liked that one  and a cowboy with a mutiemark on one cheek had put the tip of a knife in his ear and told him to shut up that noise if he wanted to keep what passed for his brains on the starboard side of his eardrum Sheb who would be happy to go on drawing breath for another thousand years if the gods so allowed quit his pianobench at once and went to the bar to help Stanley and Pettie the Trotter serve up the booze The mood of the drinkers was confused and sullen Reaping Fair had been stolen from them and they didnt know what to do about it There would still be a bonfire and plenty of stuffyguys to bum on it but there were no Reapkisses today and would be no dancing tonight no riddles no races no pigwrestle no jokes  no good cheer dammit No hearty farewell to the end of the year Instead of joviality there had been murder in the dark and the escape of the guilty and now only the hope of retribution instead of the certainty of it These folk sullendrunk and as potentially dangerous as stormclouds filled with lightning wanted someone to focus on someone to tell them what to do And of course someone to toss on the fire as in the days of Eld It was at this point not long after the last toll of noon had faded into the cold air that the batwing doors opened and two women came in A good many knew the crone in the lead and several of them crossed their eyes with their thumbs as a ward against her evil look A murmur ran through the room It was the Coos the old witchwoman and although her face was pocked with sores and her eyes sunk so deep in their sockets they could barely be seen she gave off a peculiar sense of vitality Her lips were red as if she had been eating winterberries The woman behind her walked slowly and stiffly with one hand pressed against her midsection Her face was as white as the witchwomans mouth was red Rhea advanced to the middle of the floor passing the gawking trailhands at the Watch Me tables without so much as a glance When she reached the center of the bar and stood directly beneath The Romps glare she turned to look at the silent drovers and townsfolk Most of ye know me she cried in a rusty voice which stopped just short of stridency Those of ye who dont have never wanted a lovepotion or needed the ram put back in yer rod or gotten tired of a nagging motherinlaws tongue Im Rhea the wisewoman of the Coos and this lady beside me is aunt to the girl who freed three murderers last night this same girl who murdered yer towns Sheriff and a good young man  married he was and with a kid on the way He stood before her with is defenseless hands raised pleadin for his life on behalf of his wife and his babby to come and still she shot im Cruel she is Cruel and heartless A mutter ran through the crowd Rhea raised her twisted old claws and it stilled at once She turned in a slow circle to see them all hands still raised looking like the worlds oldest ugliest prizefighter Strangers came and ye welcomed em in she cried in her rusty crows voice Welcomed em and gave em bread to eat and its ruin theyve fed ye in return The deaths of those ye loved and depended on spoilage to the time of the harvest and gods know what curses upon the time to follow fin de ano More murmurs now louder She had touched their deepest fear that this years evil would spread might even snarl the newly threaded stock which had so slowly and hopefully begun to emerge along the Outer Arc But theyve gone and likely wont be back Rhea continued Mayhap just as well  why should their strange blood taint our ground But theres this other one raised among us  a young woman gone traitor to her town and rogue among her own kind Her voice dropped to a hoarse whisper on this last phrase her listeners strained forward to hear faces grim eyes big And now Rhea pulled the pallid skinny woman in the rusty black dress forward She stood Cordelia in front other like a doll or a ventriloquists dummy and whispered in her ear  but the whisper travelled somehow they all heard it Come dear Tell em what ye told me In a dead carrying voice Cordelia said She said she wouldnt be the Mayors gilly He wasnt good enough for such as her she said And then she seduced Will Dearborn The price of her body was a fine position in Gilead as his consort    and the murder of Hart Thorin Dearborn paid her price Lusty as he was for her he paid gladly His friends helped they may have had the use of er as well for all I know Chancellor Rimer must have gotten in their way Or prhaps they just saw him and felt like doing him too Bastards Pettie cried Sneaking young culls Now tell cm whats needed to clarify the new season before its spiled dearie Rhea said in a crooning voice Cordelia Delgado raised her head and looked around at the men She took a breath pulling the sour intermingled smells of gray and beer and smoke and whiskey deep into her spinsters lungs Take her Ye must take her I say it in love and sorrow so I do Silent Their eyes Paint her hands The glass gaze of the thing on the wall looking its stuffed judgment over the waiting room Charyou tree  Cordelia whispered They did not cry their agreement but sighed it like autumn wind through stripped trees  Sheemie ran after the bad Coffin Hunter and Susansai until he could literally run no more  his lungs were afire and the stitch which had formed in his side turned into a cramp He pitched forward onto the grass of the Drop his left hand clutching his right armpit grimacing with pain He lay there for some time with his face deep in the fragrant grass knowing they were getting farther and farther ahead but also knowing it would do him no good to get up and start running again until the stitch was good and gone If he tried to hurry the process the stitch would simply come back and lay him low again So he lay where he was lifting his head to look at the tracks left by Susansai and the bad Coffin Hunter and he was just about ready to try his feet when Caprichoso bit him Not a nip mind you but a good healthy chomp Capi had had a difficult twentyfour hours and he hadnt much liked to see the author of all his misery lying on the grass apparently taking a nap YeeeOWWWWbydamn Sheemie cried and rocketed to his feet There was nothing so magical as a good bite on the ass a man of more philosophic bent might have reflected it made all other concerns no matter how heavy or sorrowful disappear like smoke He whirled about Why did you do that you mean old sneak of a Capi Sheemie was rubbing his bottom vigorously and large tears of pain stood out in his eyes That hurts like    like a big old sonovabitch Caprichoso extended his neck to its maximum length bared his teeth in the satanic grin which only mules and dromedaries can command and brayed To Sheemie that bray sounded very like laughter The mules lead still trailed back between his sharp little hoofs Sheemie reached for it and when Capi dipped his head to inflict another bite the boy gave him a good hard whack across the side of his narrow head Capi snorted and blinked You had that coming mean old Capi Sheemie said Ill have to shit from a squat for a week so I will Wont be able to sit on the damned jakes He doubled the lead over his fist and climbed aboard the mule Capi made no attempt to buck him off but Sheemie winced as his wounded part settled atop the ridge of the mules spine This was good luck just the same though he thought as he kicked the animal into motion His ass hurt but at least he wouldnt have to walk  or try to run with a stitch in his side Go on stupid he said Hurry up Fast as you can you old sonovabitch In the course of the next hour Sheemie called Capi you old sonovabitch as often as possible  he had discovered as many others had before him that only the first cussword is really hard after that theres nothing quite like them for relieving ones feelings  Susans trail cut diagonally across the Drop toward the coast and the grand old adobe that rose there When Sheemie reached Seafront he dismounted outside the arch and only stood wondering what to do next That they had come here he had no doubt  Susans horse Pylon and the bad Coffin Hunters horse were tethered side by side in the shade occasionally dropping their heads and blowing in the pink stone trough that ran along the courtyards ocean side What to do now The riders who came and went beneath the arch mostly whiteheaded vaqs whod been considered too old to form a part of Lengylls party paid no attention to the innboy and his mule but Miguel might be a different story The old mozo had never liked him acted as if he thought Sheemie would turn thief given half a chance and if he saw Corals slopandcarryboy skulking in the courtyard Miguel would very likely drive him away No he wont he thought grimly Not today today I cant let him boss me I wont go even if he hollers But if the old man did holler and raised an alarm what then The bad Coffin Hunter might come and kill him Sheemie had reached a point where he was willing to die for his friends but not unless it served a purpose So he stood in the cold sunlight shifting from foot to foot irresolute wishing he was smarter than he was that he could think of a plan An hour passed this way then two It was slow time each passing moment an exercise in frustration He sensed any opportunity to help Susansai slipping away but didnt know what to do about it Once he heard what sounded like thunder from the west    although a bright fall day like this didnt seem right for thunder He had about decided to chance the courtyard anyway  it was temporarily deserted and he might be able to make it across to the main house  when the man he had feared came staggering out of the stables Miguel Torres was festooned with reapcharms and was very drunk He approached the center of the courtyard in rolling sidetoside loops the tugstring of his sombrero twisted against his scrawny throat his long white hair flying The front of his chibosa was wet as if he had tried to take a leak without remembering that you had to unlimber your dingus first He had a small ceramic jug in one hand His eyes were fierce and bewildered Who done this Miguel cried He looked up at the afternoon sky and the Demon Moon which floated there Little as Sheemie liked the old man his heart cringed It was bad luck to look directly at old Demon so it was Who done this thing I ask that you tell me senor Por favor A pause then a scream so powerful that Miguel reeled on his feet and almost fell He raised his fists as if he would box an answer out of the winking face in the moon then dropped them wearily Corn liquor slopped from the neck of the jug and wet him further Maricon  he muttered He staggered to the wall almost tripping over the rear legs of the bad Coffin Hunters horse as he went then sat down with his back against the adobe wall He drank deeply from the jug then pulled his sombrero up and settled it over his eyes His arm twitched the jug then settled it back as if in the end it had proved too heavy Sheemie waited until the old mans thumb came unhooked from the jughandle and the hand flopped onto the cobbles He started forward then decided to wait even a little longer Miguel was old and Miguel was mean but Sheemie guessed Miguel might also be tricky Lots of folks were especially the mean ones He waited until he heard Miguels dusty snores then led Capi into the courtyard wincing at every clop of the mules hooves Miguel never stirred however Sheemie tied Capi to the end of the hitching rail wincing again as Caprichoso brayed a tuneless greeting to the horses tied there then walked quickly across to the main door through which he had never in his life expected to pass He put his hand on the great iron latch looked back once more at the old man sleeping against the wall then opened the door and tiptoed in He stood for a moment in the oblong of sun the open door admitted his shoulders hunched all the way up to his ears expecting a hand to settle on the scruff of his neck which badnatured folk always seemed able to find no matter how high you hunched your shoulders at any moment an angry voice would follow asking what he thought he was doing here The foyer stood empty and silent On the far wall was a tapestry depicting vaqueros herding horses along the Drop against it leaned a guitar with a broken string Sheemies feet sent back echoes no matter how lightly he walked He shivered This was a house of murder now a bad place There were likely ghosts Still Susan was here Somewhere He passed through the double doors on the far side of the foyer and entered the reception hall Beneath its high ceiling his footfalls echoed more loudly than ever Longdead mayors looked down at him from the walls most had spooky eyes that seemed to follow him as he walked marking him as an intruder He knew their eyes were only paint but still    One in particular troubled him a fat man with clouds of red hair a bulldog mouth and a mean glare in his eye as if he wanted to ask what some halfwit innboy was doing in the Great Hall at Mayors House Quit looking at me that way you big old sonuvabitch Sheemie whispered and felt a little better For the moment at least Next came the dining hall also empty with the long trestle tables pushed back against the wall There was the remains of a meal on one  a single plate of cold chicken and sliced bread half a mug of ale Looking at those few bits of food on a table that had served dozens at various fairs and festivals  that should have served dozens this very day  brought the enormity of what had happened home to Sheemie And the sadness of it too Things had changed in Hambry and would likely never be the same again These long thoughts did not keep him from gobbling the leftover chicken and bread or from chasing it with what remained in the alepot It had been a long foodless day He belched clapped both hands over his mouth eyes making quick and guilty sidetoside darts above his dirty fingers and then walked on The door at the far end of the room was latched but unlocked Sheemie opened it and poked his head out into the corridor which ran the length of Mayors House The way was lit with gas chandeliers and was as broad as an avenue It was empty  at least for the moment  but he could hear whispering voices from other rooms and perhaps other floors as well He supposed they belonged to the maids and any other servants that might be about this afternoon but they sounded very ghostly to him just the same Perhaps one belonged to Mayor Thorin wandering the corridor right in front of him if Sheemie could but see him    which he was glad he couldnt Mayor Thorin wandering and wondering what had happened to him what this cold jellylike stuff soaking into his nightshirt might be who  A hand gripped Sheemies arm just above the elbow He almost shrieked Dont a woman whispered For your fathers sake Sheemie somehow managed to keep the scream in He turned And there wearing jeans and a plain checked ranchshirt her hair tied back her pale face set her dark eyes blazing stood the Mayors widow SSSai Thorin  I I I There was nothing else he could think of to say Now shell call for the guards o the watch if there be any left he thought In a way it would be a relief Have ye come for the girl The Delgado girl Grief had been good to Olive in a terrible way  had made her face seem less plump and oddly young Her dark eyes never left his and forbade any attempt at a lie Sheemie nodded Good I can use your help boy Shes down below in the pantry and shes guarded Sheemie gaped not believing what he was hearing Do you think I believe she had anything to do with Harts murder Olive asked as if Sheemie had objected to her idea I may be fat and not so speedy on my pins anymore but Im not a complete idiot Come on now Seafronts not a good place for sai Delgado just now  too many people from town know where she is  Roland He will hear this voice in uneasy dreams for the rest of his life never quite remembering what he has dreamed only knowing that the dreams leave him feeling ill somehow  walking restlessly straightening pictures in loveless rooms listening to the call to muzzein in alien town squares Roland of Gilead This voice which he almost recognizes a voice so like his own that a psychiatrist from Eddies or Susannahs or Jakes whenandwhere would say it is his voice the voice of his subconscious but Roland knows better Roland knows that often the voices that sound the most like our own when they speak in our heads are those of the most terrible outsiders the most dangerous intruders Roland son of Steven The ball has taken him first to Hambry and to Mayors House and he would see more of what is happening there but then it takes him away  calls him away in that strangely familiar voice and he has to go There is no choice because unlike Rhea or Jonas he is not watching the ball and the creatures who speak soundlessly within it he is inside the ball a part of its endless pink storm Roland come Roland see And so the storm whirls him first up and then away He flies across the Drop rising and rising through stacks of air first warm and then cold and he is not alone in the pink storm which bears him west along the Path of the Beam Sheb flies past him his hat cocked back on his head he is singing Hey Jude  at the top of his lungs as his nicotinestained fingers plink keys that are not there  transported by his tune Sheb doesnt seem to realize that the storm has ripped his piano away Roland come the voice says  the voice of the storm the voice of the glass  and Roland comes The Romp flies by him glassy eyes blazing with pink light A scrawny man in farmers overalls goes flying past his long red hair streaming out behind him Life for you and for your crop  he says  something like that anyway  and then hes gone Next spinning like a weird windmill comes an iron chair to Roland it looks like a torture device equipped with wheels and the boy gunslinger thinks The Lady of Shadows without knowing why he thinks it or what it means Now the pink storm is carrying him over blasted mountains now over a fertile green delta where a broad river runs its oxbow squiggles like a vein reflecting a placid blue sky that turns to the pink of wild roses as the storm passes above Ahead Roland sees an uprushing column of darkness and his heart quails but this is where the pink storm is taking him and this is where he must go I want to get out he thinks but hes not stupid he realizes the truth he may never get out The wizards glass has swallowed him He may remain in its stormy muddled eye forever Ill shoot my way out if I have to he thinks but no  he has no guns He is naked in the storm rushing bareass toward that virulent blueblack infection that has buried all the landscape beneath it And yet he hears singing Faint but beautiful  a sweet harmonic sound that makes him shiver and think of Susan bird and bear and hare and fish Suddenly Sheemies mule Caprichoso Roland thinks a beautiful name goes past galloping on thin air with his eyes as bright as firedims in the storms lumbre fuego Following him wearing a sombrera and riding a broom festooned with fluttering reapcharms comes Rhea of the Coos Ill get you my pretty she screams at the fleeing mule and then cackling she is gone zooming and brooming Roland plunges into the black and suddenly his breath is gone The world around him is noxious darkness the air seems to creep on his skin like a layer of bugs He is buffeted boxed to and fro by invisible fists then driven downward in a dive so violent he fears he will be smashed against the ground so fell Lord Perth Dead fields and deserted villages roll up out of the gloom he sees blasted trees that will give no shade  oh but all is shade here all is death here this is the edge of EndWorld where some dark day he will come and all is death here Gunslinger this is Thunderclap Thunderclap he says Here are the unbreathing the white faces The unbreathing The white faces  Yes He knows that somehow This is the place of slaughtered soldiers the cloven helm the rusty halberd from here come the pale warriors This is Thunderclap where clocks run backward and the graveyards vomit out their dead Ahead is a tree like a crooked clutching hand on its topmost branch a billybumbler has been impaled It should be dead but as the pink storm carries Roland past it raises its head and looks at him with inexpressible pain and weariness Oy it cries and then it too is gone and not to be remembered for many years Look ahead Roland  see your destiny Now suddenly he knows that voice  it is the voice of the Turtle He looks and sees a brilliant bluegold glow piercing the dirty darkness of Thunderclap Before he can do more than register it he breaks out of the darkness and into the light like something coming out of an egg a creature at last being born Light Let there be light the voice of the Turtle cries and Roland has to put his hands to his eyes and peek through his fingers to keep from being blinded Below him is a field of blood  or so he thinks then a boy of fourteen who has that day done his first real killing This is the blood that has flowed out of Thunderclap and threatens to drown our side of the world he thinks and it will not be for untold years that he will finally rediscover his time inside the ball and put this memory together with Eddies dream and tell his compadres as they sit in the turnpike breakdown lane at the end of the night that he was wrong that he had been fooled by the brilliance coming as it did so hard on the heels of Thunderclap s shadows It wasnt blood but roses  he tells Eddie Susannah and Jake Gunslinger look  look there Yes there it is a dusty grayblack pillar rearing on the horizon the Dark Tower the place where all Beams all lines of force converge In its spiraling windows he sees fitful electric blue fire and hears the cries of all those pent within he senses both the strength of the place and the wrongness of it he can feel how it is spooling error across everything softening the divisions between the worlds how its potential for mischief is growing stronger even as disease weakens its truth and coherence like a body afflicted with cancer this jutting arm of dark gray stone is the worlds great mystery and last awful riddle It is the Tower the Dark Tower rearing to the sky and as Roland rushes toward it in the pink storm he thinks I will enter you me and my friends if ka wills it so we will enter you and we will conquer the wrongness within you It may be years yet but I swear by bird and bear and hare and fish by all I love that  But now the sky fills with flaggy clouds which flow out of Thunderclap and the world begins to go dark the blue light from the Towers rising windows shines like mad eyes and Roland hears thousands of screamingwailing voices You will kill everything and everyone you love says the voice of the Turtle and now it is a cruel voice cruel and hard and still the Tower will be pent shut against you The gunslinger draws in all his breath and draws together all his force when he cries his answer to the Turtle he does so for all the generations of his blood NO IT WILL NOT STAND WHEN I COME HERE IN MY BODY IT WILL NOT STAND I SWEAR ON MY FATHER S NAME IT WILL NOT STAND Then die the voice says and Roland is hurled at the grayblack stone flank of the Tower to be smashed there like a bug against a rock But before that can happen   Cuthbert and Alain stood watching Roland with increasing concern He had the piece of Maerlyns Rainbow raised to his face cupped in his hands as a man might cup a ceremonial goblet before making a toast The drawstring bag lay crumpled on the dusty toes of his boots his cheeks and forehead were washed in a pink glow that neither boy liked It seemed alive somehow and hungry They thought as if with one mind I cant see his eyes Where are his eyes Roland Cuthbert repeated If were going to get out to Hanging Rock before theyre ready for us you have to put that thing away Roland made no move to lower the ball He muttered something under his breath later when Cuthbert and Alain had a chance to compare notes they both agreed it had been thunderclap Roland Alain asked stepping forward As gingerly as a surgeon slipping a scalpel into the body of a patient he slipped his right hand between the curve of the ball and Rolands bent studious face There was no response Alain pulled back and turned to Cuthbert Can you touch him Bert asked Alain shook his head Not at all Its like hes gone somewhere far away We have to wake him up Cuthberts voice was dustdry and shaky at the edges Vannay told us that if you wake a person from a deep hypnotic trance too suddenly he can go mad Alain said Remember I dont know if I dare   Roland stirred The pink sockets where his eyes had been seemed to grow His mouth flattened into the line of bitter determination they both knew well No It will not stand he cried in a voice that made gooseflesh ripple the skin of the other two boys that was not Rolands voice at all at least not as he was now that was the voice of a man No Alain said much later when Roland slept and he and Cuthbert  sat up before the campfire That was the voice of a king Now however the two of them only looked at their absent roaring friend paralyzed with fright When I come here in my body it will not stand I swear on my father s name IT WILL NOT STAND Then as Rolands unnaturally pink face contorted like the face of a man who confronts some unimaginable horror Cuthbert and Alain lunged forward It was no longer a question of perhaps destroying him in an effort to save him if they didnt do something the glass would kill him as they watched In the dooryard of the Bar K it had been Cuthbert who clipped Roland this time Alain did the honors administering a hard right to the center of the gunslingers forehead Roland tumbled backward the ball spilling out of his loosening hands and the terrible pink light leaving his face Cuthbert caught the boy and Alain caught the ball Its heavy pink glow was weirdly insistent beating at his eyes and pulling at his mind but Alain stuffed it resolutely into the drawstring bag again without looking at it and as he pulled the cord yanking the bags mouth shut he saw the pink light wink out as if it knew it had lost For the time being at least He turned back and winced at the sight of the bruise puffing up from the middle of Rolands brow Is he   Out cold Cuthbert said He better come to soon Cuthbert looked at him grimly with not a trace of his usual amiability Yes he said youre certainly right about that  Sheemie waited at the foot of the stairs which led down to the kitchen area shifting uneasily from foot to foot and waiting for sai Thorin to come back or to call him He didnt know how long shed been in the kitchen but it felt like forever He wanted her to come back and more than that  more than anything  he wanted her to bring Susansai with her Sheemie had a terrible feeling about this place and this day a feeling that darkened like the sky which was now all obscured with smoke in the west What was happening out there or if it had anything to do with the thundery sounds hed heard earlier Sheemie didnt know but he wanted to be out of here before the smokehazed sun went down and the real Demon Moon not its pallid dayghost rose in the sky One of the swinging doors between the corridor and the kitchen pushed open and Olive came hurrying out She was alone Shes in the pantry all right Olive said She raked her fingers through her graying hair I got that much out of those two pupuras but no more I knew it was going to be that way as soon as they started talking that stupid crunk of theirs There was no proper word for the dialect of the Mejis vaqueros but crunk served well enough among the Baronys higherborn citizens Olive knew both of the vaqs guarding the pantry in the vague way of a person who has once ridden a lot and passed gossip and weather with other Dropriders and she knew damned well these old boys could do better than crunk They had spoken it so they could pretend to misunderstand her and save both them and her the embarrassment of an outright refusal She had gone along with the deception for much the same reason although she could have responded with crunk of her own perfectly well  and called them some names their mothers never used  had she wanted I told them there were men upstairs she said and I thought maybe they meant to steal the silver I said I wanted the maloficios turned out And still they played dumb Nohabla sai Shit Shit Sheemie thought of calling them a couple of big old sonuvabitches and decided to keep silent She was pacing back and forth in front of him and throwing an occasional burning look at the closed kitchen doors At last she stopped in front of Sheemie again Turn out your pockets she said Lets see what you have for hopes and garlands Sheemie did as she asked producing a little pocketknife a gift from Stanley Ruiz and a halfeaten cookie from one From the other he brought out three ladyfinger firecrackers a bigbanger and a few sulfur matches Olives eyes gleamed when she saw these Listen to me Sheemie she said  Cuthbert patted Rolands face with no result Alain pushed him aside knelt and took the gunslingers hands He had never used the touch this way but had been told it was possible  that one could reach anothers mind in at least some cases Roland Roland wake up Please We need you At first there was nothing Then Roland stirred muttered and pulled his hands out of Alains In the moment before his eyes opened both of the other two boys were struck by the same fear of what they might see no eyes at all only raving pink light But they were Rolands eyes all right  those cool blue shooters eyes He struggled to gain his feet and failed the first time He held out his hands Cuthbert took one Alain the other As they pulled him up Bert saw a strange and frightening thing there were threads of white in Rolands hair There had been none that morning he would have sworn to it The morning had been a long time ago however How long was I out Roland touched the bruise in the center of his forehead with the tips of his fingers and winced Not long Alain said Five minutes maybe Roland Im sorry I hit you but I had to It was  I thought it was killing you Mayhap twas Is it safe Alain pointed wordlessly to the drawstring bag Good Its best one of you carry it for now I might be    He searched for the right word and when he found it a small wintry smile touched the comers of his mouth  tempted he finished Lets ride for Hanging Rock Weve got work yet to finish Roland   Cuthbert began Roland turned one hand on the horn of his horses saddle Cuthbert licked his lips and for a moment Alain didnt think he would be able to ask If you dont I will Alain thought    but Bert managed bringing the words out in a rush What did you see Much Roland said I saw much but most of it is already fading out of my mind the way dreams do when you wake up What I do remember Ill tell you as we ride You must know because it changes everything Were going back to Gilead but not for long Where after that Alain asked mounting West In search of the Dark Tower If we survive today that is Come on Lets take those tankers  The two vaqs were rolling smokes when there was a loud bang from upstairs They both jumped and looked at each other the tobacco from their worksinprogress sifting down to the floor in small brown flurries A woman shrieked The doors burst open It was the Mayors widow again this time accompanied by a maid The vaqs knew her well  Maria Tomas the daughter of an old compadre from the Piano Ranch The thieving bastards have set the place on fire Maria cried speaking to them in crunk Come and help Maria sai we have orders to guard   A putina locked in the pantry Maria shouted her eyes blazing Come ye stupid old donkey before the whole place catches Then ye can explain to Senor Lengyll why ye stood here using yer thumbs for fartcorks while Seafront burned down around yer ears Go on Olive snapped Are you cowards There were several smaller bangs as above them in the great parlor Sheemie set off the ladyfingers He used the same match to light the drapes The two viejos exchanged a glance Andelay  said the older of the two then looked back at Maria He no longer bothered with the crunk Watch this door he said Like a hawk she agreed The two old men bustled out one gripping the cords of his bolas the other pulling a long knife from the scabbard on his belt As soon as the women heard their footsteps on the stairs at the end of the hall Olive nodded to Maria and they crossed the room Maria threw the bolts Olive pulled the door open Susan came out at once looking from one to the other then smiling tentatively Maria gasped at the sight of her mistresss swelled face and the blood crusted around her nose Susan took Marias hand before the maid could touch her face and squeezed her fingers gently Do ye think Thorin would want me now she asked and then seemed to realize who her other rescuer was Olive  sai Thorin  Im sorry I didnt mean to be cruel But ye must believe that Roland him ye know as Will Dearborn would never   I know it well Olive said and theres no time for this now Come on She and Maria led Susan out of the kitchen away from the stairs ascending to the main house and toward the storage rooms at the far north end of the lower level In the drygoods storage room Olive told the two of them to wait She was gone for perhaps five minutes but to Susan and Maria it seemed an eternity When she came back Olive was wearing a wildly colored scrape much too big for her  it might have been her husbands but Susan thought it looked too big for the late Mayor as well Olive had tucked a piece of it into the side of her jeans to keep from stumbling over it Slung over her arm like blankets she had two more both smaller and lighter Put these on she said Its going to be cold Leaving the drygoods store they went down a narrow servants passageway toward the back courtyard There if they were fortunate and if Miguel was still unconscious Sheemie would be waiting for them with mounts Olive hoped with all her heart that they would be fortunate She wanted Susan safely away from Hambry before the sun went down And before the moon rose  Susans been taken prisoner Roland told the others as they rode west toward Hanging Rock Thats the first thing I saw in the glass He spoke with such an air of absence that Cuthbert almost reined up This wasnt the ardent lover of the last few months It was as if Roland had found a dream to ride through the pink air within the ball and part of him rode it still Or is it riding him Cuthbert wondered What Alain asked Susan taken How By whom Is she all right Taken by Jonas He hurt her some but not too badly Shell heal    and shell live Id turn around in a second if I thought her life was in any real danger Ahead of them appearing and disappearing in the dust like a mirage was Hanging Rock Cuthbert could see the sunlight pricking hazy sunstars on the tankers and he could see men A lot of them A lot of horses as well He patted the neck of his own mount then glanced across to make sure Alain had Lengylls machinegun He did Cuthbert reached around to the small of his back making sure of the slingshot It was there Also his deerskin ammunition bag which now contained a number of the bigbangers Sheemie had stolen as well as steel shot Hes using every ounce of his will to keep from going back anyway Cuthbert thought He found the realization comforting  sometimes Roland scared him There was something in him that went beyond steel Something like madness If it was there you were glad to have it on your side  but often enough you wished it wasnt there at all On anybodys side Where is she Alain asked Reynolds took her back to Seafront Shes locked in the pantry  or was locked there I cant say which exactly because    Roland paused thinking The ball sees far but sometimes it sees more Sometimes it sees a future thats already happening How can the future already be happening Alain asked I dont know and I dont think it was always that way I think its more to do with the world than Maerlyns Rainbow Time is strange now We know that dont we How things sometimes seem to  slip Its almost as if theres a thinny everywhere breaking things down But Susans safe I know that and thats enough for me Sheemie is going to help her  or is helping her Somehow Jonas missed Sheemie and he followed Susan all the way back Good for Sheemie Alain said and pumped his fist into the air Hurrah Then What about us Did you see us in this future No This part was all quick  I hardly snatched more than a glance before the ball took me away Flew me away it seemed But  I saw smoke on the horizon I remember that It could have been the smoke of burning tankers or the brush piled in front of Eyebolt or both I think were going to succeed Cuthbert was looking at his old friend in a queerly distraught way The young man so deeply in love that Bert had needed to knock him into the dust of the courtyard in order to wake him up to his responsibilities    where was that young man exactly What had changed him given him those disturbing strands of white hair If we survive whats ahead Cuthbert said watching the gunslinger closely shell meet us on the road Wont she Roland He saw the pain on Rolands face and now understood the lover was here but the ball had taken away his joy and left only grief That and some new purpose  yes Cuthbert felt it very well  which had yet to be stated I dont know Roland said I almost hope not because we can never be as we were What  This time Cuthbert did rein up Roland looked at him calmly enough but now there were tears in his eyes We are fools of ka the gunslinger said Ka like a wind Susan calls it He looked first at Cuthbert on his left then at Alain on his right The Tower is our ka mine especially But it isnt hers nor she mine No more is John Parson our ka Were not going toward his men to defeat him but only because theyre in our way He raised his hands then dropped them again as if to say What more do you need me to tell you There is no Tower Roland Cuthbert said patiently I dont know what you saw in that glass ball but there is no Tower Well as a symbol I suppose  like Arthurs Cup or the Cross of the manJesus  but not as a real thing a real building   Yes Roland said Its real They looked at him uncertainly and saw no doubt on his face Its real and our fathers know Beyond the dark land  I cant remember its name now its one of the things Ive lost  is EndWorld and in EndWorld stands the Dark Tower Its existence is the great secret our fathers keep its what has held them together as katet across all the years of the worlds decline When we return to Gilead  if we return and I now think we will  Ill tell them what Ive seen and theyll confirm what I say You saw all that in the glass Alain asked in an awehushed voice I saw much But not Susan Delgado Cuthbert said No When we finish with yonder men and she finishes with Mejis her part in our katet ends Inside the ball I was given a choice Susan and my life as her husband and father of the child she now carries  or the Tower Roland wiped his face with a shaking hand I would choose Susan in an instant if not for one thing the Tower is crumbling and if it falls everything we know will be swept away There will be chaos beyond our imagining We must go  and we will go Above his young and unlined cheeks below his young and unlined brow were the ancient killers eyes that Eddie Dean would first glimpse in the mirror of an airliners bathroom But now they swam with childish tears There was nothing childish in his voice however I choose the Tower I must Let her live a good life and long with someone else  she will in time As for me I choose the Tower  Susan mounted on Pylon which Sheemie had hastened to bring around to the rear courtyard after lighting the draperies of the great parlor on fire Olive Thorin rode one of the Barony geldings with Sheemie doublemounted behind her and holding onto Capis lead Maria opened the back gate wished them good luck and the three trotted out The sun was westering now but the wind had pulled away most of the smoke that had risen earlier Whatever had happened in the desert it was over now  or happening on some other layer of the same present time Roland be thee well Susan thought Illsee thee soon dear    as soon as I can Why are we going north she asked after half an hours silent riding Because Seacoast Roads best But   Hush Theyll find you gone and search the house first    if tasnt burned flat that is Not finding you there theyll send west along the Great Road She cast an eye on Susan that was not much like the dithery slightly confabulated Olive Thorin that folks in Hambry knew  or thought they knew If I know thats the direction youd choose so will others wed do well to avoid Susan was silent She was too confused to speak but Olive seemed to know what she was about and Susan was grateful for that By the time they get around to sniffing west itll be dark Tonight well stay in one of the seacliff caves five miles or so from here I grew up a fishermans daughter and I know all those caves none better The thought of the caves shed played in as a girl seemed to cheer her Tomorrow well cut west as you like Im afraid youre going to have a plump old widow as a chaperone for a bit Better get used to the idea Thees too good Susan said Ye should send Sheemie and I on alone sai And go back to what Why I cant even get two old trailhands on kitchenduty to follow my orders Fran Lengylls boss of the shootingmatch now and Ive no urge to wait and see how he does at it Nor if he decides hed be better off with me adjudged mad and put up safe in a haci with bars on the windows Or shall I stay to see how Hash Renfrew does as Mayor with his boots up on my tables Olive actually laughed Sai Im sorry We shall all be sorry later on Olive said sounding remarkably cheery about it For now the most important thing is to reach those caves unobserved It must seem that we vanished into thin air Hold up Olive checked her horse stood in the stirrups looked around to make sure of her position nodded then twisted in the saddle so she could speak to Sheemie Young man its time for ye to mount yer trusty mule and go back to Seafront If there are riders coming after us ye must turn em aside with a few wellchosen words Willee do that Sheemie looked stricken I dont have any wellchosen words sai Thorin so I dont I hardly have any words at all Nonsense Olive said and kissed Sheemies forehead Go back at a goodish trot Ifee spy no one coming after us by the time the sun touches the hills then turn north again and follow We shall wait for ye by the signpost Do ye know where I mean Sheemie thought he did although it marked the outmost northern boundary of his little patch of geography The red un With the sombrero on it and the arrow pointing back for town The very one Ye wont get that far until after dark but therell be plenty of moonlight tonight If ye dont come right away well wait But ye must go back and shift any men that might be chasing us off our track Do ye understand Sheemie did He slid off Olives horse clucked Caprichoso forward and climbed on board wincing as the place the mule had bitten came down So itll be Olivesai Good Sheemie Good Offee go then Sheemie Susan said Come to me a moment please He did holding his hat in front of him and looking up at her worshipfully Susan bent and kissed him not on the forehead but firmly on the mouth Sheemie came close to fainting Thankeesai Susan said For everything Sheemie nodded When he spoke he could manage nothing above a whisper  Twas only ka he said I know that but I love you Susansai Go well Ill see you soon I look forward to it But there was no soon and no later for them either Sheemie took one look back as he rode his mule south and waved Susan lifted her own hand in return It was the last Sheemie ever saw of her and in many ways that was a blessing  Latigo had set pickets a mile out from Hanging Rock but the blond boy Roland Cuthbert and Alain encountered as they closed in on the tankers looked confused and unsure of himself no danger to anyone He had scurvyblossoms around his mouth and nose suggesting that the men Farson had sent on this duty had ridden hard and fast with little in the way of fresh supplies When Cuthbert gave the Good Mans sigul  hands clasped to the chest left above right then both held out to the person being greeted  the blond picket did the same and with a grateful smile What spin and raree back there he asked speaking with a strong InWorld accent  to Roland the boy sounded like a Nordite Three boys who killed a couple of big bugs and then hied for the hills Cuthbert replied He was an eerily good mimic and gave the boy back his own accent faultlessly I here were a tight It be over now but they did fight fearful What   No time Roland said brusquely We have dispatches He crossed his hands on his chest then held them out Hile Farson Good Man the blond returned smartly He gave back the salute with a smile that said he would have asked Cuthbert where he was from and who he was related to if there had been more time Then they were past him and inside Latigos perimeter As easy as that Remember that its hitandrun Roland said Slow down for nothing What we dont get must be left  therell be no second pass Gods dont even suggest such a thing Cuthbert said but he was smiling He pulled his sling out of its rudimentary holster and tested its elastic draw with a thumb Then he licked the thumb and hoisted it to the wind Not much problem there if they came in as they were the wind was strong but at their backs Alain unslung Lengylls machinegun looked at it doubtfully then yanked back the slidecock I dont know about this Roland Its loaded and I think I see how to use it but   Then use it Roland said The three of them were picking up speed now the hooves of their horses drumming against the hardpan The wind gusted belling the fronts of their scrapes This is the sort of work it was meant for If it jams drop it and use your revolver Are you ready Yes Roland Bert Aye Cuthbert said in a wildly exaggerated Hambry accent so I am so I am Ahead of them dust puffed as groups of riders passed before and behind the tankers readying the column for departure Men on foot looked around at the oncomers curiously but with a fatal lack of alarm Roland drew both revolvers Gilead he cried Hile Gilead He spurred Rusher to a gallop The other two boys did the same Cuthbert was in the middle again sitting on his reins slingshot in hand lucifer matches radiating out of his tightly pressed lips The gunslingers rode down on Hanging Rock like furies  Twenty minutes after sending Sheemie back south Susan and Olive came around a sharp bend and found themselves face to face with three mounted men in the road In the lateslanting sun she saw that the one in the middle had a blue coffin tattooed on his hand It was Reynolds Susans heart sank The one on Reynoldss left  he wore a stained white drovers hat and had a lazily cocked eye  she didnt know but the one on the right who looked like a stonyhearted preacher was Laslo Rimer It was Rimer that Reynolds glanced at after smiling at Susan Why Las and I couldnt even get us a drink to send his late brother the Chancellor of Whatever You Want and the Minister of Thank You Very Much on with a word Reynolds said We hadnt hardly hit town before we got persuaded out here I wasnt going to go but    damn That old ladys something Could talk a corpse into giving a blowjob if youll pardon the crudity I think your aunt may have lost a wheel or two off her cart though sai Delgado She   Your friends are dead Susan told him Reynolds paused shrugged Well now Maybe si and maybe no Me I think Ive decided to travel on without em even if they aint But I might hang around here one more night This Reaping business    Ive heard so much about the way folks do it in the Outers Specially the bonfire part The man with the cocked eye laughed phlegmily Let us pass Olive said This girl has done nothing and neither have I She helped Dearborn escape Rimer said him who murdered your own husband and my brother I wouldnt call that nothing The gods may restore Kimba Rimer in the clearing Olive said but the truth is he looted half of this towns treasury and what he didnt give over to John Farson he kept for himself Rimer recoiled as if slapped Ye didnt know I knew Laslo Id be angry at how little any of ye thought of me  except why would I want to be thought of by the likes of you anyway I knew enough to make me sick leave it at that I know that the man youre sitting beside   Shut up Rimer muttered   was likely the one who cut yer brothers black heart open sai Reynolds was seen that early morning in that wing so Ive been told   Shut up you cunt   and so I believe Better do as he says sai and hold your tongue Reynolds said Some of the lazy good humor had left his face Susan thought He doesnt like people knowing what he did Not even when hes the one on top and what they know cant hurt him And hes less without Jonas A lot less He knows it too Let us pass Olive said No sai I cant do that Ill help ye then shall I Her hand had crept beneath the outrageously large serape during the palaver and now she brought out a huge and ancient pistola its handles of yellowed ivory its filigreed barrel of old tarnished silver On top was a brass powderandspark Olive had no business even drawing the thing  it caught on her serape and she had to fight it free She had no business cocking it either a process that took both thumbs and two tries But the three men were utterly flummoxed by the sight of the elderly blunderbuss in her hands Reynolds as much as the other two he sat his horse with his jaw hanging slack Jonas would have wept Get her a cracked old voice shrieked from behind the men blocking the road Whats wrong with ye ye stupid culls GET HER Reynolds started at that and went for his gun He was fast but he had given Olive too much of a headstart and was beaten beaten cold Even as he cleared leather with the barrel of his revolver the Mayors widow held the old gun out in both hands and squinching her eyes shut like a little girl who is forced to eat something nasty pulled the trigger The spark flashed but the damp powder only made a weary floop sound and disappeared in a puff of blue smoke The ball  big enough to have taken Clay Reynoldss head off from the nose on up had it fired  stayed in the barrel In the next instant his own gun roared in his fist Olives horse reared whinnying Olive went off the gelding head over boots with a black hole in the orange stripe of her serape  the stripe which lay above her heart Susan heard herself screaming The sound seemed to come from very far away She might have gone on for some time but then she heard the clop of approaching pony hooves from behind the men in the road and knew Even before the man with the lazy eye moved aside to show her she knew and her screams stopped The gallopedout pony that had brought the witch back to Hambry had been replaced by a fresh one but it was the same black cart the same golden cabalistic symbols the same driver Rhea sat with the reins in her claws her head ticking from side to side like the head of a rusty old robot grinning at Susan without humor Grinning as a corpse grins Hello my little sweeting she said calling her as she had all those months ago on the night Susan had come to her hut to be proved honest On the night Susan had come running most of the way out of simple high spirits Beneath the light of the Kissing Moon she had come her blood high from the exercise her skin flushed she had been singing Careless Love Yer pallies and screwbuddies have taken my ball ye ken Rhea said clucking the pony to a stop a few paces ahead of the riders Even Reynolds looked down on her with uneasiness Took my lovely glam thats what those bad boys did Those bad bad boys But it showed me much while yet I had it aye It sees far and in more ways than one Much of it Ive forgot  but not which way yed come my sweeting Not which way that precious old dead bitch laying yonder on the road would bring ye And now ye must go to town Her grin widened became something unspeakable Its time for the fair ye ken Let me go Susan said Let me go if yed not answer to Roland of Gilead Rhea ignored her and spoke to Reynolds Bind her hands before her and stand her in the back of the cart Theres people thatll want to see her A good look is what theyll want and a good look is just what theyll have If her aunts done a proper job therell be a lot of them in town Get her up now and be smart about it  Alain had time for one clear thought We could have gone around them  if what Roland said is true then only the wizards glass matters and we have that We could have gone around them Except of course that was impossible A hundred generations of gunslinger blood argued against it Tower or no Tower the thieves must not be allowed to have their prize Not if they could be stopped Alain leaned forward and spoke directly into his horses ear Jig or rear when I start shooting and Ill knock your fucking brains out Roland led them in outracing the other two on his stronger horse The clot of men nearest by  five or six mounted a dozen or more on foot and examining a pair of the oxen which had dragged the tankers out here  gazed at him stupidly until he began to fire and then they scattered like quail He got every one of the riders their horses fled in a widening fan trailing their reins and in one case a dead soldier Somewhere someone was shouting Harriers Harriers Mount up you fools Alain Roland screamed as they bore down In front of the tankers a double handful of riders and armed men were coming together  milling together  in a clumsy defensive line Now Now Alain raised the machinegun seated its rusty wire stock in the hollow of his shoulder and remembered what little he knew about rapidfire weapons aim low swing fast and smooth He touched the trigger and the speedshooter bellowed into the dusty air recoiling against his shoulder in a series of rapid thuds shooting bright fire from the end of its perforated barrel Alain raked it from left to right running the sight above the scattering shouting defenders and across the high steel hides of the tankers The third tanker actually blew up on its own The sound it made was like no explosion Alain had ever heard a guttural muscular ripping sound accompanied by a brilliant flash of orangered fire The steel shell rose in two halves One of these spun thirty yards through the air and landed on the desert floor in a furiously burning hulk the other rose straight up into a column of greasy black smoke A burning wooden wheel spun across the sky like a plate and came back down trailing sparks and burning splinters Men fled screaming  some on foot others laid flat along the necks of their nags their eyes wide and panicky When Alain reached the end of the line of tankers he reversed the track of the muzzle The machinegun was hot in his hands now but he kept his finger pressed to the trigger In this world you had to use what you could while it still worked Beneath him his horse ran on as if it had understood every word Alain had whispered in its ear Another I want another But before he could blow another tanker the gun ceased its chatter  perhaps jammed probably empty Alain threw it aside and drew his revolver From beside him there came the thuppp of Cuthberts slingshot audible even over the cries of the men the hoofbeats of the horses the whoosh of the burning tanker Alain saw a sputtering bigbang arc into the sky and come down exactly where Cuthbert had aimed in the oil puddling around the wooden wheels of a tanker marked sunoco For a moment Alain could clearly see the line of nine or a dozen holes in the tankers bright side  holes he had put there with sai Lengylls speedshooter  and then there was a crack and a flash as the bigbang exploded A moment later the holes running along the bright flank of the tanker began to shimmer The oil beneath them was on fire Get out a man in a faded campaign hat yelled Shes gointer blow They re all going to b   Alain shot him exploding the side of his face and knocking him out of one old sprung boot A moment later the second tanker blew up One burning steel panel shot out sidewards landed in the growing puddle of crude oil beneath a third tanker and then that one exploded as well Black smoke rose in the air like the fumes of a funeral pyre it darkened the day and drew an oily veil across the sun  All six of Parsons chief lieutenants had been carefully described to Roland  to all fourteen gunslingers in training  and he recognized the man running for the remuda at once George Latigo Roland could have shot him as he ran but that ironically would have made possible a getaway that was cleaner than he wanted Instead he shot the man who ran to meet him Latigo wheeled on the heels of his boots and stared at Roland with blazing hatefilled eyes Then he ran again hiling another man shouting for the riders who were huddled together beyond the burning zone Two more tankers exploded whamming at Rolands eardrums with dull iron fists seeming to suck the air back from his lungs like a riptide The plan had been for Alain to perforate the tankers and for Cuthbert to then shoot in a steady arcing stream of bigbangers lighting the spilling oil The one bigbanger he actually shot seemed to confirm that the plan had been feasible but it was the last slingshotwork Cuthbert did that day The ease with which the gunslingers had gotten inside the enemys perimeter and the confusion which greeted their original charge could have been chalked up to inexperience and exhaustion but the placing of the tankers had been Latigos mistake and his alone He had drawn them tight without even thinking about it and now they blew tight one after another Once the conflagration began there was no chance of stopping it Even before Roland raised his left arm and circled it in the air signalling for Alain and Cuthbert to break off the work was done Latigos encampment was an oily inferno and John Farsons plans for a motorized assault were so much black smoke being tattered apart by the fin de ano wind Ride Roland screamed Ride ride ride They spurred west toward Eyebolt Canyon As they went Roland felt a single bullet drone past his left ear It was so far as he knew the only shot fired at any of them during the assault on the tankers  Latigo was in an ecstasy of fury a perfect brainbursting rage and that was probably merciful  it kept him from thinking of what the Good Man would do when he learned of this fiasco For the time being all Latigo cared about was catching the men who had ambushed him  if an ambush in desert country was even possible Men No The boys who had done this Latigo knew who they were all right he didnt know how they had gotten out here but he knew who they were and their run would stop right here east of the woods and rising hills Hendricks he bawled Hendricks had at least managed to hold his men  half a dozen of them all mounted  near the remuda Hendricks to me As Hendricks rode toward him Latigo spun the other way and saw a huddle of men standing and watching the burning tankers Their gaping mouths and stupid young sheep faces made him feel like screaming and dancing up and down but he refused to give in to that He held a narrow beam of concentration one aimed directly at the raiders who must not under any circumstances be allowed to escape You he shouted at the men One of them turned the others did not Latigo strode to them drawing his pistol as he went He slapped it into the hand of the man who had turned toward the sound of his voice and pointed at random to one of those who had not Shoot that fool Dazed his face that of a man who believes he is dreaming the soldier raised the pistol and shot the man to whom Latigo had pointed That unlucky fellow went down in a heap of knees and elbows and twitching hands The others turned Good Latigo said taking his gun back Sir Hendricks cried I see them sir I have the enemy in clearview Two more tankers exploded A few whickering shards of steel flew in their direction Some of the men ducked Latigo did not so much as twitch Nor did Hendricks A good man Thank God for at least one such in this nightmare Shall I hie after them sir  Ill take your men and hie after them myself Hendricks Mount these hossguts before us He swept an arm at the standing men whose doltish attention had been diverted from the burning tankers to their dead comrade Pull in as many others as you can Do you have a bugler Yes sir Raines sir Hendricks looked around beckoned and a pimply scaredlooking boy rode forward A dented bugle on a frayed strap hung askew on the front of his shirt Raines Latigo said youre with Hendricks Yes sir Get as many men as you can Hendricks but dont linger over the job Theyre headed for that canyon and I believe someone told me its a box If so were going to turn it into a shooting gallery Hendrickss lips spread in a twisted grin Yes sir Behind them the tankers continued to explode  Roland glanced back and was astonished by the size of the black smoky column rising into the air Ahead he could clearly see the brush blocking most of the canyons mouth And although the wind was blowing the wrong way he could now hear the maddening mosquitowhine of the thinny He patted the air with his outstretched hands signalling for Cuthbert and Alain to slow down While they were both still looking at him he took off his bandanna whipped it into a rope and tied it so it would cover his ears They copied him It was better than nothing The gunslingers continued west their shadows now running out behind them as long as gantries on the desert floor Looking back Roland could see two groups of riders streaming in pursuit Latigo was at the head of the first Roland thought and he was deliberately holding his riders back a little so that the two groups could merge and attack together Good he thought The three of them rode toward Eyebolt in a tight line continuing to hold their own horses in allowing their pursuers to close the distance Every now and then another thud smote the air and shivered through the ground as one of the remaining tankers blew up Roland was amazed at how easy it had been  even after the battle with Jonas and Lengyll which should have put the men out here on their mettle it had been easy It made him think of a Reaptide long ago he and Cuthbert surely no more than seven years old running along a line of stuffyguys with sticks knocking them over one after the other bangbangbangetybang The sound of the thinny was warbling its way into his brain in spite of the bandanna over his ears making his eyes water Behind him he could hear the whoops and shouts of the pursuing men It delighted him Latigos men had counted the odds  two dozen against three with many more of their own force riding hard to join the battle  and their peckers were up once more Roland faced front and pointed Rusher at the slit in the brush marking the entrance to Eyebolt Canyon  Hendricks fell in beside Latigo breathing hard cheeks glaring with color Sir Beg to report Then do it I have twenty men and there are praps three times that number riding hard to join us Latigo ignored all of this His eyes were bright blue flecks of ice Under his mustache was a small greedy smile Rodney he said speaking Hendrickss first name almost with the caress of a lover Sir I think theyre going in Rodney Yes    look Im sure of it Two more minutes and itll be too late for them to turn back He raised his gun laid the muzzle across his forearm and threw a shot at the three riders ahead mostly in exuberance Yes sir very good sir Hendricks turned and waved viciously for his men to close up close up  Dismount Roland shouted when they reached the line of tangled brush It had a smell that was at once dry and oily like a fire waiting to happen He didnt know if their failure to ride their horses into the canyon would put Latigos wind up or not and he didnt care These were good mounts fine Gilead stock and over these last months Rusher had become his friend He would not take him or any of the horses into the canyon where they would be caught between the fire and the thinny The boys were off the horses in a flash Alain pulling the drawstring bag free of his saddlehorn and slinging it over one shoulder Cuthberts and Alains horses ran at once whinnying parallel to the brush but Rusher lingered for a moment looking at Roland Go on Roland slapped him on the flank Run Rusher ran tail streaming out behind him Cuthbert and Alain slipped through the break in the brush Roland followed glancing down to make sure that the powdertrail was still there It was and still dry  there had been not a drop of rain since the day theyd laid it Cuthbert he said Matches Cuthbert gave him some He was grinning so hard it was a wonder they hadnt fallen out of his mouth We warmed up their day didnt we Roland Aye We did indeed Roland said grinning himself Go on now Back to that chimneycut Let me do it Cuthbert said Please Roland you go with Alain and let me stay Im a firebug at heart always have been No Roland said This part of its mine Dont argue with me Go on And tell Alain to mind the wizards glass no matter what Cuthbert looked at him for a moment longer then nodded Dont wait too long I wont May your luck rise Roland May yours rise twice Cuthbert hurried away boots rattling on the loose stone which carpeted the floor of the canyon He reached Alain who lifted a hand to Roland Roland nodded back then ducked as a bullet snapped close enough to his temple to flick his hatbrim He crouched to the left of the opening in the brush and peered around the wind now striking full in his face Latigos men were closing rapidly More rapidly than he had expected If the wind blew out the lucifers  Never mind the ifs Hold on Roland   hold on wait for them   He held on hunkering with an unlit match in each hand now peering out through a tangle of interlaced branches The smell of mesquite was strong in his nostrils Not far behind it was the reek of burning oil The drone of the thinny filled his head making him feel dizzy a stranger to himself He thought of how it had been inside the pink storm flying through the air  how he had been snatched away from his vision of Susan Thank God for Sheemie he thought distantly Hell make sure she finishes the day someplace safe But the craven whine of the thinny seemed somehow to mock him to ask him if there had been more to see Now Latigo and his men were crossing the last three hundred yards to the canyons mouth at a fullout gallop the ones behind closing up fast It would be hard for the ones riding point to stop suddenly without the risk of being ridden down It was time Roland stuck one of the lucifers between his front teeth and raked it forward It lit spilling one hot and sour spark onto the wet bed of his tongue Before the lucifers head could bum away Roland touched it to the powder in the trench It lit at once running left beneath the north end of the brush in a bright yellow thread He lunged across the opening  which might be wide enough for two horses running flank to flank  with the second lucifer already poised behind his teeth He struck it as soon as he was somewhat blocked from the wind dropped it into the powder heard the splutterhiss then turned and ran  Mother and father was Rolands first shocked thought  memory so deep and unexpected it was like a slap At Lake Saroni When had they gone there to beautiful Lake Saroni in the northern part of Gilead Barony That Roland couldnt remember He knew only that he had been very small and that there had been a beautiful stretch of sandy beach for him to play on perfect for an aspiring young castlebuilder such as he That was what he had been doing on one day of their vacation was it a vacation did my parents once upon a time actually take a vacation trip and he had looked up something  maybe only the cries of the birds circling over the lake  had made him look up and there were his mother and father Steven and Gabrielle Deschain at the waters edge standing with their backs to him and their arms around each others waists looking out at blue water beneath a blue summer sky How his heart had filled with love for them How infinite was love twining in and out of hope and memory like a braid with three strong strands so much the Bright Tower of every humans life and soul It wasnt love he felt now however but terror The figures standing before him as he ran back to where the canyon ended where the rational part of the canyon ended werent Steven of Gilead and Gabrielle of Arten but his mollies Cuthbert and Alain They didnt have their arms around each others waists either but their hands were clasped like the hands of fairytale children lost in a threatening fairytale wood Birds circled but they were vultures not gulls and the shimmering misttopped stuff before the two boys wasnt water It was the thinny and as Roland watched Cuthbert and Alain began to walk toward it Stop he screamed For your fathers sakes stop They did not stop They walked handinhand toward the whiteedged hem of the smoky green shimmer The thinny whined its pleasure murmured endearments promised rewards It baked the nerves numb and picked at the brain There was no time to reach them so Roland did the only thing he could think of raised one of his guns and fired it over their heads The report was a hammerblow in the canyons enclosure and for a moment the ricochet whine was louder than that of the thinny The two boys stopped only inches from its sick shimmer Roland kept expecting it to reach out and grab them as it had grabbed the lowflying bird when they had been here on the night of the Peddlers Moon He triggered two more shots into the air the reports hitting the walls and rolling back Gunslingers he cried To me To me It was Alain who turned toward him first his dazed eyes seeming to float in his duststreaked face Cuthbert continued forward another step the tips of his boots disappearing in the greenishsilver froth at the edge of the thinny the whingeing grumble of the thing rose half a note as if in anticipation and then Alain yanked him back by the tugstring of his sombrero Cuthbert tripped over a goodsized chunk of fallen rock and landed hard When he looked up his eyes had cleared Gods he murmured and as he scrambled to his feet Roland saw that the toes of his boots were gone clipped off neatly as if with a pair of gardening shears His great toes stuck out Roland he gasped as he and Alain stumbled toward him Roland we were almost gone It talks Yes Ive heard it Come on Theres no time He led them to the notch in the canyon wall praying that they could get up quick enough to avoid being riddled with bullets  as they certainly would be if Latigo arrived before they could get up at least part of the way A smell acrid and bitter began to fill the air  an odor like boiling juniper berries And the first tendrils of whitishgray smoke drifted past them Cuthbert you first Alain you next Ill come last Climb fast boys Climb for your lives  Latigos men poured through the slot in the wall of brush like water pouring into a funnel gradually widening the gap as they came The bottom layer of the dead vegetation was already on fire but in their excitement none of them saw these first low flames or marked them if they did The pungent smoke also went unnoticed their noses had been deadened by the colossal stench of the burning oil Latigo himself in the lead with Hendricks close behind had only one thought two words that pounded at his brain in a kind of vicious triumph Box canyon Box canyon Box canyon Yet something began to intrude on this mantra as he galloped deeper into Eyebolt his horses hooves clattering nimbly through the scree of rocks and bones whitish piles of cowskulls and ribcages This was a kind of low buzzing a maddening slobbering whine insectile and insistent It made his eyes water Yet strong as the sound was if it was a sound it almost seemed to be coming from inside him he pushed it aside holding onto his mantra box canyon box canyon got em in a box canyon instead He would have to face Walter when this was over perhaps Farson himself and he had no idea what his punishment would be for losing the tankers  but all that was for later Now he wanted only to kill these interfering bastards Up ahead the canyon took a jog to the north They would be beyond that point and probably not far beyond either Backed up against the canyons final wall trying to squeeze themselves behind what fallen rocks there might be Latigo would mass what guns he had and drive them out into the open with ricochets They would probably come with their hands up hoping for mercy They would hope in vain After what theyd done the trouble theyd caused  As Latigo rode around the jog in the canyons wall already levelling his pistol his horse screamed  like a woman it screamed  and reared beneath him Latigo caught the saddlehorn and managed to stay up but the horses rear hooves slid sideways in the scree and the animal went down Latigo let go of the horn and threw himself clear already aware that the sound which had been creeping into his ears was suddenly ten times stronger buzzing loud enough to make his eyeballs pulse in their sockets loud enough to make his balls tingle unpleasantly loud enough to blot out the mantra which had been beating so insistently in his head The insistence of the thinny was far far greater than any George Latigo could have managed Horses flashed around him as he landed in a kind of sprawling squat horses that were shoved forward willynilly by the oncoming press from behind by riders that squeezed through the gap in pairs then trios as the hole in the brush now burning all along its length widened and then spread out again once they were past the bottleneck none of them clearly realizing that the entire canyon was a bottleneck Latigo got a confused glimpse of black tails and gray forelegs and dappled fetlocks he saw chaps and jeans and boots jammed into stirrups He tried to get up and a horseshoe clanged against the back of his skull His hat saved him from unconsciousness but he went heavily to his knees with his head down like a man who means to pray his vision full of stars and the back of his neck instantly soaked with blood from the gash the passing hoof had opened in his scalp Now he heard more screaming horses Screaming men as well He got up again coughing out the dust raised by the passing horses such acrid dust too it clawed his throat like smoke and saw Hendricks trying to spur his horse south and east against the oncoming tide of riders He couldnt do it The rear third of the canyon was some sort of swamp filled with greenish steaming water and there must be quicksand beneath it because Hendrickss horse seemed stuck It screamed again and tried to rear Its hindquarters slewed sideways Hendricks crashed his boots into the animals sides again and again attempting to get it in motion but the horse didnt  or couldnt  move That hungry buzzing sound filled Latigos ears and seemed to fill the world Back Turn back He tried to scream the words but they came out in what was little more than a croak Still the riders pounded past him raising dust that was too thick to be only dust Latigo pulled in breath so he could scream louder  they had to go back something was dreadfully wrong in Eyebolt Canyon  and hacked it out without saying anything Screaming horses Reeking smoke And everywhere filling the world like lunacy that whining whingeing cringing buzz Hendrickss horse went down eyes rolling bitparted teeth snapping at the smoky air and splattering curds of foam from its lips Hendricks fell into the steaming stagnant water and it wasnt water at all It came alive somehow as he struck it grew green hands and a green shifty mouth pawed his cheek and melted away the flesh pawed his nose and tore it off pawed at his eyes and stripped them from their sockets It pulled Hendricks under but before it did Latigo saw his denuded jawbone a bloody piston to drive his screaming teeth Other men saw and tried to wheel away from the green trap Those who managed to do so in time were broadsided by the next wave of men  some of whom were incredibly still yipping or bellowing fullthroated battle cries More horses and riders were driven into the green shimmer which accepted them eagerly Latigo standing stunned and bleeding like a man in the middle of a stampede which was exactly what he was saw the soldier to whom he had given his gun This fellow who had obeyed Latigos order and shot one of his compadres in order to awaken the rest of them threw himself from his saddle howling and crawled back from the edge of the green stuff even as his horse plunged in He tried to get to his feet saw two riders bearing down on him and clapped his hands across his face A moment later he was ridden down The shrieks of the wounded and dying echoed in the smoky canyon but Latigo hardly heard them What he heard mostly was that buzzing a sound that was almost a voice Inviting him to jump in To end it here Why not It was over wasnt it All over He struggled away instead and was now able to make some headway the stream of riders packing its way into the canyon was easing Some of the riders fifty or sixty yards back from the jog had even been able to turn their horses But these were ghostly and confused in the thickening smoke The cunning bastards have set the brush on fire behind us Gods of heaven gods of earth I think we re trapped in here He could give no commands  every time he drew in breath to try he coughed it wordlessly back out again  but he was able to grab a passing rider who looked all of seventeen and yank him out of his saddle The boy went down headfirst and smashed his brow open on a jutting chunk of rock Latigo was mounted in his place before the kids feet had stopped twitching He jerked the horses head around and spurred for the front of the canyon but the smoke thickened to a choking white cloud before he got more than twenty yards The wind was driving it this way Latigo could make out  barely  the shifting orange glare of the burning brush at the desert end He wheeled his new horse back the way it had come More horses loomed out of the fog Latigo crashed into one of them and was thrown for the second time in five minutes He landed on his knees scrambled to his feet and staggered back downwind coughing and retching eyes red and streaming It was a little better beyond the canyons northward jog but wouldnt be for much longer The edge of the thinny was a tangle of milling horses many with broken legs and crawling shrieking men Latigo saw several hats floating on the greenish surface of the whining organism that filled the back of the canyon he saw boots he saw wristlets he saw neckerchiefs he saw the bugleboys dented instrument still trailing its frayed strap Come in the green shimmer invited and Latigo found its buzz strangely attractive  intimate almost Come in and visit squat and hunker be at rest be at peace be at one Latigo raised his gun meaning to shoot it He didnt believe it could be killed but he would remember the face of his father and go down shooting all the same Except he didnt The gun dropped from his relaxing fingers and he walked forward  others around him were now doing the same  into the thinny The buzzing rose and rose filling his ears until there was nothing else Nothing elseat all  They saw it all from the notch where Roland and his friends had stopped in a strungout line about twenty feet below the top They saw the screaming confusion the panicky milling the men who were trampled the men and horses that were driven into the thinny  and the men who at the end walked willingly into it Cuthbert was closest to the top of the canyons wall then Alain then Roland standing on a sixinch shelf of rock and holding an outcrop just above him From their vantagepoint they could see what the men struggling in their smoky hell below them could not that the thinny was growing reaching out crawling eagerly toward them like an incoming tide Roland his battlelust slaked did not want to watch what was happening below but he couldnt turn away The whine of the thinny  cowardly and triumphant at the same time happy and sad at the same time lost and found at the same time  held him like sweet sticky ropes He hung where he was hypnotized as did his friends above him even when the smoke began to rise and its pungent tang made him cough dryly Men shrieked their lives away in the thickening smoke below They struggled in it like phantoms They faded as the fog thickened climbing the canyon walls like water Horses whinnied desperately from beneath that acrid white death The wind swirled its surface in prankish whirlpools The thinny buzzed and above where it lay the surface of the smoke was stained a mystic shade of palest green Then at long last John Farsons men screamed no more We killed them Roland thought with a kind of sick and fascinated horror Then No not we I I killed them How long he might have stayed there Roland didnt know  perhaps until the rising smoke engulfed him as well but then Cuthbert who had begun to climb again called down three words from above him called down in a tone of surprise and dismay Roland The moon Roland looked up startled and saw that the sky had darkened to a velvety purple His friend was outlined against it and looking east his face stained feverorange with the light of the rising moon Yes orange the thinny buzzed inside his head Laughed inside his head Orange as twas when it rose on the night you came out here to see me and count me Orange like afire Orange like a bonfire How can it be almost dark he cried inside himself but he knew  yes he knew very well Time had slipped back together that was all like layers of ground embracing once more after the argument of an earthquake Twilight had come Moonrise had come Terror struck Roland like a closed fist aimed at the heart making him jerk backward on the small ledge hed found He groped for the hornshaped outcrop above him but that act of rebalancing was far away most of him was inside the pink storm again before he had been snatched away and shown half the cosmos Perhaps the wizards glass had only shown him what stood worlds far away in order to keep from showing him what might soon befall so close to home Id turn around if I thought her life was in any real danger he had said In a second And if the ball knew that If it couldnt lie might it not misdirect Might it not take him away and show him a dark land a darker tower And it had shown him something else something that recurred to him only now a scrawny man in farmers overalls who had said   what Not quite what hed thought not what he had been used to hearing all his life not Life for you and life for your crop but   Death he whispered to the stones surrounding him Death for you life for my crop Charyou tree Thats what he said Charyou tree Come Reap Orange gunslinger a cracked old voice laughed inside his head The voice of the Coos The color of bonfires Charyou tree fin de ano these are the old ways of which only the stuffyguys with their red hands remain    until tonight Tonight the old ways are refreshed as the old ways must be from time to time Charyou tree you damned babby Charyou tree tonight you pay for my sweet Ermot Tonight you pay for all Come Reap Climb he screamed reaching up and slapping Alains behind Climb climb For your fathers sake climb Roland what   Alains voice was dazed but he did begin to climb going from handhold to handhold and rattling small pebbles down into Rolands upturned face Squinting against their fall Roland reached and swatted Als bottom again driving him like a horse Climb gods damn you he cried It maynt be too late even now But he knew better Demon Moon had risen he had seen its orange light shining on Cuthberts face like delirium arid he knew better In his head the lunatic buzz of the thinny that rotting sore eating through the flesh of reality joined with the lunatic laughter of the witch and he knew better Death for you life for the crop Charyou tree Oh Susan   Nothing was clear to Susan until she saw the man with the long red hair and the straw hat which did not quite obscure his lambslaughterers eyes the man with the cornshucks in his hands He was the first just a farmer she had glimpsed him in the Lower Market she thought had even nodded to him as countryfolk do and he back to her standing by himself not far from the place where Silk Ranch Road and the Great Road intersected standing in the light of the rising moon Until they came upon him nothing was clear after he hurled his bundle of cornshucks at her as she passed standing in the slowly rolling cart with her hands bound in front of her and her head lowered and a rope around her neck everything was clear Charyou tree  he called almost sweetly uttering words of the Old People she hadnt heard since her childhood words that meant Come Reap    and something else as well Something hidden something secret something to do with that root word char that word which meant only death As the dried shucks fluttered around her boots she understood the secret very well understood also that there would be no baby for her no wedding for her in the fairydistant land of Gilead no hall in which she and Roland would be joined and then saluted beneath the electric lights no husband no more nights of sweet love all that was over The world had moved on and all that was over done before fairly begun She knew that she had been put in the back of the cart stood in the back of the cart and that the surviving Coffin Hunter had looped a noose around her neck Dont try to sit he had said sounding almost apologetic I have no desire to choke you girly If the wagon bumps and you fall Ill try to keep the knot loose but if you try to sit Ill have to give you a pinching Her orders He nodded to Rhea who sat erect on the seat of the cart the reins in her warped hands Shes in charge now And so she had been so as they neared town she still was Whatever the possession of her glam had done to her body whatever the loss of it had done to her mind it had not broken her power that seemed to have increased if anything as if shed found some other source from which she could feed at least for awhile Men who could have broken her over one knee like a stick of kindling followed her commands as unquestioningly as children There were more and more men as that Reaping afternoon wound its shallow course to night half a dozen ahead of the cart riding with Rimer and the man with the cocked eye a full dozen riding behind it with Reynolds the rope leading to her neck wound around his tattooed hand at their head She didnt know who these men were or how they had been summoned Rhea had taken this rapidly increasing party north a little farther then turned southwest on the old Silk Ranch Road which wound back toward town On the eastern edge of Hambry it rejoined the Great Road Even in her dazed state Susan had realized the harridan was moving slowly measuring the descent of the sun as they went not clucking at the pony to hurry but actually reining it in at least until afternoons gold had gone When they passed the farmer thinfaced and alone a good man no doubt with a freehold farm he worked hard from first gleam to last glow and a family he loved but oh there were those lambslaughterer eyes below the brim of his battered hat she understood this leisurely course of travel too Rhea had been waiting for the moon With no gods to pray to Susan prayed to her father Da If thees there help me to be strong as lean be and help me hold to him to the memory of him Help me to hold to myself as well Not for rescue not for salvation but just so as not to give them the satisfaction of seeing my pain and my fear And him help him as well   Help keep him safe she whispered Keep my love safe take my love safe to where he goes give him joy in who he sees and make him a cause of joy in those who see him Praying dearie the old woman asked without turning on the seat Her croaking voice oozed false compassion Aye yed do well tmake things right with the Powers while ye still can  before the spits burned right out of yer throat She threw back her head and cackled the straggling remains of her broomstraw hair flying out orange in the light of the bloated moon  Their horses led by Rusher had come to the sound of Rolands dismayed shout They stood not far away their manes rippling in the wind shaking their heads and whinnying their displeasure whenever the wind dropped enough for them to get a whiff of the thick white smoke rising from the canyon Roland paid no attention to the horses or the smoke His eyes were fixed on the drawstring sack slung over Alains shoulder The ball inside had come alive again in the growing dark the bag seemed to pulse like some weird pink firefly He held out his hands for it Give it to me Roland I dont know if   Give it to me damn your face Alain looked at Cuthbert who nodded    then lifted his hands skyward in a weary distracted gesture Roland tore the bag away before Alain could do more than begin to shrug it off his shoulder The gunslinger dipped into it and pulled the glass out It was glowing fiercely a pink Demon Moon instead of an orange one Behind and below them the nagging whine of the thinny rose and fell rose and fell Dont look directly into that thing Cuthbert muttered to Alain Dont for your fathers sake Roland bent his face over the pulsing ball its light running over his cheeks and brow like liquid drowning his eyes in its dazzle In Maerlyns Rainbow he saw her  Susan horsedrovers daughter lovely girl at the window He saw her standing in the back of a black cart decorated with gold symbols the old witchs cart Reynolds rode behind her holding the end of a rope that was noosed around her neck The cart was rolling toward Green Heart making its way with processional slowness Hill Street was lined with people of whom the farmer with the lambslaughterers eyes had been only the first  all those folk of Hambry and Mejis who had been deprived of their fair but were now given this ancient dark attraction in its stead Charyou tree come Reap death for you life for our crops A soundless whispering ran through them like a gathering wave and they began to pelt her  first with cornhusks then with rotting tomatoes then with potatoes and apples One of these latter struck her cheek She reeled almost fell then stood straight again now raising her swollen but still lovely face so the moon painted it She looked straight ahead Charyou tree  they whispered Roland couldnt hear them but he could see the words on their lips Stanley Ruiz was there and Pettie and Gert Moggins and Frank Claypool the deputy with the broken leg Jamie McCann who was to have been this years Reap Lad Roland saw a hundred people he had known and mostly liked during his time in Mejis Now these people pelted his love with cornshucks and vegetables as she stood hands bound before her in the back of Rheas cart The slowly rolling cart reached Green Heart with its colored paper lanterns and silent carousel where no laughing children rode  no not this year The crowd still speaking those two words  chanting them now it appeared  parted Roland saw the heaped pyramid of wood that was the unlit bonfire Sitting around it their backs propped on the central column their lumpy legs outstretched was a ring of redhanded stuffyguys There was a single hole in the ring a single waiting vacancy And now a woman emerged from the crowd She wore a rusty black dress and held a pail in one hand A smear of ash stood out on one of her cheeks like a brand She  Roland began to shriek It was a single word over and over again No no no no no no The balls pink light flashed brighter with each repetition as if his horror refreshed and strengthened it And now with each of those pulses Cuthbert and Alain could see the shape of the gunslingers skull beneath his skin We have to take it away from him Alain said We have to its sucking him dry Its killing him Cuthbert nodded and stepped forward He grabbed the ball but couldnt take it from Rolands hands The gunslingers fingers seemed welded to it Hit him he told Alain Hit him again you have to But Alain might as well have been hitting a post Roland didnt even rock back on his heels He continued to cry out that single negative  No No No No   and the ball flashed faster and faster eating its way into him through the wound it had opened sucking up his grief like blood  Charyou tree Cordelia Delgado cried darting forward from where she had been waiting The crowd cheered her and beyond her left shoulder Demon Moon winked as if in complicity Charyou tree ye faithless bitch Charyou tree She flung the pail of paint at her niece splattering her pants and dressing her tied hands in a pair of wet scarlet gloves She grinned up at Susan as the cart rolled past The smear of ash stood out on her cheek in the center of her pale forehead a single vein pulsed like a worm Bitch Cordelia screamed Her fists were clenched she danced a kind of hilarious jig feet jumping bony knees pumping beneath her skirt Life for the crops Death for the bitch Charyou tree Come Reap The cart rolled past her Cordelia faded from Susans sight just one more cruel phantasm in a dream that would soon end Bird and bear and hare and fish she thought Be safe Roland go with my love Thats my fondest wish Take her Rhea screamed Take this murdering bitch and cook her redhanded Charyou tree Charyou tree the crowd responded A forest of willing hands grew in the moonlit air somewhere firecrackers rattled and children laughed excitedly Susan was lifted from the cart and handed toward the waiting woodpile above the heads of the crowd passed by uplifted hands like a heroine returned triumphantly home from the wars Her hands dripped red tears upon their straining eager faces The moon overlooked it all dwarfing the glow of the paper lanterns Bird and bear and hare and fish she murmured as she was first lowered and then slammed against the pyramid of dry wood put in the place which had been left for her  the whole crowd chanting in unison now Charyou TREE Charyou TREE Charyou TREE Bird and bear and hare and fish Trying to remember how he had danced with her that night Trying to remember how he had loved with her in the willow grove Trying to remember that first meeting on the dark road Thankeesai we re well met he had said and yes in spite of everything in spite of this miserable ending with the folk who had been her neighbors turned into prancing goblins by moonlight in spite of pain and betrayal and what was coming he had spoken the truth they had been well met they had been very well met indeed Charyou TREE Charyou TREE Charyou TREE Women came and piled dry cornshucks around her feet Several of them slapped her it didnt matter her bruised and puffy face seemed to have gone numb and one  it was Misha Alvarez whose daughter Susan had taught to ride  spat into her eyes and then leaped prankishly away shaking her hands at the sky and laughing For a moment she saw Coral Thorin festooned with reapcharms her arms filled with dead leaves which she threw at Susan they fluttered down around her in a crackling aromatic shower And now came her aunt again and Rhea beside her Each held a torch They stood before her and Susan could smell sizzling pitch Rhea raised her torch to the moon CHARYOU TREE she screamed in her rusty old voice and the crowd responded CHARYOU TREE Cordelia raised her own torch COME REAP COME REAP they cried back to her Now ye bitch Rhea crooned Now comes warmer kisses than any yer love ever gave ye Die ye faithless Cordelia whispered Life for the crops death for you It was she who first flung her torch into the cornshucks which were piled as high as Susans knees Rhea flung hers a bare second later The cornshucks blazed up at once dazzling Susan with yellow light She drew in a final breath of cool air warmed it with her heart and loosed it in a defiant shout ROLAND I LOVE THEE The crowd fell back murmuring as if uneasy at what they had done now that it was too late to take it back here was not a stuffyguy but a cheerful girl they all knew one of their own for some mad reason backed up against the ReapNight bonfire with her hands painted red They might have saved her given another moment  some might have anyway  but it was too late The dry wood caught her pants caught her shirt caught her long blonde hair blazed on her head like a crown ROLAND I LOVE THEE At the end of her life she was aware of heat but not pain She had time to consider his eyes eyes of that blue which is the color of the sky at first light of morning She had time to think of him on the Drop riding Rusher flatout with his black hair flying back from his temples and his neckerchief rippling to see him laughing with an ease and freedom he would never find again in the long life which stretched out for him beyond hers and it was his laughter she took with her as she went out fleeing the light and heat into the silky consoling dark calling to him over and over as she went calling bird and bear and hare and fish  There was no word not even no in his screams at the end he howled like a gutted animal his hands welded to the ball which beat like a runaway heart He watched in it as she burned Cuthbert tried again to take the cursed thing away and couldnt He did the only other thing he could think of  drew his revolver pointed it at the ball and thumbed back the hammer He would likely wound Roland and the flying glass might even blind him but there was no other choice If they didnt do something the glam would kill him But there was no need As if seeing Cuthberts gun and understanding what it meant the ball went instantly dark and dead in Rolands hands Rolands stiff body every line and muscle trembling with horror and outrage went limp He dropped like a stone his fingers at last letting go of the ball His stomach cushioned it as he struck the ground it rolled off him and trickled to a stop by one of his limp outstretched hands Nothing burned in its darkness now except for one baleful orange spark  the tiny reflection of the rising Demon Moon Alain looked at the glass with a species of disgusted frightened awe looked at it as one might look at a vicious animal that now sleeps  but will wake again and bite when it does He stepped forward meaning to crush it to powder beneath his boot Dont you dare Cuthbert said in a hoarse voice He was kneeling beside Rolands limp form but looking at Alain The rising moon was in his eyes two small bright stones of light Dont you dare after all the misery and death weve gone through to get it Dont you even think of it Alain looked at him uncertainly for a moment thinking he should destroy the cursed thing anyway  misery suffered did not justify misery to come and as long as the thing on the ground remained whole misery was all it would bring anyone It was a miserymachine that was what it was and it had killed Susan Delgado He hadnt seen what Roland had seen in the glass but he had seen his friends face and that had been enough It had killed Susan and it would kill more if left whole But then he thought of ka and drew back Later he would bitterly regret doing so Put it in the bag again Cuthbert said and then help me with Roland We have to get out of here The drawstring bag lay crumpled on the ground nearby fluttering in the wind Alain picked up the ball hating the feel of its smooth curved surface expecting it to come alive under his touch It didnt though He put it in the bag and looped it over his shoulder again Then he knelt beside Roland He didnt know how long they tried unsuccessfully to bring him around  until the moon had risen high enough in the sky to turn silver again and the smoke roiling out of the canyon had begun to dissipate that was all he knew Until Cuthbert told him it was enough they would have to sling him over Rushers saddle and ride with him that way If they could get into the heavily forested lands west o Barony before dawn Cuthbert said they would likely be safe    but they had to get at least that far They had smashed Parsons men apart with stunning ease but the remains would likely knit together again the following day Best they be gone before that happened And that was how they left Eyebolt Canyon and the seacoast side of Mejis riding west beneath the Demon Moon with Roland laid across his saddle like a corpse  The next day they spent in II Bosque the forest west of Mejis waiting for Roland to wake up When afternoon came and he remained unconscious Cuthbert said See if you can touch him Alain took Rolands hands in his own marshalled all his concentration bent over his friends pale slumbering face and remained that way for almost half an hour Finally he shook his head let go of Rolands hands and stood up Nothingcuthbert asked Alain sighed and shook his head They made a travois of pine branches so he wouldnt have to spend another night riding oversaddle if nothing else it seemed to make Rusher nervous to be carrying his master in such a way and went on not travelling on the Great Road  that would have been far too dangerous  but parallel to it When Roland remained unconscious the following day Mejis falling behind them now and both boys feeling a deep tug of homesickness inexplicable but as real as tides they sat on either side of him looking at each other over the slow rise and fall of his chest Can an unconscious person starve or die of thirst Cuthbert asked They cant can they Yes Alain said I think they can It had been a long nervewracking night of travel Neither boy had slept well the previous day but on this one they slept like the dead with blankets over their heads to block the sun They awoke minutes apart as the sun was going down and Demon Moon now two nights past the full was rising through a troubled rack of clouds that presaged the first of the great autumn storms Roland was sitting up He had taken the glass from the drawstring bag He sat with it cradled in his arms a darkened bit of magic as dead as the glass eyes of The Romp Rolands own eyes also dead looked indifferently off into the moonlit corridors of the forest He would eat but not sleep He would drink from the streams they passed but not speak And he would not be parted from the piece of Maerlyns Rainbow which they had brought out of Mejis at such great price It did not glow for him however Not Cuthbert thought once while Al and I are awake to see it anyway Alain couldnt get Rolands hands off the ball and so he laid his own on Rolands cheeks touching him that way Except there was nothing to touch nothing there The thing which rode west with them toward Gilead was not Roland or even a ghost of Roland Like the moon at the close of its cycle Roland had gone For the first time in hours days the gunslinger fell silent He sat for a moment looking toward the building to the east of them with the sun behind it the glass palace was a black shape surrounded by a gold nimbus with his forearms propped on his knees Then he took the waterskin which lay on the pavement beside him held it over his face opened his mouth and upended it He drank what happened to go in his mouth  the others could see his adams apple working as he lay back in the breakdown lane still pouring  but drinking didnt seem to be his primary purpose Water streamed down his deeply lined forehead and bounced off his closed eyelids It pooled in the triangular hollow at the base of his throat and ran back from his temples wetting his hair and turning it darker At last he put the waterskin aside and only lay there eyes closed arms stretched out high above his head like a man surrendering in his sleep Steam rose in delicate tendrils from his wet face Ahhh he said Feel better Eddie asked The gunslingers lids rose disclosing those faded yet somehow alarming blue eyes Yes I do I dont understand how that can be as much as I dreaded this telling    but I do An ologistofthepsyche could probably explain it to you Susannah said but I doubt youd listen She put her hands in the small of her back stretched and winced  but the wince was only reflex The pain and stiffness shed expected werent there and although there was one small creak near the base other spine she didnt get the satisfying series of snaps crackles and pops she had expected Tell you one thing Eddie said this gives a whole new meaning to Get it off your chest How long have we been here Roland Just one night  The spirits have done it all in a single night  Jake said in a dreamy voice His legs were crossed at the ankles Oy sat in the diamond shape made by the boys bent knees looking at him with his bright goldblack eyes Roland sat up wiping at his wet cheeks with his neckerchief and looking at Jake sharply What is it you say Not me A guy named Charles Dickens wrote that In a story called A Christmas Carol All in a single night huh Does any part of your body say it was longer Jake shook his head No he felt pretty much the way he did any morning  better than on some He had to take a leak but his back teeth werent exactly floating or anything like that Eddie Susannah I feel good Susannah said Surely not as if I stayed up all night let alone many of em Eddie said It reminds me of the time I spent as a junkie in a way   Doesnt everything Roland asked dryly Oh thats funny Eddie said A real howl Next train that goes crazy on us you can ask it the silly questions What I meant was that youd spend so many nights high that you got used to feeling like ten pounds of shit in a ninepound bag when you got up in the morning  bad head stuffy nose thumping heart glass in the old spine Take it from your pal Eddie you can tell just from the way you feel in the morning how good dope is for you Anyway youd get so used to that  did anyway  that when you actually took a night off youd wake up the next morning and sit there on the edge of the bed thinking What the flicks wrong with me Am I sick I feel weird Did I have a stroke in the night  Jake laughed then clapped a hand over his mouth so violently that it was as if he wanted not just to hold the sound in but call it back Sorry he said That made me think of my dad One of my people huh Eddie said Anyway I expect to be sore I expect to be tired I expect to creak when I walk but I actually think all I need to put me right is a quick pee in the bushes And a bite to eat Roland asked Eddie had been wearing a mall smile Now it faded No he said After that story Im not all that hungry In fact Im not hungry at all  Eddie carried Susannah down the embankment and popped her behind a stand of laurel bushes to do her necessary Jake was sixty or seventy yards east in a grove of birches Roland had said he would use the remedial strip to do his morning necessary then raised his eyebrows when his New York friends laughed Susannah wasnt laughing when she came out of the bushes Her face was streaked with tears Eddie didnt ask her he knew He had been fighting the feeling himself He took her gently in his arms and she put her face against the side of his neck They stayed that way for a little while Charyou tree  she said at last pronouncing it as Roland had chairyou tree with a little upturned vowel at the end Yeah Eddie said thinking that a Charlie by any other name was still a Charlie As he supposed a rose was a rose was a rose Come Reap She raised her head and began to wipe her swimming eyes To have gone through all that she said keeping her voice low  and looking once at the turnpike embankment to make sure Roland wasnt there looking down at them And at fourteen Yeah It makes my adventures searching for the elusive dime bag in Tompkins Square look pretty tame In a way though Im almost relieved Relieved Why Because I thought he was going to tell us that he killed her himself For his damned Tower Susannah looked squarely into his eyes But he thinks thats what he did Dont you understand that  When they were back together again and there was food actually in sight all of them decided they could eat a bit after all Roland shared out the last of the burritos Maybe later today we can stop in at the nearest Boing Boing Burgers and see what theyve got for leftovers Eddie thought and they dug in All of them that was except Roland He picked up his burrito looked at it then looked away Eddie saw an expression of sadness on the gunslingers face that made him look both old and lost It hurt Eddies heart but he couldnt think what to do about it Jake almost ten years younger could He got up went to Roland knelt beside him put his arms around the gunslingers neck and hugged him Im sorry you lost your friend he said Rolands face worked and for a moment Eddie was sure he was going to lose it A long time between hugs maybe Mighty long Eddie had to look away for a moment Kansas in the morning he told himself A sight you never expected to see Dig on that for awhile and let the man be When he looked back Roland had it together again Jake was sitting beside him and Oy had his long snout on one of the gunslingers boots Roland had begun to eat his burrito Slowly and without much relish    but he was eating A cold hand  Susannahs  crept into Eddies He took it and folded his fingers over it One night she marvelled On our bodyclocks at least Eddie said In our heads   Who knows Roland agreed But storytelling always changes time At least it does in my world He smiled It was unexpected as always and as always it transformed his face into something nearly beautiful Looking at that Eddie mused you could see how a girl might have fallen in love with Roland once upon a time Back when he had been long and going on tall but maybe not so ugly back when the Tower hadnt yet got its best hold on him I think its that way in all worlds sugar Susannah said Could I ask you a couple of questions before we get rolling If you like What happened to you How long were you  gone I was certainly gone youre right about that I was travelling Wandering Not in Maerlyns Rainbow exactly  I dont think I ever would have returned from there if Id gone into it while I was still    sick    but everyone has a wizards glass of course Here He tapped his forehead gravely just above the space between his eyebrows Thats where I went Thats where I travelled while my friends travelled east with me I got better there little by little I held onto the ball and I travelled inside my head and I got better But the glass never glowed for me until the very end  when the battlements of the castle and the towers of the city were actually in sight If it had awakened earlier He shrugged If it had awakened before Id started to get some of my strength of mind back I dont think Id be here now Because any world  even a pink one with a glass sky  would have been preferable to one where there was no Susan I suppose the force that gives the glass its life knew that and waited But when it did glow for you again it told you the rest Jake said It must have It told you the parts that you werent there to see Yes I know as much of the story as I do because of what I saw in the ball You told us once that John Farson wanted your head on a pole Eddie said Because you stole something from him Something he held dear It was the glass ball wasnt it Yes He was more than furious when he found out He was insane with rage In your parlance Eddie he went nuclear  How many more times did it glow for you Susannah asked And what happened to it Jake added I saw in it three times after we left Mejis Barony Roland said The first was on the night before we came home to Gilead That was when I travelled in it the longest and it showed me what Ive told you A few things Ive only guessed at but most I was shown It showed me these things not to teach or enlighten but to hurt and wound The remaining pieces of the Wizards Rainbow are all evil things Hurt enlivens them somehow It waited until my mind was strong enough to understand and withstand and then it showed me all the things I missed in my stupid adolescent complacency My lovesick daze My prideful murderous conceit Roland dont Susannah said Dont let it hurt you still But it does It always will Never mind It doesnt matter now that tale is told The second time I saw into the glass  went into the glass  was three days after I came home My mother wasnt there although she was due that evening She had gone into Debaria  a kind of retreat for women  to wait and pray for my return Nor was Marten there He was in Cressia with Farson The ball Eddie said Your father had it by then Noo Roland said He looked down at his hands and Eddie observed a faint flush rising into his cheeks I didnt give it to him at first  found it hard to give up I bet Susannah said You and everyone else who ever looked into the goddam thing On the third afternoon before we were to be banqueted to celebrate our safe return I bet you were really in a mood to party too Eddie said Roland smiled without humor still studying his hands At around four o the clock Cuthbert and Alain came to my rooms We were a trio for an artist to paint I wot  windburned holloweyed hands covered with healing cuts and scrapes from our climb up the side of the canyon scrawny as scarecrows Even Alain who tended toward stoutness all but disappeared when he turned sideways They confronted me I suppose youd say Theyd kept the secret of the ball to that point  out of respect for me and for the loss Id suffered they told me and I believed them  but they would keep it no longer than that nights meal If I wouldnt give it up voluntarily it would be a question for our fathers to decide They were horribly embarrassed especially Cuthbert but they were determined I told them Id give it over to my own father before the banquet  before my mother arrived by coach from Debaria even They should come early and see that I kept my promise Cuthbert started to hem and haw and say that wouldnt be necessary but of course it was necessary   Yeah Eddie said He had the look of a man who understood this part of the story perfectly You can go into the crapper on your own but its a lot easier to actually flush all the bad shit down the toilet if you have somebody with you Alain at least knew it would be better for me  easier  if I didnt have to hand the ball over alone He hushed Cuthbert up and said theyd be there And they were And I gave it over little as I wanted to My father went as pale as paper when he looked into the bag and saw what was there then excused himself and took it away When he came back he picked up his glass of wine and went on talking to us of our adventures in Mejis as if nothing had happened But between the time your friends talked to you about it and the time you gave it up you looked into it Jake said Went into it Travelled in it What did it show you that time First the Tower again Roland said and the beginning of the way there I saw the fall of Gilead and the triumph of the Good Man Wed put those things back a mere twenty months or so by destroying the tankers and the oilpatch I could do nothing about that but it showed me something I could do There was a certain knife The blade had been treated with an especially potent poison something from a distant MidWorld Kingdom called Garlan Stuff so strong even the tiniest cut would cause almost instant death A wandering singer  in truth John Parsons eldest nephew  had brought this knife to court The man he gave it to was the castles chief of domestic staff This man was to pass the knife on to the actual assassin My father was not meant to see the sun come up on the morning after the banquet He smiled at them grimly Because of what I saw in the Wizards Glass the knife never reached the hand that would have used it and there was a new chief of domestics by the end of that week These are pretty tales I tell you are they not Aye very pretty indeed Did you see the person the knife was meant for Susannah asked The actual killer Yes Anything else Did you see anything else Jake asked The plan to murder Rolands father didnt seem to hold much interest for him Yes Roland looked puzzled Shoes Just for a minute Shoes tumbling through the air At first I thought they were autumn leaves And when I saw what they really were they were gone and I was lying on my bed with the ball hugged in my arms    pretty much the way I carried it back from Mejis My father  as Ive said his surprise when he looked inside the bag was very great indeed You told him who had the knife with the special poison on it Susannah thought Jeeves the Butler or whoever but you didnt tell him who was supposed to actually use it did you sugar Why not Because you wanted to take careof dat little spot o work yo ownself But before she could ask Eddie was asking a question of his own Shoes Flying through the air Does that mean anything to you now Roland shook his head Tell us about the rest of what you saw in it Susannah said He gave her a look of such terrible pain that what Susannah had only suspected immediately solidified to fact in her mind She looked away from him and groped for Eddies hand I cry your pardon Susannah but I cannot Not now For now Ive told all I can All right Eddie said All right Roland thats cool Ool Oy agreed Did you ever see the witch again Jake asked For a long time it seemed Roland would not answer this either but in the end he did Yes She wasnt done with me Like my dreams of Susan she followed me All the way from Mejis she followed me What do you mean Jake asked in a low awed voice Cripes Roland what do you mean Not now He got up Its time we were on our way again He nodded to the building which floated ahead of them the sun was just now clearing its battlements Yon glitterdomes a good distance away but I think we can reach it this afternoon if we move brisk Twould be best Its not a place Id reach after nightfall if that can be avoided Do you know what it is yet Susannah asked Trouble he repeated And in our road  For awhile that morning the thinny warbled so loudly that not even the bullets in their ears would entirely stop up the sound at its worst Susannah felt as if the bridge of her nose would simply disintegrate and when she looked at Jake she saw he was weeping copiously  not crying the way people do when theyre sad but the way they do when their sinuses are in total revolt She couldnt get the sawplayer the kid had mentioned out of her mind Sounds Hawaiian she thought over and over again as Eddie pushed her grimly along in the new wheelchair weaving in and out of the stalled vehicles Sounds Hawaiian doesnt it Sounds fucking Hawaiian doesnt it Miss Oh So Black and Pretty On both sides of the turnpike the thinny lapped all the way up to the embankment casting its twitching misshapen reflections of trees and grain elevators seeming to watch the pilgrims pass as hungry animals in a zoo might watch plump children Susannah would find herself thinking of the thinny in Eyebolt Canyon reaching out hungrily through the smoke for Latigos milling men pulling them in and some going in on their own walking like zombies in a horror movie and then she would find herself thinking of the guy in Central Park again the wacko with the saw Sounds Hawaiian doesnt it Counting one thinny and it sounds Hawaiian doesnt it Just when she thought she could stand it not a moment longer the thinny began to draw back from  again and its humming warble at last began to fade Susannah was eventually able to pull the bullets out of her ears She tucked them into the sidepocket of her chair with a hand that shook slightly That was a bad one Eddie said His voice sounded clogged and weepy She looked around at him and saw his cheeks were wet his eyes red Take it easy Suziepie he said Its my sinuses thats all That sound kills em Me too Susannah said My sinuses are okay but my head aches Jake said Roland do you have any more aspirin Roland stopped rummaged and found the bottle Did you ever see Clay Reynolds again Jake asked after swallowing the pills with water from the skin he carried No but I know what happened to him He got a bunch together some of them deserters from Parsons army went to robbing banks  in toward our part of the world this was but by then bankthieves and stagerobbers didnt have much to fear from gunslingers The gunslingers were busy with Farson Eddie said Yes But Reynolds and his men were trapped by a smart sheriff who turned the main street of a town called Oakley into a killingzone Six of the ten in the gang were killed outright The rest were hung Reynolds was one of those This was less than a year later during the time of Wide Earth He paused then said One of those shot dead in the killingzone was Coral Thorin She had become Reynoldss woman rode and killed with the rest of them They went on in silence for a bit In the distance the thinny warbled its endless song Jake suddenly ran ahead to a parked camper A note had been left under the wiper blade on the drivers side By standing on his toes he was just able to reach it He scanned it frowning What does it say Eddie asked Jake handed it over Eddie looked then passed it to Susannah who read it in turn and gave it to Roland He looked then shook his head I can make out only a few words  old woman dark man What does the rest say Read it to me Jake took it back  The old woman from the dreams is in Nebraska Her name is Abagail  He paused Then down here it says The dark man is in the west Maybe Vegas  Jake looked up at the gunslinger the note fluttering in his hand his face puzzled and uneasy But Roland was looking toward the palace which shimmered across the highway  the palace that was not in the west but in the east the palace that was light not dark In the west Roland said Dark man Dark Tower and always in the west Nebraskas west of here too Susannah said hesitantly I dont know if that matters this Abagail person but I think shes part of another story Roland said But a story close to this one Eddie put in Next door maybe Close enough to swap sugar for salt or start arguments Im sure youre right Roland said and we may have business with the old woman and the dark man yet but today our business is east Come on They began walking again  What about Sheemie Jake asked after awhile Roland laughed partly in surprise at the question partly in pleased remembrance He followed us It couldnt have been easy for him and it must have been damned scary in places  there were wheels and wheels of wild country between Mejis and Gilead and plenty of wild folks too Worse than just folks mayhap But ka was with him and he showed up in time for Years End Fair He and that damned mule Capi Jake said AppyOy repeated padding along at jakes heel When we went in search of the Tower I and my friends Sheemie was with us As a sort of squire I suppose youd say He    But Roland trailed off biting at his lip and of that he would say no more Cordelia Susannah asked The crazy aunt Dead beforethe bonfire had burned down to embers It might have been a heartstorm or a brainstorm  what Eddie calls a stroke Perhaps it was shame Susannah said Or horror at what shed done It may have been Roland said Waking to the truth when its too late is a terrible thing I know that very well Something up there Jake said pointing at a long stretch of road from which the cars had been cleared Do you see Roland did  with his eyes he seemed to see everything  but it was another fifteen minutes or so before Susannah began to pick up the small black specks ahead in the road She was quite sure she knew what they were although what she thought was less vision than intuition Ten minutes after that she was sure They were shoes Six pairs of shoes placed neatly in a line across the eastbound lanes of Interstate  They reached the shoes at midmorning Beyond them clearer now stood the glass palace It glimmered a delicate green shade like the reflection of a lily pad in still water There were shining gates in front of it red pennons snapped from its towers in a light breeze The shoes were also red Susannahs impression that there were six pairs was understandable but wrong  there were actually four pairs and one quartet This latter  four dark red booties made of supple leather  was undoubtedly meant for the fourfooted member of their katet Roland picked one of them up and felt inside it He didnt know how many bumblers had worn shoes in the history of the world but he was willing to guess that none had ever been gifted with a set of silklined leather booties Bally Gucci eat your heart out Eddie said This is great stuff Susannahs were easiest to pick out and not just because of the feminine sparkly swoops on the sides They werent really shoes at all  they had been made to fit over the stumps of her legs which ended just above the knees Now look at this she marvelled holding one up so the sun could flash on the rhinestones with which the shoes were decorated  if they were rhinestones She had a crazy notion that maybe they were diamond chips Cappies After four years of gettin along in what my friend Cynthia calls circumstances of reduced legroom I finally got myself a pair of cappies Think of that Cappies Eddie mused Is that what they call em Thats what they call em sugar Jakes were bright red Oxfords  except for the color they would have looked perfectly at home in the wellbred classrooms of The Piper School He flexed one then turned it over The sole was bright and unmarked There was no manufacturers stamp nor had he really expected one His father had maybe a dozen pairs of fine handmade shoes Jake knew them when he saw them Eddies were low boots with Cuban heels Maybe in this world you call them Mejis heels he thought and pointed toes  what back in his other life had been known as streetboppers Kids from the midsixties  an era OdettaDettaSusannah had just missed  might have called them Beatleboots Rolands of course were cowboy boots Fancy ones  youd go dancing rather than droving in such as these Looped stitching side decorations narrow haughty arches He examined them without picking them up then looked at his fellow travellers and frowned They were looking at each other You would have said three people couldnt do that only a pair  but you only would have said it if youd never been part of a katet Roland still shared khef with them he felt the powerful current of their mingled thought but could not understand it Because its of their world They come from different whens of that world but they see something here thats common to all three of them What is it he asked What do they mean these shoes I dont think any of us know that exactly Susannah said No Jake said Its another riddle He looked at the weird blood red Oxford shoe in his hands with distaste Another goddamned riddle Tell what you know He looked toward the glass palace again It was perhaps fifteen New York miles away now shining in the clear day delicate as a mirage but as real as  well as real as shoes Please tell me what you know about these shoes I got shoes you got shoes all Gods chillun got shoes Odetta said Thats the prevailin opinion anyway Well Eddie said we got em anyway And youre thinking what Im thinking arent you I guess I am You Jake Instead of answering with words Jake picked up the other Oxford Roland had no doubt that all the shoes including Oys would fit perfectly and clapped them briskly together three times It meant nothing to Roland but both Eddie and Susannah reacted violently looking around looking especially at the sky as if expecting a storm born out of this bright autumn sunshine I hey ended up looking at the glass palace again    and then at each other in that knowing roundeyed way that made Roland feel like shaking them both until their teeth rattled Yet he waited Sometimes that was all a man could do After you killed Jonas you looked into the ball Eddie said turning to him Yes Travelled in the ball Yes but I dont want to talk about that again now it has nothing to do with these   I think it does Eddie said You flew inside a pink storm Inside a pink gale you could say Gale is a word you might use for a storm isnt it Especially if you were making up a riddle Sure Jake said He sounded dreamy almost like a boy who talks in his sleep When does Dorothy fly over the Wizards Rainbow When shes a Gale We aint in Kansas anymore sugar Susannah said and then voiced a strange humorless bark which Roland supposed was a species of laughter May look a little like it but Kansas was never    you know this thin I dont understand you Roland said But he felt cold and his heart was beating too fast There were thinnies everywhere now hadnt he told them that Worlds melting into one another as the forces of the Tower weakened As the day when the rose would be plowed under drew nearer You saw things as you flew Eddie said Before you got to the dark land the one you called Thunderclap you saw things The pianoplayer Sheb Who turned up again later in your life didnt he Yes in Tull And the dweller with the red hair Him too He had a bird named Zoltan But when we met he and I we said the normal Life for you life for your crop that sort of thing I thought I heard the same when he flew by me in the pink storm but he really said something else He glanced at Susannah I saw your wheelchair too The old one And you saw the witch Yes I   In a creaky chortle that reminded Roland unnervingly of Rhea Jake Chambers cried Ill get you my pretty And your little dog too Roland stared at him trying not to gape Only in the movie the witch wasnt riding a broom Jake said She was on her bike the one with the basket on the back Yeah no reapcharms either Eddie said Would have been a nice touch though I tell you Jake when I was a kid I used to have nightmares about the way she laughed It was the monkeys that gave me the creeps Susannah said The flying monkeys Id get thinkin about em and then have to crawl into bed with my mom and dad Theyd still be arguin bout whose bright idea it was to take me to that show in the foist place when I fell asleep between em I wasnt worried about clapping the heels together Jake said Not a bit It was Susannah and Eddie he was speaking to for the time being it was as if Roland wasnt even there I wasnt wearing them after all True Susannah said sounding severe but you know what my daddy always used to say No but I have a feeling were going to find out Eddie said She gave Eddie a brief severe look then turned her attention back to Jake  Never whistle for the wind unless you want it to blow  she said And its good advice no matter what Young Mister Foolish here may think Spanked again Eddie said grinning Tanked Oy said eyeing Eddie severely Explain this to me Roland said in his softest voice I would hear I would share your khef And I would share it now  They told him a story almost every American child of the twentieth century knew about a Kansas farmgirl named Dorothy Gale who had been carried away by a cyclone and deposited along with her dog in the Land of Oz There was no  in Oz but there was a yellow brick road which served much the same purpose and there were witches both good and bad There was a katet comprised of Dorothy Toto and three friends she met along the way the Cowardly Lion the Tin Woodman and the Scarecrow They each had bird and bear and hare and fish a fondest wish and it was with Dorothys that Rolands new friends and Roland himself for that matter identified the most strongly she wanted to find her way home again The Munchkins told her that she had to follow the yellow brick road to Oz Jake said and so she went She met the others along the way sort of like you met us Roland   Although you dont look much like Judy Garland Eddie put in   and eventually they got there To Oz the Emerald Palace and the guy who lived in the Emerald Palace He looked toward the glass palace ahead of them greener and greener in the strengthening light and then back to Roland Yes I understand And was this fellow Oz a powerful dinh A Baron Perhaps a King Again the three of them exchanged a glance from which Roland was excluded Thats complicated Jake said He was sort of a humbug   A bumhug Whats that Humbug  Jake said laughing A faker All talk no action But maybe the important thing is that the Wizard actually came from   Wizard Roland asked sharply He grasped Jakes shoulder with his diminished right hand Why do you call him so Because that was his title sug Susannah said The Wizard of Oz She lifted Rolands hand gently but firmly from Jakes shoulder Let him tell it now He dont need you to squeeze it out of him Did I hurt you Jake I cry your pardon Nah Im fine Jake said Dont worry about it Anyway Dorothy and her friends had a lot of adventures before finding out the Wizard was a you know a bumhug Jake giggled at this with his hands clapped to his forehead and pushing back his hair like a child of five He couldnt give the Lion courage the Scarecrow a brain or the Tin Woodman a heart Worst of all he couldnt send Dorothy back to Kansas The Wizard had a balloon but he went without her I dont think he meant to but he did It seems to me from your telling of the tale Roland said speaking very slowly that Dorothys friends had the things they wanted all along Thats the moral of the story Eddie said Maybe what makes it a great story But Dorothy was stuck in Oz you see Then Glinda showed up Glinda the Good And as a present for smooshing one of the bad witches under her house and melting another one Glinda told Dorothy how to use the ruby slippers The ones Glinda gave her Eddie raised the red Cubanheeled streetboppers which had been left for him on the dotted white line of  Glinda told Dorothy to click the heels of the ruby slippers together three times That would take her back to Kansas she said And it did And thats the end of the tale Well Jake said it was so popular that the guy who wrote it went ahead and wrote about a thousand more Oz stories   Yeah Eddie said Everything but Glindas Guide to Firm Thighs   and there was this crazy remake called The Wiz starring black people   Really Susannah asked She looked bemused What a peculiar concept   but the only one that really matters is the first one I think Jake finished Roland hunkered and put his hands into the boots which had been left for him He lifted them looked at them put them down again Are we supposed to put them on do you think Here and now His three friends from New York looked at each other doubtfully At last Susannah spoke for them  fed him the khef which he could feel but not quite share on his own Best not to right now maybe Too many badass spirits here Takuro spirits Eddie murmured mostly to himself Then Look lets just take em along If were supposed to put em on I think well know when the time comes In the meantime I think we ought to beware of bumhugs bearing gifts It cracked Jake up as Eddie had known it would sometimes a word or an image got into your funny bone like a virus and just lived there awhile Tomorrow the word bumhug might mean nothing to the kid for the rest of today however he was going to laugh every time he heard it Eddie intended to use it a lot especially when ole Jake wasnt expecting it They picked up the red shoes which had been left for them in the eastbound lanes Jake took Oys and moved on again toward the shimmering glass castle Oz Roland thought He searched his memory but he didnt think it was a name he had ever heard before or a word of the High Speech that had come in disguise as char had come disguised as Charlie Yet it had a sound that belonged in this business a sound more of his world than of Jakes Susannahs and Eddies from whence the tale had come  Jake kept expecting the Green Palace to begin looking normal as they drew closer to it the way the attractions in Disney World began to look normal as you drew close to them  not ordinary necessarily but normal things which were as much a part of the world as the comer bus stop or mailbox or park bench stuff you could touch stuff you could write fuck piper on if you took a notion But that didnt happen wasnt going to happen and as they neared the Green Palace Jake realized something else it was the most beautiful radiant thing he had ever seen in his life Not trusting it  and he did not  didnt change the fact It was like a drawing in a fairytale book one so good it had become real somehow And like the thinny it hummed  except that this sound was far fainter and not unpleasant Pale green walls rose to battlements that jutted and towers that soared seeming almost to touch the clouds floating over the Kansas plains These towers were topped with needles of a darker emerald green it was from these that the red pennants nickered Upon each pennant the symbol of the open eye had been traced in yellow Its the mark of the Crimson King Jake thought Its really his sigul not John Farson s He didnt know how he knew this how could he when Alabamas Crimson Tide was the only Crimson anything he knew but he did So beautiful Susannah murmured and when Jake glanced at her he thought she was almost crying But not nice somehow Not right Maybe not downright bad the way the thinny is but  But not nice Eddie said Yeah That works Not a red light maybe but a bright yellow one just the same He rubbed the side of his face a gesture he had picked up from Roland without even realizing it and looked puzzled It feels almost not serious  a practical joke I doubt its a joke Roland said Do you think its a copy of the place where Dorothy and her katet met the false wizard Again the three erstwhile New Yorkers seemed to exchange a single glance of consultation When it was over Eddie spoke for all of them Yeah Yeah probably Its not the same as the one in the movie but if this thing came out of our minds it wouldnt be Because we see the one from L Frank Baums book too Both from the illustrations in the book   And the ones from our imaginations Jake said But thats it Susannah said Id say were definitely off to see the Wizard You bet Eddie said Becausebecausebecausebecausebecause   Because of the wonderful things he does Jake and Susannah finished in unison then laughed delighted with each other while Roland frowned at them feeling puzzled and looking left out But I have to tell you guys Eddie said that its only gonna take about one more wonderful thing to send me around to the dark side of the Psycho Moon Most likely for good  As they drew closer they could see Interstate  stretching away into the pale green depths of the castles slightly rounded outer wall it floated there like an optical illusion Closer yet and they could hear the pennants snapping in the breeze and see their own ripply reflections like drowned folk who somehow walk at the bottoms of watery tropical graves There was an inner redoubt of dark blue glass  it was a color Jake associated with the bottles fountainpen ink came in  and a rusthued wallwalk between the redoubt and the outer wall That color made Susannah think of the bottles Hires rootbeer had come in when she was a little girl The way in was blocked by a barred gate that was both huge and ethereal it looked like wrought iron which had been turned to glass Each cunningly made stake was a different color and these colors seemed to come from the inside as if the bars were filled with some bright gas or liquid The travellers stopped before it There was no sign of the turnpike beyond it instead of roadway there was a courtyard of silver glass  a huge flat mirror in fact Clouds floated serenely through its depths so did the image of the occasional swooping bird Sun reflected off this glass courtyard and ran across the green castle walls in ripples Un the far side the wall of the palaces inner ward rose in a glimmery green cliff broken by narrow loophole windows of jetblack glass There was also an arched entry in this wall that made Jake think of St Patricks Cathedral To the left of the main doorway was a sentrybox made of creamcolored glass shot through with hazy orange threads Its door painted with red stripes stood open The phoneboothsized room inside was empty although there was something on the floor which looked to Jake like a newspaper Above the entry flanking its darkness were two crouching leering gargoyles of darkest violet glass Their pointed tongues poked out like bruises The pennants atop the towers flapped like schoolyard flags Crows cawed over empty cornfields now a week past the Reap Distant the thinny whined and warbled Look at the bars of this gate Susannah said She sounded breathless and awestruck Look very closely Jake bent toward the yellow bar until his nose nearly touched it and a faint yellow stripe ran down the middle of his face At first he saw nothing and then he gasped What he had taken for motes of some kind were creatures  living creatures  imprisoned inside the bar swimming in tiny schools They looked like fish in an aquarium but they also their heads Jake told himself Ithink its mostly their heads looked oddly disquietingly human As if Jake thought he were looking into a vertical golden sea all the ocean in a glass rod  and living myths no bigger than grains of dust swimming within it A tiny woman with a fishs tail and long blonde hair streaming out behind her swam to her side of the glass seemed to peer out at the giant boy her eyes were round startled and beautiful and then flipped away again Jake felt suddenly dizzy and weak He closed his eyes until the feeling of vertigo went away then opened them again and looked around at the others Cripes Are they all the same All different I think said Eddie who had already peered into two or three He bent close to the purple rod and his cheeks lit up as if in the glow of an oldfashioned fluoroscope These guys here look like birds  little tiny birds Jake looked and saw that Eddie was right inside the gates purple upright were flocks of birds no bigger than summer minges They swooped giddily about in their eternal twilight weaving over and under one another their wings leaving tiny silver trails of bubbles Are they really there Jake asked breathlessly Are they Roland or are we only imagining them I dont know But I know what this gate has been made to look like So do I Eddie said He surveyed the shining posts each with its own column of imprisoned light and life Each of the gates wings consisted of six colored bars The one in the center  broad and flat instead of round and made to split in two when the gate was opened  was the thirteenth This one was dead black and in this one nothing moved Oh maybe not that you can see but there are things moving around in there all right Jake thought Theres life in there terrible life And maybe there are roses too Drowned ones Its a Wizards Gate Eddie said Each bar has been made to look like one of the balls in Maerlyns Rainbow Look heres the pink one Jake leaned toward it hands propped on his thighs He knew what would be inside even before he saw them horses of courses Tiny herds of them galloping through that strange pink stuff that was neither light nor liquid Horses running in search of a Drop they would never find mayhap Eddie stretched his hands out to grasp the sides of the central post the black one Dont Susannah called sharply Eddie ignored her but Jake saw his chest stop for a moment and his lips tighten as he wrapped his hands around the black bar and waited for something  some force perhaps sent Special Delivery all the way from the Dark Tower itself  to change him or even to strike him dead When nothing happened he breathed deep again and risked a smile No electricity but    He pulled the gate held fast No give either I see where it splits down the middle but I get nothing Want to take a shot Roland Roland reached for the gate but Jake put a hand on his arm and stopped him before the gunslinger could do more than give it a preliminary shake Dont bother Thats not the way Then what is Instead of answering Jake sat down in front of the gate near the place where this strange version of  ended and began putting on the shoes which had been left for him Eddie watched a moment then sat down beside him I guess we ought to try it he said to Jake even though itll probably turn out to be just another bumhug Jake laughed shook his head and began to tighten the laces of the bloodred Oxfords He and Eddie both knew it was no bumhug Not this time  Okay Jake said when they had all put on their red shoes he thought they looked extraordinarily stupid especially Eddies pair Ill count to three and well click our heels together Like this He clicked the Oxfords together once sharply    and the gate shivered like a loosely fastened shutter blown by a strong wind Susannah cried out There followed a low sweet chiming sound from the Green Palace as if the walls themselves had vibrated I guess thisll do the trick all right Eddie said I warn you though Im not singing Somewhere Over the Rainbow Thats not in my contract The rainbow is here the gunslinger said softly stretching his diminished hand out to the gate It wiped the smile off Eddies face Yeah I know Im a little scared Roland So am I the gunslinger said and indeed Jake thought he looked pale and ill Go on sugar Susannah said Count before we all lose our nerve One  two  three They clicked their heels together solemnly and in unison tock tock tock The gate shivered more violently this time the colors in the uprights brightening perceptibly The chime that followed was higher sweeter  the sound of fine crystal tapped with the haft of a knife It echoed in dreamy harmonics that made Jake shiver half with pleasure and half with pain But the gate didnt open What   Eddie began I know Jake said We forgot Oy Oh Christ Eddie said I left the world I knew to watch a kid try to put booties on a fuckedup weasel Shoot me Roland before I breed Roland ignored him watching Jake closely as the boy sat down on the turnpike and called Oy To me The bumbler came willingly enough and although he had surely been a wild creature before they had met him on the Path of the Beam he allowed Jake to slip the red leather booties onto his paws without making trouble in fact once he got the idea he stepped into the last two When all four of the little red shoes were in place they looked in fact the most like Dorothys ruby slippers Oy sniffed at one of them then looked attentively back at Jake Jake clicked his heels together three times looking at the bumbler as he did so ignoring the rattle of the gate and the soft chime from the walls of the Green Palace You Oy Oy He rolled over on his back like a dog playing dead then simply looked at his own feet with a kind of disgusted bewilderment Looking at him Jake had a sharp memory trying to pat his stomach and rub his head at the same time and his father making fun of him when he couldnt do it right away Roland help me He knows what hes supposed to do but he doesnt know how to do it Jake glanced up at Eddie And dont make any smart remarks okay No Eddie said No smart remarks Jake Do you think just Oy has to do it this time or is it still a group effort Just him I think But it wouldnt hurt us to kind of click along with Mitch Susannah said Mitch who Eddie asked looking blank Never mind Go on Jake Roland Give us a count again Eddie grasped Oys forepaws Roland gently grasped the bumblers rear paws Oy looked nervous at this  as if he perhaps expected to be swung briskly into the air and given the old heaveho  but he didnt struggle One two three Jake and Roland gently patted Oys forepaws and rear paws together in unison At the same time they clicked the heels of their own footwear Eddie and Susannah did the same This time the harmonic was a deep sweet bong like a glass church bell The black glass bar running down the center of the gate did not split open but shattered spraying crumbs of obsidian glass in all directions Some rattled against Oys hide He sprang up in a hurry yanking out of Jakes and Rolands grip and trotting a little distance away He sat on the broken white line between the travel lane and the passing lane of the highway his ears laid back looking at the gate and panting Come on Roland said He went to the left wing of the gate and pushed it slowly open He stood at the edge of the mirror courtyard a tall lanky man in cowpoke jeans an ancient shirt of no particular color and improbable red cowboy boots Lets go in and see what the Wizard of Oz has to say for himself If hes still here Eddie said Oh I think hes here Roland murmured Yes I think hes here He ambled toward the main door with the empty sentrybox beside it The others followed welded to their own downward reflections by the red shoes like sets of Siamese twins Oy came last skipping nimbly along in his ruby slippers pausing once to sniff down at his own reflected snout Oy he cried to the humbler floating below him and then hurried after Jake Roland stopped at the sentrybox glanced in then picked up the thing which was lying on the floor The others caught up with him and clustered around It had looked like a newspaper and that was just what it was    although an exceedingly odd one No Topeka CapitalJournal this and no news of a populationlevelling plague

the mirrored courtyard as if this had happened the day before instead of only minutes ago Beneath it was a caption reading Tragedy in Oz Travellers Arrive Seeking Fame and Fortune Find Death Instead I like that Eddie said adjusting Rolands revolver in the holster he wore low on his hip Comfort and encouragement after days of confusion Like a hot drink on a cold fucking night Dont be afraid of this Roland said This is a joke Im not afraid Eddie said but its a little more than a joke I lived with Henry Dean for a lot of years and I know when theres a plot to psych me out afoot I know it very well He looked curiously at Roland I hope you dont mind me saying this but you re the one who looks scared Roland Im terrified Roland said simply  The arched entryway made Susannah think of a song which had been popular ten years or so before she had been yanked out of her world and into Rolands Saw an eyeball peepin through a smoky cloud behind the Green Door the lyric went When I said Joe sent me  someone laughed out loud behind the Green Door There were actually two doors here instead of one and no peephole through which an eyeball could look in either Nor did Susannah try that old speakeasy deal about how Joe had sent her She did however bend forward to read the sign hanging from one of the circular glass doorpulls bell out of order please knock it said Dont bother she said to Roland who had actually doubled up his fist to do as the sign said Its from the story thats all Eddie pulled her chair back slightly stepped in front of it and took hold of the circular pulls The doors opened easily the hinges rolling in silence He took a step forward into what looked like a shadowy green grotto cupped his hands to his mouth and called Hey The sound of his voice rolled away and came back changed small echoing lost Dying it seemed Christ Eddie said Do we have to do this If we want to get back to the Beam I think so Roland looked paler than ever but he led them in Jake helped Eddie lift Susannahs chair over the sill a milky block of jadecolored glass and inside Oys little shoes flashed dim red on the green glass floor They had gone only ten paces when the doors slammed shut behind them with a noquestionaboutit boom that rolled past them and went echoing away into the depths of the Green Palace  There was no reception room only a vaulted cavernous hallway that seemed to go on forever The walls were lit with a faint green glow This is just like the hallway in the movie Jake thought the one where the Cowardly Lion got so scared when he stepped on his own tail And adding a little extra touch of verisimilitude Jake could have done without Eddie spoke up in a trembly and better than passable Bert Lahr imitation Wait a minute fellas I wuz just thinkin  I really dont wanna see the Wizard this much I better wait for you outside Stop it Jake said sharply Oppit Oy agreed He walked directly at Jakes heel swinging his head watchfully from side to side as he went Jake could hear no sound except for their own passage  yet he sensed something a sound that wasnt It was he thought like looking at a windchime that wants only the slightest puff of breeze to set it tinkling Sorry Eddie said Really He pointed Look down there About forty yards ahead of them the green corridor did end in a narrow green doorway of amazing height  perhaps thirty feet from the floor to its pointed tip And from behind it Jake could now hear a steady thrumming sound As they drew closer and the sound grew louder his dread grew He had to make a conscious effort to take the last dozen steps to the door He knew this sound he knew it from the run hed made with Gasher under Lud and from the run he and his friends had made on Blaine the Mono It was the steady beatbeatbeat of slotrans engines Its like a nightmare he said in a small closetotears voice Were right back where we started No Jake the gunslinger said touching his hair Never think it What you feel is an illusion Stand and be true The sign on this door wasnt from the movie and only Susannah knew it was from Dante abandon hope all ye who enter here it said Roland reached out with his twofingered right hand and pulled the thirtyfoot door open  What lay beyond it was to the eyes of Jake Susannah and Eddie a weird combination of The Wizard of Oz and Blaine the Mono A thick mg pale blue like the one in the Barony Coach lay on the floor The chamber was like the nave of a cathedral soaring to impenetrable heights of greenishblack The pillars which supported the glowing walls were great glass ribs of alternating green and pink light the pink was the exact shade of Blaines hull Jake saw these supporting pillars had been carven with a billion different images none of them comforting they jostled the eye and unsettled the heart There seemed to be a preponderance of screaming faces Ahead of them dwarfing the visitors turning them into creatures that seemed no bigger than ants was the chambers only furnishing an enormous green glass throne Jake tried to estimate its size and was unable  he had no referencepoints to help him He thought that the thrones back might be fifty feet high but it could as easily have been seventyfive or a hundred It was marked with the open eye symbol this time traced in red instead of yellow The rhythmic thrusting of the light made the eye seem alive to be beating like a heart Above the throne rising like the pipes of a mighty medieval organ were thirteen great cylinders each pulsing a different color Each that was save for the pipe which ran directly down in back of the thrones center That one was black as midnight and as still as death Hey Susannah shouted from her chair Anyone here At the sound of her voice the pipes flashed so brilliantly that Jake had to shield his eyes For a moment the entire throneroom glared like an exploding rainbow Then the pipes went out went dark went dead just as the wizards glass in Rolands story had done when the glass or the force inhabiting the glass decided to shut up for awhile Now there was only the column of blackness and the steady green pulse of the empty throne Next a somehow tired humming sound as of a very old servomechanism being called into use one final time began to whine its way into their ears Panels each at least six feet long and two feet wide slid open in the arms of the throne From the black slots thus revealed a rosecolored smoke began to drift out and up As it rose it darkened to a bright red And in it a terribly familiar zigzag line appeared Jake knew what it was even before the words Lud Candleton Rilea The Falls of the Hounds Dasherville Topeka appeared glowing smokebright It was Blaines routemap Roland could say all he wanted about how things had changed how Jakes feeling of being trapped in a nightmare this is the worst nightmare of my life and that is the truth was just an illusion created by his confused mind and frightened heart but Jake knew better This place might look a little bit like the throneroom ofoz the great and Terrible but it was really Blaine the Mono They were back aboard Blaine and soon the riddling would begin all over again Jake felt like screaming  Eddie recognized the voice that boomed out of the smoky routemap hanging above the green throne but he believed it was Blaine the Mono no more than he believed it was the Wizard of Oz Some wizard perhaps but this wasnt the Emerald City and Blaine was just as dead as dogshit Eddie had sent him home with a fuckin rupture HELLO THERE AGAIN LITTLE TRAILHANDS The smoky routemap pulsed but Eddie no longer associated it with the voice although he guessed they were supposed to No the voice was coming from the pipes He glanced down saw Jakes paperwhite face and knelt beside him If scrap kid he said NNo  its Blaine  not dead Hes dead all right This is nothing but an amplified version of the afterschool announcements    whos got detention and whos supposed to report to Room Six for Speech Therapy You dig What Jake looked up at him lips wet and trembling eyes dazed What do you   Those pipes are speakers Even a pipsqueak can sound big through a twelvespeaker Dolby soundsystem dont you remember the movie It has to sound big because its a bumhug Jake  just a bumhug WHAT ARE YOU TELLING HIM EDDIE OF NEW YORK ONE OF YOUR STUPID NASTYMINDED LITTLE JOKES ONE OF YOUR UNFAIR RIDDLES Yeah Eddie said The one that goes How many dipolar computers does it take to screw in a lightbulb Who are you buddy  know goddam well youre not Blaine the Mono so who are you I  AM   Oz the voice thundered the glass columns flashed so did the pipes behind the throne OZ THE GREAT OZ THE POWERFUL WHO ARE YOU Susannah rolled forward until her wheelchair was at the base of the dull green steps leading up to a throne that would have dwarfed even Lord Perth Im Susannah Dean the small and crippled she said and I was raised to be polite but not to suffer bullshit Were here because were spozed to be here  why else did we get left the shoes WHAT DO YOU WANT OF ME SUSANNAH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE LITTLE COWGIRL You know she said We want what everyone wants so far as I know  to go back home again cause theres no place like home We   You cant go home Jake said He spoke in a rapid frightened murmur You cant go home again Thomas Wolfe said that and that is the truth Its a lie sug Susannah said A flatout lie You can go home again All you have to do is find the right rainbow and walk under it Weve found it the rest is just you know footwork WOULD YOU GO BACK TO NEW YORK SUSANNAH DEAN EDDIE DEAN JAKE CHAMBERS IS THAT WHAT YOU ASK OF OZ THE MIGHTY AND POWERFUL New York isnt home for us anymore Susannah said She looked very small yet very fearless as she sat in her new wheelchair at the foot of the enormous pulsing throne No more than Gilead is home for Roland Take us back to the Path of the Beam Thats where we want to go because thats our way home Only way home we got GO AWAY cried the voice from the pipes GO AWAY AND COME BACK TOMORROW WELL DISCUSS THE BEAM THEN FIDDLEDEDEE SAID SCARLETT WELL TALK ABOUT THE BEAM TOMORROW FOR TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY No Eddie said Well talk about it now DO NOT AROUSE THE WRATH OF THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ the voice cried and the pipes flashed furiously with each word Susannah was sure this was supposed to be scary but she found it almost amusing instead It was like watching a salesman demonstrate a childs toy Hey kids When you talk the pipes flash bright colors Try it and see Sugar you best listen now Susannah said What you dont want to do is arouse the wrath of folks with guns Especially when you be livin in a glass house I SAID COME BACK TOMORROW Red smoke once more began to boil out of the slots in the arms of the throne It was thicker now The shape which had been Blaines routemap melted apart and joined it The smoke formed a face this time It was narrow and hard and watchful framed by long hair Its the man Roland shot in the desert Susannah thought wonderingly Its that man Jonas I know it is Now Oz spoke in a slightly trembling voice DO YOU PRESUME TO THREATEN THE GREAT OZ The lips of the huge smoky face hovering over the thrones seat parted in a snarl of mingled menace and contempt YOU UNGRATEFUL CREATURES OH YOU UNGRATEFUL CREATURES Eddie who knew smoke and mirrors when he saw them had glanced in another direction His eyes widened and he gripped Susannahs arm above the elbow Look he whispered Christ Suze look at Oy The billybumbler had no interest in smokeghosts whether they were monorail routemaps dead Coffin Hunters or just Hollywood special effects of the preWorld War II variety He had seen or smelled something that was more interesting Susannah grabbed Jake turned him and pointed at the bumbler She saw the boys eyes widen with understanding a moment before Oy reached the small alcove in the left wall It was screened from the main chamber by a green curtain which matched the glass walls Oy stretched his long neck forward caught the curtains fabric in his teeth and yanked it back  Behind the curtain red and green lights flashed cylinders spun inside glass boxes needles moved back and forth inside long rows of lighted dials Yet Jake barely noticed these things It was the man who took all his attention the one sitting at the console his back to them His filthy hair streaked with dirt and blood hung to his shoulders in matted clumps He was wearing some sort of headset and was speaking into a tiny mike which hung in front of his mouth His back was to them and at first he had no idea that Oy had smelled him out and uncovered his hiding place GO thundered the voice from the pipes   except now Jake saw where it was really coming from COME BACK TOMORROW IF YOU LIKE BUT GO NOW I WARN YOU It is Jonas Roland must not have killed him after all Eddie whispered but Jake knew better He had recognized the voice Even distorted by the amplification of the colored pipes he had recognized the voice How could he have ever believed it to be the voice of Blaine I WARN YOU IF YOU REFUSE   Oy barked a sharp and somehow forbidding sound The man in the equipment alcove began to turn Tell me cully Jake remembered this voice saying before its owner had discovered the dubious attractions of amplification Tell me all you know about dipolar computers and transitive circuits Tell me and Ill give you a drink It wasnt Jonas and it wasnt the Wizard of anything It was David Quicks grandson It was the TickTock Man  Jake stared at him horrified The coiled dangerous creature who had lived beneath Lud with his mates  Gasher and Hoots and Brandon and Tilly  was gone This might have been that monsters ruined father  or grandfather His left eye  the one Oy had punctured with his claws  bulged white and misshapen partly in its socket and partly on his unshaven cheek The right side of his head looked halfscalped the skull showing through in a long triangular strip Jake had a distant panicdarkened memory of a flap of skin falling over the side of TickTocks face but he had been on the edge of hysteria by that point and was again now Oy had also recognized the man who had tried to kill him and was barking hysterically head down teeth bared back bowed TickTock stared at him with wide stunned eyes Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain said a voice from behind them and then tittered My friend Andrew is having another in a long series of bad days Poor boy I suppose I was wrong to bring him out of Lud but he just looked so lost  The owner of the voice tittered again Jake swung around and saw that there was now a man sitting in the middle of the great throne with his legs casually crossed in front of him He was wearing jeans a dark jacket that belted at the waist and old rundown cowboy boots On his jacket was a button that showed a pigs head with a bullethole between the eyes In his lap this newcomer held a drawstring bag He rose standing in the seat of the throne like a child in daddys chair and the smile dropped away from his face like loose skin Now his eyes blazed and his lips parted over vast hungry teeth Get them Andrew Get them Kill them Every sisterfucking one of them My life for you the man in the alcove screamed and for the first time Jake saw the machinegun propped in the comer TickTock sprang for it and snatched it up My life for you He turned and Oy was on him once again leaping forward and upward sinking his teeth deep into TickTocks left thigh just below the crotch Eddie and Susannah drew in unison each raising one of Rolands big guns They fired in concert not even the smallest overlap in the sound of their shots One of them tore off the top of TickTocks miserable head buried itself in the equipment and created a loud but mercifully brief snarl of feedback The other took him in the throat He staggered forward one step then two Oy dropped to the floor and backed away from him snarling A third step took TickTock out into the throneroom proper He raised his arms toward Jake and the boy could read Tickys hatred in his remaining green eye the boy thought he could hear the mans last hateful thought Oh you fucking little squint  Then TickTock collapsed forward as he had collapsed in the Cradle of the Grays    only this time he would rise no more Thus fell Lord Perth and the earth did shake with that thunder said the man on the throne Except hes not a man Jake thought Not a man at all Weve found the Wizard at last I think And Im pretty sure I know whats in the bag he has Marten Roland said He held out his left hand the one which was still whole Marten Broadcloak After all these years After all these centuries Want this Roland Eddie put the gun he had used to kill the TickTock Man in Rolands hand A tendril of blue smoke was still rising from the barrel Roland looked at the old revolver as if he had never seen it before then slowly lifted it and pointed it at the grinning rosycheeked figure sitting crosslegged on the Green Palaces throne Finally Roland breathed thumbing back the trigger Finally in my sights  That sixshooter will do you no good as I think you know the man on the throne said Not against me Only misfires against me Roland old fellow Hows the family by the way I seem to have lost touch with them over the years I was always such a lousy correspondent Someone ought to take a hosswhip to me aye so they should He threw back his head and laughed Roland pulled the trigger of the gun in his hand When the hammer fell there was only a dull click Toadjer the man on the throne said I think you must have gotten some of those wet slugs in there by accident dont you The ones with the flat powder Good for blocking the sound of the thinny but not so good for shooting old wizards are they Too bad And your hand Roland look at your hand Short a couple of fingers by the look My this has been hard on you hasnt it Things could get easier though You and your friends could have a fine fruitful life  and as Jake would say that is the truth No more lobstrosities no more mad trains no more disquieting  not to mention dangerous  trips to other worlds All you have to do is give over this stupid and hopeless quest for the Tower No Eddie said No Susannah said No Jake said No Oy said and added a bark The dark man on the green throne continued to smile unperturbed Roland he asked What about you Slowly he raised the drawstring bag It looked dusty and old It hung from the wizards fist like a teardrop and now the thing in its pouch began to pulse with pink light Cry off and they need never see whats inside this  they need never see the last scene of that sad longago play Cry off Turn from the Tower and go your way No Roland said He began to smile and as his smile broadened that of the man sitting on the throne began to falter You can enchant my guns those of this world I reckon he said Roland I dont know what youre thinking of laddie but I warn you not to   Not to cross Oz the Great Oz the Powerful But I think I will Marten  or Maerlyn  or whoever you call yourself now Flagg actually the man on the throne said And weve met before He smiled Instead of broadening his face as smiles usually did it contracted Flaggs features into a narrow and spiteful grimace In the wreck of Gilead You and your surviving pals  that laughing donkey Cuthbert Allgood made one of your party I remember and DeCurry the fellow with the birthmark made another  were on your way west to seek the Tower Or in the parlance of Jakes world you were off to see the Wizard I know you saw me but I doubt you knew until now that I saw you as well And will again I reckon Roland said Unless that is I kill you now and put an end to your interference Still holding his own gun out in his left hand he went for the one tucked in the waistband of his jeans  Jakes Ruger a gun from another world and perhaps immune to this creatures enchantments  with his right And he was fast as he had always been fast his speed blinding The man on the throne shrieked and cringed back The bag fell from his lap and the glass ball  once held by Rhea once held by Jonas once held by Roland himself  slipped out of its mouth Smoke green this time instead of red billowed from the slots in the arms of the throne It rose in obscuring fumes Yet Roland still might have shot the figure disappearing into the smoke if he had made a clean draw He didnt however the Ruger slid in the grip of his reduced hand then twisted The front sight caught on his beltbuckle It took only an extra quartersecond for him to free the snag but that was the quartersecond he had needed He pumped three shots into the billowing smoke then ran forward oblivious of the shouts of the others He waved the smoke aside with his hands His shots had shattered the back of the throne into thick green slabs of glass but the manshaped creature which had called itself Flagg was gone Roland found himself already beginning to wonder if he  or it had been there in the first place The ball was still there however unharmed and glowing the same enticing pink he remembered from so long ago  from Mejis when he had been young and in love This survivor of Maerlyns Rainbow had rolled almost to the edge of the thrones seat two more inches and it would have plunged over and shattered on the floor Yet it had not still it remained this bewitched thing Susan Delgado had first glimpsed through the window of Rheas hut under the light of the Kissing Moon Roland picked it up  how well it fit his hand how natural it felt against his palm even after all these years  and looked into its cloudy troubled depths You always did have a charmed life he whispered to it He thought of Rhea as he had seen her in this ball  her ancient laughing eyes He thought of the flames from the ReapNight bonfire rising around Susan making her beauty shimmer in the heat Making it shiver like a mirage Wretched glam he thought If I dashed you to the floor surely we would drown in the sea of tears that would pour out of your split belly    the tears of all those youve put to ruin And why not do it Left whole the nasty thing might be able to help them back to the Path of the Beam but Roland didnt believe they actually needed it He thought that TickTock and the creature which had called itself Flagg had been their last challenge in that regard The Green Palace was their door back to MidWorld  and it was theirs now They had conquered it by force of arms But you cant go yet gunslinger Not until youve finished your story told the last scene Whose voice was that Vannays No Corts No Nor was it the voice of his father who had once turned him naked out of a whores bed That was the hardest voice the one he often heard in his troubled dreams the one he wanted so to please and so seldom could No not that voice not this time This time what he heard was the voice of ka  ka like a wind He had told so much of that awful fourteenth year  but he hadnt finished the tale As with Detta Walker and the Blue Ladys forspecial plate there was one more thing A hidden thing The question wasnt he saw whether or not the five of them could find their way out of the Green Palace and recover the Path of the Beam the question was whether or not they could go on as katet If they were to do that there could be nothing hidden he would have to tell them of the final time he had looked into the wizards glass in that longago year Three nights past the welcoming banquet it had been He would have to tell them  No Roland the voice whispered Not just tell Not this time You know better Yes He knew better Come he said turning to them They drew slowly around him their eyes wide and filling with the balls flashing pink light Already they were halfhypnotized by it even Oy We are katet Roland said holding the ball toward them We are one from many I lost my one true love at the beginning of my quest for the Dark Tower Now look into this wretched thing if you would and see what I lost not long after See it once and for all see it very well They looked The ball cupped in Rolands upraised hands began to pulse faster It gathered them in and swept them away Caught and whirled in the grip of that pink storm they flew over the Wizards Rainbow to the Gilead that had been Jake of New York stands in an upper corridor of the Great Hall of Gilead more castles here in the green land than Mayors House He looks around and sees Susannah and Eddie standing by a tapestry their eyes big their hands tightly entwined And Susannah is standing she has her legs back at least for now and what she called cappies  have been replaced by a pair of ruby slippers exactly like those Dorothy wore when she stepped out upon her version of the Great Road to find the Wizard of Oz that bumhug She has her legs because this is a dream Jake thinks but knows it is no dream He looks down and sees Oy looking up at him with his anxious intelligent goldringed eyes He is still wearing the red booties Jake bends and strokes Oy s head The feel of the humblers fur under his hand is clear and real No this isnt a dream Yet Roland is not here he realizes they are four instead of five He realizes something else as well the air of this corridor is faintly pink and small pink halos revolve around the funny oldfashioned lightbulbs that illuminate the corridor Something is going to happen some story is going to play out in front of their eyes And now as if the very thought had summoned them the boy hears the click of approaching footfalls Its a story I know Jake thinks One Ive been told before As Roland comes around the corner he realizes what story it is the one where Marten Broadcloak stops Roland as Roland passes by on his way to the rooftop where it will perhaps be cooler You boy  Marten will say Come in Dont stand in the hall Your mother wants to speak to you  But of course that isnt the truth was never the truth will never be the truth no matter how much time slips and bends What Marten wants is for the boy to see his mother and to understand that Gabrielle Deschain has become the mistress of his fathers wizard Marten wants to goad the boy into an early test of manhood while his father is away and cant put a stop to it he wants to get the puppy out of his way before it can grow teeth long enough to bite Now they will see all this the sad comedy will go its sad and preordained course in front of their eyes Im too young Jake thinks but of course he is not too young Roland will be only three years older when he comes to Mejis with his friends and meets Susan upon the Great Road Only three years older when he loves her only three years older when he loses her I dont care I dont want to see it  And wont he realizes as Roland draws closer all that has already happened For this is not August the time of Full Earth but late fall or early winter He can tell by the serape Roland wears a souvenir of his trip to the Outer Arc and by the vapor that smokes from his mouth and nose each time he exhales no central heating in Gilead and its cold up here There are other changes as well Roland is now wearing the guns which are his birthright the big ones with the sandalwood grips His father passed them on at the banquet Jake thinks He doesnt know how he knows this but he does And Rolands face although still that of a boy is not the open untried face of the one who idled up this same corridor five months before the boy who was ensnared by Marten has been through much since then and his battle with Cort has been the very least of it Jake sees something else too the boy gunslinger is wearing the red cowboy boots He doesnt know it though Because this isnt really happening Yet somehow it is They are inside the wizards glass they are inside the pink storm those pink halos revolving around the light fixtures remind Jake of The Falls of the Hounds and the moonbows revolving in the mist and this is happening all over again Roland Eddie calls from where he and Susannah stand by the tapestry Susannah gasps and squeezes his shoulder wanting him to be silent but Eddie ignores her No Roland Dont Bad idea  No Olan Oy yaps Roland ignores both of them and he passes by Jake a hands breadth away without seeing him For Roland they are not here red boots or no red boots this katet is far in his future He stops at a door near the end of the corridor hesitates then raises his fist and knocks Eddie starts down the corridor toward him still holding Susannahs hand now he looks almost as if he is dragging her Come on Jake  says Eddie No I dont want to Its not about what you want and you know it Were supposed to see If we cant stop him we can at least do what we came here to do Now come on Heart heavy with dread his stomach clenched in a knot Jake comes along As they approach Roland  the guns look enormous on his slim hips and his unlined but already tired face somehow makes Jake feel like weeping  the gunslinger knocks again She aint there sugar Susannah shouts at him She aint there or she aint answering the door and which one it is dont matter to you Leave it Leave her She aint worth it Just bein your mother dont make her worth it Go away But he doesnt hear her either and he doesnt go away As Jake Eddie Susannah and Oy gather unseen behind him Roland tries the door to his mothers room and finds it unlocked He opens it revealing a shadowy chamber decorated with silk hangings On the floor is a rug that looks like the Persians beloved of Jakes mother    only this rug Jake knows comes from the Province of Kashamin On the far side of the parlor by a window which has been shuttered against the winter winds Jake sees a lowbacked chair and knows it is the one she was in on the day of Rolands manhood test it is where she was sitting when her son observed the lovebite on her neck The chair is empty now but as the gunslinger takes another step into the room and turns to look toward the apartments bedroom Jake observes a pair of shoes  black not red  beneath the drapes flanking the shuttered window Roland he shouts Roland behind the drapes Someone behind the drapes Look out But Roland doesnt hear Mother  he calls and even his voice is the same Jake would know it anywhere    but it is such a magically freshened version of it Young and uncracked by all the years of dust and wind and cigarette smoke Mother its Roland I want to talk to you Still no answer He walks down the short hall which leads to the bedroom Part of Jake wants to stay here in the parlor to go to that drape and yank it aside but he knows this isnt the way its supposed to go Even if he tried he doubts it would do any good his hand would likely pass right through like the hand of a ghost Come on  Eddie says Stay with him They go in a cluster that might have been comic under other circumstances Not under these here it is a case of three people desperate for the comfort of friends Roland stands looking at the bed against the rooms left wall He looks at it as if hypnotized Perhaps he is trying to imagine Marten in it with his mother perhaps he is remembering Susan with whom he never slept in a proper bed let alone a canopied luxury such as this Jake can see the gunslingers dim profile in a threepaneled mirror across the room in an alcove This triple glass stands in front of a small table the boy recognizes from his mothers side of his parents bedroom it is a vanity The gunslinger shakes himself and comes back from whatever thoughts have seized his mind On his feet are those terrible boots in this dim light they look like the boots of a man who has walked through a creek of blood Mother He takes a step toward the bed and actually bends a little as if he thinks she might be hiding under it If shes been hiding however it wasnt there the shoes which Jake saw beneath the drape were womens shoes and the shape which now stands at the end of the short corridor just outside the bedroom door is wearing a dress Jake can see its hem And he sees more than that Jake understands Rolands troubled relationship with his mother and father better than Eddie or Susannah ever could because Jakes own parents are peculiarly like them Elmer Chambers is a gunslinger for the Network and Megan Chambers has a long history of sleeping with sick friends This is nothing Jake has been told but he knows somehow he has shared khef with his mother and father and he knows what he knows He knows something about Roland as well that he saw his mother in the wizards glass It was Gabrielle Deschain fresh back from her retreat in Debaria Gabrielle who would confess to her husband the errors of her ways and her thinking after the banquet who would cry his pardon and beg to be taken back to his bed   and when Steven drowsed after their lovemaking she would bury the knife in his breast    or perhaps only lightly scratch his arm with it not even waking him With that knife it would come to the same either way Roland had seen it all in the glass before finally turning the wretched thing over to his father and Roland had put a stop to it To save Steven Deschain s life Eddie and Susannah would have said had they seen so far into the business but Jake has the unhappy wisdom of unhappy children and sees further To save his mothers life as well To give her one last chance to recover her sanity one last chance to stand at her husbands side and be true One last chance to repent of Marten Broadcloak Surely she will surely she must Roland saw her face that day how unhappy she was and surely she must Surely she cannot have chosen the magician If he can only make her see    So unaware that he has once more lapsed into the unwisdom of the very young  Roland cannot grasp that unhappiness and shame are often no match for desire  he has come here to speak to his mother to beg her to come back to her husband before its too late He has saved her from herself once he will tell her but he cannot do it again And if she still wont go Jake thinks or tries to brave it out pretend she doesnt know what hes talking about hell give her a choice leave Gilead with his help  now tonight  or be clapped in chains tomorrow morning a traitor so outrageous she will almost certainly be hung as Hax the cook was hung Mother  he calls still unaware of the shape standing in the shadows behind him He takes one further step into the room and now the shape moves The shape raises its hands There is something in its hands Not a gun Jake can tell that much but it has a deadly look to it a snaky look somehow  Roland watch out Susannah shrieks and her voice is like a magical switch There is something on the dressing table  the glass of course Gabrielle has stolen it its what she II bring to her lover as a consolation prize for the murder her son prevented  and now it lights as if in response to Susannahs voice It sprays brilliant pink light up the triple mirror and casts its glow back into the room In that light in that triple glass Roland finally sees the figure behind him Christ Eddie Dean shrieks horrifiedoh christ roland thats not your mother Thats   Its not even a woman not really not anymore it is a kind of living corpse in a roadfilthy black dress There are only a few straggling tufts of hair left on her head and theres a gaping hole where her nose used to be but her eyes still blaze and the snake she holds wriggling between her hands is very lively Even in his own horror Jake has time to wonder if she got it from under the same rock where she found the one Roland killed It is Rhea who has been waiting for the gunslinger in his mothers apartment it is the Coos come not just to retrieve her glam but to finish with the boy who has caused her so much trouble Now ye trollops get she cries shrilly cackling Now yell pay But Roland has seen her in the glass he has seen her Rhea betrayed by the very ball she came to take back and now he is whirling his hands dropping to his new guns with all their deadly speed He is fourteen his reflexes are the sharpest and quickest they II ever be and he goes off like exploding gunpowder No Roland dont Susannah screams Its a trick its a glam Jake has just time to look from the mirror to the woman actually standing in the doorway has just time to realize he too has been tricked Perhaps Roland also understands the truth at the last splitsecond  that the woman in the doorway really is his mother after all that the thing in her hands isnt a snake but a belt something she has made for him a peace offering mayhap that the glass has lied to him in the only way it canby reflection In any case its too late The guns are out and thundering their bright yellow flashes lighting the room He pulls the trigger of each gun twice before he can stop and the four slugs drive Gabrielle Deschain back into the corridor with the hopeful canwemakepeace smile still on her face She dies that way smiling Roland stands where he is the smoking guns in his hands his face cramped in a grimace of surprise and horror just beginning to get the truth of what he must carry with him the rest of his life he has used the guns of his father to kill his mother Now cackling laughter fills the room Roland does not turn he is frozen by the woman in the blue dress and black shoes who lies bleeding in the corridor of her apartment the woman he came to save and has killed instead She lies with the handwoven belt draped across her bleeding stomach Jake turns for him and is not surprised to see a greenfaced woman in a pointed black hat swimming inside the hall It is the Wicked Witch of the East it is also he knows Rhea of the Coos She stares at the boy with the guns in his hands and bares her teeth at him in the most terrible grin Jake has ever seen in his life Ive burned the stupid girl ye loved  aye burned her alive I did  and now Ive made ye a matricide Do ye repent of killing my snake yet gunslinger My poor sweet Ermot Do ye regret playing yer hard games with one more trig than ye II ever be in yer miserable life  He gives no sign that he hears only stares at his lady mother Soon he will go to her kneel by her but not yet not yet The face in the ball now turns toward the three pilgrims and as it does it changes becomes old and bald and raddled  becomes in fact the face Roland saw in the lying mirror The gunslinger has been unable to see his future friends but Rhea sees them aye she sees them very well Cry it off  she croaks  it is the caw of a raven sitting on a leafless branch beneath a winterdimmed sky Cry it off Renounce the Tower Never you bitch  Eddie says Ye see what he is What a monster he is And this is only the beginning of it ye ken Ask him what happened to Cuthbert To Alain  Alain s touch clever as twas saved him not in the end so it didnt Ask him what happened to Jamie De Curry He never had a friend he didnt kill never had a lover whos not dust in the wind Go your way  Susannah says and leave us to ours  Rheas green cracked lips twist in a horrible sneer Hes killed his own mother What will he do to you ye stupid brownskinned bitch   He didnt kill her  Jake said You killed her Now go Jake takes a step toward the ball meaning to pick it up and dash it to the floor    and he can do that he realizes for the ball is real Its the one thing in this vision that is But before he can put his hands to it it flashes a soundless explosion of pink light Jake throws his hands up in front of his face to keep from being blinded and then he is melting Im melting what a world oh what a world falling he is being whirled down through the pink storm out of Oz and back to Kansas out of Oz and back to Kansas out of Oz and back to    home Eddie muttered His voice sounded thick and punchdrunk to his own ears Back home because theres no place like home no indeed He tried to open his eyes and at first couldnt It was as if they were glued shut He put the heel of his hand to his forehead and pushed up tightening the skin on his face It worked his eyes popped open He saw neither the throneroom of the Green Palace nor and this was what he had really expected the richly appointed but somehow claustrophobic bedroom in which he had just been He was outside lying in a small clearing of winterwhite grass Nearby was a little grove of trees some still with their last brown leaves clinging to the branches And one branch with an odd white leaf an albino leaf There was a pretty trickle of running water farther into the grove Standing abandoned in the high grass was Susannahs new and improved wheelchair There was mud on the tires Eddie saw and a few late leaves crispy and brown caught in the spokes A few swatches of grass too Overhead was a skyful of still white clouds every bit as interesting as a laundrybasket full of sheets The sky was clear when we went inside the Palace he thought and realized time had slipped again How much or how little he wasnt sure he wanted to know  Rolands world was like a transmission with its gearteeth all but stripped away you never knew when time was going to pop into neutral or race you away in overdrive Was this Rolands world though And if it was how had they gotten back to it How should I know Eddie croaked and got slowly to his feet wincing as he did so He didnt think he was hungover but his legs were sore and he felt as if he had just taken the worlds heaviest Sunday afternoon nap Roland and Susannah lay on the ground under the trees The gunslinger was stirring but Susannah lay on her back arms spread extravagantly wide snoring in an unladylike way that made Eddie grin Jake was nearby with Oy sleeping on his side by one of the kids knees As Eddie looked at them Jake opened his eyes and sat up His gaze was wide but blank he was awake but had been so heavily asleep he didnt know it yet Gruz Jake said and yawned Yep Eddie said that works for me He turned in a slow circle and had gotten three quarters of the way back to where hed started when he saw the Green Palace on the horizon From here it looked very small and its brilliance had been robbed by the sunless day Eddie guessed it might be thirty miles away Leading toward them from that direction were the tracks of Susannahs wheelchair He could hear the thinny but faintly He thought he could see it as well  a quicksilver shimmer like bogwater stretching across the flat open land   and finally drying up about five miles away Five miles west of here Given the location of the Green Palace and the fact that they had been travelling east on  that was the natural assumption but who really knew especially with no visible sun to use for orientation Wheres the turnpike Jake asked His voice sounded thick and gummy Oy joined him stretching first one rear leg then the other Eddie saw he had lost one of his booties at some point Maybe it was cancelled due to lack of interest I dont think were in Kansas anymore Jake said Eddie looked at him sharply but didnt believe the kid was consciously riffing on The Wizard of Oz Not the one where the Kansas City Royals play not the one where the Monarchs play either What gives you that idea Jake hoisted a thumb toward the sky and when Eddie looked up he saw that he had been wrong it wasnt all still white overcast boring as a basket of sheets Directly above their heads a band of clouds was moiling toward the horizon as steadily as a conveyor belt They were back on the Path of the Beam  Eddie Where you at sugar Eddie looked down from the lane of clouds in the sky and saw Susannah sitting up rubbing the back of her neck She looked unsure of where she was Perhaps even of who she was The red cappies she was wearing looked oddly dull in this light but they were still the brightest things in Eddies view  until he looked down at his own feet and saw the streetboppers with their Cuban heels Yet these also looked dull and Eddie no longer thought it was just the days cloudy light that made them seem so He looked at Jakes shoes Oys remaining three slippers Rolands cowboy boots the gunslinger was sitting up now arms crossed around his knees looking blankly off into the distance All the same ruby red but a lifeless red somehow As if some magic essential to them had been used up Suddenly Eddie wanted them off his feet He sat down beside Susannah gave her a kiss and said Good morning Sleeping Beauty Or afternoon if its that Then quickly almost hating to touch them it was like touching dead skin somehow Eddie yanked off the streetboppers As he did he saw that they were scuffed at the toes and muddy at the heels no longer new looking Hed wondered how theyd gotten here now feeling the ache in the muscles of his legs and remembering the wheelchair tracks he knew They had walked by God Walked in their sleep That Susannah said is the best idea youve had since    well in a long time She stripped off the cappies Close by Eddie saw Jake taking off Oys booties Were we there Susannah asked him Eddie were we really there when he When I killed my mother Roland said Yes you were there As I was Gods help me I was there I did it He covered his face with his hands and began to voice a series of harsh sobs Susannah crawled across to him in that agile way that was almost a version of walking She put an arm around him and used her other hand to take his hands away from his face At first Roland didnt want to let her do that but she was persistent and at last his hands  those killers hands  came down revealing haunted eyes which swam with tears Susannah urged his face down against her shoulder Be easy Roland she said Be easy and let it go This part is over now You past it A man doesnt get past such a thing Roland said No I dont think so Not ever You didnt kill her Eddie said Thats too easy The gunslingers face was still against Susannahs shoulder but his words were clear enough Some responsibilities cant be shirked Some sins cant be shirked Yes Rhea was there  in a way at least  but I cant shift it all to the Coos much as I might like to It wasnt her either Eddie said Thats not what I mean Roland raised his head What in hells name are you talking about Ka  Eddie said Ka like a wind  In their packs there was food none of them had put there  cookies with Keebler elves on the packages Saran Wrapped sandwiches that looked like the kind you could get if you were desperate that was from turnpike vending machines and a brand of cola neither Eddie Susannah nor Jake knew It tasted like Coke and came in a red and white can but the brand was NozzALa They ate a meal with their backs to the grove and their faces to the distant glamgleam of the Green Palace and called it lunch If we start to lose the light in an hour or so we can make it supper by voice vote Eddie thought but he didnt believe theyd need to His interior clock was running again now and that mysterious but usually accurate device suggested that it was early afternoon At one point he stood up and raised his soda smiling into an invisible camera When Im travelling through the Land of Oz in my new Takuro Spirit I drink NozzALa he proclaimed It fills me up but never fills me out It makes me happy to be a man It makes me know God It gives me the outlook of an angel and the balls of a tiger When I drink NozzALa I say Gosh Aint I glad to be alive I say   Sit down you bumhug Jake said laughing Ug Oy agreed His snout was on Jakes ankle and he was watching the boys sandwich with great interest Eddie started to sit and then that strange albino leaf caught his eye again Thats no leaf he thought and walked over to it No not a leaf but a scrap of paper He turned it over and saw columns of blah blah and yak yak and all the stuffs the same Usually newspapers werent blank on one side but Eddie wasnt surprised to find thisone was  the oz Daily Buzz had only been a prop after all Nor was the blank side blank Printed on it in neat careful letters was this message Below that a little drawing Eddie brought the note back to where the others were eating Each of them looked at it Roland held it last ran his thumb over it thoughtfully feeling the texture of the paper then gave it back to Eddie RF Eddie said The man who was running TickTock This is from him isnt it Yes He must have brought the TickTock Man out of Lud Sure Jake said darkly That guy Flagg looked like someone whod know a firstclass bumhug when he found one But how did they get here before us What could be faster than Blaine the Mono for cripes sake A door Eddie said Maybe they came through one of those special doors Bingo Susannah said She held her hand out palm up and Eddie slapped it In any case what he suggests is not bad advice Roland said I urge you to consider it most seriously And if you want to go back to your world I will allow you to go Roland I cant believe you Eddie said This after you dragged me and Suze over here kicking and screaming You know what my brother would say about you That youre as contrary as a hog on iceskates I did what I did before I learned to know you as friends Roland said Before I learned to love you as I loved Alain and Cuthbert And before I was forced to  to revisit certain scenes Doing that has  He paused looking down at his feet he had put his old boots back on again and thinking hard At last he looked up again There was a part of me that hadnt moved or spoken in a good many years  thought it was dead It isnt I have learned to love again and Im aware that this is probably my last chance to love Im slow  Vannay and Cort knew that so did my father  but Im not stupid Then dont act that way Eddie said Or treat us as if we were What you call the bottom line Eddie is this I get my friends killed And Im not sure I can even risk doing that again Jake especially  I never mind I dont have the words For the first time since I turned around in a dark room and killed my mother I may have found something more important than the Tower Leave it at that All right I guess I can respect that So can I Susannah said but Eddies right about ka She took the note and ran a finger over it thoughtfully Roland you cant talk about that  ka I mean  then turn around and take it back again just because you get a little low on willpower and dedication Willpower and dedication are good words Roland remarked Theres a bad one though that means the same thing That one is obsession She shrugged it away with an impatient twitch of her shoulders Sugarpie either this whole business is ka or none of it is And scary as ka might be  the idea of fate with eagle eyes and a bloodhounds nose  I find the idea of no ka even scarier She tossed the RF note aside on the matted grass Whatever you call it youre just as dead if it runs you over Roland said Rimer    Thorin    Jonas    my mother    Cuthbert    Susan Just ask them Any of them If you only could Youre missing the biggest part of this Eddie said You cant send us back Dont you realize that you big galoot Even if there was a door we wouldnt go through it Am I wrong about that He looked at Jake and Susannah They shook their heads Even Oy shook his head No he wasnt wrong Weve changed Eddie said We Now he was the one who didnt know how to go on How to express his need to see the Tower    and his other need just as strong to go on carrying the gun with the sandalwood insets The big iron was how hed come to think of it Like in that old Marty Robbins song about the man with the big iron on his hip Its ka he said It was all he could think of that was big enough to cover it Kaka Roland replied after a moments consideration The three of them stared at him mouths open Roland of Gilead had made a joke  Theres one thing I dont understand about what we saw Susannah said hesitantly Why did your mother hide behind that drape when you came in Roland Did she mean to She bit her lip then brought it out Did she mean to kill you If shed meant to kill me she wouldnt have chosen a belt as her weapon The very fact that she had made me a present  and thats what it was it had my initials woven into it  suggests that she meant to ask my forgiveness That she had had a change of heart Is that what you know or only what you want to believe Eddie thought It was a question he would never ask Roland had been tested enough had won their way back to the Path of the Beam by reliving that terrible final visit to his mothers apartment and that was enough I think she hid because she was ashamed the gunslinger saidorbecause she needed a moment to think of what to say to me Of how to explain And the ball Susannah asked him gently Was it on the vanity table where we saw it And did she steal it from your father Yes to both Roland said Although    did she steal it He seemed to ask this question of himself My father knew a great many things but he sometimes kept what he knew to himself Like him knowing that your mother and Marten were seeing each other Susannah said Yes But Roland   you surely dont believe that your father would knowingly have allowed you to  to  Roland looked at her with large haunted eyes His tears had gone but when he tried to smile at her question he was unable Have knowingly allowed his son to kill his wife he asked No I cant say that Much as Id like to I cant That he should have caused such a thing to have happened to have deliberately set it in motion like a man playing Castles    that I cannot believe But would he allow ka to run its course Aye most certainly What happened to the ball Jake asked I dont know I fainted When I awoke my mother and  were still alone one dead and one alive No one had come to the sound of the shots  the walls of that place were thick stone and that wing mostly empty as well Her blood had dried The belt shed made me was covered with it but I took it and I put it on I wore that bloodstained gift for many years and how I lost it is a tale for another day  Ill tell it to you before we have done for it bears on my quest for the Tower But although no one had come to investigate the gunshots someone had come for another reason While I lay fainted away by my mothers corpse that someone came in and took the wizards glass away Rhea Eddie asked I doubt she was so close in her body  but she had a way of making friends that one Aye a way of making friends I saw her again you know Roland explained no further but a stony gleam arose in his eyes Eddie had seen it before and knew it meant killing Jake had retrieved the note from RF and now gestured at the little drawing beneath the message Do you know what this means I have an idea its the sigul of a place I saw when I first travelled in the wizards glass The land called Thunderclap He looked around at them one by one I think its there that well meet this man  this thing  named Flagg again Roland looked back the way they had come sleepwalking in their fine red shoes The Kansas we came through was his Kansas and the plague that emptied out that land was his plague At least thats what I believe But it might not stay there Susannah said It could travel Eddie said To our world Jake said Still looking back toward the Green Palace Roland said To your world or any other Whos the Crimson King Susannah asked abruptly Susannah I know not They were quiet then watching Roland look toward the palace where he had faced a false wizard and a true memory and somehow opened the door back to his own world by so doing Our world Eddie thought slipping an arm around Susannah Our world now If we go back to America and perhaps well have to before this is over we II arrive as strangers in a strange land no matter what when it is This is our world now The world of the Beams and the Guardians and the Dark Tower We got some daylight left he said to Roland and put a hesitant hand on the gunslingers shoulder When Roland immediately covered it with his own hand Eddie smiled You want to use it or what Yes Roland said Lets use it He bent and shouldered his pack What about the shoes Susannah asked looking doubtfully at the little red pile they had made Leave them here Eddie said Theyve served their purpose Into your wheelchair girl He put his arms around her and helped her in All Gods children have shoes Roland mused Isnt that what you said Susannah Well she said settling herself the correct dialect adds a soupcon of flavor but youve got the essence honey yes Then well undoubtedly find more shoes as God wills it Roland said Jake was looking into his knapsack taking inventory of the foodstuffs that had been added by some unknown hand He held up a chicken leg in a Baggie looked at it then looked at Eddie Who do you suppose packed this stuff Eddie raised his eyebrows as if to ask Jake how he could possibly be so stupid The Keebler Elves he said Who else Come on lets go  They clustered near the grove five wanderers on the face of an empty land Ahead of them running across the plain was a line in the grass which exactly matched the lane of rushing clouds in the sky This line was nothing so obvious as a path    but to the awakened eye the way that everything bent in the same direction was as clear as a painted stripe The Path of the Beam Somewhere ahead where this Beam intersected all the others stood the Dark Tower Eddie thought that if the wind were right he would almost be able to smell its sullen stone And roses  the dusky scent of roses He took Susannahs hand as she sat in her chair Susannah took Rolands Roland took Jakes Oy stood two paces before them head up scenting the autumn air that combed his fur with unseen fingers his goldringed eyes wide We are katet Eddie said It crossed his mind to wonder at how much hed changed how he had become a stranger even to himself We are one from many Katet  Susannah said We are one from many One from many Jake said Come on lets go Bird and bear and hare and fish Eddie thought With Oy in the lead they once more set out for the Dark Tower walking along the Path of the Beam AFTERWORD The scene in which Roland bests his old teacher Cort and goes off to roister in the less savory section of Gilead was written in the spring of  The one in which Rolands father shows up the following morning was written in the summer of  Although only sixteen hours pass between the two occurrences in the world of the story twentysix years had passed in the life of the storys teller Yet the moment finally came and I found myself confronting myself across a whores bed  the unemployed schoolboy with the long black hair and beard on one side the successful popular novelist Americas shlockmeister as I am affectionately known by my legions of admiring critics on the other I mention this only because it sums up the essential weirdness of the Dark Tower experience for me I have written enough novels and short stories to fill a solar system of the imagination but Rolands story is my Jupiter  a planet that dwarfs all the others at least from my own perspective a place of strange atmosphere crazy landscape and savage gravitational pull Dwarfs the others did I say I think theres more to it than that actually I am coming to understand that Rolands world or worlds actually contains all the others of my making there is a place in MidWorld for Randall Flagg Ralph Roberts the wandering boys from The Eyes of the Dragon even Father Callahan the damned priest from Salem s Lot who rode out of New England on a Greyhound Bus and wound up dwelling on the border of a terrible MidWorld land called Thunderclap This seems to be where they all finish up and why not MidWorld was here first before all of them dreaming under the blue gaze of Rolands bombardier eyes This book has been too long in coming  a good many readers who enjoy Rolands adventures have all but howled in frustration  and for that I apologize The reason is best summed up by Susannahs thought as she prepares to tell Blaine the first riddle of their contest It is hard to begin Theres nothing in these pages that I agree with more I knew that Wizard and Glass meant doubling back to Rolands young days and to his first love affair and I was scared to death of that story Suspense is relatively easy at least for me love is hard Consequently I dallied I temporized I procrastinated and the book remained unwritten I began at last working in motel rooms on my Macintosh PowerBook while driving crosscountry from Colorado to Maine after finishing my work on the miniseries version of The Shining It occurred to me as I drove north through the deserted miles of western Nebraska where I also happened to be driving back from Colorado when I got the idea for a story called Children of the Corn that if I didnt start soon I would never write the book at all But I no longer know the truth of romantic love I told myself I know about marriage and mature love but fortyeight has a way of forgetting the heat and passion of seventeen I will help you with that part came the reply I didnt know who that voice belonged to on that day outside Thetford Nebraska but I do now because I have looked into his eyes across a whores bed in a land that exists very clearly in my imagination Rolands love for Susan Delgado and hers for him is what was told to me by the boy who began this story If its right thank him If its wrong blame whatever got lost in the translation Also thank my friend Chuck Verrill who edited the book and hung with me every step of the way His encouragement and help were invaluable as was the encouragement of Elaine Koster who has published all of these cowboy romances in paperback Most thanks of all go to my wife who supports me in this madness as best she can and helped me on this book in a way she doesnt even know Once in a dark time she gave me a funny little rubber figure that made me smile Its Rocket J Squirrel wearing his blue aviators hat and with his arms bravely outstretched I put that figure on my manuscript as it grew and grew  and grew hoping some of the love that came with it would kind of fertilize the work It must have worked at least to a degree the book is here after all I dont know if its good or bad  I lost all sense of perspective around page four hundred  but its here That alone seems like a miracle And I have started to believe I might actually live to complete this cycle of stories Knock on wood There are three more to be told I think two set chiefly in MidWorld and one almost entirely in our world  thats the one dealing with the vacant lot on the comer of Second and Fortysixth and the rose that grows there That rose I must tell you is in terrible danger In the end Rolands katet will come to the nightscape which is Thunderclap    and to what lies beyond it All may not live to reach the Tower but I believe that those who do reach it will stand and be true  Stephen King Lovell Maine October
