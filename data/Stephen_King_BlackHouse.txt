in the fluid present where clearsightedness never guarantees perfect vision Here about two hundred feet the height of a gliding eagle above Wisconsins far western edge where the vagaries of the Mississippi River declare a natural border Now an early Friday morning in midJuly a few years into both a new century and a new millennium their wayward courses so hidden that a blind man has a better chance of seeing what lies ahead than you or I Right here and now the hour is just past six AM and the sun stands low in the cloudless eastern sky a fat confident yellowwhite ball advancing as ever for the first time toward the future and leaving in its wake the steadily accumulating past which darkens as it recedes making blind men of us all Below the early sun touches the rivers wide soft ripples with molten highlights Sunlight glints from the tracks of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad running between the riverbank and the backs of the shabby twostory houses along County Road Oo known as Nailhouse Row the lowest point of the comfortablelooking little town extending uphill and eastward beneath us At this moment in the Coulee Country life seems to be holding its breath The motionless air around us carries such remarkable purity and sweetness that you might imagine a man could smell a radish pulled out of the ground a mile away Moving toward the sun we glide away from the river and over the shining tracks the backyards and roofs of Nailhouse Row then a line of HarleyDavidson motorcycles tilted on their kickstands These unprepossessing little houses were built early in the century recently vanished for the metal pourers mold makers and crate men employed by the Pederson Nail factory On the grounds that working stiffs would be unlikely to complain about the flaws in their subsidized accommodations they were constructed as cheaply as possible Pederson Nail which had suffered multiple hemorrhages during the fifties finally bled to death in  The waiting Harleys suggest that the factory hands have been replaced by a motorcycle gang The uniformly ferocious appearance of the Harleys owners wildhaired bushybearded swagbellied men sporting earrings black leather jackets and less than the full complement of teeth would seem to support this assumption Like most assumptions this one embodies an uneasy halftruth The current residents of Nailhouse Row whom suspicious locals dubbed the Thunder Five soon after they took over the houses along the river cannot so easily be categorized They have skilled jobs in the Kingsland Brewing Company located just out of town to the south and one block east of the Mississippi If we look to our right we can see the worlds largest sixpack storage tanks painted over with gigantic Kingsland OldTime Lager labels The men who live on Nailhouse Row met one another on the UrbanaChampaign campus of the University of Illinois where all but one were undergraduates majoring in English or philosophy The exception was a resident in surgery at the UIUC university hospital They get an ironic pleasure from being called the Thunder Five the name strikes them as sweetly cartoonish What they call themselves is the Hegelian Scum These gentlemen form an interesting crew and we will make their acquaintance later on For now we have time only to note the handpainted posters taped to the fronts of several houses two lamp poles and a couple of abandoned buildings The posters say FISHERMAN YOU BETTER PRAY TO YOUR STINKING GOD WE DONT CATCH YOU FIRST REMEMBER AMY From Nailhouse Row Chase Street runs steeply uphill between listing buildings with worn unpainted facades the color of fog the old Nelson Hotel where a few impoverished residents lie sleeping a blankfaced tavern a tired shoe store displaying Red Wing workboots behind its filmy picture window a few other dim buildings that bear no indication of their function and seem oddly dreamlike and vaporous These structures have the air of failed resurrections of having been rescued from the dark westward territory although they were still dead In a way that is precisely what happened to them An ocher horizontal stripe ten feet above the sidewalk on the facade of the Nelson Hotel and two feet from the rising ground on the opposed ashen faces of the last two buildings represents the highwater mark left behind by the flood of  when the Mississippi rolled over its banks drowned the railroad tracks and Nailhouse Row and mounted nearly to the top of Chase Street Where Chase rises above the flood line and levels out it widens and undergoes a transformation into the main street of French Landing the town beneath us The Agincourt Theater the Taproom Bar  Grille the First Farmer State Bank the Samuel Stutz Photography Studio which does a steady business in graduation photos wedding pictures and childrens portraits and shops not the ghostly relics of shops line its blunt sidewalks Bentons Rexall drugstore Reliable Hardware Saturday Night Video Regal Clothing Schmitts Allsorts Emporium stores selling electronic equipment magazines and greeting cards toys and athletic clothing featuring the logos of the Brewers the Twins the Packers the Vikings and the University of Wisconsin After a few blocks the name of the street changes to Lyall Road and the buildings separate and shrink into onestory wooden structures fronted with signs advertising insurance offices and travel agencies after that the street becomes a highway that glides eastward past a Eleven the Reinhold T Grauerhammer VFW Hall a big farmimplement dealership known locally as Goltzs and into a landscape of flat unbroken fields If we rise another hundred feet into the immaculate air and scan what lies beneath and ahead we see kettle moraines coulees blunted hills furry with pines loamrich valleys invisible from ground level until you have come upon them meandering rivers mileslong patchwork fields and little towns  one of them Centralia no more than a scattering of buildings around the intersection of two narrow highways  and  Directly below us French Landing looks as though it had been evacuated in the middle of the night No one moves along the sidewalks or bends to insert a key into one of the locks of the shop fronts along Chase Street The angled spaces before the shops are empty of the cars and pickup trucks that will begin to appear first by ones and twos then in a mannerly little stream an hour or two later No lights burn behind the windows in the commercial buildings or the unpretentious houses lining the surrounding streets A block north of Chase on Sumner Street four matching redbrick buildings of two stories each house in westeast order the French Landing Public Library the offices of Patrick J Skarda MD the local general practitioner and Bell  Holland a twoman law firm now run by Garland Bell and Julius Holland the sons of its founders the Heartfield  Son Funeral Home now owned by a vast funereal empire centered in St Louis and the French Landing Post Office Separated from these by a wide driveway into a goodsized parking lot at the rear the building at the end of the block where Sumner intersects with Third Street is also of red brick and two stories high but longer than its immediate neighbors Unpainted iron bars block the rear secondfloor windows and two of the four vehicles in the parking lot are patrol cars with light bars across their tops and the letters FLPD on their sides The presence of police cars and barred windows seems incongruous in this rural fastness  what sort of crime can happen here Nothing serious surely surely nothing worse than a little shoplifting drunken driving and an occasional bar fight As if in testimony to the peacefulness and regularity of smalltown life a red van with the words LA RIVIERE HERALD on its side panels drifts slowly down Third Street pausing at nearly all of the mailbox stands for its driver to insert copies of the days newspaper wrapped in a blue plastic bag into gray metal cylinders bearing the same words When the van turns onto Sumner where the buildings have mail slots instead of boxes the route man simply throws the wrapped papers at the front doors Blue parcels thwack against the doors of the police station the funeral home and the office buildings The post office does not get a paper What do you know lights are burning behind the front downstairs windows of the police station The door opens A tall darkhaired young man in a pale blue shortsleeved uniform shirt a Sam Browne belt and navy trousers steps outside The wide belt and the gold badge on Bobby Dulacs chest gleam in the fresh sunlight and everything he is wearing including the mm pistol strapped to his hip seems as newly made as Bobby Dulac himself He watches the red van turn left onto Second Street and frowns at the rolled newspaper He nudges it with the tip of a black highly polished shoe bending over just far enough to suggest that he is trying to read the headlines through the plastic Evidently this technique does not work all that well Still frowning Bobby tilts all the way over and picks up the newspaper with unexpected delicacy the way a mother cat picks up a kitten in need of relocation Holding it a little distance away from his body he gives a quick glance up and down Sumner Street aboutfaces smartly and steps back into the station We who in our curiosity have been steadily descending toward the interesting spectacle presented by Officer Dulac go inside behind him A gray corridor leads past a blank door and a bulletin board with very little on it to two sets of metal stairs one going down to a small locker room shower stalls and a firing range the other upward to an interrogation room and two facing rows of cells none presently occupied Somewhere near a radio talk show is playing at a level that seems too loud for a peaceful morning Bobby Dulac opens the unmarked door and enters with us on his shiny heels the ready room he has just left A rank of filing cabinets stands against the wall to our right beside them a beatup wooden table on which sit neat stacks of papers in folders and a transistor radio the source of the discordant noise From the nearby studio of KDCUAM Your Talk Voice in the Coulee Country the entertainingly rabid George Rathbun has settled into Badger Barrage his popular morning broadcast Good old George sounds too loud for the occasion no matter how low you dial the volume the guy is just flatout noisy  thats part of his appeal Set in the middle of the wall directly opposite us is a closed door with a dark pebbleglass window on which has been painted DALE GILBERTSON CHIEF OF POLICE Dale will not be in for another half hour or so Two metal desks sit at right angles to each other in the corner to our left and from the one that faces us Tom Lund a fairhaired officer of roughly his partners age but without his appearance of having been struck gleaming from the mint five minutes before regards the bag tweezed between two fingers of Bobby Dulacs right hand All right Lund says Okay The latest installment You thought maybe the Thunder Five was paying us another social call Here I dont want to read the damn thing Not deigning to look at the newspaper Bobby sends the new days issue of the La Riviere Herald sailing in a flat fast arc across ten feet of wooden floor with an athletic snap of his wrist spins rightward takes a long stride and positions himself in front of the wooden table a moment before Tom Lund fields his throw Bobby glares at the two names and various details scrawled on the long chalkboard hanging on the wall behind the table He is not pleased Bobby Dulac he looks as though he might burst out of his uniform through the sheer force of his anger Fat and happy in the KDCU studio George Rathbun yells Caller gimme a break willya and get your prescription fixed Are we talking about the same game here Caller   Maybe Wendell got some sense and decided to lay off Tom Lund says Wendell Bobby says Because Lund can see only the sleek dark back of his head the little sneering thing he does with his lip wastes motion but he does it anyway Caller let me ask you this one question and in all sincerity I want you to be honest with me Did you actually see last nights game I didnt know Wendell was a big buddy of yours Bobby says I didnt know you ever got as far south as La Riviere Here I was thinking your idea of a big night out was a pitcher of beer and trying to break one hundred at the Arden BowlADrome and now I find out you hang out with newspaper reporters in college towns Probably get down and dirty with the Wisconsin Rat too that guy on KWLA Do you pick up a lot of punk babes that way The caller says he missed the first inning on account of he had to pick up his kid after a special counseling session at Mount Hebron but he sure saw everything after that Did I say Wendell Green was a friend of mine asks Tom Lund Over Bobbys left shoulder he can see the first of the names on the chalkboard His gaze helplessly focuses on it Its just I met him after the Kinderling case and the guy didnt seem so bad Actually I kind of liked him Actually I wound up feeling sorry for him He wanted to do an interview with Hollywood and Hollywood turned him down flat Well naturally he saw the extra innings the hapless caller says thats how he knows Pokey Reese was safe And as for the Wisconsin Rat I wouldnt know him if I saw him and I think that socalled music he plays sounds like the worst bunch of crap I ever heard in my life How did that scrawny pastyface creep get a radio show in the first place On the college station What does that tell you about our wonderful UWCLa Riviere Bobby What does it say about our whole society Oh I forgot you like that shit No I like  and Korn and youre so out of it you cant tell the difference between Jonathan Davis and Dee Dee Ramone but forget about that all right Slowly Bobby Dulac turns around and smiles at his partner Stop stalling His smile is none too pleasant Im stalling Tom Lund widens his eyes in a parody of wounded innocence Gee was it me who fired the paper across the room No I guess not If you never laid eyes on the Wisconsin Rat how come you know what he looks like Same way I know he has funnycolored hair and a pierced nose Same way I know he wears a beattoshit black leather jacket day in day out rain or shine Bobby waited By the way he sounds Peoples voices are full of information A guy says Looks like itll turn out to be a nice day he tells you his whole life story Want to know something else about Rat Boy He hasnt been to the dentist in six seven years His teeth look like shit From within KDCUs ugly cementblock structure next to the brewery on Peninsula Drive via the radio Dale Gilbertson donated to the station house long before either Tom Lund or Bobby Dulac first put on their uniforms comes good old dependable George Rathbuns patented bellow of genial outrage a passionate inclusive uproar that for a hundred miles around causes breakfasting farmers to smile across their tables at their wives and passing truckers to laugh out loud I swear caller and this goes for my last last caller too and every single one of you out there I love you dearly that is the honest truth I love you like my momma loved her turnip patch but sometimes you people DRIVE ME CRAZY Oh boy Top of the eleventh inning two outs SixCseven Reds Men on second and third Batter lines to short center field Reese takes off from third good throw to the plate clean tag clean tag A BLIND MAN COULDA MADE THAT CALL Hey I thought it was a good tag and I only heard it on the radio says Tom Lund Both men are stalling and they know it In fact shouts the handsdown most popular Talk Voice of the Coulee Country let me go out on a limb here boys and girls let me make the following recommendation okay Lets replace every umpire at Miller Park hey every umpire in the National League with BLIND MEN You know what my friends I guarantee a sixty to seventy percent improvement in the accuracy of their calls GIVE THE JOB TO THOSE WHO CAN HANDLE IT  THE BLIND Mirth suffuses Tom Lunds bland face That George Rathbun man hes a hoot Bobby says Come on okay Grinning Lund pulls the folded newspaper out of its wrapper and flattens it on his desk His face hardens without altering its shape his grin turns stony Oh no Oh hell What Lund utters a shapeless groan and shakes his head Jesus I dont even want to know Bobby rams his hands into his pockets then pulls himself perfectly upright jerks his right hand free and clamps it over his eyes Im a blind guy all right Make me an umpire  I dont wanna be a cop anymore Lund says nothing Its a headline Like a banner headline How bad is it Bobby pulls his hand away from his eyes and holds it suspended in midair Well Lund tells him it looks like Wendell didnt get some sense after all and he sure as hell didnt decide to lay off I cant believe I said I liked the dipshit Wake up Bobby says Nobody ever told you law enforcement officers and journalists are on opposite sides of the fence Tom Lunds ample torso tilts over his desk A thick lateral crease like a scar divides his forehead and his stolid cheeks burn crimson He aims a finger at Bobby Dulac This is one thing that really gets me about you Bobby How long have you been here Five six months Dale hired me four years ago and when him and Hollywood put the cuffs on Mr Thornberg Kinderling which was the biggest case in this county for maybe thirty years I cant claim any credit but at least I pulled my weight I helped put some of the pieces together One of the pieces Bobby says I reminded Dale about the girl bartender at the Taproom and Dale told Hollywood and Hollywood talked to the girl and that was a big big piece It helped get him So dont you talk to me that way Bobby Dulac assumes a look of completely hypothetical contrition Sorry Tom I guess Im kind of wound up and beat to shit at the same time What he thinks is So you got a couple years on me and you once gave Dale this crappy little bit of information so what Im a better cop than youll ever be How heroic were you last night anyhow At  the previous night Armand Beezer St Pierre and his fellow travelers in the Thunder Five had roared up from Nailhouse Row to surge into the police station and demand of its three occupants each of whom had worked an eighteenhour shift exact details of the progress they were making on the issue that most concerned them all What the hell was going on here What about the third one huh what about Irma Freneau Had they found her yet Did these clowns have anything or were they still just blowing smoke You need help Beezer roared Then deputize us well give you all the goddamn help you need and then some A giant named Mouse had strolled smirking up to Bobby Dulac and kept on strolling jumbo belly to sixpack belly until Bobby was backed up against a filing cabinet whereupon the giant Mouse had mysteriously inquired in a cloud of beer and marijuana whether Bobby had ever dipped into the works of a gentleman named Jacques Derrida When Bobby replied that he had never heard of the gentleman Mouse said No shit Sherlock and stepped aside to glare at the names on the chalkboard Half an hour later Beezer Mouse and their companions were sent away unsatisfied undeputized but pacified and Dale Gilbertson said he had to go home and get some sleep but Tom ought to remain just in case The regular night men had both found excuses not to come in Bobby said he would stay too no problem Chief which is why we find these two men in the station so early in the morning Give it to me says Bobby Dulac Lund picks up the paper turns it around and holds it out for Bobby to see FISHERMAN STILL AT LARGE IN FRENCH LANDING AREA reads the headline over an article that takes up three columns on the top lefthand side of the front page The columns of type have been printed against a background of pale blue and a black border separates them from the remainder of the page Beneath the head in smaller print runs the line Identity of Psycho Killer Baffles Police Underneath the subhead a line in even smaller print attributes the article to Wendell Green with the support of the editorial staff The Fisherman Bobby says Right from the start your friend has his thumb up his butt The Fisherman the Fisherman the Fisherman If I all of a sudden turned into a fiftyfoot ape and started stomping on buildings would you call me King Kong Lund lowers the newspaper and smiles Okay Bobby allows bad example Say I held up a couple banks Would you call me John Dillinger Well says Lund smiling even more broadly they say Dillingers tool was so humongous they put it in a jar in the Smithsonian So    Read me the first sentence Bobby says Tom Lund looks down and reads  As the police in French Landing fail to discover any leads to the identity of the fiendish double murderer and sex criminal this reporter has dubbed the Fisherman the grim specters of fear despair and suspicion run increasingly rampant through the streets of that little town and from there out into the farms and villages throughout French County darkening by their touch every portion of the Coulee Country  Just what we need Bobby says Jeezus And in an instant has crossed the room and is leaning over Tom Lunds shoulder reading the Heralds front page with his hand resting on the butt of his Glock as if ready to drill a hole in the article right here and now  Our traditions of trust and good neighborliness our habit of extending warmth and generosity to all writes Wendell Green editorializing like crazy are eroding daily under the corrosive onslaught of these dread emotions Fear despair and suspicion are poisonous to the soul of communities large and small for they turn neighbor against neighbor and make a mockery of civility  Two children have been foully murdered and their remains partially consumed Now a third child has disappeared Eightyearold Amy St Pierre and sevenyearold Johnny Irkenham fell victim to the passions of a monster in human form Neither will know the happiness of adolescence or the satisfactions of adulthood Their grieving parents will never know the grandchildren they would have cherished The parents of Amy and Johnnys playmates shelter their children within the safety of their own homes as do parents whose children never knew the deceased As a result summer playgroups and other programs for young children have been canceled in virtually every township and municipality in French County  With the disappearance of tenyearold Irma Freneau seven days after the death of Amy St Pierre and only three after that of Johnny Irkenham public patience has grown dangerously thin As this correspondent has already reported Merlin Graasheimer fiftytwo an unemployed farm laborer of no fixed abode was set upon and beaten by an unidentified group of men in a Grainger side street late Tuesday evening Another such episode occurred in the early hours of Thursday morning when Elvar Praetorious thirtysix a Swedish tourist traveling alone was assaulted by three men again unidentified while asleep in La Rivieres Leif Eriksson Park Graasheimer and Praetorious required only routine medical attention but future incidents of vigilantism will almost certainly end more seriously  Tom Lund looks down at the next paragraph which describes the Freneau girls abrupt disappearance from a Chase Street sidewalk and pushes himself away from his desk Bobby Dulac reads silently for a time then says You gotta hear this shit Tom This is how he winds up  When will the Fisherman strike again  For he will strike again my friends make no mistake  And when will French Landings chief of police Dale Gilbertson do his duty and rescue the citizens of this county from the obscene savagery of the Fisherman and the understandable violence produced by his own inaction  Bobby Dulac stamps to the middle of the room His color has heightened He inhales then exhales a magnificent quantity of oxygen How about the next time the Fisherman strikes Bobby says how about he goes right up Wendell Greens flabby rear end Im with you says Tom Lund Can you believe that shinola Understandable violence Hes telling people its okay to mess with anyone who looks suspicious Bobby levels an index finger at Lund I personally am going to nail this guy That is a promise Ill bring him down alive or dead In case Lund may have missed the point he repeats Personally Wisely choosing not to speak the words that first come to his mind Tom Lund nods his head The finger is still pointing He says If you want some help with that maybe you should talk to Hollywood Dale didnt have no luck but could be youd do better Bobby waves this notion away No need Dale and me    and you too of course we got it covered But I personally am going to get this guy That is a guarantee He pauses for a second Besides Hollywood retired when he moved here or did you forget Hollywoods too young to retire Lund says Even in cop years the guy is practically a baby So you must be the next thing to a fetus And on their cackle of shared laughter we float away and out of the ready room and back into the sky where we glide one block farther north to Queen Street Moving a few blocks east we find beneath us a low rambling structure branching out from a central hub that occupies with its wide rising breadth of lawn dotted here and there with tall oaks and maples the whole of a block lined with bushy hedges in need of a good trim Obviously an institution of some kind the structure at first resembles a progressive elementary school in which the various wings represent classrooms without walls the square central hub the dining room and administrative offices When we drift downward we hear George Rathbuns genial bellow rising toward us from several windows The big glass front door swings open and a trim woman in catseye glasses comes out into the bright morning holding a poster in one hand and a roll of tape in the other She immediately turns around and with quick efficient gestures fixes the poster to the door Sunlight reflects from a smoky gemstone the size of a hazelnut on the third finger of her right hand While she takes a moment to admire her work we can peer over her crisp shoulder and see that the poster announces in a cheerful burst of handdrawn balloons that TODAY IS STRAWBERRY FEST when the woman walks back inside we take in the presence in the portion of the entry visible just beneath the giddy poster of two or three folded wheelchairs Beyond the wheelchairs the woman whose chestnut hair has been pinned back into an architectural whorl strides on her highheeled pumps through a pleasant lobby with blond wooden chairs and matching tables strewn artfully with magazines marches past a kind of unmanned guardpost or reception desk before a handsome fieldstone wall and vanishes with the trace of a skip through a burnished door marked WILLIAM MAXTON DIRECTOR What kind of school is this Why is it open for business why is it putting on festivals in the middle of July We could call it a graduate school for those who reside here have graduated from every stage of their existences but the last which they live out day after day under the careless stewardship of Mr William Chipper Maxton Director This is the Maxton Elder Care Facility once  in a more innocent time and before the cosmetic renovations done in the mideighties  known as the Maxton Nursing Home which was owned and managed by its founder Herbert Maxton Chippers father Herbert was a decent if wishywashy man who it is safe to say would be appalled by some of the things the sole fruit of his loins gets up to Chipper never wanted to take over the family playpen as he calls it with its freight of gummers zombies bed wetters and droolies and after getting an accounting degree at UWCLa Riviere with hardearned minors in promiscuity gambling and beer drinking our boy accepted a position with the Madison Wisconsin office of the Internal Revenue Service largely for the purpose of learning how to steal from the government undetected Five years with the IRS taught him much that was useful but when his subsequent career as a freelancer failed to match his ambitions he yielded to his fathers increasingly frail entreaties and threw in his lot with the undead and the droolies With a certain grim relish Chipper acknowledged that despite a woeful shortage of glamour his fathers business would at least provide him with the opportunity to steal from the clients and the government alike Let us flow in through the big glass doors cross the handsome lobby noting as we do so the mingled odors of air freshener and ammonia that pervade even the public areas of all such institutions pass through the door bearing Chippers name and find out what that wellarranged young woman is doing here so early Beyond Chippers door lies a windowless cubicle equipped with a desk a coatrack and a small bookshelf crowded with computer printouts pamphlets and flyers A door stands open beside the desk Through the opening we see a much larger office paneled in the same burnished wood as the directors door and containing leather chairs a glasstopped coffee table and an oatmealcolored sofa At its far end looms a vast desk untidily heaped with papers and so deeply polished it seems nearly to glow Our young woman whose name is Rebecca Vilas sits perched on the edge of this desk her legs crossed in a particularly architectural fashion One knee folds over the other and the calves form two nicely molded roughly parallel lines running down to the triangular tips of the black highheeled pumps one of which points to four oclock and the other to six Rebecca Vilas we gather has arranged herself to be seen has struck a pose intended to be appreciated though certainly not by us Behind the catseye glasses her eyes look skeptical and amused but we cannot see what has aroused these emotions We assume that she is Chippers secretary and this assumption too expresses only half of the truth as the ease and irony of her attitude imply Ms Vilass duties have long extended beyond the purely secretarial We might speculate about the source of that nice ring she is wearing as long as our minds are in the gutter we will be right on the money We float through the open door follow the direction of Rebeccas increasingly impatient gaze and find ourselves staring at the sturdy khakiclad rump of her kneeling employer who has thrust his head and shoulders into a goodsized safe in which we glimpse stacks of record books and a number of manila envelopes apparently stuffed with currency A few bills flop out of these envelopes as Chipper pulls them from the safe You did the sign the poster thing he asks without turning around Aye aye says Rebecca Vilas And a splendid day it is we shall be havin for the great occasion too as is only roight and proper Her Irish accent is surprisingly good if a bit generic She has never been anywhere more exotic than Atlantic City where Chipper used his frequentflier miles to escort her for five enchanted days two years before She learned the accent from old movies I hate Strawberry Fest Chipper says dredging the last of the envelopes from the safe The zombies wives and children mill around all afternoon cranking them up so we have to sedate them into comas just to get some peace And if you want to know the truth I hate balloons He dumps the money onto the carpet and begins to sort the bills into stacks of various denominations Only Oi was wonderin in me simple country manner says Rebecca why Oi should be requested to appear at the crack o dawn on the grand day Know what else I hate The whole music thing Singing zombies and that stupid deejay Symphonic Stan with his bigband records whoo boy talk about thrills I assume Rebecca says dropping the stageIrish accent you want me to do something with that money before the action begins Time for another journey to Miller An account under a fictitious name in the State Provident Bank in Miller forty miles away receives regular deposits of cash skimmed from patients funds intended to pay for extra goods and services Chipper turns around on his knees with his hands full of money and looks up at Rebecca He sinks back down to his heels and lets his hands fall into his lap Boy do you have great legs Legs like that you ought to be famous I thought youd never notice Rebecca says Chipper Maxton is fortytwo years old He has good teeth all his hair a wide sincere face and narrow brown eyes that always look a little damp He also has two kids Trey nine and Ashley seven and recently diagnosed with ADD a matter Chipper figures is going to cost him maybe two thousand a year in pills alone And of course he has a wife his lifes partner Marion thirtynine years of age five foot five and somewhere in the neighborhood of  pounds In addition to these blessings as of last night Chipper owes his bookie  the result of an unwise investment in the Brewers game George Rathbun is still bellowing about He has noticed oh yes he has Chipper has noticed Ms Vilass splendidly cantilevered legs Before you go over there he says I was thinking we could kind of stretch out on the sofa and fool around Ah Rebecca says Fool around how exactly Gobble gobble gobble Chipper says grinning like a satyr You romantic devil you says Rebecca a remark that utterly escapes her employer Chipper thinks he actually is being romantic She slides elegantly down from her perch and Chipper pushes himself inelegantly upright and closes the safe door with his foot Eyes shining damply he takes a couple of thuggish strutting strides across the carpet wraps one arm around Rebecca Vilass slender waist and with the other slides the fat manila envelopes onto the desk He is yanking at his belt even before he begins to pull Rebecca toward the sofa So can I see him says clever Rebecca who understands exactly how to turn her lovers brains to porridge       and before Chipper obliges her we do the sensible thing and float out into the lobby which is still empty A corridor to the left of the reception desk takes us to two large blond glassinset doors marked DAISY and BLUEBELL the names of the wings to which they give entrance Far down the gray length of Bluebell a man in baggy coveralls dribbles ash from his cigarette onto the tiles over which he is dragging with exquisite slowness a filthy mop We move into Daisy The functional parts of Maxtons are a great deal less attractive than the public areas Numbered doors line both sides of the corridor Handlettered cards in plastic holders beneath the numerals give the names of the residents Four doors along a desk at which a burly male attendant in an unclean white uniform sits dozing upright faces the entrances to the mens and womens bathrooms  at Maxtons only the most expensive rooms those on the other side of the lobby in Asphodel provide anything but a sink Dirty mopswirls harden and dry all up and down the tiled floor which stretches out before us to improbable length Here too the walls and air seem the same shade of gray If we look closely at the edges of the hallway at the juncture of the walls and the ceiling we see spiderwebs old stains accumulations of grime PineSol ammonia urine and worse scent the atmosphere As an elderly lady in Bluebell wing likes to say when you live with a bunch of people who are old and incontinent you never get far from the smell of caca The rooms themselves vary according to the conditions and capacities of their inhabitants Since nearly everyone is asleep we can glance into a few of these quarters Here in D a single room two doors past the dozing aide old Alice Weathers lies snoring gently dreaming of dancing in perfect partnership with Fred Astaire across a white marble floor surrounded by so much of her former life that she must navigate past the chairs and end tables to maneuver from the door to her bed Alice still possesses even more of her wits than she does her old furniture and she cleans her room herself immaculately Next door in D two old farmers named Thorvaldson and Jesperson who have not spoken to each other in years sleep separated by a thin curtain in a bright clutter of family photographs and grandchildrens drawings Farther down the hallway D presents a spectacle completely opposite to the clean crowded jumble of D just as its inhabitant a man known as Charles Burnside could be considered the polar opposite of Alice Weathers In D there are no end tables hutches overstuffed chairs gilded mirrors lamps woven rugs or velvet curtains this barren room contains only a metal bed a plastic chair and a chest of drawers No photographs of children and grandchildren stand atop the chest and no crayon drawings of blocky houses and stick figures decorate the walls Mr Burnside has no interest in housekeeping and a thin layer of dust covers the floor the windowsill and the chests bare top D is bereft of history empty of personality it seems as brutal and soulless as a prison cell A powerful smell of excrement contaminates the air For all the entertainment offered by Chipper Maxton and all the charm of Alice Weathers it is Charles Burnside Burny we have most come to see CHIPPERS BACKGROUND we know Alice arrived at Maxtons from a big house on Gale Street the old part of Gale Street where she outlived two husbands raised five sons and taught piano to four generations of French Landing children none of whom ever became professional pianists but who all remember her fondly and think of her with affection Alice came to this place as most people do in a car driven by one of her children and with a mixture of reluctance and surrender She had become too old to live alone in the big house in the old section of Gale Street she had two grown married sons who were kind enough but she could not tolerate adding to their cares Alice Weathers had spent her entire life in French Landing and she had no desire to live anywhere else in a way she had always known that she would end her days in Maxtons which though not at all luxurious was agreeable enough On the day her son Martin had driven her over to inspect the place she had realized that she knew at least half the people there Unlike Alice Charles Burnside the tall skinny old man lying covered by a sheet before us in his metal bed is not in full possession of his wits nor is he dreaming of Fred Astaire The veiny expanse of his bald narrow head curves down to eyebrows like tangles of gray wire beneath which on either side of the fleshy hook of his nose two narrow eyes shine at his northfacing window and the expanse of woods beyond Maxtons Alone of all the residents of Daisy wing Burny is not asleep His eyes gleam and his lips are wormed into a bizarre smile  but these details mean nothing for Charles Burnsides mind may be as empty as his room Burny has suffered from Alzheimers disease for many years and what looks like an aggressive form of pleasure could be no more than physical satisfaction of a very basic kind If we had failed to guess that he was the origin of the stench in this room the stains rising into the sheet that covers him make it clear He has just evacuated massively into his bed and the very least we can say about his response to the situation is that he does not mind a bit no sir shame is not a part of this picture But if  unlike delightful Alice  Burny no longer has a firm grasp on all of his marbles neither is he a typical Alzheimers patient He might spend a day or two mumbling into his oatmeal like the rest of Chippers zombies then revitalize himself and join the living again When not undead he usually manages to get down the hall to the bathroom as necessary and he spends hours either sneaking off on his own or patrolling the grounds being unpleasant  in fact offensive  to all and sundry Restored from zombiehood he is sly secretive rude caustic stubborn foultongued meanspirited and resentful in other words  in the world according to Chipper  a blood brother to the other old men who reside at Maxtons Some of the nurses aides and attendants doubt that Burny really does have Alzheimers They think he is faking it opting out lying low deliberately making them work harder while he rests up and gathers his strength for yet another episode of unpleasantness We can hardly blame them for their suspicion If Burny has not been misdiagnosed he is probably the only advanced Alzheimers patient in the world to experience prolonged spells of remission In  his seventyeighth year the man known as Charles Burnside arrived at Maxtons in an ambulance from La Riviere General Hospital not in a vehicle driven by a helpful relative He had appeared in the emergency room one morning carrying two heavy suitcases filled with dirty clothing and loudly demanding medical attention His demands were not coherent but they were clear He claimed to have walked a considerable distance to reach the hospital and he wanted the hospital to take care of him The distance varied from telling to telling  ten miles fifteen miles twentyfive He either had or had not spent some nights sleeping in fields or by the side of the road His general condition and the way he smelled suggested that he had been wandering the countryside and sleeping rough for perhaps a week If he had once had a wallet he had lost it on his journey La Riviere General cleaned him up fed him gave him a bed and tried to extract a history Most of his statements trailed off into disjointed babble but in the absence of any documents at least these facts seemed reliable Burnside had been a carpenter framer and plasterer in the area for many years working for himself and general contractors An aunt who lived in the town of Blair had given him a room He had walked the eighteen miles from Blair to La Riviere then No he had started his walk somewhere else he could not remember where but it was ten miles away no twentyfive miles away some town and the people in that town were nogood jackass asswipes What was the name of his aunt Althea Burnside What were her address and telephone number No idea couldnt remember Did his aunt have a job of any kind Yes she was a fulltime jackass asswipe But she had permitted him to live in her house Who Permitted what Charles Burnside needed no ones permission he did what he damn well wanted Had his aunt ordered him out of her house Who are you talking about you jackass asshole The admitting MD entered an initial diagnosis of Alzheimers disease pending the results of various tests and the social worker got on the telephone and requested the address and telephone number of an Althea Burnside currently residing in Blair The telephone company reported no listing for a person of that name in Blair nor was she listed in Ettrick Cochrane Fountain Sparta Onalaska Arden La Riviere or any other of the towns and cities within a fiftymile radius Widening her net the social worker consulted the Records Office and the departments of Social Security Motor Vehicle License and Taxation for information about Althea and Charles Burnside Of the two Altheas that popped up out of the system one owned a diner in Butternut far to the north of the state and the other was a black woman who worked in a Milwaukee daycare center Neither had any connection to the man in La Riviere General The Charles Burnsides located by the records search were not the social workers Charles Burnside Althea seemed not to exist Charles it seemed was one of those elusive people who go through life without ever paying taxes registering to vote applying for a Social Security card opening a bank account joining the armed forces getting a drivers license or spending a couple of seasons at the state farm Another round of telephone calls resulted in the elusive Charles Burnsides classification as a ward of the county and his admission to the Maxton Elder Care Facility until accommodation could be found at the state hospital in Whitehall The ambulance conveyed Burnside to Maxtons at the expense of the generous public and grumpy Chipper slammed him into Daisy wing Six weeks later a bed opened up in a ward at the state hospital Chipper received the telephone call a few minutes after the days mail brought him a check drawn by an Althea Burnside on a bank in De Pere for Charles Burnsides maintenance at his facility Althea Burnsides address was a De Pere post office box When the state hospital called Chipper announced that in the spirit of civic duty he would be happy to continue Mr Burnsides status at Maxton Elder Care The old fellow had just become his favorite patient Without putting Chipper through any of the usual shenanigans Burny had doubled his contribution to the income stream For the next six years the old man slid relentlessly into the darkness of Alzheimers If he was faking he gave a brilliant performance Down he went through the descending way stations of incontinence incoherence frequent outbursts of anger loss of memory loss of the ability to feed himself loss of personality He dwindled into infancy then into vacuity and spent his days strapped into a wheelchair Chipper mourned the inevitable loss of a uniquely cooperative patient Then in the summer of the year before these events the amazing resuscitation occurred Animation returned to Burnys slack face and he began to utter vehement nonsense syllables Abbalah Gorg Munshun Gorg He wanted to feed himself he wanted to exercise his legs to stagger around and reacquaint himself with his surroundings Within a week he was using English words to insist on wearing his own clothes and going to the bathroom by himself He put on weight gained strength once again became a nuisance Now often in the same day he passes back and forth between latestage Alzheimers lifelessness and a guarded gleaming surliness so healthy in a man of eightyfive it might be called robust Burny is like a man who went to Lourdes and experienced a cure but left before it was complete For Chipper a miracle is a miracle As long as the old creep stays alive who cares if he is wandering the grounds or drooping against the restraining strap in his wheelchair We move closer We try to ignore the stench We want to see what we can glean from the face of this curious fellow It was never a pretty face and now the skin is gray and the cheeks are sunken potholes Prominent blue veins wind over the gray scalp spotted as a plovers egg The rubberylooking nose hooks slightly to the right which adds to the impression of slyness and concealment The wormy lips curl in a disquieting smile  the smile of an arsonist contemplating a burning building  that may after all be merely a grimace Here is a true American loner an internal vagrant a creature of shabby rooms and cheap diners of aimless journeys resentfully taken a collector of wounds and injuries lovingly fingered and refingered Here is a spy with no cause higher than himself Burnys real name is Carl Bierstone and under this name he conducted in Chicago from his midtwenties until the age of fortysix a secret rampage an unofficial war during which he committed wretched deeds for the sake of the pleasures they afforded him Carl Bierstone is Burnys great secret for he cannot allow anyone to know that this former incarnation this earlier self still lives inside his skin Carl Bierstones awful pleasures his foul toys are also Burnys and he must keep them hidden in the darkness where only he can find them So is that the answer to Chippers miracle That Carl Bierstone found a way to creep out through a seam in Burnys zombiedom and assume control of the foundering ship The human soul contains an infinity of rooms after all some of them vast some no bigger than a broom closet some locked some few imbued with a radiant light We bow closer to the veiny scalp the wandering nose the wirebrush eyebrows we lean deeper into the stink to examine those interesting eyes They are like black neon they glitter like moonlight on a sodden riverbank All in all they look unsettlingly gleeful but not particularly human Not much help here Burnys lips move he is still smiling if you can call that rictus a smile but he has begun to whisper What is he saying    dey are gowering in their bloody holes and govering their eyes dey are whimbering in derror my boor loss babbies No no dat wont help will it Ah zee de engynes yezz oh dose beeyoodiful beeyoodiful engynes whad a zight the beeyoodiful engynes againzt de vire how they churrn how dey churrn and burrn I zee a hole yez yez dere id iz oho zo brighd around de etches zo folded back    Carl Bierstone may be reporting in but his babble is not of much help Let us follow the direction of Burnys mudglitter gaze in hopes that it might give us a hint as to what has so excited the old boy Aroused too as we observe from the shape beneath the sheet He and Chipper seem to be in sync here since both are standing at the ready except that instead of the benefit of Rebecca Vilass expert attentions Burnys only stimulation is the view through his window The view hardly measures up to Ms Vilas Head slightly elevated upon a pillow Charles Burnside looks raptly out over a brief expanse of lawn to a row of maple trees at the beginning of an extensive woods Farther back tower the great leafy heads of oaks A few birch trunks shine candlelike in the inner darkness From the height of the oaks and the variety of the trees we know that we are regarding a remnant of the great climax forest that once blanketed this entire part of the country Like all of the ancient forests traces the woods extending north and east from Maxtons speak of profound mysteries in a voice nearly too deep to be heard Beneath its green canopy time and serenity embrace bloodshed and death violence roils on unseen constantly absorbed into every aspect of a hushed landscape that never pauses but moves with glacial lack of haste The spangled yielding floor covers millions of scattered bones in layer upon layerall that grows and thrives here thrives on rot Worlds within worlds churn and great systematic universes hum side by side each ignorantly bringing abundance and catastrophe upon its unguessedat neighbors Does Burny contemplate these woods is he enlivened by what he sees in them Or for that matter is he in fact still asleep and does Carl Bierstone caper behind Charles Burnsides peculiar eyes Burny whispers Fogzes down fogzhulls radz in radhulls hyenaz over embdy stomachs wail oho aha dis iz moztmozt gladzome my frenz more an more de liddle wunz drudge drudge drudge oho on bledding foodzies    Lets blow this pop stand okay Lets sail away from old Burnys ugly mouth  enough is enough Let us seek the fresh air and fly north over the woods Foxes down foxholes and rats in ratholes may be wailing true thats how it works but we are not about to find any starving hyenas in western Wisconsin Hyenas are always hungry anyhow No one feels sorry for them either Youd have to be a real bleeding heart to pity a creature that does nothing but skulk around the periphery of other species until the moment when grinning and chuckling it can plunder their leftovers Out we go right through the roof East of Maxtons the woods carpet the ground for something like a mile or two before a narrow dirt road curves in from Highway  like a careless parting in a thick head of hair The woods continue for another hundred yards or so then yield to a thirtyyearold housing development consisting of two streets Basketball hoops backyard swing sets tricycles bicycles and vehicles by FisherPrice clutter the driveways of the modest houses on Schubert and Gale The children who will make use of them lie abed dreaming of cotton candy puppy dogs home runs excursions to distant territories and other delightful infinitudes also asleep are their anxious parents doomed to become even more so after reading Wendell Greens contribution to the front page of the days Herald Something catches our eye  that narrow dirt road curving into the woods from Highway s straightaway More a lane than an actual road its air of privacy seems at odds with its apparent uselessness The lane loops off into the woods and threefourths of a mile later comes to an end What is its point what is it for From our height above the earth the track resembles a faint line sketched by a No  pencil  you practically need an eagles eye to see it at all  but someone went to considerable effort to draw this line through the woods Trees had to be cut and cleared stumps to be pried from the ground If one man did it the work would have taken months of sweaty musclestraining labor The result of all that inhuman effort has the remarkable property of concealing itself of evading the eye so that it fades away if attention wanders and must be located again We might think of dwarfs and secret dwarf mines the path to a dragons hidden cache of gold  a treasure so safeguarded that access to it has been camouflaged by a magic spell No dwarf mines dragon treasures and magic spells are too childish but when we drop down for a closer examination we see that a weathered NO TRESPASSING sign stands at the beginning of the lane proof that something is being guarded even if it is merely privacy Having noticed the sign we look again at the end of the lane In the darkness under the trees down there one area seems murkier than the rest Even as it shrinks back into the gloom this area possesses an unnatural solidity that distinguishes it from the surrounding trees Aha oho we say to ourselves in an echo of Burnys gibberish what have we here a wall of some kind It seems that featureless When we reach the midpoint in the curve of the lane a triangular section of darkness all but obscured by the treetops abruptly defines itself as a peaked roof Not until we are nearly upon it does the entire structure move into definition as a threestory wooden house oddly shambling in structure with a sagging front porch This house has clearly stood empty for a long time and after taking in its eccentricity the first thing we notice is its inhospitability to new tenants A second NO TRESPASSING sign leaning sideways at an improbable angle against a newel post merely underlines the impression given by the building itself The peaked roof covers only the central section To the left a twostory extension retreats back into the woods On the right the building sprouts additions like outsized sheds more like growths than afterthoughts In both senses of the word the building looks unbalanced an offkilter mind conceived it then relentlessly brought it into offcenter being The intractable result deflects inquiry and resists interpretation An odd monolithic invulnerability emanates from the bricks and boards despite the damage done by time and weather Obviously built in search of seclusion if not isolation the house seems still to demand them Oddest of all from our vantage point the house appears to have been painted a uniform black  not only the boards but every inch of the exterior the porch the trim the rain gutters even the windows Black from top to bottom And that cannot be possible in this guileless goodhearted corner of the world not even the most crazily misanthropic builder would turn his house into its own shadow We float down to just above ground level and move nearer along the narrow lane    When we come close enough for reliable judgment which is uncomfortably close we find that misanthropy can go further than we had supposed The house is not black now but it used to be What it has faded into makes us feel that we might have been too critical about the original color The house has become the leaden grayblack of thunderheads and dismal seas and the hulls of wrecked ships Black would be preferable to this utter lifelessness We may be certain that very few of the adults who live in the nearby development or any adults in French Landing or the surrounding towns have defied the admonition on  and ventured up the narrow lane Almost none so much as notice the sign anymore none of them know of the existence of the black house We can be just as certain however that a number of their children have explored the lane and that some of those children wandered far enough to come upon the house They would have seen it in a way their parents could not and what they saw would have sent them racing back toward the highway The black house seems as out of place in western Wisconsin as a skyscraper or a moated palace In fact the black house would be an anomaly anywhere in our world except perhaps as a Haunted Mansion a Castle of Terrors in an amusement park where its capacity to repel ticket buyers would put it out of business within a week Yet in one specific way it might remind us of the dim buildings along the ascent of Chase Street into respectability from the riverbank and Nailhouse Row The shabby Nelson Hotel the obscure tavern the shoe store and the others marked with the horizontal stripe drawn by the rivers grease pencil share the same eerie dreamlike halfunreal flavor that saturates the black house At this moment in our progress  and through everything that follows  we would do well to remember that this strange flavor of the dreamlike and slightly unnatural is characteristic of borderlands It can be detected in every seam between one specific territory and another however significant or insignificant the border in question Borderlands places are different from other places they are borderish Say you happen to be driving for the first time through a semirural section of Oostler County in your home state on your way to visit a recently divorced friend of the opposite sex who has abruptly and you think unwisely decamped to a small town in adjacent Orelost County On the passenger seat beside you atop a picnic basket containing two bottles of a superior white Bordeaux held tightly in place by various gourmet goodies in exquisite little containers lies a map carefully folded to expose the relevant area You may not know your exact location but you are on the right road and making good time Gradually the landscape alters The road veers around a nonexistent berm then begins winding through inexplicable curves on either side the trees slouch beneath their twisted boughs the intermittent houses grow smaller and seedier Ahead a threelegged dog squirms through a hedge and barrels snarling toward your right front tire A crone wearing a teensy straw hat and what appears to be a shroud glances up redeyed from a listing porch swing Two front yards along a little girl costumed in dirty pink gauze and a foil crown flaps a glittery starheaded wand over a heap of burning tires Then a rectangular placard bearing the legend WELCOME TO ORELOST COUNTY glides into view Soon the trees improve their posture and the road straightens out Released from anxieties barely noticed until they were gone you nudge the accelerator and hasten toward your needy friend Borderlands taste of unruliness and distortion The grotesque the unpredictable and the lawless take root in them and luxuriate The central borderlands flavor is of slippage And while we are in a setting of wondrous natural beauty we have also been traveling over a natural borderland delineated by a great river and defined by other lesser rivers wide glacial moraines limestone cliffs and valleys that remain invisible like the black house until you turn the right corner and meet them face to face Have you ever seen a furious old wreck in wornout clothes who pushes an empty shopping cart down deserted streets and rants about a fushing feef  Sometimes he wears a baseball cap sometimes a pair of sunglasses with one cracked lens Have you ever moved frightened into a doorway and watched a soldierly man with a zigzag lightningbolt scar on one side of his face storm into a drunken mob and discover lying spreadeagled in death on the ground a boy his head smashed and his pockets turned out Have you seen the anger and the pity blaze in that mans mutilated face These are signs of slippage Another lies concealed below us on the outskirts of French Landing and despite the terror and heartbreak that surround this sign we have no choice but to stand in witness before it By our witness we shall do it honor to the measure of our individual capabilities by being witnessed by offering its testimony to our mute gaze it will repay us in measure far greater We are back in midair and spread out  we could say spreadeagled out  beneath us French County sprawls like a topographical map The morning sunlight stronger now glows on green rectangular fields and dazzles off the lightning rods rising from the tops of barns The roads look clean Molten pools of light shine from the tops of the few cars drifting toward town along the edges of the fields Holsteins nudge pasture gates ready for the confinement of their stanchions and the mornings date with the milking machine At a safe distance from the black house which has already given us an excellent example of slippage we are gliding eastward crossing the long straight ribbon of Eleventh Street and beginning a journey into a transitional area of scattered houses and small businesses before Highway  cuts through actual farmland The Eleven slips by and the VFW hall where the flagpole will not display Old Glory for another fortyfive minutes In one of the houses set back from the road a woman named Wanda Kinderling the wife of Thornberg Kinderling a wicked and foolish man serving a life sentence in a California prison awakens eyes the level of the vodka in the bottle on her bedside table and decides to postpone breakfast for another hour Fifty yards along gleaming tractors in military rows face the giant steelandglass bubble of Ted Goltzs farmimplement dealership French County Farm Equipment where a decent troubled husband and father named Fred Marshall whom we shall be meeting before long will soon report for work Beyond the showy glass bubble and the asphalt sea of Goltzs parking lot a half mile of stony longneglected field eventually degenerates into bare earth and spindly weeds At the end of a long overgrown turnin what seems to be a pile of rotting lumber stands between an old shed and an antique gas pump This is our destination We glide toward the earth The heap of lumber resolves into a leaning dilapidated structure on the verge of collapse An old tin CocaCola sign pocked with bullet holes tilts against the front of the building Beer cans and the milkweed of old cigarette filters litter the scrubby ground From within comes the steady somnolent buzz of a great many flies We wish to retreat into the cleansing air and depart The black house was pretty bad in fact it was terrible but this    this is going to be worse One secondary definition of slippage is the feeling that things in general have just gotten or very shortly will get worse The ruined boxcarshaped shack before us used to house a comically illrun and unsanitary establishment called Eds Eats  Dawgs From behind an eternally messy counter a chortling pound mass of blubber named Ed Gilbertson once served up greasy overdone hamburgers baloneyandmayonnaise sandwiches ornamented with black thumbprints and oozing icecream cones to a small undiscriminating clientele mostly local children who arrived on bicycles Now long deceased Ed was one of the numerous uncles of French Landings chief of police Dale Gilbertson and a goodhearted slob and dimwit of great local renown His cooks apron was of an indescribable filthiness the state of his hands and fingernails would have brought any visiting health inspector to the verge of nausea his utensils might as well have been cleaned by cats Immediately behind the counter tubs of melting ice cream cooked in the heat from the crusted griddle Overhead limp flypaper ribbons hung invisible within the fur of a thousand fly corpses The unlovely truth is that for decades Eds Eats permitted generation upon generation of microbes and germs to multiply unchecked swarming from floor counter and griddle  not hesitating to colonize Ed himself  to spatula fork and the unwashed icecream scoop thence into the horrible food finally into the mouths and guts of the kids who ate that stuff plus those of the occasional mother Remarkably no one ever died from eating at Eds and after a longoverdue heart attack felled its proprietor one day when he mounted a stool for the purpose of finally tacking up a dozen new strips of flypaper nobody had the heart to raze his little shack and clear away the rubble For twentyfive years under the shelter of darkness its rotting shell has welcomed romantic teenage couples as well as gatherings of boys and girls in need of a secluded place to investigate for the first time in recorded history or so it seemed to them the liberation of drunkenness The rapt buzzing of the flies tells us that whatever we might be about to witness within this ruin will be neither a pair of spent young lovers nor a few silly passedout kids That soft greedy uproar inaudible from the road declares the presence of ultimate things We could say that it represents a kind of portal We enter Mild sunlight filtering in through gaps in the eastern wall and the battered roof paints luminous streaks across the gritty floor Feathers dust eddy and stir over animal tracks and the dim impressions left by many longgone shoes Threadbare armysurplus blankets speckled with mold lie crumpled against the wall to our left a few feet away discarded beer cans and flattened cigarette ends surround a keroseneburning hurricane lamp with a cracked glass housing The sunlight lays warm stripes over crisp footprints advancing in a wide curve around the remains of Eds appalling counter and into the vacancy formerly occupied by the stove a sink and a rank of storage shelves There in what once was Eds sacred domain the footprints vanish Some ferocious activity has scattered the dust and grit and something that is not an old army blanket though we wish it were lies disarrayed against the rear wall half in half out of a dark irregular pool of tacky liquid Delirious flies hover and settle upon the dark pool In the far corner a rustcolored mongrel with quilllike hair gets its teeth into the knuckle of meat and bone protruding from the white object held between its front paws The white object is a running shoe a sneaker A New Balance sneaker to be exact To be more exact a childs New Balance sneaker size  We want to invoke our capacity for flight and get the hell out of here We want to float through the unresisting roof to regain the harmless air but we cannot we must bear witness An ugly dog is chewing on a childs severed foot while making every effort to extract the foot from the white New Balance sneaker The mongrels scrawny back arches down and extends the quilled shoulders and narrow head drop the bony front legs rigidly clamp the prize tug tug tug but the sneakers laces are tied  too bad for the mutt As for the something that is not an old armysurplus blanket beyond a swirl of dusty tracks and furrows at the floors far edge its pale form lies flattened and faceup on the floor its top half extending out of the dark pool One arm stretches limply out into the grit the other props upright against the wall The fingers of both hands curl palmward Blunt strawberryblond hair flops back from the small face If the eyes and mouth display any recognizable expression it is that of mild surprise This is an accident of structure it means nothing for the configuration of this childs face caused her to look faintly surprised even while she was asleep Bruises like ink stains and eraser smudges lie upon her cheekbones her temple her neck A white Tshirt bearing the logo of the Milwaukee Brewers and smeared with dirt and dried blood covers her torso from neck to navel The lower half of her body pale as smoke except where drizzled with blood lengthens into the dark pool where the ecstatic flies hover and settle Her bare slender left leg incorporates a scabby knee and concludes with the uptick of a bloodstained New Balance sneaker size  laces doubleknotted toe pointed to the ceiling Where the partner to this leg should be is a vacancy for her right hip ends abruptly at a ragged stump We are in the presence of the Fishermans third victim tenyearold Irma Freneau The shock waves aroused by her disappearance yesterday afternoon from the sidewalk outside the video store will increase in force and number after Dale Gilbertson comes upon her body a little over a day from now The Fisherman gathered her up on Chase Street and transported her  we cannot say how  up the length of Chase Street and Lyall Road past the Eleven and the VFW hall past the house where Wanda Kinderling seethes and drinks past the shiny glass spaceship of Goltzs and across the border between town and farmland She was alive when the Fisherman moved her through the doorway next to the pockmarked CocaCola sign She must have struggled she must have screamed The Fisherman brought her to the rear wall and silenced her with blows to the face Very likely he strangled her He lowered her body to the floor and arranged her limbs Except for the white New Balance sneakers he removed all the clothing from her waist down underwear jeans shorts whatever Irma had been wearing when he abducted her After that the Fisherman amputated her right leg Using some sort of long heavybladed knife and without the assistance of cleaver or saw he parted flesh and bone until he had managed to detach the leg from the rest of the body Then perhaps with no more than two or three downward chops to the ankle he severed the foot He tossed it still contained within the white sneaker aside Irmas foot was not important to the Fisherman  all he wanted was her leg Here my friends we have true slippage Irma Freneaus small inert body seems to flatten out as if it intends to melt through the rotting floorboards The drunken flies sing on The dog keeps trying to yank the whole of its juicy prize out of the sneaker Were we to bring simpleminded Ed Gilbertson back to life and stand him beside us he would sink to his knees and weep We on the other hand    We are not here to weep Not like Ed anyhow in horrified shame and disbelief A tremendous mystery has inhabited this hovel and its effects and traces hover everywhere about us We have come to observe register and record the impressions the afterimages left in the comet trail of the mystery It speaks from their details therefore it lingers in its own wake therefore it surrounds us A deep deep gravity flows outward from the scene and this gravity humbles us Humility is our best most accurate first response Without it we would miss the point the great mystery would escape us and we would go on deaf and blind ignorant as pigs Let us not go on like pigs We must honor this scene  the flies the dog worrying the severed foot the poor pale body of Irma Freneau the magnitude of what befell Irma Freneau  by acknowledging our littleness In comparison we are no more than vapors A fat bee wanders in through the empty window frame in the side wall six feet from Irmas body and makes a slow exploratory circuit around the rear of the shack Suspended beneath its blurred wings the bee looks nearly too heavy for flight but it proceeds with easy unhurried deliberation moving well above the bloody floor in a wide curve The flies the mongrel and Irma pay it no attention For us though the bee which continues to drift contentedly about the rear of the horror chamber has ceased to be a welcome distraction and has been absorbed into the surrounding mystery It is a detail within the scene and it too commands our humility and speaks The weighty burrowing rumble of its wings seems to define the exact center of the undulating sound waves higher in pitch produced by the greedy flies Like a singer at a microphone in front of a chorus the bee controls the aural background The sound gathers and comes to a serious point When the bee ambles into a shaft of yellow light streaming through the eastern wall its stripes glow black and gold the wings coalesce into a fan and the insect becomes an intricate airborne wonder The slaughtered girl flattens into the bloody floorboards Our humility our sense of littleness our appreciation of the gravity deeply embedded in this scene grant us the sense of forces and powers beyond our understanding of a kind of grandeur always present and at work but perceptible only during moments like this We have been honored but the honor is unbearable The speaking bee circles back to the window and passes into another world and following his lead we move on out the window into the sun and into the upper air Smells of shit and urine at Maxton Elder Care the fragile slick feel of slippage at the offkilter house north of Highway  the sound of the flies and the sight of the blood at the former Eds Eats Ag Yuck Is there no place here in French Landing we may ask where there is something nice under the skin Where what we see is what we get so to speak The short answer no French Landing should be marked with big road signs at every point of ingress WARNING SLIPPAGE IN PROGRESS PASS AT YOUR OWN RISK The magic at work here is Fishermagic It has rendered nice at least temporarily obsolete But we can go someplace niceer and if we can we probably should because we need a break We may not be able to escape slippage but we can at least visit where no one shits the bed or bleeds on the floor at least not yet So the bee goes its way and we go ours ours takes us southwest over more woods exhaling their fragrance of life and oxygen  there is no air like this air at least not in this world  and then back to the works of man again This section of town is called Libertyville so named by the French Landing Town Council in  You wont believe this but bigbellied Ed Gilbertson the Hot Dog King himself was a member of that bicentennial band of town fathers those were strange days pretty mama strange days indeed Not as strange as these however in French Landing these are the Fisherdays the slippery slippage days The streets of Libertyville have names that adults find colorful and children find painful Some of the latter have been known to call this area of town Faggotyville Let us descend now down through the sweet morning air its warming up already this will be a Strawberry Fest kind of day for sure We cruise silently over Camelot Street past the intersection of Camelot and Avalon and travel on down Avalon to Maid Marian Way From Maid Marian we progress to  is it any surprise  Robin Hood Lane Here at No  a sweet little Cape Cod honey of a home that looks just right for The Decent Hardworking Family On Its Way Up we find a kitchen window open There is the smell of coffee and toast a wonderful combined odor that denies slippage if only we did not know better if only we had not seen the dog at work eating a foot out of a sneaker as a child might eat the hot dog right out of its bun and we follow the aroma in Its nice to be invisible isnt it To watch in our godlike silence If only what our godlike eyes saw was just a little less goddamn upsetting But that is by the way Were in it now for better or for worse and we had better get on about our business Daylights awasting as they say in this part of the world Here in the kitchen of No  is Fred Marshall whose picture currently graces the Salesman of the Month easel in the showroom of French County Farm Equipment Fred has also been named Employee of the Year three years out of the last four two years ago Ted Goltz gave the award to Otto Eisman just to break the monotony and when he is on the job no one radiates more charm personality or all around niceness You wanted nice Ladies and gentlemen presenting Fred Marshall Only now his confident smile is not in evidence and his hair always carefully combed on the job hasnt yet seen the brush Hes wearing Nike shorts and a tee with cutoff sleeves instead of his usual pressed khakis and sport shirt On the counter is the Marshall copy of the La Riviere Herald open to an inside page Fred has his share of problems just lately  or rather his wife Judy has problems and whats hers is his so said the minister when he joined them in holy wedlock  and what hes reading isnt making him feel any better Far from it Its a sidebar to the lead story on the front page and of course the author is everyones favorite muckraker Wendell FISHERMAN STILL AT LARGE Green The sidebar is your basic recap of the first two murders Gruesome and Gruesomer is how Fred thinks of them and as he reads Fred bends first his left leg up behind him and then his right stretching those allimportant thigh muscles and preparing for his morning run What could be more antislippage than a morning run What could be nicer What could possibly spoil such a lovely start to such a beautiful Wisconsin day Well how about this Johnny Irkenhams dreams were simple enough according to his griefstricken father Griefstricken father Fred thinks stretching and imagining his son asleep upstairs Dear God save me from ever being a griefstricken father Not knowing of course how soon he must assume this role Johnny wanted to be an astronaut George Irkenham said a smile briefly lighting his exhausted face When he wasnt putting out fires for the French Landing FD or fighting crime with the Justice League of America that is These innocent dreams ended in a nightmare we cannot imagine But Im sure youll try Fred thinks now beginning his toe raises Earlier this week his dismembered body was discovered by Spencer Hovdahl of Centralia Hovdahl a First Farmer State Bank loan officer was inspecting an abandoned French Landing farm owned by John Ellison who lives in a neighboring county with an eye to initiating repossession proceedings I didnt want to be there in the first place Hovdahl told this reporter If theres anything I hate its the repo stuff Knowing Spence Hovdahl as he does Fred very much doubts if stuff  was the word he used I wanted to be there even less after I went into the henhouse Its all rickety and falling down and I would have stayed out except for the sound of the bees I thought there might be a hive in there Bees are an interest of mine and I was curious God help me I was curious I hope Ill never be curious again What he found in the henhouse was the body of sevenyearold John Wesley Irkenham The corpse had been dismembered the pieces hung from the henhouses decaying rafters by chains Although Police Chief Dale Gilbertson would neither confirm nor deny it reliable police sources in La Riviere say that the thighs torso and buttocks had been bitten  Okay thats enough for Fred everybody out of the pool He sweeps the newspaper closed and shoves it all the way down the counter to the Mr Coffee By God they never put stuff like that in the paper when he was a kid And why the Fisherman for heavens sake Why did they have to tag every monster with a catchy nickname turn a guy like whoever did this into the Celebrity Sicko of the Month Of course nothing like this had ever happened when he was Tylers age but the principle    the goddamned principle of the matter    Fred finishes his toe raises reminding himself to have a talk with Tyler It will be harder than their little talk about why his thing sometimes gets hard but it absolutely must be done Buddy system Fred will say Youve got to stick with your buddies now Ty No more rambling around on your own for a while okay Yet the idea of Ty actually being murdered seems remote to Fred it is the stuff of TV docudramas or maybe a Wes Craven movie Call it Scream The Fisherman In fact wasnt there a movie sort of like that A guy in a fishermans slicker wandering around and killing teenagers with a hook Maybe but not little kids not babies like Amy St Pierre and Johnny Irkenham Jesus the world was disintegrating right in front of him Body parts hanging from chains in a crumbling henhouse that is the part which haunts him Can that really be Can it be here right here and now in Tom SawyerCBecky Thatcher country Well let it go Its time to run But maybe the paper kind of got lost this morning Fred thinks picking it up from the counter and folding it until it looks like a thick paperback book but part of the headline accuses him even so FISHERMAN STILL AT L Maybe the paper just kind of I dont know migrated straight to the old garbage can beside the house Yes good idea Because Judy has been strange lately and Wendell Greens pulsating stories about the Fisherman are not helping Thighs and torso bitten Fred thinks as he glides through the earlymorningquiet house toward the door and while youre at it waiter have them cut me a nice rare chunk of butt She reads the press accounts obsessively making no comment but Fred doesnt like the way her eyes jump around or some of the other tics shes picked up the obsessive touching of her tongue to her upper lip for instance    and sometimes this in the last two or three days he has seen her tongue reach all the way up and pet at her philtrum just below her nose a feat he would have thought impossible if he had not seen it again last night during the local news She goes to bed earlier and earlier and sometimes she talks in her sleep  strange slurry words that dont sound like English Sometimes when Fred speaks to her she doesnt respond simply stares off into space eyes wide lips moving slightly hands kneading together cuts and scratches have begun to show up on the backs of them even though she keeps her nails cropped sensibly short Ty has noticed his mothers encroaching oddities too On Saturday while father and son were having lunch together  Judy was upstairs taking one of her long naps another new wrinkle  the boy suddenly asked right out of a blue clear sky Whats wrong with Mom Ty nothings wrong with   There is Tommy Erbter says shes a Coke short of a Happy Meal these days And had he almost reached across the tomato soup and toastedcheese sandwiches and clouted his son His only child Good old Ty who was nothing but concerned God help him he had Outside the door at the head of the concrete path leading down to the street Fred begins to jog slowly in place taking deep breath after deep breath depositing the oxygen he will soon withdraw It is usually the best part of his day assuming he and Judy dont make love that is and lately there has been precious little of that He likes the feeling  the knowledge  that his path might be the beginning of the road to anywhere that he could start out here in the Libertyville section of French Landing and wind up in New York    San Francisco    Bombay    the mountain passes of Nepal Every step outside ones own door invites the world perhaps even the universe and this is something Fred Marshall intuitively understands He sells John Deere tractors and Case cultivators yes all right already but he is not devoid of imagination When he and Judy were students at UWMadison their first dates were at the coffeehouse just off campus an espressojazzandpoetry haven called the Chocolate Watchband It would not be entirely unfair to say that they had fallen in love to the sound of angry drunks declaiming the works of Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder into the Chocolate Watchbands cheap but exquisitely loud sound system Fred draws one more deep breath and begins to run Down Robin Hood Lane to Maid Marian Way where he gives Deke Purvis a wave Deke in his robe and slippers is just picking Wendell Greens daily dose of doom up off his own stoop Then he wheels onto Avalon Street picking it up a little now showing his heels to the morning He cannot outrun his worries however Judy Judy Judy he thinks in the voice of Cary Grant a little joke that has long since worn thin with the love of his life There is the gibberish when she sleeps Theres the way her eyes dart hither and yon And lets not forget the time  just three days ago when he followed her into the kitchen and she wasnt there  shed turned out to be behind him coming down the stairs and how she had done that seems less important to him than why she had done it gone sneaking up the back stairs and then come tromping down the front ones because that is what she must have done its the only solution he can think of  Theres the constant tapping and petting she does with her tongue Fred knows what it all adds up to Judy has been acting like a woman in terror This has been going on since before the murder of Amy St Pierre so it cant be the Fisherman or not entirely the Fisherman And there is a larger issue Before the last couple of weeks Fred would have told you that his wife doesnt have a fearful bone in her body She might be just five foot two Why youre no bigger than a minute was his grandmothers comment when she first met Freds intended but Judy has the heart of a lion of a Viking warrior This isnt bullshit or hype or poetic license it is the simple truth as Fred sees it and it is the contrast between what he has always known and what he sees now that scares him the most From Avalon he races onto Camelot crossing the intersection without looking for traffic going much faster than usual almost sprinting instead of jogging He is remembering something that happened about a month after they started going out It was the Chocolate Watchband they had gone to as usual only this time during the afternoon to listen to a jazz quartet that had actually been pretty good Not that they had listened very much as Fred now recalls it mostly he had talked to Judy about how little he liked being in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences Moo U the Letters and Science snooties called it and how little he liked the unspoken family assumption that when he graduated he would come on back home and help Phil run the family farm in French Landing The idea of spending his life in harness with Phil gave Fred a severe case of the glooms What do you want then Judy had asked Holding his hand on the table a candle burning inside a jelly glass the combo onstage working a sweet little number called Ill Be There for You I dont know hed said but I tell you what Jude I should be in Business Admin not Moo U Im a hell of a lot better at selling than at planting Then why dont you switch Because my family thinks  Your family isnt going to have to live your life Fred  you are Talk is cheap he remembers thinking but then something had happened on the way back to campus something so amazing and out of his understanding of how life was supposed to work that it fills him with wonder even now some thirteen years later Still talking about his future and their future together I could be a farm wife Judy had said but only if my husband really wants to be a farmer Deep into that Letting their feet carry them along without much interest in exactly where they were And then at the intersection of State Street and Gorham a scream of brakes and a hearty metallic bang had interrupted the conversation Fred and Judy had looked around and seen a Dodge pickup that had just tangled bumpers with an elderly Ford station wagon Getting out of the wagon which had pretty clearly run the stop sign at the end of Gorham Street was a middleaged man in a middleaged brown suit He looked scared as well as shaken up and Fred thought there was good reason for that the man advancing toward him from the pickup truck was young heavyset Fred particularly remembered the belly bulging over the waist of his jeans and carrying a tire iron You goddamn careless asshole Young and Heavyset cried Look what you done to my truck This my dads truck you goddamn asshole MiddleAged Suit backing up eyes wide hands raised Fred watching fascinated from in front of Rickmans Hardware thinking Oh no mister bad idea You dont back away from a guy like this you go toward him even as mad as he is Youre provoking him  cant you see that youre provoking him So fascinated he didnt realize that Judys hand was no longer in his listening with a kind of sick foreknowledge as Mr MiddleAged Suit still backing up blathered about how he was sorry    entirely his fault wasnt looking wasnt thinking    insurance papers    State Farm    draw a diagram    get a policeman to take statements    And all the time Young and Heavyset was advancing thwocking the end of the tire iron into the palm of his hand not listening This wasnt about insurance or compensation this was about how Mr MiddleAged Suit had scared the shit out of him while he was just driving along and minding his own business and listening to Johnny Paycheck sing Take This Job and Shove It Young and Heavyset intended to take a little payback paycheck of his own for getting the shit scared out of him and all jounced around behind the wheel    had to take a little because the other mans smell was inciting him that pissyellow smell of fear and innate defenselessness It was a case of rabbit and farmyard dog and all at once the rabbit was clean out of backing room Mr MiddleAged Suit was pressed against the side of his station wagon and in a moment the tire iron was going to start swinging and the blood was going to start flying Except there was no blood and not a single swing because all at once Judy DeLois was there no bigger than a minute but standing between them looking fearlessly up into Young and Heavysets burning face Fred blinked wondering how in the name of God shed gotten there so damned fast Much later he would feel the same way when he followed her into the kitchen only to hear the steady thump of her feet descending the front stairs And then Then Judy slapped Young and Heavysets arm Whack right on the meaty bicep she slapped him leaving a white palm print on the sunburned freckled flesh below the sleeve of the guys torn blue Tshirt Fred saw it but couldnt believe it Quit it Judy shouted up into Young and Heavysets surprised beginningtobebewildered face Put it down quit it Dont be dumb You want to go to jail over seven hundred dollars worth of bodywork Put it down Get it together big boy Put    that    thing    DOWN Thered been one second when Fred was quite sure Young and Heavyset was going to bring the tire iron down anyway and right on his pretty little girlfriends head But Judy never flinched her eyes never left the eyes of the young man with the tire iron who towered at least a foot over her and must have outweighed her by a couple of hundred pounds There was certainly no pissy yellow fear smell coming off her that day her tongue did no nervous patting at her upper lip or her philtrum her blazing eyes were steadfast And after another moment Young and Heavyset put the tire iron down Fred wasnt aware that a crowd had gathered until he heard the spontaneous applause from perhaps thirty onlookers He joined in never more proud of her than he was at that moment And for the first time Judy looked startled She hung in there though startled or not She got the two of them together tugging Mr MiddleAged Suit forward by one arm and actually hectored them into shaking hands By the time the cops arrived Young and Heavyset and Mr MiddleAged Suit were sitting side by side on the curb studying each others insurance papers Case closed Fred and Judy walked on toward the campus holding hands again For two blocks Fred didnt speak Was he in awe of her He supposes now that he was At last he said That was amazing She gave him an uncomfortable little look an uncomfortable little smile No it wasnt she said If you want to call it something call it good citizenship I could see that guy getting ready to send himself to jail I didnt want that to happen Or the other guy to be hurt Yet she said that last almost as an afterthought and Fred for the first time sensed not only her courage but her unflinching Vikings heart She was on the side of Young and Heavyset because    well because the other fellow had been afraid Werent you worried though he asked her He had still been so stunned by what hed seen that it hadnt crossed his mind  yet  to think he should be a little ashamed after all it was his girlfriend whod stepped in instead of him and that wasnt the Gospel According to Hollywood Werent you afraid that in the heat of the moment the guy with the tire iron would take a swing at you Judys eyes had grown puzzled It never crossed my mind she said Camelot eventually debouches into Chase Street where there is a pleasant little gleam of the Mississippi on clear days like this one but Fred doesnt go that far He turns at the top of Liberty Heights and starts back the way he came his shirt now soaked with sweat Usually the run makes him feel better but not today at least not yet The fearless Judy of that afternoon on the corner of State and Gorham is so unlike the shiftyeyed sometimes disconnected Judy who now lives in his house  the naptaking handwringing Judy  that Fred has actually spoken to Pat Skarda about it Yesterday this was when the doc was in Goltzs looking at riding lawn mowers Fred had shown him a couple a Deere and a Honda inquired after his family and then asked casually he hoped Hey Doc tell me something  do you think its possible for a person to just go crazy Without any warning like Skarda had given him a sharper look than Fred had really liked Are we talking about an adult or an adolescent Fred Well were not talking about anyone actually Big hearty laugh  unconvincing to Freds own ears and judging from Pat Skardas look not very convincing to him either Not anyone real anyway But as a hypothetical case lets say an adult Skarda had thought about it then shook his head There are few absolutes in medicine even fewer in psychiatric medicine That said I have to tell you that I think its very unlikely for a person to just go crazy It may be a fairly rapid process but it is a process We hear people say Soandso snapped but thats rarely the case Mental dysfunction  neurotic or psychotic behavior  takes time to develop and there are usually signs Hows your mom these days Fred Mom Oh hey shes fine Right in the pink And Judy It had taken him a moment to get a smile started but once he did he managed a big one Big and guileless Judy Shes in the pink too Doc Of course she is Steady as she goes Sure Steady as she goes Just showing a few signs that was all Maybe theyll pass he thinks Those good old endorphins are finally kicking in and all at once this seems plausible Optimism is a more normal state for Fred who does not believe in slippage and a little smile breaks on his face  the days first Maybe the signs will pass Maybe whatevers wrong with her will blow out as fast as it blew in Maybe its even you know a menstrual thing Like PMS God if that was all it was what a relief  In the meantime theres Ty to think about He has to have a talk with Tyler about the buddy system because while Fred doesnt believe what Wendell Green is apparently trying to insinuate that the ghost of a fabulous turnofthecentury cannibal and allaround boogerman named Albert Fish has for some reason turned up here in Coulee Country someone is certainly out there and this someone has murdered two little children and done unspeakable at least unless youre Wendell Green it seems things to the bodies Thighs torso and buttocks bitten Fred thinks and runs faster although now hes getting a stitch in his side Yet this bears repeating he does not believe that these horrors can actually touch his son nor does he see how they can have caused Judys condition since her oddities started while Amy St Pierre was still alive Johnny Irkenham too both of them presumably playing happily in their respective backyards Maybe this maybe that    but enough of Fred and his worries all right Let us rise from the environs of his troubled head and precede him back to No  Robin Hood Lane  lets go directly to the source of his troubles The upstairs window of the connubial bedroom is open and the screen is certainly no problem we strain ourselves right through entering with the breeze and the first sounds of the awakening day The sounds of French Landing awakening do not awaken Judy Marshall Nope she has been stareyeyed since three conning the shadows for she doesnt know what fleeing dreams too horrible to remember Yet she does remember some things little as she wants to Saw the eye again she remarks to the empty room Her tongue comes out and with no Fred around to watch her she knows hes watching she is beset but not stupid  it does not just pet at her philtrum but slathers it in a great big wipe like a dog licking its chops after a bowl of scraps Its a red eye His eye Eye of the King She looks up at the shadows of the trees outside They dance on the ceiling making shapes and faces shapes and faces Eye of the King she repeats and now it starts with the hands kneading and twisting and squeezing and digging Abbalah Foxes down foxholes Abbalahdoon the Crimson King Rats in their ratholes Abbalah Munshun The King is in his Tower eating bread and honey The Breakers in the basement making all the money She shakes her head from side to side Oh these voices out of the darkness they come and sometimes she awakens with a vision burning behind her eyes a vision of a vast slaty tower standing in a field of roses A field of blood Then the talking begins the speaking in tongues testification words she cant understand let alone control a mixed stream of English and gibberish Trudge trudge trudge she says The little ones are trudging on their bleeding footsies    oh for Christs sake wont this ever stop Her tongue yawns out and licks across the tip of her nose for a moment her nostrils are plugged with her own spit and her head roars  Abbalah Abbalahdoon Cantah Abbalah  with those terrible foreign words those terrible impacted images of the Tower and the burning caves beneath caves through which little ones trudge on bleeding feet Her mind strains with them and there is only one thing that will make them stop only one way to get relief Judy Marshall sits up On the table beside her there is a lamp a copy of the latest John Grisham novel a little pad of paper a birthday present from Ty each sheet headed HERES ANOTHER GREAT IDEA I HAD and a ballpoint pen with LA RIVIERE SHERATON printed on the side Judy seizes the pen and scribbles on the pad No Abbalah no Abbalahdoon no Tower no Breakers no Crimson King only dreams these are just my dreams It is enough but pens are also roads to anywhere and before she can divorce the tip of this one from the birthday pad it writes one more line The Black House is the doorway to Abbalah the entrance to hell Sheol Munshun all these worlds and spirits No more Good merciful God no more And the worst thing What if it all begins to make sense She throws the pen back on the table where it rolls to the base of the lamp and lies still Then she tears the page from the pad crumples it and sticks it in her mouth She chews furiously not tearing it but at least mashing it sodden then swallows There is an awful moment when it sticks in her throat but then it goes down Words and worlds recede and Judy falls back against the pillows exhausted Her face is pale and sweaty her eyes huge with unshed tears but the moving shadows on the ceiling no longer look like faces to her  the faces of trudging children of rats in their ratholes foxes in foxholes eye of the King AbbalahAbbalahdoon Now they are just the shadows of the trees again She is Judy DeLois Marshall wife of Fred mother of Ty This is Libertyville this is French Landing this is French County this is Wisconsin this is America this is the Northern Hemisphere this is the world and there is no other world than this Let it be so Ah let it be so Her eyes close and as she finally slips back to sleep we slip across the room to the door but just before we get there Judy Marshall says one other thing  says it as she crosses over the border and into sleep Burnside is not your name Where is your hole The bedroom door is closed and so we use the keyhole passing through it like a sigh Down the hall we go past pictures of Judys family and Freds including one photo of the Marshall family farm where Fred and Judy spent a horrible but blessedly short period not long after their marriage Want some good advice Dont talk to Judy Marshall about Freds brother Phil Just dont get her started as George Rathbun would undoubtedly say No keyhole in the door at the end of the hall and so we slide underneath like a telegram and into a room we immediately know is a boys room we can tell from the mingled smells of dirty athletic socks and neatsfoot oil Its small this room but it seems bigger than Fred and Judys down the hall very likely because the odor of anxiety is missing On the walls are pictures of Shaquille ONeal Jeromy Burnitz last years Milwaukee Bucks team    and Tyler Marshalls idol Mark McGwire McGwire plays for the Cards and the Cards are the enemy but hell its not as if the Milwaukee Brewers are actually competition for anything The Brew Crew were doormats in the American League and they are likewise doormats in the National And McGwire    well hes a hero isnt he Hes strong hes modest and he can hit the baseball a country mile Even Tylers dad who roots strictly for Wisconsin teams thinks McGwire is something special The greatest hitter in the history of the game he called him after the seventyhomerun season and Tyler although little more than an infant in that fabled year has never forgotten this Also on the wall of this little boy who will soon be the Fishermans fourth victim yes there has already been a third as we have seen holding pride of place directly over his bed is a travel poster showing a great dark castle at the end of a long and misty meadow At the bottom of the poster which he has Scotchtaped to the wall his mom absolutely forbids pushpins it says COME BACK TO THE AULD SOD in big green letters Ty is considering taking the poster down long enough to cut this part off He doesnt like the poster because he has any interest in Ireland to him the picture whispers of somewhere else somewhere Entirely Else It is like a photograph of some splendid mythical kingdom where there might be unicorns in the forests and dragons in the caves Never mind Ireland never mind Harry Potter either Hogwarts is fine enough for summer afternoons but this is a castle in the Kingdom of Entirely Else Its the first thing Tyler Marshall sees in the morning the last thing he sees at night and thats just the way he likes it He lies curled on his side in his underwear shorts a human comma with tousled dark blond hair and a thumb that is close to his mouth really just an inch or so away from being sucked He is dreaming  we can see his eyeballs moving back and forth behind his closed lids His lips move    hes whispering something    Abbalah Is he whispering his mothers word Surely not but    We lean closer to listen but before we can hear anything a circuit in Tylers jazzy red clockradio goes hot and all at once the voice of George Rathbun fills the room calling Tyler hence from whatever dreams have been playing themselves out under that tousled thatch Fans you gotta listen to me now how many times have I told you this If you dont know Henreid Brothers Furniture of French Landing and Centralia then you dont know furniture Thats right Im talking Henreid Brothers home of the Colonial Blowout Livingroom sets diningroom sets bedroom sets famous names you know and trust like LaZBoy Breton Woods and Moosehead EVEN A BLIND MAN CAN SEE THAT HENREID BROTHERS MEANS QUALITY Ty Marshall is laughing even before hes got both eyes fully open He loves George Rathbun George is absolutely fly And now without even changing gears from the commercial You guys are all ready for the Brewer Bash aintcha Sent me those postcards with your name address and el telfono on em Hope so because the contest closed at midnight If you missed out    so solly Cholly Ty closes his eyes again and mouths the same word over three times Shit shit shit He did forget to enter and now he can only hope that his dad who knows how forgetful his son can be remembered and entered the contest for him Grand prize George is saying ONLY the chance for you or the favorite young person of your acquaintance to be the Brew Crews batboy or batgirl for the entire Cincinnati series ONLY the chance to win an autographed Richie Sexson bat the LUMBER that holds the LIGHTNING Not to mention fifty free seats on the firstbase side with me George Rathbun Coulee Countrys Traveling College of Baseball Knowledge BUT WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS If you missed out youre too late Case closed game over zip up your fly Oh I know why I brought it up  to make sure you tune in next Friday to see if I speak YOUR NAME over the radio Ty groans There are only two chances that George will speak his name over the radio slim and none Not that he cared so much about being a batboy dressed in a baggy Brewers uni and running around in front of all those people at Miller Park but to own Richie Sexsons own bat the lumber with the lightning    how boss would thatve been Tyler rolls out of bed sniffs the armpits of yesterdays Tshirt tosses it aside gets another out of the drawer His dad sometimes asks him why he sets his alarm so early  its summer vacation after all  and Tyler cant seem to make him understand that every day is important especially those filled with warmth and sunlight and no particular responsibilities Its as if theres some little voice deep inside him warning him not to waste a minute not a single one because time is short What George Rathbun says next drives the remaining sleepfog from Tylers brain  its like a dash of cold water Say there Coulee want to talk about the Fisherman Tyler stops what hes doing an odd little chill running up his back and then down his arms The Fisherman Some crazy guy killing kids    and eating them Well hes heard that rumor mostly from the bigger kids down at the baseball field or at the French Landing Rec Center but who would do something so gross Cannibalism ack Georges voice drops Now Im going to tell you a little secret so listen close to your Uncle George Tyler sits on his bed holding his sneakers by the laces and listening closely to his Uncle George as bidden It seems odd to hear George Rathbun talking about a subject so    so unsporty but Tyler trusts him Didnt George Rathbun predict that the Badgers would go to at least the Elite Eight two years ago when everyone else said theyd get blown out in the first round of the Big Dance Yeah he did Case closed game over zip up your fly Georges voice drops further to what is almost a confidential whisper The original Fisherman boys and girls Albert Fish has been dead and gone for sixtyseven years and sfars I know he never got much west of New Jersey Furthermore he was probably a DAMYANKEE FAN SO COOL IT COULEE COUNTRY JUST CAAAALM DOWN Tyler relaxes smiling and starts putting on his sneakers Calm down you got that right The day is new and yeah okay his moms been a little on the Tinky Winky side lately but shell pull out of it Let us leave on this optimistic note  make like an amoeba and split as the redoubtable George Rathbun might say And speaking of George that ubiquitous voice of the Coulee Country morning should we not seek him out Not a bad idea Let us do so immediately OUT TYLERS WINDOW we go away from Libertyville flying southwest on a diagonal not lingering now but really flapping those old wings flying with a purpose Were headed toward the heliograph flash of earlymorning sun on the Father of Waters also toward the worlds largest sixpack Between it and County Road Oo we can call it Nailhouse Row if we want were practically honorary citizens of French Landing now is a radio tower the warning beacon on top now invisible in the bright sunshine of this newborn July day We smell grass and trees and warming earth and as we draw closer to the tower we also smell the yeasty fecund aroma of beer Next to the radio tower in the industrial park on the east side of Peninsula Drive is a little cinderblock building with a parking lot just big enough for half a dozen cars and the Coulee patrol van an aging Ford Econoline painted candyapple pink As the day winds down and afternoon wears into evening the cylindrical shadows of the sixpack will fall first over the sign on the balding lawn facing the drive then the building then the parking lot KDCUAM this sign reads YOUR TALK VOICE IN COULEE COUNTRY Spraypainted across it in a pink that almost matches the patrol van is a fervent declaration TROY LUVS MARYANN YES Later on Howie Soule the UCrew engineer will clean this off probably during the Rush Limbaugh show which is satellite fed and totally automated but for now it stays telling us all we need to know about smalltown luv in middle America Looks like we found something nice after all Coming out of the stations side door as we arrive is a slender man dressed in pleated khaki Dockers a tieless white shirt of Egyptian cotton buttoned all the way to the neck and maroon braces they are as slim as he is those braces and far too cool to be called suspenders suspenders are vulgar things worn by such creatures as Chipper Maxton and Sonny Heartfield down at the funeral home This silverhaired fellow is also wearing a very sharp straw fedora antique but beautifully kept The maroon hatband matches his braces Aviatorstyle sunglasses cover his eyes He takes a position on the grass to the left of the door beneath a battered speaker that is amping KDCUs current broadcast the local news This will be followed by the Chicago farm report which gives him ten minutes before he has to settle in behind the mike again We watch in growing puzzlement as he produces a pack of American Spirit cigarettes from his shirt pocket and fires one up with a gold lighter Surely this elegant fellow in the braces Dockers and Bass Weejuns cannot be George Rathbun In our minds we have already built up a picture of George and it is one of a fellow very different from this In our minds eye we see a guy with a huge belly hanging over the white belt of his checked pants all those ballpark bratwursts a brickred complexion all those ballpark beers not to mention all that bellowing at the dastardly umps and a squat broad neck perfect for housing those asbestos vocal cords The George Rathbun of our imagination  and all of Coulee Countrys it almost goes without saying  is a popeyed broadassed wildhaired leatherlunged Rolaidspopping Chevydriving Republicanvoting heart attack waiting to happen a churning urn of sports trivia mad enthusiasms crazy prejudices and high cholesterol This fellow is not that fellow This fellow moves like a dancer This fellow is iced tea on a hot day cool as the king of spades But say thats the joke of it isnt it Uhhuh The joke of the fat deejay with the skinny voice only turned inside out In a very real sense George Rathbun does not exist at all He is a hobby in action a fiction in the flesh and only one of the slim mans multiple personalities The people at KDCU know his real name and think theyre in on the joke the punch line of course being Georges trademark line the evenablindman thing but they dont know the half of it Nor is this a metaphorical statement They know exactly onethird of it because the man in the Dockers and the straw fedora is actually four people In any case George Rathbun has been the saving of KDCU the last surviving AM station in a predatory FM market For five mornings a week week in and week out he has been a drivetime bonanza The UCrew as they call themselves love him just about to death Above him the loudspeaker cackles on   still no leads according to Chief Dale Gilbertson who has called Herald reporter Wendell Green an outoftown fearmonger who is more interested in selling papers than in how we do things in French Landing Meanwhile in Arden a house fire has taken the lives of an elderly farmer and his wife Horst P Lepplemier and his wife Gertrude both eightytwo    Horst P Lepplemier says the slim man drawing on his cigarette with what appears to be great enjoyment Try saying that one ten times fast you moke Behind him and to his right the door opens again and although the smoker is still standing directly beneath the speaker he hears the door perfectly well The eyes behind the aviator shades have been dead his whole life but his hearing is exquisite The newcomer is pastyfaced and comes blinking into the morning sun like a baby mole that has just been turned out of its burrow by the blade of a passing plow His head has been shaved except for the Mohawk strip up the center of his skull and the pigtail that starts just above the nape of his neck and hangs to his shoulder blades The Mohawk has been dyed bright red the tail is electric blue Dangling from one earlobe is a lightningbolt earring that looks suspiciously like the Nazi SS insignia He is wearing a torn black Tshirt with a logo that reads SNIVELLING SHITS  THE WE GET HARD FOR JESUS TOUR In one hand this colorful fellow has a CD jewel box Hello Morris says the slim man in the fedora still without turning Morris pulls in a little gasp and in his surprise looks like the nice Jewish boy that he actually is Morris Rosen is the UCrews summer intern from the Oshkosh branch of UW Man I love that unpaid grunt labor station manager Tom Wiggins has been heard to say usually while rubbing his hands together fiendishly Never has a checkbook been guarded so righteously as the Wigger guards the KDCU checkbook He is like Smaug the Dragon reclining on his heaps of gold not that there are heaps of anything in the DCU accounts it bears repeating to say that as an AM talker the station is lucky just to be alive Morriss look of surprise  it might be fair to call it uneasy surprise  dissolves into a smile Wow Mr Leyden Good grab What a pair of ears Then he frowns Even if Mr Leyden  whos standing directly beneath the outside honker cant forget that  heard someone come out how in Gods name did he know which someone it was Howd you know it was me he asks Only two people around here smell like marijuana in the morning Henry Leyden says One of them follows his morning smoke with Scope the other  thats you Morris  just lets her rip Wow Morris says respectfully That is totally bitchrod I am totally bitchrod Henry agrees He speaks softly and thoughtfully Its a tough job but somebody has to do it In regard to your morning rendezvous with the undeniably tasty Thai stick may I offer an Appalachian aphorism Go dude This is Morriss first real discussion with Henry Leyden who is every bit the head Morris has been told to expect Every bit and more It is no longer so hard to believe that he could have another identity    a secret identity like Bruce Wayne But still    this is just so pimp What we do in our childhood forms as a habit Henry says in the same soft totally unCGeorge Rathbun voice That is my advice to you Morris Yeah totally Morris says He has no clue what Mr Leyden is talking about But he slowly shyly extends the CD jewel box in his hand For a moment when Henry makes no move to take it Morris feels crushed all at once seven years old again and trying to wow his alwaystoobusy father with a picture he has spent all afternoon drawing in his room Then he thinks Hes blind dickweed He may be able to smell pot on your breath and he may have ears like a bat but hows he supposed to know youre holding out a fucking CD Hesitantly a bit frightened by his own temerity Morris takes Henrys wrist He feels the man start a little but then Leyden allows his hand to be guided to the slender box Ah a CD Henry says And what is it pray tell You gotta play the seventh track tonight on your show Morris says Please For the first time Henry looks alarmed He takes a drag on his cigarette then drops it without even looking  of course ha ha into the sandfilled plastic bucket by the door What show could you possibly mean he asks Instead of answering directly Morris makes a rapid little smacking noise with his lips the sound of a small but voracious carnivore eating something tasty And to make things worse he follows it with the Wisconsin Rats trademark line as well known to the folks in Morriss age group as George Rathbuns hoarse Even a blind man cry is known to their elders Chew it up eat it up wash it down it aaallll comes out the same place He doesnt do it very well but theres no question who hes doing the one and only Wisconsin Rat whose evening drivetime program on KWLAFM is famous in Coulee Country except the word we probably want is infamous KWLA is the tiny college FM station in La Riviere hardly more than a smudge on the wallpaper of Wisconsin radio but the Rats audience is huge And if anyone found out that the comfortable Brew CrewCrooting Republicanvoting AMbroadcasting George Rathbun was also the Rat  who had once narrated a gleeful onair evacuation of his bowels onto a Backstreet Boys CD  there could be trouble Quite serious possibly resounding well beyond the tightknit little radio community What in Gods name would ever make you think that Im the Wisconsin Rat Morris Henry asks I barely know who youre talking about Who put such a weird idea in your head An informed source Morris says craftily He wont give Howie Soule up not even if they pull out his fingernails with redhot tongs Besides Howie only found out by accident went into the station crapper one day after Henry left and discovered that Henrys wallet had fallen out of his back pocket while he was sitting on the throne Youd have thought a fellow whose other senses were so obviously tightwired would have sensed the absence but probably Henrys mind had been on other things  he was obviously a heavy dude who undoubtedly spent his days getting through some heavy thoughts In any case there was a KWLA ID card in Henrys wallet which Howie had thumbed through in the spirit of friendly curiosity as he put it and on the line marked NAME someone had stamped a little inkpad drawing of a rat Case closed game over zip up your fly I have never in my life so much as stepped through the door of KWLA Henry says and this is the absolute truth He makes the Wisconsin Rat tapes among others in his studio at home then sends them in to the station from the downtown Mail Boxes Etc where he rents under the name of Joe Strummer The card with the rat stamped on it was more in the nature of an invitation from the KWLA staff than anything else one hes never taken up    but he kept the card Have you become anyone elses informed source Morris Huh Have you told anyone that you think Im the Wisconsin Rat No Course not Which as we all know is what people always say Luckily for Henry in this case it happens to be true So far at least but the day is still young And you wont will you Because rumors have a way of taking root Just like certain bad habits Henry mimes puffing pulling in smoke I know how to keep my mouth shut Morris declares with perhaps misplaced pride I hope so Because if you bruited this about Id have to kill you Bruited Morris thinks Oh man this guy is complete Kill me yeah Morris says laughing And eat you Henry says He is not laughing not even smiling Yeah right Morris laughs again but this time the laugh sounds strangely forced to his own ears Like youre Hannibal Lecture No like Im the Fisherman Henry says He slowly turns his aviator sunglasses toward Morris The sun reflects off them for a moment turning them into rufous eyes of fire Morris takes a step back without even realizing that he has done so Albert Fish liked to start with the ass did you know that N   Yes indeed He claimed that a good piece of young ass was as sweet as a veal cutlet His exact words Written in a letter to the mother of one of his victims Far out Morris says His voice sounds faint to his own ears the voice of a plump little pig denying entrance to the big bad wolf But Im not exactly like worried that youre the Fisherman No Why not Man youre blind for one thing Henry says nothing only stares at the now vastly uneasy Morris with his fiery glass eyes And Morris thinks But is he blind He gets around pretty good for a blind guy    and the way he tabbed me as soon as I came out here how weird was that Ill keep quiet he says Honest to God Thats all I want Henry says mildly Now that weve got that straight what exactly have you brought me He holds up the CD  but not as if hes looking at it Morris observes with vast relief Its um this Racine group Dirtysperm And theyve got this cover of Where Did Our Love Go The old Supremes thing Only they do it at like a hundred and fifty beats a minute Its fuckin hilarious I mean it destroys the whole pop thing man blitzes it Dirtysperm Henry says Didnt they used to be Jane Wyatts Clit Morris looks at Henry with awe that could easily become love Dirtysperms lead guitarist like formed JWC man Then him and the bass guy had this political fallingout something about Dean Kissinger and Henry Acheson and Ucky Ducky  hes the guitarist  went off to form Dirtysperm  Where Did Our Love Go Henry muses then hands the CD back And as if he sees the way Morriss face falls I cant be seen with something like that  use your head Stick it in my locker Morriss gloom disappears and he breaks into a sunny smile Yeah okay You got it Mr Leyden And dont let anyone see you doing it Especially not Howie Soule Howies a bit of a snoop Youd do well not to emulate him No way baby Still smiling delighted at how all this has gone Morris reaches for the door handle And Morris Yeah Since you know my secret perhaps youd better call me Henry Henry Yeah Is this the best morning of the summer for Morris Rosen You better believe it And something else Yeah Henry Morris dares imagine a day when they will progress to Hank and Morrie Keep your mouth shut about the Rat I already told you   Yes and I believe you But temptation comes creeping Morris temptation comes creeping like a thief in the night or like a killer in search of prey If you give in to temptation Ill know Ill smell it on your skin like bad cologne Do you believe me Uh    yeah And he does Later when he has time to kick back and reflect Morris will think what a ridiculous idea that is but yes at the time he believes it Believes him Its like being hypnotized Very good Now off you go I want Ace Hardware Zaglat Chevy and Mr Tastee Ribs all cued up for the first seg Gotcha Also last nights game   Wickman striking out the side in the eighth That was pimp Totally like unBrewers No I think we want the Mark Loretta home run in the fifth Loretta doesnt hit many and the fans like him I cant think why Even a blind man can see he has no range especially from deep in the hole Go on son Put the CD in my locker and if I see the Rat Ill give it to him Im sure hell give it a spin The track   Seven seven rhymes with heaven I wont forget and neither will he Go on now Morris gives him a final grateful look and goes back inside Henry Leyden alias George Rathbun alias the Wisconsin Rat also alias Henry Shake well get to that one but not now the hour draweth late lights another cigarette and drags deep He wont have time to finish it the farm report is already in full flight hog bellies up wheat futures down and the corn as high as an elephants eye but he needs a couple of drags just now to steady himself A long long day stretches out ahead of him ending with the Strawberry Fest Hop at Maxton Elder Care that house of antiquarian horrors God save him from the clutches of William Chipper Maxton he has often thought Given a choice between ending his days at MEC and burning his face off with a blowtorch he would reach for the blowtorch every time Later if hes not totally exhausted perhaps his friend from up the road will come over and they can begin the longpromised reading of Bleak House That would be a treat How long he wonders can Morris Rosen hold on to his momentous secret Well Henry supposes he will find that out He likes the Rat too much to give him up unless he absolutely has to that much is an undeniable fact Dean Kissinger he murmurs Henry Acheson Ucky Ducky God save us He takes another drag on his cigarette then drops it into the bucket of sand It is time to go back inside time to replay last nights Mark Loretta home run time to start taking more calls from the Coulee Countrys dedicated sports fans And time for us to be off Seven oclock has rung from the Lutheran church steeple In French Landing things are getting into high gear No one lies abed long in this part of the world and we must speed along to the end of our tour Things are going to start happening soon and they may happen fast Still we have done well and we have only one more stop to make before arriving at our final destination We rise on the warm summer updrafts and hover for a moment by the KDCU tower we are close enough to hear the tiktiktik of the beacon and the low rather sinister hum of electricity looking north and taking our bearings Eight miles upriver is the town of Great Bluff named for the limestone outcropping that rises there The outcropping is reputed to be haunted because in  a chief of the Fox Indian tribe Far Eyes was his name assembled all his warriors shamans squaws and children and told them to leap to their deaths thereby escaping some hideous fate he had glimpsed in his dreams Far Eyess followers like Jim Joness did as they were bidden We wont go that far upriver however we have enough ghosts to deal with right here in French Landing Let us instead fly over Nailhouse Row once more the Harleys are gone Beezer St Pierre has led the Thunder Five off to their days work at the brewery over Queen Street and Maxton Elder Care Burnys down there still looking out his window  ugh to Bluff Street This is almost the countryside again Even now in the twentyfirst century the towns in Coulee Country give up quickly to the woods and the fields Herman Street is a left turn from Bluff Street in an area that is not quite town and not quite city Here in a sturdy brick house sitting at the end of a halfmile meadow as yet undiscovered by the developers even here there are a few developers unknowing agents of slippage lives Dale Gilbertson with his wife Sarah and his sixyearold son David We cant stay long but let us at least drift in through the kitchen window for a moment Its open after all and there is room for us to perch right here on the counter between the Silex and the toaster Sitting at the kitchen table reading the newspaper and shoveling Special K into his mouth without tasting it he has forgotten both the sugar and the sliced banana in his distress at seeing yet another Wendell Green byline on the front page of the Herald is Chief Gilbertson himself This morning he is without doubt the unhappiest man in French Landing We will meet his only competition for that booby prize soon but for the moment let us stick with Dale The Fisherman he thinks mournfully his reflections on this subject very similar to those of Bobby Dulac and Tom Lund Why didnt you name him something a little more turnofthecentury you troublesome scribbling fuck Something a little bit local Dahmerboy maybe thatd be good Ah but Dale knows why The similarities between Albert Fish who did his work in New York and their boy here in French Landing are just too good  too tasty  to be ignored Fish strangled his victims as both Amy St Pierre and Johnny Irkenham were apparently strangled Fish dined on his victims as both the girl and the boy were apparently dined upon both Fish and the current fellow showed an especial liking for the    well for the posterior regions of the anatomy Dale looks at his cereal then drops his spoon into the mush and pushes the bowl away with the side of his hand And the letters Cant forget the letters Dale glances down at his briefcase crouched at the side of his chair like a faithful dog The file is in there and it draws him like a rotted achy tooth draws the tongue Maybe he can keep his hands off it at least while hes here at home where he plays toss with his son and makes love to his wife but keeping his mind off it    thats a whole nother thing as they also say in these parts Albert Fish wrote a long and horribly explicit letter to the mother of Grace Budd the victim who finally earned the old cannibal a trip to the electric chair What a thrill electrocution will be Fish reputedly told his jailers The only one I havent tried The current doer has written similar letters one addressed to Helen Irkenham the other to Amys father the awful but genuinely griefstricken in Dales estimation Armand Beezer St Pierre It would be good if Dale could believe these letters were written by some troublemaker not otherwise connected to the murders but both contain information that has been withheld from the press information that presumably only the killer could know Dale at last gives in to temptation how well Henry Leyden would understand and hauls up his briefcase He opens it and puts a thick file where his cereal bowl lately rested He returns the briefcase to its place by his chair then opens the file it is marked ST PIERREIRKENHAM rather than FISHERMAN He leafs past heartbreaking school photos of two smiling gaptoothed children past state medical examiner reports too horrible to read and crimescene photos too horrible to look at ah but he must look at them again and again he must look at them  the bloodslicked chains the flies the open eyes There are also various transcripts the longest being the interview with Spencer Hovdahl who found the Irkenham boy and who was very briefly considered a suspect Next come Xerox copies of three letters One had been sent to George and Helen Irkenham addressed to Helen alone if it made any difference One went to Armand Beezer St Pierre addressed just that way too nickname and all The third had been sent to the mother of Grace Budd of New York City following the murder of her daughter in the late spring of  Dale lays the three of them out side by side Grace sat in my lap and kissed me I made up my mind to eat her So Fish had written to Mrs Budd Amy sat in my lap and hugged me I made up my mind to eat her So had Beezer St Pierres correspondent written and was it any wonder the man had threatened to burn the French Landing police station to the ground Dale doesnt like the son of a bitch but has to admit he might feel the same way in Beezers shoes I went upstairs and stripped all my clothes off I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them Fish to Mrs Budd I went around back of the henhouse and stripped all my cloes off New if I did not I would get his blood on them Anonymous to Helen Irkenham And here was a question How could a mother receive a letter like that and retain her sanity Was that possible Dale thought not Helen answered questions coherently had even offered him tea the last time he was out there but she had a glassy poleaxed look in her eye that suggested she was running entirely on instruments Three letters two new one almost seventyfive years old And yet all three are so similar The St Pierre letter and the Irkenham letter had been handprinted by someone who was lefthanded according to the state experts The paper was plain white Hammermill mimeo available in every Office Depot and Staples in America The pen used had probably been a Bic  now there was a lead Fish to Mrs Budd back in  I did not fuck her tho I could of had I wished She died a virgin Anonymous to Beezer St Pierre I did NOT fuck her tho I could of had I wished She died a VIRGIN Anonymous to Helen Irkenham This may comfort you I did NOT fuck him tho I could of had I wished He died a VIRGIN Dales out of his depth here and knows it but he hopes he isnt a complete fool This doer although he did not sign his letters with the old cannibals name clearly wanted the connection to be made He had done everything but leave a few dead trout at the dumping sites Sighing bitterly Dale puts the letters back into the file the file back into the briefcase Dale Honey Sarahs sleepy voice from the head of the stairs Dale gives the guilty jump of a man who has almost been caught doing something nasty and latches his briefcase Im in the kitchen he calls back No need to worry about waking Davey he sleeps like the dead until at least seventhirty every morning Going in late Uhhuh He often goes in late then makes up for it by working until seven or eight or even nine in the evening Wendell Green hasnt made a big deal of that    at least not so far but give him time Talk about your cannibals Give the flowers a drink before you go would you Its been so dry You bet Watering Sarahs flowers is a chore Dale likes He gets some of his best thinking done with the garden hose in his hand A pause from upstairs    but he hasnt heard her slippers shuffling back toward the bedroom He waits And at last You okay hon Fine he calls back pumping what he hopes will be the right degree of heartiness into his voice Because you were still tossing around when I dropped off No Im fine Do you know what Davey asked me last night while I was washing his hair Dale rolls his eyes He hates these longdistance conversations Sarah seems to love them He gets up and pours himself another cup of coffee No what He asked Is Daddy going to lose his job   Dale pauses with the cup halfway to his lips What did you say I said no Of course Then you said the right thing He waits but there is no more Having injected him with one more dram of poisonous worry  Davids fragile psyche as well as what a certain party might do to the boy should David be so unlucky as to run afoul of him  Sarah shuffles back to their room and presumably to the shower beyond Dale goes back to the table sips his coffee then puts his hand to his forehead and closes his eyes In this moment we can see precisely how frightened and miserable he is Dale is just fortytwo and a man of abstemious habits but in the cruel morning light coming through the window by which we entered he looks for the moment anyway a sickly sixty He is concerned about his job knows that if the fellow who killed Amy and Johnny keeps it up he will almost certainly be turned out of office the following year He is also concerned about Davey    although Davey isnt his chief concern for like Fred Marshall he cannot actually conceive that the Fisherman could take his and Sarahs own child No it is the other children of French Landing he is more worried about possibly the children of Centralia and Arden as well His worst fear is that he is simply not good enough to catch the son of a bitch That he will kill a third a fourth perhaps an eleventh and twelfth God knows he has requested help And gotten it    sort of There are two State Police detectives assigned to the case and the FBI guy from Madison keeps checking in on an informal basis though the FBI is not officially part of the investigation Even his outside help has a surreal quality for Dale one that has been partially caused by an odd coincidence of their names The FBI guy is Agent John P Redding The state detectives are Perry Brown and Jeffrey Black So he has Brown Black and Redding on his team The Color Posse Sarah calls them All three making it clear that they are strictly working support at least for the time being Making it clear that Dale Gilbertson is the man standing on ground zero Christ but I wish Jack would sign on to help me with this Dale thinks Id deputize him in a second just like in one of those corny old Western movies Yes indeed In a second When Jack had first come to French Landing almost four years ago Dale hadnt known what to make of the man his officers immediately dubbed Hollywood By the time the two of them had nailed Thornberg Kinderling  yes inoffensive little Thornberg Kinderling hard to believe but absolutely true  he knew exactly what to make of him The guy was the finest natural detective Dale had ever met in his life The only natural detective thats what you mean Yes all right The only one And although they had shared the collar at the LA newcomers absolute insistence it had been Jacks detective work that had turned the trick He was almost like one of those storybook detectives    Hercule Poirot Ellery Queen one of those Except that Jack didnt exactly deduct nor did he go around tapping his temple and talking about his little gray cells He    He listens Dale mutters and gets up He heads for the back door then returns for his briefcase Hell put it in the back seat of his cruiser before he waters the flower beds He doesnt want those awful pictures in his house any longer than strictly necessary He listens Like the way hed listened to Janna Massengale the bartender at the Taproom Dale had had no idea why Jack was spending so much time with the little chippy it had even crossed his mind that Mr Los Angeles Linen Slacks was trying to hustle her into bed so he could go back home and tell all his friends on Rodeo Drive that hed gotten himself a little piece of the cheese up there in Wisconsin where the air was rare and the legs were long and strong But that hadnt been it at all He had been listening and finally she had told him what he needed to hear Yeah shurr people get funny ticks when theyre drinking Janna had said Theres this one guy who starts doing this after a couple of belts She had pinched her nostrils together with the tips of her fingers    only with her hand turned around so the palm pointed out Jack still smiling easily still sipping a club soda Always with the palm out Like this And mimicked the gesture Janna smiling half in love Thats it doll  youre a quick study Jack Sometimes I guess Whats this fellas name darlin Janna Kinderling Thornberg Kinderling She giggled Only after a drink or two  once hes started up with that pinchy thing  he wants everyone to call him Thorny Jack still with his own smile And does he drink Bombay gin darlin One ice cube little trace of bitters Jannas smile starting to fade now looking at him as if he might be some kind of wizard Howd you know that But how he knew it didnt matter because that was really the whole package done up in a neat bow Case closed game over zip up your fly Eventually Jack had flown back to Los Angeles with Thornberg Kinderling in custody  Thornberg Kinderling just an inoffensive bespectacled farminsurance salesman from Centralia wouldnt say boo to a goose wouldnt say shit if he had a mouthful wouldnt dare ask your mamma for a drink of water on a hot day but he had killed two prostitutes in the City of Angels No strangulation for Thorny he had done his work with a Buck knife which Dale himself had eventually traced to Lapham Sporting Goods the nasty little trading post a door down from the Sand Bar Centralias grungiest drinking establishment By then DNA testing had nailed Kinderlings ass to the barn door but Jack had been glad to have the provenance of the murder weapon anyway He had called Dale personally to thank him and Dale whod never been west of Denver in his life had been almost absurdly touched by the courtesy Jack had said several times during the course of the investigation that you could never have enough evidence when the doer was a genuine bad guy and Thorny Kinderling had turned out to be about as bad as you could want Hed gone the insanity route of course and Dale  who had privately hoped he might be called upon to testify  was delighted when the jury rejected the plea and sentenced him to consecutive life terms And what made all that happen What had been the first cause Why a man listening That was all Listening to a lady bartender who was used to having her breasts stared at while her words most commonly went in one ear of the man doing the staring and out the other And who had Hollywood Jack listened to before he had listened to Janna Massengale Some Sunset Strip hooker it seemed    or more likely a whole bunch of them What would you call that anyway Dale wonders absently as he goes out to the garage to get his trusty hose A shimmy of streetwalkers A strut of hookers None of them could have picked Thornberg Kinderling out of a lineup because the Thornberg who visited LA surely hadnt looked much like the Thornberg who traveled around to the farmsupply companies in the Coulee and over in Minnesota LA Thorny had worn a wig contacts instead of specs and a little false mustache The most brilliant thing was the skin darkener Jack had said Just a little just enough to make him look like a native Dramatics all four years at French Landing High School Dale had replied grimly I looked it up The little bastard played Don Juan his junior year do you believe it A lot of sly little changes too many for a jury to swallow an insanity plea it seemed but Thorny had forgotten that one revelatory little signature that trick of pinching his nostrils together with the palm of his hand turned outward Some prostitute had remembered it though and when she mentioned it  only in passing Dale has no doubt just as Janna Massengale did  Jack heard it Because he listened Called to thank me for tracing the knife and again to tell me how the jury came back Dale thinks but that second time he wanted something too And I knew what it was Even before he opened his mouth I knew Because while he is no genius detective like his friend from the Golden State Dale had not missed the younger mans unexpected immediate response to the landscape of western Wisconsin Jack had fallen in love with the Coulee Country and Dale would have wagered a good sum that it had been love at first look It had been impossible to mistake the expression on his face as they drove from French Landing to Centralia from Centralia to Arden from Arden to Miller wonder pleasure almost a kind of rapture To Dale Jack had looked like a man who has come to a place he has never been before only to discover he is back home Man I cant get over this hed said once to Dale The two of them had been riding in Dales old Caprice cruiser the one that just wouldnt stay aligned and sometimes the horn stuck which could be embarrassing Do you realize how lucky you are to live here Dale It must be one of the most beautiful places in the world Dale who had lived in the Coulee his entire life had not disagreed Toward the end of their final conversation concerning Thornberg Kinderling Jack had reminded Dale of how hed once asked not quite kidding not quite serious either for Dale to let him know if a nice little place ever came on the market in Dales part of the world something out of town And Dale had known at once from Jacks tone  the almost anxious drop in his voice  that the kidding was over So you owe me Dale murmurs shouldering the hose You owe me you bastard Of course he has asked Jack to lend an unofficial hand with the Fisherman investigation but Jack has refused    almost with a kind of fear Im retired hed said brusquely If you dont know what that word means Dale we can look it up in the dictionary together But its ridiculous isnt it Of course it is How can a man not yet thirtyfive be retired Especially one who is so infernally good at the job You owe me baby he says again now walking along the side of the house toward the bib faucet The sky above is cloudless the wellwatered lawn is green there is nary a sign of slippage not out here on Herman Street Yet perhaps there is and perhaps we feel it A kind of discordant hum like the sound of all those lethal volts coursing through the steel struts of the KDCU tower But we have stayed here too long We must take wing again and proceed to our final destination of this early morning We dont know everything yet but we know three important things first that French Landing is a town in terrible distress second that a few people  Judy Marshall for one Charles Burnside for another understand on some deep level that the towns ills go far beyond the depredations of a single sick pedophilemurderer third that we have met no one capable of consciously recognizing the force  the slippage  that has now come to bear on this quiet town hard by Tom and Hucks river Each person weve met is in his own way as blind as Henry Leyden This is as true of the folks we havent so far encountered  Beezer St Pierre Wendell Green the Color Posse  as it is of those we have Our hearts groan for a hero And while we may not find one this is the twentyfirst century after all the days not of dArtagnan and Jack Aubrey but of George W Bush and Dirtysperm we can perhaps find a man who was a hero once upon a time Let us therefore search out an old friend one we last glimpsed a thousand and more miles east of here on the shore of the steady Atlantic Years have passed and they have in some ways lessened the boy who was he has forgotten much and has spent a good part of his adult life maintaining that state of amnesia But he is French Landings only hope so let us take wing and fly almost due east back over the woods and fields and gentle hills Mostly we see miles of unbroken farmland regimental cornfields luxuriant hay fields fat yellow swaths of alfalfa Dusty narrow drives lead to white farmhouses and their arrays of tall barns granaries cylindrical cementblock silos and long metal equipment sheds Men in denim jackets are moving along the wellworn paths between the houses and the barns We can already smell the sunlight Its odor richly compacted of butter yeast earth growth and decay will intensify as the sun ascends and the light grows stronger Below us Highway  intersects Highway  at the center of tiny Centralia The empty parking lot behind the Sand Bar awaits the noisy arrival of the Thunder Five who customarily spend their Saturday afternoons evenings and nights in the enjoyment of the Sand Bars pool tables hamburgers and pitchers of that ambrosia to the creation of which they have devoted their eccentric lives Kingsland Brewing Companys finest product and a beer that can hold up its creamy head among anything made in a specialty microbrewery or a Belgian monastery Kingsland Ale If Beezer St Pierre Mouse and company say it is the greatest beer in the world why should we doubt them Not only do they know much more about beer than we do they called upon every bit of the knowledge skill expertise and seatofthepants inspiration at their disposal to make Kingsland Ale a benchmark of the brewers art In fact they moved to French Landing because the brewery which they had selected after careful deliberation was willing to work with them To invoke Kingsland Ale is to wish for a goodsized mouthful of the stuff but we put temptation behind us  AM is far too early for drinking anything but fruit juice coffee and milk except for the likes of Wanda Kinderling and Wanda thinks of beer even Kingsland Ale as a dietary supplement to Aristocrat vodka and we are in search of our old friend and the closest we can come to a hero whom we last saw as a boy on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean We are not about to waste time we are on the move right here and now The miles fly past beneath us and along Highway  the fields narrow as the hills rise up on both sides For all our haste we must take this in we must see where we are THREE YEARS AGO our old friend traveled down this stretch of  in the passenger seat of Dale Gilbertsons old Caprice his heart going crazy in his chest his throat constricting and his mouth dry as friendly Dale in those days little more than a smalltown cop whom he had impressed beyond rational measure simply by doing his job more or less as well as he could piloted him toward a farmhouse and five acres left Dale by his deceased father The nice little place could be purchased for next to nothing since Dales cousins did not particularly want it and it had no value to anyone else Dale had been holding on to the property for sentimental reasons but he had no particular interest in it either Dale had scarcely known what to do with a second house apart from spending a great deal of time keeping it up a task he had found oddly enjoyable but did not at all mind turning over to someone else And at this point in their relationship Dale was so in awe of our friend that far from resenting the prospect of this man occupying his fathers old house he considered it an honor As for the man in the passenger seat he was too caught up in his response to the landscape  too caught up by the landscape  to be embarrassed by Dales awe Under ordinary circumstances our friend would have urged his admirer into a quiet bar bought him a beer and said Look I know you were impressed by what I did but after all Dale Im just another cop like you Thats all And in all honesty Im a lot luckier than I deserve to be It would be the truth too ever since we last saw him our friend has been blessed if it is a blessing with such extravagantly good luck that he no longer dares to play cards or bet on sporting events When you win almost all the time winning tastes like spoiled grape juice But these were not ordinary circumstances and in the swarm of emotion that had been threatening to undo him since they left Centralia on the flat straightaway of Highway  Dales adulation barely registered This short drive to a place he had never seen before felt like a longdelayed journey home everything he saw seemed charged with remembered meaning a part of him essential Everything seemed sacred He knew he was going to buy the nice little place no matter what it looked like or how much it cost not that price could in any way have been an obstacle He was going to buy it that was all Dales heroworship affected him only to the extent that he realized he would be forced to keep his admirer from undercharging him In the meantime he struggled against the tears that wanted to fill his eyes From above we see the glacial valleys dividing the landscape to the right of  like the imprint of a giants fingers He saw only the sudden narrow roads that split off the highway and slipped into mingled sunshine and darkness Each road said Nearly there The highway said This is the way Gazing down we can observe a roadside parking area two gasoline pumps and a long gray roof bearing the fading legend ROYS STORE when he looked to his right and saw past the gas pumps the wooden stairs rising to a wide inviting porch and the stores entrance he felt as though he had already mounted those stairs a hundred times before and gone inside to pick up bread milk beer cold cuts work gloves a screwdriver a bag of tenpenny nails whatever he needed from the practical cornucopia crowded onto the shelves as after that day he would do a hundred times and more Fifty yards down the highway the bluegray sliver of Tamarack Creek comes winding into Norway Valley When Dales car rolled across the rusting little metal bridge the bridge said This is it and the casually but expensively dressed man in the passenger seat who looked as though all he knew of farmland had been learned through the windows next to firstclass seats on transcontinental flights and in fact was incapable of telling wheat from hay felt his heart shiver On the other side of the bridge a road sign read NORWAY VALLEY ROAD This is it said Dale and made the right turn into the valley Our friend covered his mouth with his hand stifling whatever sounds his shivering heart might cause him to utter Here and there wildflowers bloomed and nodded on the roadside some of them audacious and bright others halfhidden in a blanket of vibrant green Driving up this road always makes me feel good Dale said No wonder our friend managed to say Most of what Dale said failed to penetrate the whirlwind of emotion roaring through his passengers mind and body Thats the old Lund farm  cousins of my mother The oneroom schoolhouse where my greatgrandmother taught used to be right over there only they tore it down way back This here is Duane Updahls place hes no relation thank goodness Buzz blur mumble Blur mumble buzz They once again drove over Tamarack Creek its glittering bluegray water laughing and calling out Here we are Around a bend in the road they went and a wealth of luxuriant wildflowers leaned carousing toward the car In their midst the blind attentive faces of tiger lilies tilted to meet our friends face A ripple of feeling distinct from the whirlwind quieter but no less potent brought dazzled tears to the surface of his eyes Tiger lilies why Tiger lilies meant nothing to him He used the pretense of a yawn to wipe his eyes and hoped that Dale had not noticed Here we are Dale said having noticed or not and swerved into a long overgrown drive hedged with wildflowers and tall grasses which appeared to lead nowhere except into a great expanse of meadow and banks of waisthigh flowers Beyond the meadow striped fields sloped upward to the wooded hillside Youll see my dads old place in a second The meadow goes with the house and my cousins Randy and Kent own the field Our friend could not see the white twostory farmhouse that stands at the end of the last curve of the drive until the moment Dale Gilbertson swung halfway into the curve and he did not speak until Dale had pulled up in front of the house switched off the engine and both men had left the car Here was the nice little place sturdy newly painted lovingly maintained modest yet beautiful in its proportions removed from the road removed from the world at the edge of a green and yellow meadow profuse with flowers My God Dale he said its perfection Here we will find our former traveling companion who in his own boyhood knew a boy named Richard Sloat and once too briefly knew yet another whose name was simply Wolf In this sturdy comely removed white farmhouse we will find our old friend who once in his boyhood journeyed crosscountry from ocean to ocean in pursuit of a certain crucial thing a necessary object a great talisman and who despite horrendous obstacles and fearful perils succeeded in finding the object of his search and used it wisely and well Who we could say accomplished a number of miracles heroically And who remembers none of this Here making breakfast for himself in his kitchen while listening to George Rathbun on KDCU we at last find the former Los Angeles County lieutenant of police Homicide Division Jack Sawyer Our Jack Jackyboy as his mother the late Lily Cavanaugh Sawyer used to say He had followed Dale through the empty house upstairs and down into the basement dutifully admiring the new furnace and water heater Gilbertson had installed the year before his fathers death the quality of the repairs he had made since then the shining grain of the wooden floors the thickness of the insulation in the attic the solidity of the windows the many craftsmanlike touches that met his eye Yeah I did a lot of work on the place Dale told him It was pretty shipshape to begin with but I like working with my hands After a while it turned into sort of a hobby Whenever I had a couple of hours free weekends and such I got in the habit of driving over here and puttering around I dont know maybe it helped me feel like I was staying in touch with my dad He was a really good guy my dad He wanted me to be a farmer but when I said I was thinking of getting into law enforcement he supported me straight down the line Know what he said Go into farming half hearted itll kick you in the tail sunrise to sundown Youd wind up feeling no better than a mule Your mom and I didnt bring you into this world to turn you into a mule  What did she think Jack had asked My mom came from a long line of farmers Dale had said She thought I might find out that being a mule wasnt so bad after all By the time she passed away which was four years before my dad shed gotten used to my being a cop Lets go out the kitchen door and take a gander at the meadow okay While they were standing outside and taking their gander Jack had asked Dale how much he wanted for the house Dale who had been waiting for this question had knocked five thousand off the most he and Sarah had ever thought he could get Who was he kidding Dale had wanted Jack Sawyer to buy the house where he had grown up  hed wanted Jack to live near him for at least a couple of weeks during the year And if Jack did not buy the place no one else would Are you serious Jack had asked More dismayed than he wished to admit Dale had said Sounds like a fair deal to me It isnt fair to you Jack had said Im not going to let you give this place away just because you like me Raise the asking price or I walk You bigcity hotshots sure know how to negotiate All right make it three thousand more Five Jack said Or Im outta here Done But youre breaking my heart I hope this is the last time I buy property off one of you lowdown Norwegians Jack said He had purchased the house longdistance sending a down payment from LA exchanging signatures by fax no mortgage cash up front Whatever Jack Sawyers background might have been Dale had thought it was a lot wealthier than the usual police officers Some weeks later Jack had reappeared at the center of a selfcreated tornado arranging for the telephone to be connected and the electricity billed in his name scooping up what looked like half the contents of Roys Store zipping off to Arden and La Riviere to buy a new bed linens tableware castiron pots and pans and a set of French knives a compact microwave and a giant television and a stack of sound equipment so sleek black and resplendent that Dale who had been invited over for a companionable drink figured it must have cost more than his own annual salary Much else besides had Jack reeled in some of the much else consisting of items Dale had been surprised to learn could be obtained in French County Wisconsin Why would anyone need a sixtyfivedollar corkscrew called a WineMaster Who was this guy what kind of family had produced him Hed noticed a bag bearing an unfamiliar logo filled with compact discs  at fifteen sixteen dollars a pop he was looking at a couple hundred dollars worth of CDs Whatever else might have been true of Jack Sawyer he was into music in a big way Curious Dale bent down pulled out a handful of jewel boxes and regarded images of people generally black generally with instruments pressed to or in their mouths Clifford Brown Lester Young Tommy Flanagan Paul Desmond I never heard of these guys he said What is this jazz I guess You guess right Jack said Could I ask you to help me move furniture around and hang pictures stuff like that in a month or two Im going to have a lot of stuff shipped here Anytime A splendid idea bloomed in Dales mind Hey you have to meet my uncle Henry Hes even a neighbor of yours lives about a quarter mile down the road He was married to my aunt Rhoda my fathers sister who died three years ago Henrys like an encyclopedia of weird music Jack did not take up the assumption that jazz was weird Maybe it was Anyhow it probably sounded weird to Dale I wouldnt have thought farmers had much time to listen to music Dale opened his mouth and uttered a bray of laughter Henry isnt a farmer Henry    Grinning Dale raised his hands palms up and fingers spread and looked into the middle distance searching for the right phrase Hes like the reverse of a farmer When you get back Ill introduce you to him Youre going to be crazy about the guy Six weeks later Jack returned to greet the moving van and tell the men where to put the furniture and other things he had shipped a few days afterward when he had unpacked most of the boxes he telephoned Dale and asked if he was still willing to give him a hand It was  on a day so slow that Tom Lund had fallen asleep at his desk and Dale drove over without even bothering to change out of his uniform His first response after Jack had shaken his hand and ushered him in was undiluted shock Having taken a single step past the doorway Dale froze in his tracks unable to move any farther Two or three seconds passed before he realized that it was a good shock a shock of pleasure His old house had been transformed it was as if Jack Sawyer had tricked him and opened the familiar front door upon the interior of another house altogether The sweep from the living room into the kitchen looked nothing like either the space he remembered from childhood or the clean bare progression of the recent past Jack had decorated the house with the wave of a wand it seemed to Dale in the process somehow turning it into he hardly knew what  a villa on the Riviera a Park Avenue apartment Dale had never been to New York or the south of France Then it struck him that instead of transforming the old place into something it was not Jack had simply seen more in it than Dale ever had The leather sofas and chairs the glowing rugs the wide tables and discreet lamps had come from another world but fit in perfectly as if they had been made specifically for this house Everything he saw beckoned him in and he found that he could move again Wow he said Did I ever sell this place to the right guy Im glad you like it Jack said I have to admit I do too It looks even better than I expected What am I supposed to do The place is already organized Were going to hang some pictures Jack said Then itll be organized Dale supposed Jack was talking about family photographs He did not understand why anyone would need help to hang up a bunch of framed photos but if Jack wanted his assistance he would assist Besides that the pictures would tell him a considerable amount about Jacks family still a subject of great interest to him However when Jack led him to a stack of flat wooden crates leaning against the kitchen counter Dale once again got the feeling that he was out of his depth here that he had entered an unknown world The crates had been made by hand they were serious objects built to provide industrialstrength protection Some of them were five or six feet tall and nearly as wide These monsters did not have pictures of Mom and Dad inside them He and Jack had to pry up the corners and loosen the nails along the edges before they could get the crates open It took a surprising amount of effort to lever the tops off the crates Dale regretted not stopping at his house long enough to take off his uniform which was damp with sweat by the time he and Jack had pulled from their cocoons five heavy rectangular objects thickly swaddled in layers of tissue Many crates remained An hour later they carried the empty crates down to the basement and came back upstairs to have a beer Then they sliced open the layers of tissue exposing paintings and graphics in a variety of frames including a few that looked as if the artist had nailed them together himself out of barn siding Jacks pictures occupied a category Dale vaguely thought of as modern art He did not grasp what some of these things were supposed to be about although he actually liked almost all of them especially a couple of landscapes He knew that he had never heard of the artists but their names he thought would be recognized by the kind of people who lived in big cities and hung out in museums and galleries All this art  all of these images large and small now lined up on the kitchen floor  stunned him not altogether pleasantly He really had entered another world and he knew none of its landmarks Then he remembered that he and Jack Sawyer were going to hang these pictures on the walls of his parents old house Immediately unexpected warmth flooded into this notion and filled it to the brim Why shouldnt adjoining worlds mingle now and then And wasnt this other world Jacks All right he said I wish Henry that uncle I was telling you about Who lives right down the road I wish he could see this stuff Henry hed know how to appreciate it Why wont he be able to see them Ill invite him over Didnt I say Dale asked Henrys blind Paintings went up on the livingroom walls ascended the stairwell moved into the bedrooms Jack put up a couple of small pictures in the upstairs bathroom and the little half bath on the ground floor Dales arms began to ache from holding the frames while Jack marked the places where the nails would go in After the first three paintings he had removed his necktie and rolled up his sleeves and he could feel sweat trickling out of his hair and sliding down his face His unbuttoned collar had soaked through Jack Sawyer had worked as hard or harder than he but looked as if he had done nothing more strenuous than think about dinner Youre like an art collector huh Dale said Did it take a long time to get all these paintings I dont know enough to be a collector Jack said My father picked up most of this work back in the fifties and sixties My mother bought a few things too when she saw something that turned her on Like that little Fairfield Porter over there with the front porch and a lawn and the flowers The little Fairfield Porter which name Dale assumed to be that of its painter had appealed to him as soon as he and Jack had pulled it out of its crate You could hang a picture like that in your own living room You could almost step into a picture like that The funny thing was Dale thought if you hung it in your living room most of the people who came in would never really notice it at all Jack had said something about being glad to get the paintings out of storage So Dale said your mom and dad gave them to you I inherited them after my mothers death Jack said My father died when I was a kid Oh darn Im sorry Dale said snapped abruptly out of the world into which Mr Fairfield Porter had welcomed him Had to be tough on you losing your dad so young He thought Jack had given him the explanation for the aura of apartness and isolation that seemed always to envelop him A second before Jack could respond Dale told himself he was bullshitting He had no idea how someone wound up being like Jack Sawyer Yeah Jack said Fortunately my mother was even tougher Dale seized his opportunity with both hands What did your folks do Were you brought up in California Born and raised in Los Angeles Jack said My parents were in the entertainment industry but dont hold that against them They were great people Jack did not invite him to stay for supper  that was what stuck with Dale Over the hour and a half it took them to hang the rest of the pictures Jack Sawyer remained friendly and goodhumored but Dale who was not a cop for nothing sensed something evasive and adamant in his friends affability a door had opened a tiny crack then slammed shut The phrase great people had placed Jacks parents out of bounds When the two men broke for another beer Dale noticed a pair of bags from a Centralia grocery next to the microwave It was then nearly  at least two hours past French Countys suppertime Jack might reasonably have assumed that Dale had already eaten were his uniform not evidence to the contrary He tossed Jack a softball about the hardest case he had ever solved and sidled up to the counter The marbled red tips of two sirloin steaks protruded from the nearest bag His stomach emitted a reverberant clamor Jack ignored the thunder roll and said Thornberg Kinderling was right up there with anything I handled in LA I was really grateful for your help Dale got the picture Here was another locked door This one had declined to open by as much as a crack History was not spoken here the past had been nailed shut They finished their beers and installed the last of the pictures Over the next few hours they spoke of a hundred things but always within the boundaries Jack Sawyer had established Dale was sure that his question about Jacks parents had shortened the evening but why should that be true What was the guy hiding And from whom was he hiding it After their work was done Jack thanked him warmly and walked him outside to his car thereby cutting off any hope of a lastminute reprieve Case closed game over zip up your fly in the words of the immortal George Rathbun While they stood in the fragrant darkness beneath the millions of stars arrayed above them Jack sighed with pleasure and said I hope you know how grateful I am Honestly Im sorry I have to go back to LA Would you look at how beautiful this is Driving back to French Landing his the only headlights on the long stretch of Highway  Dale wondered if Jacks parents had been involved in some aspect of the entertainment business embarrassing to their adult son like pornography Maybe Dad directed skin flicks and Mom starred in them The people who made dirty movies probably raked in the dough especially if they kept it in the family Before his odometer ticked off another tenth of a mile the memory of the little Fairfield Porter turned Dales satisfaction to dust No woman who earned her keep having oncamera sex with strangers would spend actual money on a painting like that Let us enter Jack Sawyers kitchen The mornings Herald lies unfolded on the dining table a black frying pan recently sprayed with Pam heats atop the circle of blue flames from the gas stoves front lefthand burner A tall fit distractedlooking man wearing an old USC sweatshirt jeans and Italian loafers the color of molasses is swirling a whisk around the interior of a stainless steel bowl containing a large number of raw eggs Looking at him as he frowns at a vacant section of air well above the shiny bowl we observe that the beautiful twelveyearold boy last seen in a fourthfloor room of a deserted New Hampshire hotel has aged into a man whose good looks contribute only the smallest portion to what makes him interesting For that Jack Sawyer is interesting declares itself instantly Even when troubled to distraction by some private concern some enigma we might as well say in the face of that contemplative frown Jack Sawyer cannot help but radiate a persuasive authority Just by looking at him you know that he is one of those persons to whom others turn when they feel stumped threatened or thwarted by circumstance Intelligence resolve and dependability have shaped the cast of his features so deeply that their attractiveness is irrelevant to their meaning This man never pauses to admire himself in mirrors  vanity plays no part in his character It makes perfect sense that he should have been a rising star in the Los Angeles Police Department that his file bulged with commendations and that he had been selected for several FBIsponsored programs and training courses designed to aid the progress of rising stars A number of Jacks colleagues and superiors had privately concluded that he would become the police commissioner of a city like San Diego or Seattle around the time he turned forty and ten to fifteen years later if all went well step up to San Francisco or New York More strikingly Jacks age seems no more relevant than his attractiveness he has the air of having passed through lifetimes before this one of having gone places and seen things beyond the scope of most other people No wonder Dale Gilbertson admires him no wonder Dale yearns for Jacks assistance In his place we would want it too but our luck would be no better than his This man has retired he is out of the game sorry damn shame and all that but a mans gotta whisk eggs when hes gotta have omelettes as John Wayne said to Dean Martin in Rio Bravo And as my momma told me Jack says out loud to himself she said Sonny boy said she when the Duke spoke up everdangbody lissened up lessen he was agrindin one of his numerous political axes yes she did them were her same exack words just as she said em to me A half second later he adds On that fine morning in Beverly Hills and finally takes in what he is doing What we have here is a spectacularly lonely man Loneliness has been Jack Sawyers familiar for so long that he takes it for granted but what you cant fix eventually turns into wallpaper all right Plenty of things such as cerebral palsy and Lou Gehrigs disease to name but two are worse than loneliness Loneliness is just part of the program thats all Even Dale noticed this aspect of his friends character and despite his many virtues our chief of police cannot be described as a particularly pyschological human being Jack glances at the clock above the stove and sees he has another fortyfive minutes before he must drive to French Landing and pick up Henry Leyden at the end of his shift Thats good he has plenty of time hes keeping it together the subtext to which is Everything is all right and nothings wrong with me thank you very much When Jack woke up this morning a small voice in his head announced I am a coppiceman Like hell I am he thought and told the voice to leave him alone The little voice could go to hell He had given up on the coppiceman business he had walked away from the homicide trade       the lights of a carousel reflected on the bald head of a black man lying dead on the Santa Monica Pier    No Dont go there Just    just dont thats all Jack should not have been in Santa Monica anyhow Santa Monica had its own coppicemen As far as he knew they were a swell bunch of guys though perhaps not quite up to the standard set by that ace boy whizbang and youngestever lieutenant of LAPDs Homicide Division himself The only reason the ace boy and whizbang had been on their turf in the first place was that he had just broken up with this extremely nice or at least moderately nice resident of Malibu Ms Brooke Greer a screenwriter greatly esteemed within her genre the action adventureCromantic comedy also a person of remarkable wit insight and bodily charm and as he sped homeward down the handsome stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway below the Malibu Canyon exit he yielded to an uncharacteristically edgy spell of gloom A few seconds after swinging up the California Incline into Santa Monica he saw the bright ring of the Ferris wheel revolving above the strings of lights and the lively crowd on the pier A tawdry enchantment or an enchanted tawdriness spoke to him from the heart of this scene On a whim Jack parked his car and walked down to the array of brilliant lights glowing in the darkness The last time he had visited the Santa Monica Pier he had been an excited sixyearold boy pulling on Lily Cavanaugh Sawyers hand like a dog straining at a leash What happened was accidental It was too meaningless to be called coincidence Coincidence brings together two previously unrelated elements of a larger story Here nothing connected and there was no larger story He came to the piers gaudy entrance and noticed that after all the Ferris wheel was not revolving A circle of stationary lights hung over empty gondolas For a moment the giant machine looked like an alien invader cleverly disguised and biding its time until it could do the maximum amount of damage Jack could almost hear it purring to itself Right he thought an evil Ferris wheel  get a grip Youre shaken up more than you want to admit Then he looked back down at the scene before him and finally took in that his fantasy of the pier had hidden a reallife evil rendered far too familiar by his profession He had stumbled onto the initial stages of a homicide investigation Some of the brilliant lights he had seen flashed not from the Ferris wheel but from the tops of Santa Monica patrol cars Out on the pier four uniforms were discouraging a crowd of civilians from breaching the circle of crimescene tape around a brightly illuminated carousel Jack told himself to leave it alone He had no role here Besides that the carousel aroused some smoky indistinct feeling an entire set of unwelcome feelings in him The carousel was creepier than the stalled Ferris wheel Carousels had always spooked him hadnt they Painted midget horses frozen into place with their teeth bared and steel poles rammed through their guts  sadistic kitsch Walk away Jack told himself Your girlfriend dumped you and youre in a rotten mood And as for carousels    The abrupt descent of a mental lead curtain ended the debate about carousels Feeling as though pushed from within Jack stepped onto the pier and began moving through the crowd He was half conscious of taking the most unprofessional action of his career When he had pushed his way to the front of the crowd he ducked under the tape and flashed his badge at a babyfaced cop who tried to order him back Somewhere nearby a guitarist began playing a blues melody Jack could almost identify the title swam to the surface of his mind then dove out of sight The infant cop gave him a puzzled look and walked away to consult one of the detectives standing over a long shape Jack did not quite feel like looking at just then The music annoyed him It annoyed him a lot In fact it bugged the hell out of him His irritation was out of proportion to its cause but what kind of idiot thought homicides needed a sound track A painted horse reared frozen in the garish light Jacks stomach tightened and deep in his chest something fierce and insistent something at all costs not to be named flexed itself and threw out its arms Or extended its wings The terrible something wished to break free and make itself known Briefly Jack feared he would have to throw up The passing of this sensation bought him a moment of uncomfortable clarity Voluntarily idly he had walked into craziness and now he was crazy You could put it no other way Marching toward him with an expression nicely combining disbelief and fury was a detective named Angelo Leone before his expedient transfer to Santa Monica a colleague of Jacks distinguished by his gross appetites his capacity for violence and corruption his contempt for all civilians regardless of color race creed or social status and to be fair his fearlessness and utter loyalty to all police officers who went with the program and did the same things he did which meant anything they could get away with Angelo Leones disdain for Jack Sawyer who had not gone with the program had equaled his resentment at the younger mans success In a few seconds this brutal caveman would be in his face Instead of trying to figure out how to explain himself to the caveman he was obsessing about carousels and guitars attending to the details of going crazy He had no way of explaining himself Explanation was impossible The internal necessity that had pushed him into this position hummed on but Jack could hardly speak to Angelo Leone of internal necessities Nor could he offer a rational explanation to his captain if Leone filed a complaint Well you see it was like someone else was pulling my strings like another person was doing the driving    The first words out of Angelo Leones fleshy mouth rescued him from disaster  Dont tell me youre here for a reason you ambitious little prick A piratical career like Leones inevitably exposed the pirate to the danger of an official investigation A strategic sidestep to a neighboring force offered little protection from the covert archaeological digs police officials mounted into records and reputations when the press gave them no other choice Every decade or two dogooders whistleblowers whiners snitches pissedoff civilians and cops too stupid to accept the timehonored program got together rammed a cherry bomb up the presss collective anus and set off an orgy of bloodletting Leones essential guiltinspired paranoia had instantly suggested to him that LA Homicides ace boy might be gilding his rsum As Jack had known it would his claim of having been pulled toward the scene like a fire horse to a fire magnified Leones suspicions  Okay you happened to walk into my investigation Fine Now listen to me If I happen to hear your name in some connection I dont like anytime during the next six months make that ever youll be pissing through a tube for the rest of your life Now get the fuck out of here and let me do my job  Im gone Angelo Leones partner started to come forward across the gleaming pier Leone grimaced and waved him back Without intending to do so without thinking about it Jack let his eyes drift past the detective and down to the corpse in front of the carousel Far more powerfully than it had the first time the ferocious creature at the center of his chest flexed itself unfurled and extended its wings its arms its talons whatever they were and by means of a tremendous upward surge attempted to rip free of its moorings The wings the arms the talons crushed Jacks lungs Hideous claws splayed through his stomach There is one act a homicide detective especially a homicide lieutenant must never commit and it is this confronted with a dead body he must not puke Jack struggled to remain on the respectable side of the Forbidden Bile seared the back of his throat and he closed his eyes A constellation of glowing dots wavered across his eyelids The creature molten and foul battered against its restraints Lights reflected on the scalp of a bald black man lying dead beside a carousel    Not you No not you Knock all you like but you cant come in The wings arms talons retracted the creature dwindled to a dozing speck Having succeeded in avoiding the Forbidden Act Jack found himself capable of opening his eyes He had no idea how much time had passed Angelo Leones corrugated forehead murky eyes and carnivorous mouth heaved into view and from a distance of six inches occupied all the available space  What are we doing here Reviewing our situation  I wish that idiot would put his guitar back in its case And that was one of the oddest turns of the evening  Guitar I dont hear no guitar Neither Jack realized did he Wouldnt any rational person attempt to put such an episode out of mind To throw this garbage overboard You couldnt do anything with it you couldnt use it so why hold on to it The incident on the pier meant nothing It connected to nothing beyond itself and it led to nothing It was literally inconsequential for it had had no consequences After his lover had sandbagged him Jack had lost his bearings suffered a momentary aberration and trespassed upon another jurisdictions crime scene It was no more than an embarrassing mistake Fiftysix days and eleven hours later the ace boy slipped into his captains office laid down his shield and his gun and announced much to the captains astonishment his immediate retirement Knowing nothing of the confrontation with Detective Leone on the Santa Monica Pier the captain did not inquire as to the possible influence upon his lieutenants decision of a stalled carousel and a dead black man if he had Jack would have told him he was being ridiculous Dont go there he advises himself and does an excellent job of not going there He receives a few involuntary flashes no more strobelit snapshots of a wooden ponys rearing head of Angelo Leones distempered mug also of one other thing the object occupying the dead center of the scene in every sense that which above all must not be witnessed    the instant these imagistic lightning bolts appear he sends them away It feels like a magical performance He is doing magic good magic He knows perfectly well that these feats of image banishment represent a form of selfprotection and if the motives behind his need for this protective magic remain unclear the need is motive enough When you gotta have an omelette you gotta whisk eggs to quote that unimpeachable authority Duke Wayne Jack Sawyer has more on his mind than the irrelevancies suggested by a dream voices having uttered the word policeman in baby talk These matters too he wishes he could send away by the execution of a magic trick but the wretched matters refuse banishment they zoom about him like a tribe of wasps All in all he is not doing so well our Jack He is marking time and staring at the eggs which no longer look quite right though he could not say why The eggs resist interpretation The eggs are the least of it In the periphery of his vision the banner across the front page of the La Riviere Herald seems to rise off the sheet of newsprint and float toward him FISHERMAN STILL AT LARGE IN Nope thats enough he turns away with the terrible knowledge of having brought on this Fisherman business by himself How about IN STATEN ISLAND or IN BROOKLYN where the real Albert Fish a tormented piece of work if there ever was one found two of his victims This stuff is making him sick Two dead kids the Freneau girl missing and probably dead body parts eaten a lunatic who plagiarized from Albert Fish Dale insisted on assaulting him with information The details enter his system like a contaminant The more he learns  and for a man who truly wished to be out of the loop Jack has learned an amazing amount  the more the poisons swim through his bloodstream distorting his perceptions He had come to Norway Valley in flight from a world that had abruptly turned unreliable and rubbery as if liquefying under thermal pressure During his last month in Los Angeles the thermal pressure had become intolerable Grotesque possibilities leered from darkened windows and the gaps between buildings threatening to take form On days off the sensation of dishwater greasing his lungs made him gasp for breath and fight against nausea so he worked without stopping in the process solving more cases than ever before His diagnosis was that the work was getting to him but we can hardly blame the captain for his astonishment at the ace boys resignation He had escaped to this obscure pocket of the countryside this shelter this haven at the edge of a yellow meadow removed from the world of threat and madness removed by nearly twenty miles from French Landing removed a good distance even from Norway Valley Road However the layers of removal had failed to do their job What he was trying to escape riots around him again here in his redoubt If he let himself succumb to selfcentered fantasy he would have to conclude that what he had fled had spent the last three years sniffing his trail and had finally succeeded in tracking him down In California the rigors of his task had overwhelmed him now the disorders of western Wisconsin must be kept at arms length Sometimes late at night he awakens to the echo of the little poisoned voice wailing No more coppiceman I wont too close too close What was too close Jack Sawyer refuses to consider the echo proves that he must avoid any further contamination Bad news for Dale he knows and he regrets both his inability to join the investigation and to explain his refusal to his friend Dales ass is on the line no two ways about it He is a good chief of police more than good enough for French Landing but he misjudged the politics and let the staties set him up With every appearance of respect for local authority state detectives Brown and Black had bowed low stepped aside and permitted Dale Gilbertson who thought they were doing him a favor to slip a noose around his neck Too bad but Dale has just figured out that he is standing on a trapdoor with a black bag over his face If the Fisherman murders one more kid Well Jack Sawyer sends his most profound regrets He cant perform a miracle right now sorry Jack has more pressing matters on his mind Red feathers for example Small ones Little red feathers are much on Jacks mind and have been despite his efforts to magic them away since a month before the murders started One morning as he emerged from his bedroom and began to go down to fix breakfast a single red feather a plume smaller than a babys finger seemed to float out of the slanted ceiling at the top of the stairs In its wake two or three others came drifting toward him An oval section of plaster two inches across seemed to blink and open like an eye and the eye released a tight fat column of feathers that zoomed out of the ceiling as if propelled through a straw A feather explosion a feather hurricane battered his chest his raised arms his head But this    This never happened Something else happened and it took him a minute or two to figure it out A wayward brain neuron misfired A mental receptor lapped up the wrong chemical or lapped up too much of the right chemical The switches that nightly triggered the image conduits responded to a false signal and produced a waking dream The waking dream resembled an hallucination but hallucinations were experienced by wetbrain alcoholics drug takers and crazy people specifically paranoid schizophrenics with whom Jack had dealt on many an occasion during his life as a coppiceman Jack fit into none of those categories including the last He knew he was not a paranoid schizophrenic or any other variety of madman If you thought Jack Sawyer was crazy you were He has complete at least  percent complete faith in his sanity Since he is not delusional the feathers must have flown toward him in a waking dream The only other explanation involves reality and the feathers had no connection to reality What kind of world would this be if such things could happen to us Abruptly George Rathbun bellows It pains me to say this truly it does for I love our dear old Brew Crew you know I do but there come times when love must grit its teeth and face a painful reality  for example take the sorrowful state of our pitching staff Bud Selig oh BUUD this is Houston calling Could you Please return to earth immediately A blind man could throw more strikes than that aggregation of WIMPS LOSERS AND AIRHEADS Good old Henry Henry has George Rathbun down so perfectly you can see the sweat stains under his armpits But the best of Henrys inventions  in Jacks opinion  has to be that embodiment of hipster cool the laidback authoritative Henry Shake the Sheik the Shake the Shook of Araby who can if in the mood tell you the color of the socks worn by Lester Young on the day he recorded Shoe Shine Boy and Lady Be Good and describe the interiors of two dozen famous but mostly longdeparted jazz clubs    and before we get into the very cool very beautiful very simptico music whispered one Sunday at the Village Vanguard by the Bill Evans Trio we might pay our respects to the third inner eye Let us honor the inner eye the eye of imagination It is late on a hot July afternoon in Greenwich Village New York City On sundazzled Seventh Avenue South we stroll into the shade of the Vanguards marquee open a white door and proceed down a long narrow flight of stairs to a roomy underground cave The musicians climb onto the stand Bill Evans slides onto the piano bench and nods at the audience Scott LaFaro hugs his bass Paul Motian picks up his brushes Evans lowers his head way way down and drops his hands on the keyboard For those of us who are privileged to be there nothing will ever be the same again My Foolish Heart by the Bill Evans Trio live at the Village Vanguard the twentyfifth of June  I am your host Henry Shake  the Sheik the Shake the Shook of Araby Smiling Jack pours the beaten eggs into the frying pan twice swirls them with a fork and marginally reduces the gas flame It occurs to him that he has neglected to make coffee Nuts to coffee Coffee is the last thing he needs he can drink orange juice A glance at the toaster suggests that he has also neglected to prepare the mornings toast Does he require toast is toast essential Consider the butter consider slabs of cholesterol waiting to corrupt his arteries The omelette is risky enough in fact he has the feeling he cracked way too many eggs Now Jack cannot remember why he wanted to make an omelette in the first place He rarely eats omelettes In fact he tends to buy eggs out of a sense of duty aroused by the two rows of eggsized depressions near the top of his refrigerator door If people were not supposed to buy eggs why would refrigerators come with egg holders He nudges a spatula under the edges of the hardening but still runny eggs tilts the pan to slide them around scrapes in the mushrooms and scallions and folds the result in half All right Okay Looks good A luxurious forty minutes of freedom stretches out before him In spite of everything he seems to be functioning pretty well Control is not an issue here Unfolded on the kitchen table the La Riviere Herald catches Jacks eye He has forgotten about the newspaper The newspaper has not forgotten him however and demands its proper share of attention FISHERMAN STILL AT LARGE IN and so on ARCTIC CIRCLE would be nice but no he moves nearer to the table and sees that the Fisherman remains a stubbornly local problem From beneath the headline Wendell Greens name leaps up and lodges in his eye like a pebble Wendell Green is an allaround comprehensive pest an ongoing irritant After reading the first two paragraphs of Greens article Jack groans and clamps a hand over his eyes Im a blind man make me an umpire Wendell Green has the confidence of a smalltown athletic hero who never left home Tall expansive with a crinkly mat of redblond hair and a senatorial waistline Green swaggers through the bars the courthouses the public arenas of La Riviere and its surrounding communities distributing wisedup charm Wendell Green is a reporter who knows how to act like one an oldfashioned print journalist the Heralds great ornament At their first encounter the great ornament struck Jack as a thirdrate phony and he has seen no reason to change his mind since then He distrusts Wendell Green In Jacks opinion the reporters gregarious facade conceals a limitless capacity for treachery Green is a blowhard posturing in front of a mirror but a canny blowhard and such creatures will do anything to gain their own ends After Thornberg Kinderlings arrest Green requested an interview Jack turned him down as he declined the three invitations that followed his removal to Norway Valley Road His refusals had not deterred the reporter from staging occasional accidental meetings The day after the discovery of Amy St Pierres body Jack emerged from a Chase Street dry cleaners shop with a box of freshly laundered shirts under his arm began walking toward his car and felt a hand close on his elbow He looked back and beheld contorted into a leer of spurious delight the florid public mask of Wendell Green  Hey hey Holly   A badboy smirk I mean Lieutenant Sawyer Hey Im glad I ran into you This is where you have your shirts done They do a good job  If you leave out the part about the buttons  Good one Youre a funny guy Lieutenant Let me give you a tip Reliable on Third Street in La Riviere They live up to their name No smashee no breakee Want your shirts done right go to a Chink every time Sam Lee try him out Lieutenant  Im not a lieutenant anymore Wendell Call me Jack or Mr Sawyer Call me Hollywood I dont care And now  He walked toward his car and Wendell Green walked beside him  Any chance of a few words Lieutenant Sorry Jack Chief Gilbertson is a close friend of yours I know and this tragic case little girl apparently mutilated terrible things can you can offer us your expertise step in give us the benefit of your thoughts  You want to know my thoughts  Anything you can tell me buddy Pure irresponsible malice inspired Jack to extend an arm over Greens shoulders and say  Wendell old buddy check out a guy named Albert Fish It was back in the twenties  Fisch  Fish From an oldline WASP New York family An amazing case Look it up Until that moment Jack had been barely conscious of remembering the outrages committed by the bizarre Mr Albert Fish Butchers more uptodate  Ted Bundy John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer  had eclipsed Albert Fish not to mention exotics like Edmund Emil Kemper III who after committing eight murders decapitated his mother propped her head on his mantel and used it as a dartboard By way of explanation Edmund III said This seemed appropriate Yet the name of Albert Fish an obscure back number had surfaced in Jacks mind and into Wendell Greens ready ear he had uttered it What had gotten into him Well that was the question wasnt it Whoops the omelette Jack grabs a plate from a cabinet silverware from a drawer jumps to the stove turns off the burner and slides the mess in the pan onto his plate He sits down and opens the Herald to page  where he reads about Milly Kubys nearly winning third place at the big statewide spelling bee but for the substitution of an i for an a in opopanax the kind of thing that is supposed to be in a local paper How can you expect a kid to spell opopanax correctly anyhow Jack takes two or three bites of his omelette before the peculiar taste in his mouth distracts him from the monstrous unfairness done to Milly Kuby The funny taste is like halfburned garbage He spits the food out of his mouth and sees a wad of gray mush and raw halfchewed vegetables The uneaten part of his breakfast does not look any more appetizing He did not cook this omelette he ruined it He drops his head and groans A shudder like a loose electrical wire travels here and there through his body throwing off sparks that singe his throat his lungs his suddenly palpitating organs Opopanax he thinks Im falling apart Right here and now Forget I said that The savage opopanax has gripped me in its claws shaken me with the fearful opopanax of its opopanax arms and intends to throw me into the turbulent Opopanax River where I shall meet my opopanax What is happening to me he says aloud The shrill sound of his voice scares him Opopanax tears sting his opopanax eyes and he gets groaning up off his opopanax dumps the swill into the garbage disposal rinses the plate and decides that it is damn well time to start making sense around here Opopanax me no opopanaxes Everybody makes mistakes Jack examines the door of the refrigerator trying to remember if he still has an egg or two in there Sure he does a whole bunch of eggs about nine or ten had nearly filled the entire row of eggshaped depressions at the top of the door He could not have squandered all of them he wasnt that out of it Jacks closes his fingers around the edge of the refrigerator door Entirely unbidden the vision of lights reflected on a black mans bald head Not you The person being addressed is not present the person being addressed is scarcely a person at all No no not you The door swings open under the pressure of his fingers the refrigerator light illuminates the laden shelves Jack Sawyer regards the egg holders They appear to be empty A closer look reveals nested within the rounded depression at the end of the first row the presence of a small eggshaped object colored a pale and delicate shade of blue a nostalgic tender blue quite possibly the halfremembered blue of a summer sky observed in early afternoon by a small boy lying faceup on the quarter acre of grass located behind a nice residential property on Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills California Whoever owns this residential property boy you can put your money on one thing theyre in the entertainment business Jack knows the name of this precise shade of blue due to an extended consideration of color samples undertaken in the company of Claire Evinrude MD an oncologist of lovely and brisk dispatch during the period when they were planning to repaint their thenshared bungalow in the Hollywood Hills Claire Dr Evinrude had marked this color for the master bedroom he recently returned from a bigdeal absurdly selective VICAP course of instruction at Quantico Virginia and newly promoted to the rank of lieutenant had dismissed it as um well maybe a little cold Jack have you ever seen an actual robins egg Dr Evinrude inquired Do you have any idea how beautiful they are Dr Evinrudes gray eyes enlarged as she grasped her mental scalpel Jack inserts two fingers into the egg receptacle and lifts from it the small eggshaped object the color of a robins egg What do you know this is a robins egg An actual in the words of Dr Claire Evinrude robins egg hatched from the body of a robin sometimes called a robin redbreast He deposits the egg in the palm of his left hand There it sits this pale blue oblate the size of a pecan The capacity for thought seems to have left him What the hell did he do buy a robins egg Sorry no this relationship isnt working the opopanax is out of whack Roys Store doesnt sell robins eggs Im gone Slowly stiffly awkward as a zombie Jack progresses across the kitchen floor and reaches the sink He extends his left hand over the maw at the sinks center and releases the robins egg Down into the garbage disposal it drops irretrievably His right hand switches the machine into action with the usual noisy results Growl grind snarl a monster is enjoying a nice little snack Grrr The live electrical wire shudders within him shedding sparks as it twitches but he has become zombiefied and barely registers the internal shocks All in all taking everything into consideration what Jack Sawyer feels most like doing at this moment    When the red red    For some reason he has not called his mother in a long long while He cannot think why he has not and it is about time he did Robin me no red robins The voice of Lily Cavanaugh Sawyer the Queen of the Bs once his only companion in a raptureflooded transcendent rigorously forgotten New Hampshire hotel room is precisely the voice Jack needs to hear right about now Lily Cavanaugh is the one person in the world to whom he can spill the ridiculous mess in which he finds himself Despite the dim unwelcome awareness of trespassing beyond the borders of strict rationality and therefore bringing further into question his own uncertain sanity he moves down the kitchen counter picks up his cell phone and punches in the number of the nice residential property on Roxbury Drive Beverly Hills California The telephone in his old house rings five times six times seven A man picks up and in an angry slightly drunken sleepdistorted voice says Kimberley    whatever the hell this is about    for your sake    I hope its really really important Jack hits END and snaps his phone shut Oh God oh hell oh damn It is just past five AM in Beverly Hills or Westwood or Hancock Park or wherever that number now reaches He forgot his mother was dead Oh hell oh damn oh God can you beat that Jacks grief which has been sharpening itself underground once again rises up to stab him as if for the first time bang deadcenter in the heart At the same time the idea that even for a second he could have forgotten that his mother was dead strikes him God knows why as hugely and irresistibly funny How ridiculous can you get The goofy stick has whapped him on the back of the head and without knowing if he is going to burst into sobs or shouts of laughter Jack experiences a brief wave of dizziness and leans heavily against the kitchen counter Jiveass turkey he remembers his mother saying Lily had been describing her late husbands recently deceased partner in the days after her suspicious accountants discovered that the partner Morgan Sloat had been diverting into his own pockets threefourths of the income from Sawyer  Sloats astonishingly vast real estate holdings Every year since Phil Sawyers death in a socalled hunting accident Sloat had stolen millions of dollars many millions from his late partners family Lily diverted the flow back into the proper channels and sold half the company to its new partners in the process guaranteeing her son a tremendous financial bonanza not to mention the annual bonanza that produces the interest Jacks private foundation funnels off to noble causes Lily had called Sloat things far more colorful than jiveass turkey but that is the term her voice utters in his inner ear Way back in May Jack tells himself he probably came across that robins egg on an absentminded stroll through the meadow and put it in the refrigerator for safekeeping To keep it safe Because after all it was of a delicate shade of blue a beautiful blue to quote Dr Evinrude So long had he kept it safe that hed forgotten all about it Which he gratefully recognizes is why the waking dream presented him with an explosion of red feathers Everything happens for a reason concealed though the reason may be loosen up and relax long enough to stop being a jiveass turkey and the reason might come out of hiding Jack bends over the sink and for the sake of refreshment internal and external immerses his face in a double handful of cold water For the moment the cleansing shock washes away the ruined breakfast the ridiculous telephone call and the corrosive image flashes It is time to strap on his skates and get going In twentyfive minutes Jack Sawyers best friend and only confidant will with his customary aura of rotary perception emerge through the front door of KDCUAMs cinderblock building and applying his golden lighters flame to the tip of a cigarette glide down the walkway to Peninsula Drive Should rotary perception inform him that Jack Sawyers pickup awaits Henry Leyden will unerringly locate the handle and climb in This exhibition of blindman cool is too dazzling to miss And miss it he does not for in spite of the mornings difficulties which from the balanced mature perspective granted by his journey through the lovely countryside eventually seem trivial Jacks pickup pulls in front of the Peninsula Drive end of KDCUAMs walkway at  a good five minutes before his friend is to stroll out into the sunlight Henry will be good for him just the sight of Henry will be like a dose of soul tonic Surely Jack cannot be the first man or woman in the history of the world who momentarily lost his or her grip under stress and kind of halfway forgot that his or her mother had shuffled off the old mortal coil and departed for a higher sphere Stressedout mortals turned naturally to their mothers for comfort and reassurance The impulse is coded into our DNA When he hears the story Henry will chuckle and advise him to tighten his wig On second thought why cloud Henrys sky with a story so absurd The same applies to the robins egg especially since Jack has not spoken to Henry about his waking dream of a feather eruption and he does not feel like getting involved in a lot of pointless backtracking Live in the present let the past stretch out in its grave keep your chin high and walk around the mud puddles Dont look to your friends for therapy He switches on the radio and hits the button for KWLAFM the UWCLa Riviere station home to both the Wisconsin Rat and Henry the Sheik the Shake the Shook What pours glittering from the cabs hidden speakers raises the hairs on his arms Glenn Gould inner eye luminously open blazing through something by Bach he could not say exactly what But Glenn Gould but Bach for sure One of the Partitas maybe A CD jewel box in one hand Henry Leyden strolls through the humble doorway at the side of the station enters the sunlight and without hesitation begins to glide down the flagged walkway the rubber soles of his Hersheybrown suede loafers striking the center of each successive flagstone Henry    Henry is a vision Today Jack observes Henry comes attired in one of his Malaysian teak forest owner ensembles a handsome collarless shirt shimmering braces and an heirloom straw fedora creased to a faretheewell Had Jack not been so welcomed into Henrys life he would not have known that his friends capacity for flawless wardrobe assemblage depended upon the profound organization of his enormous walkin closet long ago established by Rhoda Gilbertson Leyden Henrys deceased wife Rhoda had arranged every article of her husbands clothing by season style and color Item by item Henry memorized the entire system Although blind since birth therefore incapable of distinguishing between matching and mismatching shades Henry never errs Henry extracts from his shirt pocket a gold lighter and a yellow pack of American Spirits fires up exhales a radiant cloud brightened by sunlight to the color of milk and continues his unwavering progress down the flagstones The pink backslanting capitals of TROY LUVS MARYANN YES sprayed across the sign on the bare lawn suggest that  Troy spends a lot of time listening to KDCUAM and  Maryann loves him back Good for Troy good for Maryann Jack applauds loves announcement even in pink spray paint and wishes the lovers happiness and good fortune It occurs to him that if at this present stage of his existence he could be said to love anyone that person would have to be Henry Leyden Not in the sense that Troy luvs Maryann or vice versa but he luvs him all the same a matter that has never been as clear as it is this moment Henry traverses the last of the flagstones and approaches the curb A single stride brings him to the door of the pickup his hand closes on the recessed metal bar he opens the door steps up and slides in His head tilts cocking his right ear to the music The dark lenses of his aviator glasses shine How can you do that Jack asked This time the music helped but you dont need music I can do that because I am totally totally bitchrod Henry says I learned that lovely word from our pothead intern Morris Rosen who kindly applied it to me Morris thinks I am God but he must have something on the ball because he figured out that George Rathbun and the Wisconsin Rat are one and the same I hope the kid keeps his mouth shut I do too Jack says but Im not going to let you change the subject How can you always open the door right away How do you find the handle without groping for it Henry sighs The handle tells me where it is Obviously All I have to do is listen to it The door handle makes a sound Not like your hightech radio and The Goldberg Variations no More like a vibration The sound of a sound The sound inside a sound Isnt Daniel Barenboim a great piano player Man listen to that  every note a different coloration Makes you want to kiss the lid of his Steinway baby Imagine the muscles in his hands Thats Barenboim Well who else could it be Slowly Henry turns his head to Jack An irritating smile raises the corners of his mouth Ah I see yes Knowing you as I do you poor schmuck I see you imagined you were listening to Glenn Gould I did not Jack says Please Maybe for a minute I wondered if it was Gould but   Dont dont dont Dont even try Your voice gives you away Theres a little whiny topspin on every word its so pathetic Are we going to drive back to Norway Valley or would you like to sit here and keep lying to me I want to tell you something on the way home He holds up the CD Lets put you out of your misery The pothead gave this to me  Dirtysperm doing an old Supremes ditty Me I loathe that sort of thing but it might be perfect for the Wisconsin Rat Cue up track seven The pianist no longer sounds anything like Glenn Gould and the music seems to have slowed to half its former velocity Jack puts himself out of his misery and inserts the CD into the opening beneath the radio He pushes a button then another At an insanely fast tempo the screeches of madmen subjected to unspeakable tortures come blasting out of the speakers Jack rocks backward into the seat jolted My God Henry he says and reaches for the volume control Dont dare touch that dial Henry says If this crap doesnt make your ears bleed it isnt doing its job Ears Jack knows is jazzspeak for the capacity to hear what is going on in music as it unfurls across the air A musician with good ears soon memorizes the songs and arrangements he is asked to play picks up or already knows the harmonic movement underlying the theme and follows the transformations and substitutions to that pattern introduced by his fellow musicians Whether or not he can accurately read notes written on a staff a musician with great ears learns melodies and arrangements the first time he hears them grasps harmonic intricacies through flawless intuition and immediately identifies the notes and key signatures registered by taxi horns elevator bells and mewing cats Such people inhabit a world defined by the particularities of individual sounds and Henry Leyden is one of them As far as Jack is concerned Henrys ears are Olympian in a class by themselves It was Henrys ears that gave him access to Jacks great secret the role his mother Lily Cavanaugh Sawyer Lily Cavanaugh had occupied in life and he is the only person ever to discover it Shortly after Dale introduced them Jack and Henry Leyden entered into an easy companionable friendship surprising to both Each the answer to the others loneliness they spent two or three nights of every week having dinner together listening to music and talking about whatever came into their wellstocked minds Either Jack drove down the road to Henrys eccentric house or he picked Henry up and drove him back to his place After something like six or seven months Jack wondered if his friend might enjoy spending an hour or so listening to him read aloud from books agreed upon by both parties Henry replied Iveydivey my man what a beautiful idea How about starting with some whackedout crime novels They began with Chester Himes and Charles Willeford changed gear with a batch of contemporary novels floated through S J Perelman and James Thurber and ventured emboldened into fictional mansions erected by Ford Madox Ford and Vladimir Nabokov Marcel Proust lies somewhere ahead they understand but Proust can wait at present they are to embark upon Bleak House One night after Jack had finished the evenings installment of Fords The Good Soldier Henry cleared his throat and said Dale said you told him your parents were in the entertainment industry In show business  Thats right  I dont want to pry but would you mind if I asked you some questions If you feel like answering just say yes or no Already alarmed Jack said Whats this about Henry  I want to see if Im right about something  Okay Ask  Thank you Were your parents in different aspects of the industry  Um  Was one of them in the business end of things and the other a performer  Um  Was your mother an actress  Uhhuh  A famous actress in a way She never really got the respect she deserved but she made a ton of movies all through the fifties and into the midsixties and at the end of her career she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress  Henry Jack said Where did you   Clam up I intend to relish this moment Your mother was Lily Cavanaugh Thats wonderful Lily Cavanaugh was always so much more talented than most people gave her credit for Every time out she brought those roles she played those girls those tough little waitresses and dames with guns in their handbags up to a new level Beautiful smart gutsy no pretensions just lock in and inhabit the part She was about a hundred times better than anyone else around her  Henry     Some of those movies had nice sound tracks too Lost Summer Johnny Mandel Out of sight  Henry how did   You told me how else could I know These little things your voice does thats how You slide over the tops of your rs and you hit the rest of your consonants in a kind of cadence and that cadence runs through your sentences  A cadence  Bet your ass junior An underlying rhythm like your own personal drummer All through The Good Soldier I kept trying to remember where Id heard it before Faded in faded back out A couple of days ago I nailed it Lily Cavanaugh You cant me blame for wanting to see if I was right can you  Blame you Jack said Im too stunned to blame anybody but give me a couple of minutes  Your secrets safe When people see you you dont want their first thought to be Hey theres Lily Cavanaughs son Makes sense to me Henry Leyden has great ears all right As the pickup rolls through French Landing the din filling the cab makes conversation impossible Dirtysperm is burning a hole through the marzipan center of Where Did Our Love Go and in the process committing hideous atrocities upon those cute little Supremes Henry who claims to loathe this kind of thing slouches in his seat knees up on the dash hands steepled below his chin grinning with pleasure The shops on Chase Street have opened for business and half a dozen cars jut at an angle from parking spaces Four boys astride bicycles swerve off the sidewalk before Schmitts Allsorts and into the road twenty feet in front of the moving pickup Jack hits his brakes the boys come to an abrupt halt and line up side by side waiting for him to pass Jack trolls forward Henry straightens up checks his mysterious sensors and drops back into position All is well with Henry The boys however do not know what to make of the uproar growing ever louder as the pickup approaches They stare at Jacks windshield in bafflement tinged with distaste the way their greatgrandfathers once stared at the Siamese twins and the Alligator Man in the freak show at the back of the fairground Everybody knows that the drivers of pickup trucks listen to only two kinds of music heavy metal or country so whats with this creep As Jack drives past the boys the first a scowling heavyweight with the inflamed face of a schoolyard bully displays an upraised second finger The next two continue the imitations of their greatgrandfathers having a hot night out in  and gape idiotically mouths slack and open The fourth boy whose dark blond hair beneath a Brewers cap bright eyes and general air of innocence make him the nicestlooking of the group gazes directly into Jacks face and gives him a sweet tentative smile This is Tyler Marshall out for a spin  though he is completely unaware of it  into nomansland The boys glide into the background and Jack glances into the mirror to see them pedaling furiously up the street Sluggo in front the smallest most appealing one in the rear already falling behind A sidewalk panel of experts has reported in on the Dirtysperm Jack says Four kids on bikes Since he can scarcely make out his words he does not think Henry will be able to hear them at all Henry it seems has heard him perfectly and he responds with a question that disappears into the uproar Having a reasonably good idea of what it must have been Jack answers it anyhow One firm negative two undecideds tending toward negative and one cautious positive Henry nods Violent marzipandestruction crashes and thuds to a conclusion on Eleventh Street As if a haze has blown from the cab as if the windshield has been freshly washed the air seems clearer the colors more vibrant Interesting Henry says He reaches unerringly for the EJECT button extracts the disc from the holder and slips it into its case That was very revealing dont you think Raw selfcentered hatred should never be dismissed automatically Morris Rosen was right Its perfect for the Wisconsin Rat Hey I think they could be bigger than Glenn Miller That reminds me Henry says Youll never guess what Im doing later I have a gig Chipper Maxton actually his second in command this Rebecca Vilas woman who I am sure is as gorgeous as she sounds hired me to put on a record hop as the slambang climax to Maxtons big Strawberry Fest Well not me  an old longneglected persona of mine Symphonic Stan the BigBand Man Do you need a ride I do not The wondrous Miss Vilas has attended to my needs in the form of a car with a comfy back seat for my turntable and a trunk spacious enough for the speakers and record cartons which she will be sending But thanks anyhow Symphonic Stan Jack said A knockedout allfrantic allzootsuit embodiment of the bigband era and a charming mellifluous gentleman besides For the residents of Maxtons an evocation of their salad days and a joy to behold Do you actually own a zoot suit Magnificently inexpressive Henrys face swings toward him Sorry I dont know what came over me To change the subject what you said I mean what George Rathbun said about the Fisherman this morning probably did a lot of good I was glad to hear that Henry opens his mouth and summons George Rathbun in all his avuncular glory  The original Fisherman boys and girls Albert Fish has been dead and gone for sixtyseven years  It is uncanny hearing the voice of that chargedup fat man leap from Henry Leydens slender throat In his own voice Henry says I hope it did some good After I read your buddy Wendell Greens nonsense in the paper this morning I thought George had to say something Henry Leyden enjoys using terms like I read I was reading I saw I was looking at He knows these phrases disconcert his auditors And he called Wendell Green your buddy because Henry is the only person to whom Jack has ever admitted that he alerted the reporter to the crimes of Albert Fish Now Jack wishes he had confessed to no one Gladhanding Wendell Green is not his buddy Having been of some assistance to the press Henry says you might reasonably be thought in a position to do the same for our boys in blue Forgive me Jack but you opened the door and Ill only say this once Dale is my nephew after all I dont believe youre doing this to me Jack says Doing what speaking my mind Dale is my nephew remember He could use your expertise and he is very much of the opinion that you owe him a favor Hasnt it occurred to you that you could help him stay in his job Or that if you love French Landing and Norway Valley as much as you say you owe these folks a little of your time and talent Hasnt it occurred to you Henry that Im retired Jack says through gritted teeth That investigating homicides is the last thing I mean the last thing in the world I want to do Of course it has Henry says But  and again I hope youll forgive me Jack  here you are the person I know you are with the skills you have which are certainly far beyond Dales and probably well beyond all these other guys and I cant help wondering what the hell your problem is I dont have a problem Jack says Im a civilian Youre the boss We might as well listen to the rest of the Barenboim Henry runs his fingers over the console and pushes the button for the tuner For the next fifteen minutes the only voice to be heard in the pickups cab is that of a Steinway concert grand meditating upon The Goldberg Variations in the Teatro Coln Buenos Aires A splendid voice it is too Jack thinks and youd have to be an ignoramus to mistake it for Glenn Gould A person capable of making that mistake probably couldnt hear the vibrationlike inner sound produced by a General Motors door handle When they turn right off Highway  onto Norway Valley Road Henry says Stop sulking I shouldnt have called you a schmuck And I shouldnt have accused you of having a problem because Im the one with the problem You Jack looks at him startled Long experience has immediately suggested that Henry is about to ask for some kind of unofficial investigative help Henry is facing the windshield giving nothing away What kind of problem can you have Did your socks get out of order Oh  are you having trouble with one of the stations That I could deal with Henry pauses and the pause stretches into a lengthy silence What I was going to say is I feel like Im losing my mind I think Im going sort of crazy Come on Jack eases up on the gas pedal and cuts his speed in half Has Henry witnessed a feather explosion Of course he hasnt Henry cannot see anything And his own feather explosion was merely a waking dream Henry quivers like a tuning fork He is still facing the windshield Tell me whats going on Jack says Im starting to worry about you Henry opens his mouth to a crack that might accommodate a communion wafer then closes it again Another tremor runs through him Hmm he says This is harder than I thought Astonishingly his dry measured voice the true voice of Henry Leyden wobbles with a wide helpless vibrato Jack slows the pickup to a crawl begins to say something and decides to wait I hear my wife Henry says At night when Im lying in bed Around three four in the morning Rhodas footsteps are moving around in the kitchen theyre coming up the stairs I must be losing my mind How often does this happen How many times I dont know exactly Three or four Do you get up and look for her Call out her name Henrys voice again sails up and down on the vibrato trampoline Ive done both those things Because I was sure I heard her Her footsteps her way of walking her tread Rhodas been gone for six years now Pretty funny huh Id think it was funny if I didnt think I was going bats You call out her name Jack says And you get out of bed and go downstairs Like a lunatic like a madman Rhoda Is that you Rhoda Last night I went all around the house Rhoda Rhoda Youd think I was expecting her to answer Henry pays no attention to the tears that leak from beneath his aviator glasses and slip down his cheeks And I was thats the problem No one else was in the house Jack says No signs of disturbance Nothing misplaced or missing or anything like that Not as far as I saw Everything was still where it should have been Right where I left it He raises a hand and wipes his face The entrance to Jacks looping driveway slides past on the right side of the cab Ill tell you what I think Jack says picturing Henry wandering through his darkened house Six years ago you went through all the grief business that happens when someone you love dies and leaves you the denial the bargaining the anger the pain whatever acceptance that whole range of emotions but afterward you still missed Rhoda No one ever says you keep on missing the dead people you loved but you do Now thats profound Henry says And comforting too Dont interrupt Weirdness happens Believe me I know what Im talking about Your mind rebels It distorts the evidence it gives false testimony Who knows why It just does In other words you go batshit Henry says I believe that is where we came in What I mean Jack says is that people can have waking dreams Thats what is happening to you Its nothing to worry about All right heres your drive youre home He turns into the grassy entrance and rolls up to the white farmhouse in which Henry and Rhoda Leyden had spent the fifteen lively years between their marriage and the discovery of Rhodas liver cancer For nearly two years after her death Henry went wandering through his house every evening turning on the lights Waking dreams Whered you get that one Waking dreams arent uncommon Jack says Especially in people who never get enough sleep like you Or like me he silently adds Im not making this up Henry Ive had one or two myself One anyhow Waking dreams Henry says in a different considering tone of voice Iveydivey Think about it We live in a rational world People do not return from the dead Everything happens for a reason and the reasons are always rational Its a matter of chemistry or coincidence If they werent rational wed never figure anything out and wed never know what was going on Even a blind man can see that Henry says Thanks Words to live by He gets out of the cab and closes the door He moves away steps back and leans in through the window Do you want to start on Bleak House tonight I should get home about eightthirty something like that Ill turn up around nine By way of parting Henry says Dingdong He turns away walks to his doorstep and disappears into his house which is of course unlocked Around here only parents lock their doors and even thats a new development Jack reverses the pickup swings down the drive and onto Norway Valley Road He feels as though he has done a doubly good deed for by helping Henry he has also helped himself Its nice how things turn out sometimes When he turns into his own long driveway a peculiar rattle comes from the ashtray beneath his dashboard He hears it again at the last curve just before his house comes into view The sound is not so much a rattle as a small dull clunk A button a coin  something like that He rolls to a stop at the side of his house turns off the engine and opens his door On an afterthought he reaches over and pulls out the ashtray What Jack finds nestled in the grooves at the bottom of the sliding tray a tiny robins egg a robins egg the size of an almond MM expels all the air from his body The little egg is so blue a blind man could see it Jacks trembling fingers pluck the egg from the ashtray Staring at it he leaves the cab and closes the door Still staring at the egg he finally remembers to breathe His hand revolves on his wrist and releases the egg which falls in a straight line to the grass Deliberately he lifts his foot and smashes it down onto the obscene blue speck Without looking back he pockets his keys and moves toward the dubious safety of his house WE GLIMPSED A janitor on our whirlwind earlymorning tour of Maxton Elder Care  do you happen to remember him Baggy overalls A wee bit thick in the gut Dangling cigarette in spite of the NO SMOKING LUNGS AT WORK signs that have been posted every twenty feet or so along the patient corridors A mop that looks like a clot of dead spiders No Dont apologize Its easy enough to overlook Pete Wexler a onetime nondescript youth final grade average at French Landing High School  who passed through a nondescript young manhood and has now reached the edge of what he expects to be a nondescript middle age His only hobby is administering the occasional secret savage pinch to the moldy oldies who fill his days with their grunts nonsensical questions and smells of gas and piss The Alzheimers assholes are the worst He has been known to stub out the occasional cigarette on their scrawny backs or buttocks He likes their strangled cries when the heat hits and the pain cores in This small and ugly torture has a doublebarreled effect it wakes them up a little and satisfies something in him Brightens his days somehow Refreshes the old outlook Besides who are they going to tell And oh God there goes the worst of them now shuffling slowly down the corridor of Daisy Charles Burnsides mouth is agape as is the back of his johnny Pete has a better view of Burnsides scrawny shitsmeared buttocks than he ever wanted The chocolate stains go all the way down to the backs of his knees by God Hes headed for the bathroom but its just a leetle bit late A certain brown horse  call him Morning Thunder  has already bolted from its stall and no doubt galloped across Burnys sheets Thank God cleaning em up isnt my job Pete thinks and smirks around his cigarette Over to you Butch But the desk up there by the little boys and girls rooms is for the time being unattended Butch Yerxa is going to miss the charming sight of Burnys dirty ass sailing by Butch has apparently stepped out for a smoke although Pete has told the idiot a hundred times that all those NO SMOKING signs mean nothing  Chipper Maxton could care less about who smoked where or where the smokes were butted out for that matter The signs are just there to keep good old Drooler Manor in compliance with certain tiresome state laws Petes smirk widens and at that moment he looks a good deal like his son Ebbie Tyler Marshalls sometime friend it was Ebbie Wexler in fact who just gave Jack and Henry the finger Pete is wondering whether he should go out and tell Butch hes got a little cleanup job in D  plus Ds occupant of course  or if he should just let Butch discover Burnys latest mess on his own Perhaps Burny will go back to his room and do a little fingerpainting kind of spread the joy around That would be good but it would also be good to see Butchs face fall when Pete tells him  Pete Oh no Sandbagged by the bitch Shes a finelooking bitch but a bitch is still a bitch Pete stands where he is for a moment thinking that maybe if he ignores her shell go away Vain hope Pete He turns There is Rebecca Vilas current squeeze of the big cheese Today she is wearing a light red dress perhaps in honor of Strawberry Fest and black highheeled pumps probably in honor of her own fine gams Pete briefly imagines those fine gams wrapped around him those high heels crossed at the small of his back and pointing like clock hands then sees the cardboard box shes holding in her arms Work for him no doubt Pete also notes the glinting ring on her finger some sort of gemstone the size of a goddamn robins egg although considerably paler He wonders not for the first time just what a woman does to earn a ring like that She stands there tapping her foot letting him have his look Behind him Charles Burnside continues his slow tottery progress toward the mens Youd think looking at that old wreck with his scrawny legs and flyaway milkweed hair that his running days were long behind him But youd be wrong Terribly wrong Miz Vilas Pete says at last Common room Pete On the double And how many times have you been told not to smoke in the patient wings Before he can reply she turns with a sexy little flirt of the skirt and starts off toward the Maxton common room where that afternoons Strawberry Fest dance will be held Sighing Pete props his mop against the wall and follows her Charles Burnside is now alone at the head of the Daisy corridor The vacancy leaves his eyes and is replaced with a brilliant and feral gleam of intelligence All at once he looks younger All at once Burny the human shit machine is gone In his place is Carl Bierstone who reaped the young in Chicago with such savage efficiency Carl    and something else Something not human He  it  grins On the unattended desk is a pile of paper weighed down with a round stone the size of a coffee cup Written on the stone in small black letters is BUTCHS PET ROCK Burny picks up Butch Yerxas pet rock and walks briskly toward the mens room still grinning In the common room the tables have been arranged around the walls and covered with red paper cloths Later Pete will add small red lights battery powered no candles for the droolers gosh no On the walls great big cardboard strawberries have been taped up everywhere some looking rather battered  they have been put up and taken down every July since Herbert Maxton opened this place at the end of the swingin sixties The linoleum floor is open and bare This afternoon and early evening the moldy oldies who are still ambulatory and of a mind to do so will shuffle around out there to the bigband sounds of the thirties and forties clinging to each other during the slow numbers and probably dampening their Depends with excitement at the end of the jitterbugs Three years ago a moldy oldie named Irving Christie had a minor heart attack after doing a particularly strenuous lindyhop to Dont Sit Under the Apple Tree with Anyone Else but Me Oh yes the Strawberry Fest Hop is always exciting Rebecca has all by herself pushed together three wooden flats and covered them with a white cloth creating the basis for Symphonic Stans podium In the corner stands a brilliantly chromed microphone with a large round head a genuine antique from the thirties that saw service at the Cotton Club It is one of Henry Leydens prize possessions Beside it is the tall narrow carton in which it arrived yesterday On the podium beneath a beam decorated with red and white crepe and more cardboard strawberries is a stepladder Seeing it Pete feels a moments possessive jealousy Rebecca Vilas has been in his closet Trespassing bitch If she stole any of his weed by God  Rebecca sets her carton down on the podium with an audible grunt then straightens up She brushes a lock of silky chestnut hair off one flushed cheek Its only midmorning but the day is going to be a genuine Coulee Country scorcher Aircondition your underwear and double up on the deodorant folks as George Rathbun has been known to bellow Oi thought youd never come me foine bucko Rebecca says Well Im here Pete says sullenly Looks like youre doing fine without me He pauses then addsFoine For Pete this is quite a witticism He walks forward and peers into the carton which like the one by the mike is stamped PROPERTY OF HENRY LEYDEN Inside the box is a small spotlight with an electrical cord wrapped around it and a circular pink gel that is meant to turn the light the color of candy canes and sugar strawberries Whats this shit Pete asks Rebecca gives him a brilliant dangerous smile Even to a relatively dull fellow like Pete the message of that smile is clear youre on the edge of the gator pool buddy how many more steps do you want to take Light she says LIGHT Hangs up there on that hook HOOK Its something the deejay insists on Says it gets him in the mood MOO   What happened to Weenie Erickson Pete grumbles There was none of this shit with Weenie He played the goddamn records for two hours had a few out of his hip flask then shut it down He moved Rebecca says indifferently Racine I think Well   Pete is looking up studying the beam with its intertwined fluffs of red and white crepe I dont see no hook Miz Vilas Christ on a bicycle she says and mounts the stepladder Here Are you blind Pete most definitely not blind has rarely been so grateful for his sighted state From his position below her hes got a clear view of her thighs the red lace froth of her panties and the twin curves of her buttocks now nicely tensed as she stands on the fifth step of the ladder She looks down at him sees the stunned look on his face notes the direction of his sight line Her expression softens a bit As her dear mither so wisely observed some men are just fools for a flash of panty Pete Earth to Pete Uh He looks up at her mouth agape a dot of spittle on his lower lip There is no hook of any kind on my underwear Im sure of that as of few things in life But if you will direct your gaze upward    to my hand instead of my ass    He looks up face still dazed and sees one redtipped nail Rebecca is a throughandthrough vision in strawberry red today no doubt about it tapping a hook that just gleams out of the crepe like a fishermans hook gleaming murderously out of a gaudy lure Hook she says Attach gel to light attach light to hook Light becomes warm pink spotlight as per deejays explicit instructions You getum message Kemo sabe Uh    yeah    Then if I may coin a phrase will you please get it up She comes down the ladder deciding Pete Wexler has gotten the biggest free show he can reasonably expect for one lousy chore And Pete who has already achieved one erection pulls Symphonic Stans pink pinspot out of its box and prepares to achieve another As he mounts the stepladder his crotch rises past Rebeccas face She notes the bulge there and gnaws the inside of one cheek to suppress a smile Men are fools all right Lovable fools some of them but fools all the same Its just that some fools can afford rings and trips and midnight suppers at Milwaukee nightspots and some fools cannot With some fools the best you can get them to do is put up a lousy light Wait up you guys Ty Marshall calls Ebbie Ronnie TJ Wait up Over his shoulder Ebbie Wexler who really does look like Nancys nottoobright boyfriend Sluggo calls back Catch us slowpoke Yeah Ronnie Metzger yells Catch us posloke Ronnie a kid with a lot of hours in the speechtherapy room ahead of him looks back over his own shoulder almost crashes his bike into a parking meter and just manages to swerve around it Then they are fleeing the three of them filling the sidewalk with their bikes God help the pedestrian headed the other way their racing shadows fleeing beside them Tyler considers a final catchup dash then decides his legs are just too tired His mother and father say that he will catch up in time that hes just small for his age but brother Ty has his doubts And he has had increasing doubts about Ebbie Ronnie and TJ too Are they really worth keeping up with If Judy Marshall knew of these doubts she would stand and applaud  she has wondered for the last two years when her bright and thoughtful son will finally tire of hanging out with such a bunch of losers    what she calls lowraters Suck an elf Ty says disconsolately  he has picked up this harmless vulgarity from SciFi Channel reruns of a miniseries called The th Kingdom  and dismounts his bike Theres no real reason to speed after them anyway he knows where hell find them in the parking lot of the Eleven drinking Slurpees and trading Magic cards This is another problem Tyler is having with his friends These days hed much rather trade baseball cards Ebbie Ronnie and TJ could care less about the Cardinals the Indians the Red Sox and the Brew Crew Ebbie has gone so far as to say that baseball is gay a comment Ty considers stupid almost pitiable rather than outrageous He walks his bike slowly up the sidewalk catching his breath Here is the intersection of Chase and Queen streets Ebbie calls Queen Street Queer Street Of course No surprise there And isnt that a big part of the problem Tyler is a boy who likes surprises Ebbie Wexler is a boy who doesnt Which makes their opposite reactions to the music pouring out of the pickup a little earlier that morning perfectly predictable Tyler pauses at the corner looking down Queen Street There are shaggy hedges on both sides Above those on the right rise a number of interconnected red roofs The old folks home Beside the main gate some sort of sign has been placed Curious Tyler remounts his bike and rides slowly down the sidewalk for a look The longest branches of the hedge beside him whisper against the handlebar of his bike The sign turns out to be a great big strawberry TODAY IS STRAWBERRY FEST is written below it What Ty Marshall wonders is a Strawberry Fest A party something strictly for old folks Its a question but not a very interesting one After mulling it over for a few seconds he turns his bike and prepares to ride back down to Chase Street Charles Burnside enters the mens room at the head of the Daisy corridor still grinning and clutching Butchs pet rock To his right is a line of sinks with a mirror over each one  they are the sort of metal mirrors one finds in the toilets of lowerclass bars and saloons In one of these Burny sees his own grinning reflection In another the one closest the window he sees a small boy in a Milwaukee Brewers Tshirt The boy is standing astride his bike just outside the gate reading the Strawberry Fest sign Burny begins to drool There is nothing discreet about it either Burny drools like a wolf in a fairy tale white curds of foamy spit leaking from the corners of his mouth and flowing over the slack livercolored roll of his lower lip The drool runs down his chin like a stream of soapsuds He wipes at it absently with the back of one gnarled hand and shakes it to the floor in a splatter never taking his eyes from the mirror The boy in the mirror is not one of this creatures poor lost babies  Ty Marshall has lived in French Landing his whole life and knows exactly where he is  but he could be He could very easily become lost and wind up in a certain room A certain cell Or trudging toward a strange horizon on burning bleeding footsies Especially if Burny has his way He will have to move fast but as we have already noted Charles Burnside can with the proper motivation move very fast indeed Gorg he says to the mirror He speaks this nonsense word in a perfectly clear perfectly flat midwestern accent Come Gorg And without waiting to see what comes next  he knows what comes next  Burny turns and walks toward the line of four toilet stalls He steps into the second from the left and closes the door Tyler has just remounted his bike when the hedge rustles ten feet from the Strawberry Fest sign A large black crow shrugs its way out of the greenery and onto the Queen Street sidewalk It regards the boy with a lively intelligent eye It stands with its black legs spread opens its beak and speaks Gorg Tyler looks at it beginning to smile not sure he heard this but ready to be delighted at ten hes always ready to be delighted always primed to believe the unbelievable What Did you say something The crow flutters its glossy wings and cocks its head in a way that renders the ugly almost charming Gorg Ty The boy laughs It said his name The crow said his name He dismounts his bike puts it on the kickstand and takes a couple of steps toward the crow Thoughts of Amy St Pierre and Johnny Irkenham are  unfortunately  the furthest things from his mind He thinks the crow will surely fly away when he steps toward it but it only flutters its wings a little and takes a slidestep toward the bushy darkness of the hedge Did you say my name Gorg Ty Abbalah For a moment Tys smile falters That last word is almost familiar to him and the associations although faint are not exactly pleasant It makes him think of his mother for some reason Then the crow says his name again surely it is saying Ty Tyler takes another step away from Queen Street and toward the black bird The crow takes a corresponding step sidling closer still to the bulk of the hedge There is no one on the street this part of French Landing is dreaming in the morning sunshine Ty takes another step toward his doom and all the worlds tremble Ebbie Ronnie and TJ come swaggering out of the Eleven where the raghead behind the counter has just served them blueberry Slurpees raghead is just one of many pejorative terms Ebbie has picked up from his dad They also have fresh packs of Magic cards two packs each Ebbie his lips already smeared blue turns to TJ Go on downstreet and get the slowpoke TJ looks injured Why me Because Ronnie bought the cards dumbwit Go on hurry up Why do we need him Ebbie Ronnie asks He leans against the bike rack noshing on the cold sweet chips of ice Because I say so Ebbie replies loftily The fact is Tyler Marshall usually has money on Fridays In fact Tyler has money almost every day His parents are loaded Ebbie who is being raised if you can call it that by a single father who has a crappy janitors job has already conceived a vague hate for Tyler on this account the first humiliations arent far away and the first beatings will follow soon after But now all he wants is more Magic cards a third pack for each of them The fact that Tyler doesnt even like Magic that much will only make getting him to pony up that much sweeter But first they have to get the little slowpoke up here Or the little posloke as mushmouthed Ronnie calls him Ebbie likes that and thinks he will start using it Posloke A good word Makes fun of Ty and Ronnie at the same time Two for the price of one Go on TJ Unless you want an Indian burn TJ doesnt Ebbie Wexlers Indian burns hurt like a mad bastard He gives a theatrical sigh backs his bike out of the rack mounts it and rides back down the mild slope of the hill holding a handlebar in one hand and his Slurpee in the other He expects to see Ty right away probably walking his bike because hes just    so    tiyyyurd but Ty doesnt seem to be on Chase Street at all  whats up with that TJ pedals a little faster In the mens room we are now looking at the line of toilet stalls The door of the one second from the left is closed The other three stand ajar on their chrome hinges Beneath the closed door we see a pair of gnarled veiny ankles rising from a pair of filthy slippers A voice cries out with surprising strength It is a young mans voice hoarse hungry and angry It echoes flatly back from the tile walls Abbalah Abbalahdoon Munshun gorg Suddenly the toilets flush Not just the one in the closed cubicle but all of them Across the room the urinals also flush their chromed handles dipping in perfect synchronicity Water runs down their curved porcelain surfaces When we look back from the urinals to the toilets we see that the dirty slippers  and the feet that were in them  are gone And for the first time we have actually heard the sound of slippage a kind of hot exhale the sort of sound one hears escaping ones lungs when waking from a nightmare at two in the morning Ladies and gentlemen Charles Burnside has left the building The crow has backed right up against the hedge now Still it regards Tyler with its bright eerie eyes Tyler steps toward it feeling hypnotized Say my name again he breathes Say my name again and you can go Ty the crow croaks obligingly then gives its wings a little shake and slips into the hedge For a moment Tyler can still see it a mixture of shiny black in the shiny green and then its gone Holy crow Tyler says He realizes what hes said and gives a small shaky laugh Did it happen It did didnt it He leans closer to where the crow reentered the hedge thinking if it shed a feather he will take it for a souvenir and when he does a scrawny white arm shoots out through the green and seizes him unerringly by the neck Tyler has time to give a single terrified squawk and then he is dragged through the hedge One of his sneakers is pulled off by the short stiff branches From the far side there is a single guttural greedy cry  it might have been Boy  and then a thud the sound of a pet rock coming down on a small boys head perhaps Then theres nothing but the distant drone of a lawn mower and the closer drone of a bee The bee is bumbling around the flowers on the far side of the hedge the Maxton side There is nothing else to be seen over there but green grass and closer to the building the tables where the elderly inhabitants will at noon sit down to the Strawberry Fest Picnic Tyler Marshall is gone T J Renniker coasts to a stop at the corner of Chase and Queen His Slurpee is dripping dark blue juice over his wrist but he barely notices Halfway down Queen Street he sees Tys bike leaning neatly over on its kickstand but no Ty Moving slowly  he has a bad feeling about this somehow  TJ rides over to the bike At some point he becomes aware that what was a Slurpee has now dissolved into a soggy cup of melting goop He tosses it into the gutter Its Tys ride all right No mistaking that red twentyinch Schwinn with the apehanger handlebars and the green Milwaukee Bucks decal on the side The bike and  Lying on its side by the hedge that creates a border between the world of the old folks and the world of regular people the real people TJ sees a single Reebok sneaker Scattered around it are a number of shiny green leaves One feather protrudes from the sneaker The boy stares at this sneaker with wide eyes TJ may not be as smart as Tyler but hes a few watts brighter than Ebbie Wexler and its easy enough for him to imagine Tyler being dragged through the hedge leaving his bike behind    and one sneaker    one lonely overturned sneaker    Ty he calls Are you jokin around Because if you are you better stop Ill tell Ebbie to give you the biggest Indian burn you ever had No answer Ty isnt joking around TJ somehow knows it Thoughts of Amy St Pierre and Johnny Irkenham suddenly explode in TJs mind He hears or imagines he hears stealthy footsteps behind the hedge the Fisherman having secured dinner has come back for dessert TJ tries to scream and cannot His throat has shrunk down to a pinhole Instead of screaming he hunches himself over the handlebars of his bike and begins pedaling He swerves off the sidewalk and into the street wanting to get away from the dark bulk of that hedge just as fast as he can When he leaves the curb the front tire of his Huffy bike squashes through the remains of his Slurpee As he pedals toward Chase Street bent over his handlebars like a Grand Prix racer he leaves a dark and shiny track on the pavement It looks like blood Somewhere nearby a crow caws It sounds like laughter  Robin Hood Lane weve been here before as the chorus girl said to the archbishop Peek through the kitchen window and we see Judy Marshall asleep in the rocking chair in the corner Theres a book in her lap the John Grisham novel we last saw on her bedside table Sitting beside her on the floor is half a cup of cold coffee Judy managed to read ten pages before dozing off We shouldnt blame Mr Grishams narrative skills Judy had a hard night last night and its not the first Its been over two months since she last got more than two hours of sleep in one stretch Fred knows something is wrong with his wife but has no idea how deep it runs If he did he would be a lot more than frightened Soon God help him he is going to have a better picture of her mental state Now she begins to moan thickly and to turn her head from side to side Those nonsense words begin to issue from her again Most of them are too sleepfuzzy to understand but we catch abbalah and gorg Her eyes suddenly flash open They are a brilliant royal blue in the morning light which fills the kitchen with summers dusty gold Ty she gasps and her feet give a convulsive waking jerk She looks at the clock over the stove It is twelve minutes past nine and everything seems twisted as it so often does when we sleep deeply but not well or long She has sucked some miserable notquiteanightmare dream after her like mucusy strings of afterbirth men with fedora hats pulled down so as to shadow their faces walking on long R Crumb legs that ended in big roundtoed R Crumb shoes sinister keep on truckin sharpies who moved too fast against a city background  Milwaukee Chicago  and in front of a baleful orange sky The dreams sound track was the Benny Goodman band playing King Porter Stomp the one her father had always played when he was getting a little shot and the feeling of the dream had been a terrible darkwood mix of terror and grief awful things had happened but the worst was waiting Theres none of the relief people usually feel upon waking from bad dreams  the relief she herself had felt when she had been younger and    and    And sane she says in a croaky justwokeup voice  King Porter Stomp Think of that To her it had always sounded like the music you heard in the old cartoons the ones where mice in white gloves ran in and out of ratholes with dizzying feverish speed Once when her father was dancing her around to that one she had felt something hard poking against her Something in his pants After that when he put on his dance music she tried to be somewhere else Quit it she says in the same croaky voice Its a crows voice and it occurs to her that there was a crow in her dream Sure you bet The Crow Gorg Gorg means death she says and licks her dry upper lip without realizing it Her tongue comes out even farther and on the return swipe the tip licks across her nostrils warm and wet and somehow comforting Over there gorg means death Over there in the   Faraway is the word she doesnt say Before she can she sees something on the kitchen table that wasnt there before Its a wicker box A sound is coming from it some low sleepy sound Distress worms into her lower belly making her bowels feel loose and watery She knows what a box like that is called a creel Its a fishermans creel There is a fisherman in French Landing these days A bad fisherman Ty she calls but of course there is no answer The house is empty except for her Dale is at work and Ty will be out playing  you bet Its halfpast July the heart of summer vacation and Ty will be rolling around the town doing all the Ray BradburyCAugust Derleth things boys do when theyve got the whole endless summer day to do them in But he wont be alone Dale has talked with him about buddying up until the Fisherman is caught at least until then and so has she Judy has no great liking for the Wexler kid the Metzger or Renniker kids either but theres safety in numbers Ty probably isnt having any great cultural awakenings this summer but at least  At least hes safe she says in her croaky Crow Gorg voice Yet the box that has appeared on the kitchen table during her nap seems to deny that to negate the whole concept of safety Where did it come from And what is the white thing on top of it A note she says and gets up She crosses the short length of floor between the rocker and the table like someone still in a dream The note is a piece of paper folded over Written across the half she can see is Sweet Judy Blue Eyes In college just before meeting Dale she had a boyfriend who used to call her that She asked him to stop  it was annoying sappy  and when he kept forgetting on purpose she suspected she dropped him like a rock Now here it is again that stupid nickname mocking her Judy turns on the sink tap without taking her eyes from the note fills her cupped hand with cold water and drinks A few drops fall on Sweet Judy Blue Eyes and the name smears at once Written in fountainpen ink How antique Who writes with a fountain pen these days She reaches for the note then draws back The sound from inside the box is louder now Its a humming sound It  Its flies she says Her throat has been refreshed by the water and her voice isnt so croaky but to herself Judy still sounds like the Crow Gorg You know the sound of flies Get the note Dont want to Yes but you NEED to Now get it What happened to your GUTS you little chickenshit Good question Fucking good question Judys tongue comes out slathers her upper lip and philtrum Then she takes the note and unfolds it Sorry there is only one kiddieknee kindney The other I fryed and ate It was very good The Fisherman The nerves in Judy Marshalls fingers palms wrists and forearms suddenly shut down The color drops so completely from her face that the blue veins in her cheeks become visible Its surely a miracle that she doesnt pass out The note drops from her fingers and goes seesawing to the floor Shrieking her sons name over and over again she throws back the lid of the fishermans creel Inside are shiny red coils of intestine crawling with flies There are the wrinkled sacs of lungs and the fistsized pump that was a childs heart There is the thick purple pad of a liver    and one kidney This mess of guts is crawling with flies and all the world is gorg is gorg is gorg In the sunny stillness of her kitchen Judy Marshall now begins to howl and it is the sound of madness finally broken free of its flimsy cage madness unbound Butch Yerxa intended to go in after a single smoke  theres always a lot to do on Strawberry Fest days although kindhearted Butch doesnt hate the little artificial holiday the way Pete Wexler does Then Petra English an orderly from Asphodel wandered over and they started talking motorcycles and before you know it twenty minutes have passed He tells Petra he has to go she tells him to keep the shiny side up and the rubber side down and Butch slips back in through the door to an unpleasant surprise There is Charles Burnside starkers standing beside the desk with his hand on the rock Butch uses as a paperweight His son made it in camp last year  painted the words on it anyway  and Butch thinks its cute as hell Butch has nothing against the residents  certainly he would give Pete Wexler a pasting if he knew about the thing with the cigarettes never mind just reporting him  but he doesnt like them touching his things Especially this guy who is fairly nasty when he has his few wits about him Which he does now Butch can see it in his eyes The real Charles Burnside has come up for air perhaps in honor of Strawberry Fest And speaking of strawberries Burny has apparently been into them already There are traces of red on his lips and tucked into the deep folds at the corners of his mouth Butch barely looks at this though There are other stains on Burny Brown ones Want to take your hand off that Charles he asks Off what Burny asks then adds Asswipe Butch doesnt want to say Off my pet rock that sounds stupid Off my paperweight Burny looks down at the rock which he has just replaced there was a little blood and hair on it when he emerged from the toilet stall but cleanup is what bathroom sinks are for He drops his hand from it and just stands there Clean me up bozo I shit myself So I see But first tell me if youve gone and spread your crap around the kitchen And I know youve been down there so dont lie Warshed my hands first Burny says and shows them They are gnarled but pink and clean for all that Even the nails are clean He certainly has washed them He then adds Jackoff Come on down to the bathroom with me Butch says The jackoff asswipe will get you cleaned up Burny snorts but comes willingly enough You ready for the dance this afternoon Butch asks him just to be saying something Got your dancing shoes all polished big boy Burny who can surprise you sometimes when hes actually home smiles showing a few yellow teeth Like his lips they are stained with red Yowza Im ready to rock he says Although Ebbies face doesnt show it he listens with growing unease to TJs story about Tyler Marshalls abandoned bike and sneaker Ronnies face on the other hand shows plenty of unease So whatre we gonna do Ebbie TJ asks when hes done Hes finally getting his breath back from his rapid pedal up the hill What do you mean whatre we gonna do Ebbie says Same things we were gonna do anyway go downstreet see what we can find for returnable bottles Go down the park and trade Magics But    but what if   Shut your yap Ebbie says He knows what two words TJ is about to say and he doesnt want to hear them His dad says its bad luck to toss a hat on the bed and Ebbie never does it If thats bad luck mentioning some freako killers name has got to be twice as bad But then that idiot Ronnie Metzger goes and says it anyway    sort of But Ebbie what if its the Misherfun What if Ty got grabbed by the   Shut the fuck up Ebbie says and draws back his fist as if to hit the damn mushmouth At that moment the raghead clerk pops out of the Eleven like a turbaned jack out of his box I want none of that talk here he cries You go now do your filthytalk another place Or I call police Ebbie starts to pedal slowly away in a direction that will take him farther from Queer Street under his breath he mutters dune coon another charming term he has learned from his father and the other two boys follow him When they have put a block between them and the Eleven Ebbie stops and faces the other two both his gut and his jaw jutting He rode off on his own half an hour ago he says Huh says TJ Who did what says Ronnie Ty Marshall If anyone asks he rode off on his own half an hour ago When we were    ummm    Ebbie casts his mind back something thats hard for him because he has had so little practice In ordinary circumstances the present is all Ebbie Wexler needs When we were looking in the window of the Allsorts TJ asks timidly hoping he isnt buying himself one of Ebbies ferocious Indian burns Ebbie looks at him blankly for a moment then smiles TJ relaxes Ronnie Metzger only goes on looking bewildered With a baseball bat in his hands or a pair of hockey skates on his feet Ronnie is prince of all he surveys The rest of the time hes pretty much at sea Thats right Ebbie says yeah We was lookin in the window of Schmitts then that truck came along the one playin the punkass music and then Ty said he hadda split Whered he have to go TJ asks Ebbie isnt bright but he is possessed of what might be termed low cunning He knows instinctively that the best story is a short story  the less there is the smaller the chance that someone will trip you up with an inconsistency He didnt tell us that He just said he hadda go He didnt go anywhere Ronnie says He just got behind because hes a    He pauses arranging the word and this time it comes out right Slowpoke You never mind that Ebbie says What if the    what if that guy got him you dummocks You want people sayin it was because he couldnt keep up That he got killed or somethin because we left him behind You want people sayin it was our fault Gee Ronnie says You dont really think the Misherfun  Fisherman  got Ty do you I dont know and I dont care Ebbie says but I dont mind it that hes gone He was startin to piss me off Oh Ronnie contrives to look both vacant and satisfied What a dummocks he is Ebbie marvels What a total and complete dummocks And if you didnt believe it just think of how Ronnie whos as strong as a horse allows Ebbie to give him Indian burn after Indian burn A day will probably come when Ronnie realizes he doesnt have to put up with that anymore and on that day he may well pound Ebbie into the ground like a human tent peg but Ebbie doesnt worry about such things hes even worse at casting his mind forward than he is at casting it back Ronnie Ebbie says What Where were we when Tyler took off  Um    Schmitts Allsorts Right And whered he go Didnt say Ebbie sees that for Ronnie this is already becoming the truth and is satisfied He turns to TJ You got it I got it Then lets go They pedal off The dummocks pulls a little ahead of Ebbie and TJ as they roll along the treelined street and Ebbie allows this He swings his bike a little closer to TJs and says You see anything else back there Anybody Like a guy TJ shakes his head Just his bike and his sneaker He pauses remembering as hard as he can There were some leaves scattered around From the hedge And I think there might have been a feather Like a crow feather Ebbie dismisses this He is grappling with the question of whether or not the Fisherman has actually come close to him this morning close enough to snatch one of his buddies There is a bloodthirsty part of him that likes the idea that relishes the thought of some shadowy noface monster killing the increasingly annoying Ty Marshall and eating him for lunch There is also a childish part of him that is terrified of the boogeyman this part will be in charge tonight as he lies awake in his room looking at shadows that seem to take form and slink ever closer around his bed And there is the olderthanhisyears part of him which has taken instinctive and immediate measures to avoid the eye of authority should Tylers disappearance turn into what Ebbies father calls a fuckarow But mostly as with Dale Gilbertson and Tys father Fred there is a continent of fundamental disbelief inside of Ebbie Wexler He simply cannot believe that anything final has happened to Tyler Not even after Amy St Pierre and Johnny Irkenham who was carved into pieces and hung up in an old henhouse These are kids of whom Ebbie has heard on the evening news fictions from the Land of TV He didnt know Amy or Johnny so they could have died just as makebelieve people were always dying in the movies and on TV Ty is different Ty was just here He talked to Ebbie Ebbie talked to him In Ebbies mind this equals immortality Or should If Ty could be snatched by the Fisherman any kid could be snatched Including him Hence like Dale and Fred he just doesnt believe it His most secret and fundamental heart the part of him that assures the rest of him that everything is fine on Planet Ebbie denies the Fisherman and all his works TJ says Ebbie do you think   Nah Ebbie says Hell turn up Come on lets go to the park We can look for cans and bottles later Fred Marshall has left his sport coat and tie in his office rolled up his sleeves and is helping Rod Tisbury unpack a new Hiler rototiller Its the first of the new Hiler line and its a beaut Ive been waiting for a gadget like this twenty years or more Rod says He expertly inserts the wide end of his crowbar at the top of the big crate and one of the wooden sides falls to the concrete floor of the maintenance garage with a flat clap Rod is Goltzs chief mechanic and out here in maintenance he is king Its gonna work for the small farmer its gonna work for the town gardener as well If you cant sell a dozen of these by fall youre not doing your job Ill sell twenty by the end of August Fred says with perfect confidence All his worries have been temporarily swept away by this splendid little green machine which can do a hell of a lot more than rototill there are a number of sexy attachments that snap in and out as easily as the lining in a fall jacket He wants to start it up listen to it run That twocylinder engine looks pretty sweet Fred He looks around impatiently Its Ina Gaitskill Ted Goltzs secretary and the dealership receptionist What Youve got a call on line one She points across the floor  alive with clanging machinery and the noisy whir of pneumatic screwdrivers loosening bolts on an old Case tractor  to the phone on the wall where several lights are blinking Can you take a message Ina I was going to help Rod get a battery in this little beast and then   I think you should take the call Its a woman named Enid Purvis A neighbor of yours For a moment Fred blanks and then his salesmans mind which stores up names compulsively comes to his rescue Enid Purvis Wife of Deke Corner of Robin Hood and Maid Marian He saw Deke just this morning They waved to each other At the same time he becomes aware that Inas eyes are too big and her normally generous mouth is too small She looks worried What is it Dale asks Ina what is it I dont know Then reluctantly Something about your wife Better take it hoss Rod says but Fred is already crossing the oilstained concrete floor to the phone He arrives home ten minutes after leaving Goltzs peeling out of the employees parking lot and laying rubber like a teenager The worst part had been Enid Purviss calm and careful delivery how hard shed been trying not to sound frightened She had been walking Potsie past the Marshall house she said when she heard Judy scream Not once but twice Of course Enid had done what any good neighbor would God bless her gone up to the door rapped then pushed open the letter slot and called through it If there had been no answer she told Fred she probably would have phoned the police She wouldnt even have gone back home to do it she would have crossed the street to the Plotskys house and called from there But  Im all right Judy had called back and then she had laughed The laugh was shrill ending in a tittery gasp Enid had found this laugh somehow even more upsetting than the screams It was all a dream Even Ty was a dream Did you cut yourself dear Enid had called through the letter slot Did you fall down There was no creel Judy had called back She might have said keel but Enid was quite sure it was creel I dreamed that too Then Enid reluctantly told Fred Judy Marshall had begun crying It had been very upsetting listening to that sound come to her through the letter slot It had even made the dog whine Enid had called through one more time asking if she could come in and make sure Judy wasnt hurt Go away Judy had called back In the midst of her crying shed laughed again  an angry distracted laugh Youre a dream too This whole world is a dream Then there had been the sound of shattering glass as if she had struck a coffee mug or water tumbler and knocked it to the floor Or thrown it at the wall I didnt call the police because she sounded all right Enid told Fred Fred standing with the phone jammed up against one ear and his hand plastered over the other to cut out all the yammering mechanical sounds which he ordinarily enjoys and which at that moment seemed to go into his head like chrome spikes Physically all right anyway But Fred    I think you ought to go home and check on her All of Judys recent oddities went through his mind in a whirl So did Pat Skardas words Mental dysfunction We hear people say Soandso snapped but there are usually signs    And he has seen the signs hasnt he Seen them and done nothing Fred parks his car a sensible Ford Explorer in the driveway and hurries up the steps already calling his wifes name There is no answer Even when he has stepped through the front door he pushes it open so hard the brass letter slot gives a nonsensical little clack there is no answer The airconditioned interior of the house feels too cold on his skin and he realizes hes sweating Judy Jude Still no answer He hurries down the hall to the kitchen where he is most apt to find her if he comes home for something in the middle of the day The kitchen is sunwashed and empty The table and the counter are clean the appliances gleam two coffee cups have been placed in the dish drainer winking sun from their freshly washed surfaces More sun winks from a heap of broken glass in the corner Fred sees a flower decal on one piece and realizes it was the vase on the windowsill Judy he calls again He can feel the blood hammering in his throat and at his temples She doesnt answer him but he hears her upstairs beginning to sing Rockabye baby    on the treetop    when the wind blows    Fred recognizes it and instead of feeling relieved at the sound of her voice his flesh goes even colder She used to sing it to Tyler when their son was little Tys lullabye Fred hasnt heard that particular ditty come out of her mouth in years He goes back down the hall to the stairs now seeing what he missed on his first trip The Andrew Wyeth print Christinas World has been taken down and set against the baseboard heater The wallpaper below the picture hook has been scraped away in several places revealing the plasterboard beneath Fred colder than ever knows that Judy did this It isnt intuition exactly not deduction either Call it the telepathy of the long married Floating down from above beautiful and onkey yet at the same time perfectly empty    the cradle will rock When the bough breaks the cradle will fall    Fred is up the stairs two at a time calling her name The upper hall is a scary mess This is where they have hung the gallery of their past Fred and Judy outside Madison Shoes a blues club they sometimes went to when there was nothing interesting going on at the Chocolate Watchband Fred and Judy dancing the first dance at their wedding reception while their folks happily looked on Judy in a hospital bed exhausted but smiling holding the wrapped bundle that was Ty the photo of the Marshall family farm that she always sniffed at more Most of these framed photographs have been taken down Some like the one of the farm have been thrown down Glass litters the hall in sparkling sprays And she has been at the wallpaper behind half a dozen In the spot where the picture of Judy and Ty in the hospital had hung the paper has been torn almost completely away and he can see where she scraped at the wallboard beneath Some of the scratches are dappled with drying spots of blood Judy Judy Tylers door stands open Fred sprints the length of the upstairs hall with glass crunching under his loafers    and down will come Tyler cradle and all Judy Ju   He stands in the door all words temporarily knocked out of him Tys room looks like the aftermath of a rough search in a detective movie The drawers have been yanked out of his bureau and lie everywhere most overturned The bureau itself has been pulled away from the wall Summer clothes are spread hell to breakfast  jeans and Tshirts and underwear and white athletic socks The closet door is open and more clothes have been struck from the hangers that same spousal telepathy tells him she tore Tys slacks and buttonup shirts down so she could make sure nothing was behind them The coat of Tylers only suit hangs askew from the closets doorknob His posters have been pulled from the walls Mark McGwire has been torn in half In every case but one she has left the wallpaper behind the posters alone but the one exception is a beaut Behind the rectangle where the poster of the castle hung COME BACK TO THE AULD SOD the wallpaper has been almost entirely stripped away There are more streaks of blood on the wallboard beneath Judy Marshall sits on the bare mattress of her sons bed The sheets are heaped in the corner along with the pillow The bed itself has been yanked away from the wall Judys head is down He cant see her face  her hair is screening it  but shes wearing shorts and he can see dapples and streaks of blood on her tanned thighs Her hands are clasped below her knees out of sight and Fred is glad He doesnt want to see how badly she has hurt herself until he has to His heart is hammering in his chest his nervous system is redlining with adrenaline overload and his mouth tastes like a burnt fuse She begins to sing the chorus of Tys lullabye again and he cant stand it Judy no he says going to her through the strewn minefield that was only last night when he came in to give Ty a goodnight kiss a reasonably neat little boys room Stop honey its okay For a wonder she does stop She raises her head and when he sees the terrified look in her eyes he loses what little breath he has left Its more than terror Its emptiness as if something inside her has slipped aside and exposed a black hole Tys gone she says simply I looked behind all the pictures I could    I was sure hed be behind that one if he was anywhere hed be behind that one    She points toward the place where the Ireland travel poster hung and he sees that four of the nails on her left hand have been ripped partly or completely away His stomach does a flipflop Her fingers look as if they have been dipped in red ink If only it was ink Fred thinks If only    but of course its just a picture Theyre all just pictures I see that now She pauses then cries Abbalah Munshun Abbalahgorg Abbalahdoon Her tongue comes out  comes out to an impossible cartoonish length  and swipes spittishly across her nose Fred sees it but cannot believe it This is like coming into a horror movie halfway through the show discovering its real and not knowing what to do What is he supposed to do When you discover that the woman you love has gone mad  had a break with reality at the very least  what are you supposed to do How the hell do you deal with it But he loves her has loved her from the first week he knew her helplessly and completely and without the slightest regret ever after and now love guides him He sits down next to her on the bed puts his arm around her and simply holds her He can feel her trembling from the inside out Her body thrums like a wire I love you he says surprised at his voice Its amazing that seeming calmness can issue from such a crazy cauldron of confusion and fear I love you and everything is going to be all right She looks up at him and something comes back into her eyes Fred cannot call it sanity no matter how much he would like to but it is at least some sort of marginal awareness She knows where she is and who is with her For a moment he sees gratitude in her eyes Then her face cramps in a fresh agony of grief and she begins to weep It is an exhausted lost sound that wrenches at him Nerves heart and mind it wrenches at him Tys gone Judy says Gorg fascinated him and the abbalah took him Abbalahdoon The tears course down her cheeks When she raises her hands to wipe them away her fingers leave appalling streaks of blood Even though hes sure Tyler is fine certainly Fred has had no premonitions today unless we count his rosy sales prediction about the new Hiler roto he feels a shudder course through him at the sight of those streaks and it is not Judys condition that causes it but what shes just said Tys gone Ty is with his friends he told Fred just last night that he Ronnie TJ and the lessthanpleasant Wexler boy intended to spend the day goofing off If the other three boys go somewhere Ty doesnt want to be he has promised to come directly home All the bases seem to be covered yet    is there not such a thing as mothers intuition Well he thinks maybe on the Fox Network He picks Judy up in his arms and is appalled all over again this time by how light she is Shes lost maybe twenty pounds since the last time I picked her up like this he thinks At least ten How could I not have noticed But he knows Preoccupation with work was part of it a stubborn refusal to let go of the idea that things were basically all right was the rest of it Well he thinks carrying her out the door her arms have crept tiredly up and locked themselves around his neck Im over that little misconception And he actually believes this in spite of his continued blind confidence in his sons safety Judy hasnt toured their bedroom during her rampage and to Fred it looks like a cool oasis of sanity Judy apparently feels the same way She gives a tired sigh and her arms drop away from her husbands neck Her tongue comes out but this time it gives only a feeble little lick at her upper lip Fred bends and puts her down on the bed She holds up her hands looks at them I cut myself    scraped myself    Yes he says Im going to get something for them How     He sits beside her for a moment Her head has sunk into the soft double thickness of her pillows and her eyelids are drooping He thinks that beyond the puzzlement in them he can still see that terrifying blankness He hopes he is wrong Dont you remember he asks her gently No    did I fall down Fred chooses not to answer He is starting to think again Not much hes not capable of much just yet but a little Honey whats a gorg Whats an abbalah Is it a person Dont    know    Ty    Tys fine he says No    Yes he insists Perhaps hes insisting to both of the people in this pretty tastefully decorated bedroom Honeybunch you just lie there I want to get a couple of things Her eyes drift closed He thinks she will sleep but her lids struggle slowly back up to halfmast Lie right there he says No getting up and wandering around Theres been enough of that You scared poor Enid Purvis out of a years life You promise Promise    Her eyelids drift back down Fred goes into the adjoining bathroom ears alert for any movement behind him He has never seen anyone in his life who looks more boltshot than Judy does right now but mad people are clever and despite his prodigious capacity for denial in some areas Fred can no longer fool himself about his wifes current mental state Mad Actually stark raving mad Probably not But off the rails certainly Temporarily off the rails he amends as he opens the medicine cabinet He takes the bottle of Mercurochrome then scans the prescription bottles on the shelf above There arent many He grabs the one on the far left Sonata French Landing Pharmacy one capsule at bedtime do not use more than four nights in a row prescribing physician Patrick J Skarda MD Fred cant see the entire bed in the medicinecabinet mirror but he can see the foot of it    and one of Judys feet as well Still on the bed Good good He shakes out one of the Sonatas then dumps their toothbrushes out of the glass  he has no intention of going all the way downstairs for a clean glass does not want to leave her alone that long He fills the glass then goes back into the bedroom with the water the pill and the bottle of Mercurochrome Her eyes are shut She is breathing so slowly that he has to put one hand on her chest to make sure shes breathing at all He looks at the sleeping pill debates then gives her a shake Judy Jude Wake up a little hon Just long enough to take a pill okay She doesnt even mutter and Fred sets the Sonata aside It wont be necessary after all He feels some faint optimism at how fast shes fallen asleep and how deep she has gone Its as if some vile sac has popped discharged its poison left her weak and tired but possibly okay again Could that be Fred doesnt know but hes positive that she isnt just shamming sleep All of Judys current woes began with insomnia and the insomnia has been the one constant throughout Although shes only been exhibiting distressing symptoms for a couple of months  talking to herself and doing that odd and rather disgusting thing with her tongue to mention only a couple of items  she hasnt been sleeping well since January Hence the Sonata Now it seems that she has finally tipped over And is it too much to hope that when she wakes from a normal sleep shell be her old normal self again That her worries about her sons safety during the summer of the Fisherman have forced her to some sort of climax Maybe maybe not    but at least it has given Fred some time to think about what he should do next and he had better use it well One thing seems to him beyond argument if Ty is here when his mother wakes up Ty is going to have a much happier mother The immediate question is how to locate Tyler as soon as possible His first thought is to call the homes of Tys friends It would be easy those numbers are posted on the fridge printed in Judys neat backslanting hand along with the numbers of the fire department the police department including Dale Gilbertsons private number hes an old friend and French Landing Rescue But it takes Fred only a moment to realize what a bad idea this is Ebbies mother is dead and his father is an unpleasant moron  Fred met him just once and once is more than enough Fred doesnt much like his wife labeling some people lowraters Who do you think you are he asked her once Queen of the doggone Realm but in the case of Pete Wexler the shoe fits He wont have any idea of where the boys are today and wont care Mrs Metzger and Ellen Renniker might but having once been a boy on summer vacation himself  the whole world laid at your feet and at least two thousand places to go  Fred doubts it like hell Theres a chance the boys might be eating lunch its getting to be that time at the Metzgers or Rennikers but is that slight chance worth scaring the hell out of two women Because the killer will be the first thing they think of just as sure as God made little fishes    and fishermen to catch em Once more sitting on the bed beside his wife Fred feels his first real tingle of apprehension on his sons behalf and dismisses it brusquely This is no time to give in to the heebiejeebies He has to remember that his wifes mental problems and his sons safety are not linked  except in her mind His job is to present Ty front and center and all squared away thus proving her fears groundless Fred looks at the clock on his side of the bed and sees that its quarter past eleven How the time flies when youre having fun he thinks Beside him Judy utters a single gaspy snore Its a small sound really quite ladylike but Fred jumps anyway How she scared him when he first saw her in Tys room Hes still scared Ty and his friends may come here for lunch Judy says they often do because the Metzgers dont have much to eat and Mrs Renniker usually serves what the boys call goop a mystery dish consisting of noodles and some gray meat Judy makes them Campbells soup and baloney sandwiches stuff they like But Ty has money enough to treat them all to McDonalds out by the little mall on the north side or they could go into Sonnys Cruisin Restaurant a cheap diner with a cheesy fifties ambience And Ty isnt averse to treating Hes a generous boy Ill wait until lunch he murmurs completely unaware that he is talking as well as thinking Certainly he doesnt disturb Judy she has gone deep Then   Then what He doesnt know exactly He goes downstairs kicks the Mr Coffee back into gear and calls work He asks Ina to tell Ted Goltz hell be out the rest of the day  Judys sick The flu he tells her Throwing up and everything He runs down a list of people he was expecting to see that day and tells her to speak to Otto Eisman about handling them Otto will be on that like white on rice An idea occurs to him while hes talking to her and when hes done he calls the Metzgers and Rennikers after all At the Metzgers he gets an answering machine and hangs up without leaving a message Ellen Renniker however picks up on the second ring Sounding casual and cheerful  it comes naturally hes a hell of a salesman  he asks her to have Ty call home if the boys show up there for lunch Fred says he has something to tell his son making it sound like something good Ellen says she will but adds that TJ had four or five dollars burning a hole in his jeans when he left the house that morning and she doesnt expect to see him until suppertime Fred goes back upstairs and checks on Judy She hasnt moved so much as a finger and he supposes thats good No Theres nothing good about any of this Instead of receding now that the situation has stabilized  sort of  his fear seems to be intensifying Telling himself that Ty is with his friends no longer seems to help The sunny silent house is creeping him out He realizes he no longer wants Ty front and center simply for his wifes sake Where would the boys go Is there any one place   Of course there is Where they can get Magic cards That stupid incomprehensible game they play Fred Marshall hurries back downstairs grabs the phone book hunts through the Yellow Pages and calls the Eleven Like most of French Landing Fred is in the Eleven four or five times a week  a can of soda here a carton of orange juice there  and he recognizes the lilt of the Indian day clerks voice He comes up with the mans name at once Rajan Patel Its that old salesmans trick of keeping as many names as possible in the active file It sure helps here When Fred calls the man Mr Patel the day clerk immediately becomes friendly perfectly willing to help Unfortunately there isnt much help he can give Lots of boys in They are buying Magic cards also Pokmon and baseball cards Some are trading these cards outside He does recall three that came in that morning on bikes he says They bought Slurpees as well as cards and then argued about something outside Rajan Patel doesnt mention the cursing although this is chiefly why he remembers these boys After a little while he says they went on their way Fred is drinking coffee without even remembering when he poured it Fresh threads of unease are spinning spidersilky webs in his head Three boys Three It means nothing you know that dont you he tells himself He does know it and at the same time he doesnt know it He cant even believe hes caught a little of Judys freakiness like a cold germ This is just    well    freakiness for freakinesss sake He asks Patel to describe the kids and isnt too surprised when Patel cant He thinks one of them was a bit of a fat boy but hes not even sure of that Sorry but I see so many he says Fred tells him he understands He does too only all the understanding in the world wont ease his mind Three boys Not four but three Lunchtime has come but Fred is not the least bit hungry The spooky sunny silence maintains itself The spiderwebs continue to spin Not four but three If it was Tys bunch that Mr Patel saw the fattish boy was certainly Ebbie Wexler The question is who were the other two And which one was missing Which one had been stupid enough to go off on his own Tys gone Gorg fascinated him and the abbalah took him Crazy talk no doubt about it    but Freds arms nevertheless break out in a lush of goose bumps He puts his coffee mug down with a bang Hell clean up the broken glass thats what hell do Thats the next step no doubt about it The actual next step the logical next step whispers through his mind as he climbs the stairs and he immediately pushes it away Hes sure the cops are just lately overwhelmed with queries from hysterical parents who have lost track of their kids for an hour or so The last time he saw Dale Gilbertson the poor guy looked careworn and grim Fred doesnt want to be marked down as part of the problem instead of part of the solution Still    Not four but three He gets the dustpan and broom out of the little utility closet next to the laundry room and begins sweeping up broken glass When hes done he checks on Judy sees shes still sleeping more deeply than ever from the look of her and goes down to Tys room If Ty saw it like this hed be upset Hed think his mom was a lot more than a Coke short of a Happy Meal You dont have to worry about that his mind whispers He wont be seeing his room not tonight not ever Gorg fascinated him and the abbalah took him Stop it Fred tells himself Stop being an old woman But the house is too empty too silent and Fred Marshall is afraid Setting Tylers room to rights takes longer than Fred ever would have expected his wife went through it like a whirlwind How can such a little woman have such strength in her Is it the strength of the mad Perhaps but Judy doesnt need the strength of the mad When she sets her mind to something she is a formidable engine By the time hes finished cleaning up almost two hours have passed and the only obvious scar is the scratchedout rectangle of wallpaper where the Irish travel poster hung Sitting on Tys remade bed Fred finds that the longer he looks at that spot the less he can stand the white wallboard peering through as brazenly as a broken bone through outraged skin He has washed away the streaks of blood but can do nothing about the scratch marks she made with her nails Yes I can he thinks Yes I can too Tys dresser is mahogany a piece of furniture that came to them from the estate of some distant relative on Judys side Moving it really isnt a oneman job and under the circumstances that suits Fred just fine He slides a rug remnant under it to keep from marking up the floor then pulls it across the room Once its been placed against the far wall it covers most of the scratched area With the bald spot out of sight Fred feels better Saner Ty hasnt come home for lunch but Fred didnt really expect he would Hell be home by four at the latest Home for supper Take it to the bank Fred strolls back to the master bedroom massaging the small of his back as he walks Judy still hasnt moved and once again he puts an anxious hand on her chest Her breathing is slow but steady as she goes Thats all right He lies down beside her on the bed goes to loosen his tie and laughs when he feels his open collar Coat and tie both back at Goltzs Well its been a crazy day For the time being its just good to lie here in the airconditioned cool easing his aching back Moving that dresser was a bitch but hes glad he did it Certainly theres no chance hell drop off hes far too upset Besides napping in the middle of the day has never been his thing So thinking Fred falls asleep Beside him in her own sleep Judy begins to whisper Gorg    abbalah    the Crimson King And a womans name The name is Sophie IN THE READY ROOM of the French Landing PD the phone on the desk rings Bobby Dulac has been mining for nosegold Now he squashes his latest treasure on the sole of his shoe and picks up the phone Yello Police Department Officer Dulac speaking how can I help you Hey Bobby Its Danny Tcheda Bobby feels a prink of unease Danny Tcheda  last name pronounced Cheetah  is one of French Landings fourteen fulltime RMP cops Hes currently on duty and ordinary procedure dictates that duty cops radio in  thats what the R in RMP stands for after all The only exception to the rule has to do with the Fisherman Dale has mandated that patrol officers call in on a landline if they think they have a situation involving the killer Too many people have their ears on out there doubtless including Wendell Pisshead Green Danny whats up Maybe nothing maybe something not so good I got a bike and a sneaker in the trunk of my car I found em over on Queen Street Near Maxton Elder Care Bobby draws a pad toward him and begins to jot The tickle of unease has become a sinking feeling Nothing wrong with the bike Danny continues just sitting there on its kickstand but combined with the sneaker    Yeah yeah I see your point Danny but you never should have fooled with what could be evidence of a crime Please God dont let it be evidence of a crime Bobby Dulac is thinking Please God dont let it be another one Irma Freneaus mother has just been in to see Dale and while there was no screaming or shouting she came out with tears on her cheeks and looking like death on the half shell They cant still be sure the little girl has become the Fishermans third victim but  Bobby I had to Danny is saying Im ridin solo I didnt want to put this out on the air I hadda find a phone If Id left the bike there someone else coulda monkeyed with it Hell stolen it This is a good bike Schwinn threespeed Bettern the one my kids got tell you that Whats your twenty Eleven up the hill on  What I did was mark the location of the bike and the sneaker with chalk Xs on the sidewalk I handled them with gloves and put the sneaker in an evidence bag Danny is sounding more and more anxious Bobby knows how he must feel sympathizes with the choices Danny had to make Riding solo is a bitch but French Landing is already supporting as many cops  fulltime and parttime  as the budget will bear Unless of course this Fisherman business gets totally out of control in that case the town fathers will no doubt discover a bit more elastic in the budget Maybe its already out of control Bobby thinks Okay Danny Okay See your point Whether or not Dale sees it is a whole nother thing Bobby thinks Danny lowers his voice No one needs to know I broke the chain of evidence do they I mean if the subject ever came up In court or something I guess thats up to Dale Oh God Bobby thinks A new problem has just occurred to him All calls that come in on this phone are automatically taped Bobby decides the taping machinery is about to have a malfunction retroactive to about two oclock in the afternoon And you want to know the other thing Danny is asking The big thing I didnt want people to see it A bike standing all by itself that way you dont have to be Sherlock Fucking Holmes to draw a certain conclusion And folksre getting close to the panic line especially after that goddamned irresponsible story in the paper this morning I didnt want to call from Maxtons for the same reason Im gonna put you on hold You better talk to Dale In a vastly unhappy voice Danny says Oh boy In Dale Gilbertsons office there is a bulletin board dominated by enlarged photographs of Amy St Pierre and Johnny Irkenham A third photo will be added soon he fears  that of Irma Freneau Beneath the two current photos Dale sits at his desk smoking a Marlboro  Hes got the fan on It will he hopes blow the smoke away Sarah would just about kill him if she knew he was smoking again but dear Jesus Christ he needs something His interview with Tansy Freneau had been short and nothing short of purgatorial Tansy is a juicer a regular patron of the Sand Bar and during their interview the smell of coffee brandy was so strong it almost seemed to be coming out of her pores another excuse for the fan Half drunk she had been and Dale was glad It kept her calm at least It didnt put any sparkle in her dead eyes coffee brandy was no good for that but she had been calm Hideously she had even said Thank you for helping me sir before leaving Tansys ex  Irmas father  lives across the state in Green Bay Green Bay is the devils town Dales father used to say God knows why where he works in a garage and according to Tansy supports several bars with names like the End Zone and the FiftyYard Line Until today there has been some reason to believe  at least to hope  that Richard Cubby Freneau snatched his daughter An email from the Green Bay Police Department has put paid to that little idea Cubby Freneau is living with a woman who has two kids of her own and he was in jail  D  D  the day Irma disappeared There is still no body and Tansy hasnt received a letter from the Fisherman but  The door opens Bobby Dulac sticks his head in Dale mashes his cigarette out on the inside lip of the wastebasket burning the back of his hand with sparks in the process Gosh n fishes Bobby do you know how to knock Sorry Chief Bobby looks at the smoke ribboning up from the wastebasket with neither surprise nor interest Danny Tchedas on the phone I think you better take it Whats it about But he knows Why else would it be the phone Bobby only repeats not without sympathy I think you better take it The car sent by Rebecca Vilas delivers Henry to Maxton Elder Care at threethirty ninety minutes before the Strawberry Fest dance is scheduled to begin The idea is for the old folks to work up an appetite on the floor then troop down to the caff  suitably decorated for the occasion  for a glamorously late seventhirty is quite late for Maxtons dinner With wine for those who drink it A resentful Pete Wexler has been drafted by Rebecca Vilas to bring in the deejays shit Pete thinks of Henry as the blind recordhopper Said shit consists of two speakers very large one turntable light but awkward as a motherfucker to carry one preamp very heavy assorted wires all tangled up but thats the blind recordhoppers problem and four boxes of actual records which went out of style about a hundred years ago Pete guesses that the blind recordhopper never heard a CD in his whole life The last item is a suit bag on a hanger Pete has peeked in and ascertained that the suit is white Hang it in there please Henry says pointing with unerring accuracy toward the supply closet that has been designated his dressing room Okay Pete says What exactly is it if you dont mind me asking Henry smiles He knows perfectly well that Pete has already had a peep He heard the plastic bag rattling and the zipper chinking in a duet that only occurs when someone pulls the bag away from the hanger at the neck Inside that bag my friend Symphonic Stan the BigBand Man is just waiting for me to put him on and bring him to life Oh uhhuh Pete says not knowing if he has been answered or not All hes really sure of is that those records were almost as heavy as the preamp Someone should really give the blind recordhopper some information about CDs the next great leap forward You asked me one may I ask you one Be my guest Pete says There appears to have been a police presence at Maxton Elder Care this afternoon the blind recordhopper says Theyre gone now but they were here when I arrived Whats that about There hasnt been a robbery or an assault among the geriatrics I hope Pete stops in his tracks beneath a large cardboard strawberry holding the suit bag and looking at the blind recordhopper with an amazement Henry can almost touch Howd you know the cops were here Henry puts a finger to the side of his nose and tips his head to one side He replies in a hoarse conspiratorial whisper Smelled something blue Pete looks puzzled debates whether or not to inquire further and decides not to Resuming his march toward the supply closetCdressing room he says Theyre playing it cagey but I think theyre looking for another lost kid The look of amused curiosity fades from Henrys face Good Christ he says They came and went in a hurry No kids here Mr    uh Leyden Leyden Henry confirms A kid in this place would stand out like a rose in a patch of poison ivy if you know what I mean Henry doesnt consider old folks in any way analogous to poison ivy but he does indeed get Mr Wexlers drift What made them think   Someone found sumpin on the sidewalk Pete says He points out the window then realizes the blind guy cant see him pointing Duh as Ebbie would say He lowers his hand If a kid got snatched someone probably came along in a car and snatched him No kidnapers in here I can tell you that much Pete laughs at the very idea of a Maxton moldy oldie snatching any kid big enough to ride a bike The kid would probably break the guy over his knee like a dry stick No Henry says soberly that hardly seems likely does it But I guess the cops got to dot all the ts and cross all the is He pauses Thats just a little joke of mine Henry smiles politely thinking that with some people Alzheimers disease might be an actual improvement When you hang my suit up Mr Wexler would you be so good as to give it a gentle shake Just to banish any incipient wrinkles Okay Want me to take it out of the bag forya Thanks that wont be necessary Pete goes into the supply closet hangs up the suit bag and gives it a little shake Incipient just what the hell does that mean Theres a rudiment of a library here at Maxtons maybe hell look it up in the dictionary It pays to increase your word power as it says in the Readers Digest although Pete doubts it will pay him much in this job When he goes back out to the common room the blind recordhopper  Mr Leyden Symphonic Stan whoever the hell he is  has begun unraveling wires and plugging them in with a speed and accuracy Pete finds a trifle unnerving Poor old Fred Marshall is having a terrible dream Knowing its a dream should make it less horrible but somehow doesnt Hes in a rowboat with Judy out on a lake Judy is sitting in the bow They are fishing He is at least Judy is just holding her pole Her face is an expressionless blank Her skin is waxy Her eyes have a stunned hammered look He labors with increasing desperation to make contact with her trying one conversational gambit after another None work To make what is under the circumstances a fairly apt metaphor she spits every lure He sees that her empty eyes appear fixed on the creel sitting between them in the bottom of the boat Blood is oozing through the wickerwork in fat red dribbles Its nothing just fishblood he tries to assure her but she makes no reply In fact Fred isnt so sure himself Hes thinking he ought to take a look inside the creel just to be sure when his pole gives a tremendous jerk  if not for quick reflexes he would have lost it over the side Hes hooked a big one Fred reels it in the fish on the other end of the line fighting him for every foot Then when he finally gets it near the boat he realizes he has no net Hell with it he thinks go for broke He whips the pole backward just daring the line to snap and the fish  biggest goddamned lake trout youd ever hope to see  flies out of the water and through the air in a gleaming finflipping arc It lands in the bottom of the boat beside the oozing creel in fact and begins thrashing It also begins to make gruesome choking noises Fred has never heard a fish make noises like that He bends forward and is horrified to see that the trout has Tylers face His son has somehow become a weretrout and now hes dying in the bottom of the boat Strangling Fred grabs at it wanting to remove the hook and throw it back while theres still time but the terrible choking thing keeps slipping through his fingers leaving only a shiny slime of scales behind It would be tough to get the hook out in any case The Tyfish has swallowed it whole and the barbed tip is actually protruding from one of the gills just below the point where the human face melts away Tys choking becomes louder harsher infinitely more horrible  Fred sits up with a low cry feeling as if hes choking himself For a moment hes completely adrift as to place and time  lost in the slippage we might say  and then he realizes hes in his own bedroom sitting up on his side of the bed he shares with Judy He notices that the light in here is much dimmer because the sun has moved to the other side of the house My God he thinks how long have I been asleep How could I  Oh but here is another thing that hideous choking sound has followed him out of his dream Its louder than ever It will wake Judy scare her  Judy is no longer on the bed though Jude Judy Shes sitting in the corner Her eyes are wide and blank just as they were in his dream A corsage of crumpled paper is protruding from her mouth Her throat is grotesquely swelled looks to Fred like a sausage that has been grilled until the casing is ready to pop More paper he thinks Christ shes choking on it Fred rolls himself across the bed falls off and lands on his knees like a gymnast doing a trick He reaches for her She makes no move to evade him Theres that at least And although shes choking he still sees no expression in her eyes They are dusty zeros Fred yanks the corsage of paper from her mouth Theres another behind it Fred reaches between her teeth tweezes this second ball of paper between the first two fingers of his right hand thinking Please dont bite me Judy please dont and pulls it out too Theres a third ball of paper behind this one way at the back of her mouth He gets hold of this one as well and extracts it Although its crumpled he can see the printed words GREAT IDEA and knows what shes swallowed sheets of paper from the notepad Ty gave her for her birthday Shes still choking Her skin is turning slate Fred grabs her by her upper arms and pulls her up She comes easily but when he relaxes his hold her knees bend and she starts to go back down Shes turned into Raggedy Ann The choking sound continues Her sausage throat  Help me Judy Help me you bitch Unaware of what he is saying He yanks her hard  as hard as he yanked the fishing pole in his dream  and spins her around like a ballerina when she comes up on her toes Then he seizes her in a bear hug his wrists brushing the undersides of her breasts her bottom tight against his crotch the kind of position he would find extremely sexy if his wife didnt happen to be choking to death He pops his thumb up between her breasts like a hitchhiker then says the magic word as he pulls sharply upward and backward The magic word is Heimlich and it works Two more wads of paper fly from Judys mouth propelled by a jet of vomit that is little more than bile  her intake of food over the last twelve hours amounts to three cups of coffee and a cranberry muffin She gives a gasp coughs twice then begins to breathe more or less normally He puts her on the bed    drops her on the bed His lower back is spasming wildly and its really no wonder first Tys dresser now this Well what did you think you were doing he asks her loudly What in the name of Christ did you think you were doing He realizes that he has raised one hand over Judys upturned face as if to strike her Part of him wants to strike her He loves her but at this moment he also hates her He has imagined plenty of bad things over the years theyve been married  Judy getting cancer Judy paralyzed in an accident Judy first taking a lover and then demanding a divorce  but he has never imagined Judy going chickenshit on him and isnt that what this amounts to What did you think you were doing She looks at him without fear    but without anything else either Her eyes are dead Her husband lowers his hand thinking Id cut it off before I hit you I might be pissed at you I am pissed at you but Id cut it off before I did that Judy rolls over facedown on the coverlet her hair spread around her head in a corona Judy Nothing She just lies there Fred looks at her for a moment then uncrumples one of the slimy balls of paper with which she has tried to strangle herself It is covered with tangles of scribbled words Gorg abbalah eeleelee munshun bas lum opopanax these mean nothing to him Others  drudge asswipe black red Chicago and Ty  are actual words but have no context Printed up one side of the sheet is IF YOUVE GOT PRINCE ALBERT IN A CAN HOW CAN YOU EVER GET HIM OUT Up the other like a teletype stuck in repeat mode is this BLACK HOUSE CRIMSON KING BLACK HOUSE CRIMSON KING BLACK If you waste time looking for sense in this youre as crazy as she is Fred thinks You cant waste time  Time He looks at the clock on his side of the bed and cannot believe its news  PM Is that possible He looks at his watch and sees that it is Knowing its foolish knowing he would have heard his son come in even if in a deep sleep Fred strides to the door on big nerveless legs Ty he yells Hey Ty TYLER Waiting for an answer that will not come Fred realizes that everything in his life has changed quite possibly forever People tell you this can happen  in the blink of an eye they say before you know it they say  but you dont believe it Then a wind comes Go down to Tys room Check Be sure Ty isnt there  Fred knows this  but he does it just the same The room is empty as he knew it would be And it looks oddly distorted almost sinister with the dresser now on the other side Judy You left her alone you idiot Shell be chewing paper again by now theyre clever mad people are clever  Fred dashes back down to the master bedroom and exhales a sigh of relief when he sees Judy lying just as he left her facedown hair spread around her head He discovers that his worries about his mad wife are now secondary to his worries about his missing son Hell be home by four at the latest    take it to the bank So he had thought But four has come and gone A strong wind has arisen and blown the bank away Fred walks to his side of the bed and sits down beside his wifes splayed right leg He picks up the phone and punches in a number Its an easy number only three digits Yello Police Department Officer Dulac speaking youve dialed  do you have an emergency Officer Dulac this is Fred Marshall Id like to speak to Dale if hes still there Fred is pretty sure Dale is He works late most nights especially since  He pushes the rest away but inside his head the wind blows harder Louder Gee Mr Marshall hes here but hes in a meeting and I dont think I can   Get him Mr Marshall youre not hearing me Hes in with two guys from the WSP and one from the FBI If you could just tell me   Fred closes his eyes Its interesting isnt it Something interesting here He called in on the  line but the idiot on the other end seems to have forgotten that Why Because its someone he knows Its good old Fred Marshall bought a Deere lawn tractor from him just the year before last Must have dialed  because it was easier than looking up the regular number Because no one Bobby knows can actually have an emergency Fred remembers having a similar idea himself that morning  a different Fred Marshall one who believed that the Fisherman could never touch his son Not his son Tys goneGorg fascinated him and the abbalah took him Hello Mr Marshall Fred Are you still   Listen to me Fred says his eyes still closed Down at Goltzs he would be calling the man on the other end Bobby by now but Goltzs has never seemed so far away Goltzs is in the starsystem Opopanax on Planet Abbalah Listen to me carefully Write it down if you have to My wife has gone mad and my son is missing Do you understand those things Wife mad Son missing Now put me through to the chief But Bobby Dulac doesnt not right away He has made a deduction A more diplomatic police officer  Jack Sawyer as he was in his salad days for instance would have kept said deduction to himself but Bobby cant do that Bobby has hooked a big one Mr Marshall Fred Your son doesnt own a Schwinn does he Threespeed Schwinn red Got a novelty license plate that reads    uh    BIG MAC Fred cannot answer For several long and terrible moments he cannot even draw a breath Between his ears the wind blows both louder and harder Now its a hurricane Gorg fascinated him    the abbalah took him At last just when it seems he will begin to strangle himself his chest unlocks and he takes in a huge tearing breath PUT CHIEF GILBERTSONONDOITNOWYOUMOTHERFUCKER Although he shrieks this at the top of his lungs the woman lying facedown on the coverlet beside him never moves There is a click Hes on hold Not for long but its long enough for him to see the scratched bald place on his missing sons bedroom wall the swelled column of his mad wifes throat and blood dribbling through the creel in his dream His back spasms cruelly and Fred welcomes the pain Its like getting a telegram from the real world Then Dale is on the phone Dale is asking him whats wrong and Fred Marshall begins to cry GOD MAY KNOW where Henry Leyden found that astounding suit but we certainly do not A costume shop No it is too elegant to be a costume this is the real thing not an imitation But what sort of real thing is it The wide lapels sweep down to an inch below the waist and the twin flaps of the swallowtail reach nearly to the ankles of the billowing pleated trousers which seem beneath the snowfield expanse of the doublebreasted waistcoat to ride nearly at the level of the sternum On Henrys feet white highbutton spats adorn white patentleather shoes about his neck a stiff high collar turns its pointed peaks over a wide flowing white satin bow tie perfectly knotted The total effect is of oldfashioned diplomatic finery harmoniously wedded to a zoot suit the raffishness of the ensemble outweighs its formality but the dignity of the swallowtail and the waistcoat contribute to the whole a regal quality of a specific kind the regality often seen in African American entertainers and musicians Escorting Henry to the common room while surly Pete Wexler comes along behind pushing a handcart loaded with boxes of records Rebecca Vilas dimly remembers having seen Duke Ellington wearing a white cutaway like this in a clip from some old film    or was it Cab Calloway She recalls an upraised eyebrow a glittering smile a seductive face an upright figure posed before a band but little more If alive either Mr Ellington or Mr Calloway could have informed Rebecca that Henrys outfit including the highdrape pants with a reet pleat terms not in her vocabulary had undoubtedly been handmade by one of four specific tailors located in the black neighborhoods of New York Washington DC Philadelphia or Los Angeles masters of their trade during the thirties and forties underground tailors men now alas as dead as their celebrated clients Henry Leyden knows exactly who tailored his outfit where it came from and how it fell into his hands but when it comes to persons such as Rebecca Vilas Henry imparts no more information than is already likely to be known In the corridor leading to the common room the white cutaway appears to shine from within an impression only increased by Henrys oversized daddycool dark glasses with bamboo frames in which what may be tiny sapphires wink at the corners of the bows Is there maybe some shop that sells Spiffy Clothes of Great s Bandleaders Does some museum inherit this stuff and auction it off  Rebecca cannot contain her curiosity a moment longer Mr Leyden where did you get that beautiful outfit From the rear and taking care to sound as though he is muttering to himself Pete Wexler opines that obtaining an outfit like that probably requires chasing a person of an ethnicity beginning with the letter n for at least a couple of miles Henry ignores Pete and smiles Its all a matter of knowing where to look Guess you never heard of CDs Pete says Theyre like this big new breakthrough Shut up and tote them bales me bucko says Ms Vilas Were almost there Rebecca my dear if I may Henry says Mr Wexler has every right to grouse After all theres no way he could know that I own about three thousand CDs is there And if the man who originally owned these clothes can be called a nigger Id be proud to call myself one too That would be an incredible honor I wish I could claim it Henry has come to a halt Each in a different way shocked by his use of the forbidden word Pete and Rebecca have also stopped moving And Henry says we owe respect to those who assist us in the performance of our duties I asked Mr Wexler to shake out my suit when he hung it up and he very kindly obliged me Yeah Pete says Plus I also hung up your light and put your turntable and speakers and shit right where you want em Thank you very much Mr Wexler Henry says I appreciate your efforts in my behalf Well shit Pete says I was only doing my job you know But anything you want after youre done Ill give you a hand Without benefit of a flash of panties or a glimpse of ass Pete Wexler has been completely disarmed Rebecca finds this amazing All in all sightless or not Henry Leyden it comes to her is far and away the coolest human being she has ever been privileged to encounter in her entire twentysix years on the face of the earth Never mind his clothes  where did guys like this come from Do you really think some little boy vanished from the sidewalk out in front of here this afternoon Henry asks What Rebecca asks Seems like it to me Pete says What Rebecca asks again this time to Pete Wexler not Henry What are you saying Well he ast me and I tol him Pete says Thats all Simmering dangerously Rebecca takes a stride toward him This happened on our sidewalk Another kid in front of our building And you didnt say anything to me or Mr Maxton There wasnt nothin to say Pete offers in selfdefense Maybe you could tell us what actually happened Henry says Sure What happened was I went outside for a smoke see This is less than strictly truthful Faced with the choice of walking ten yards to the Daisy corridor mens room to flush his cigarette down a toilet or walking ten feet to the entrance and pitching it into the parking lot Pete had sensibly elected outdoor disposal So I get outside and thats when I saw it This police car parked right out there So I walked up to the hedge and theres this cop a young guy I think his name is Cheetah or something like that and hes loadin this bike like a kids bike into his trunk And something else too only I couldnt see what it was except it was small And after he did that he got a piece a chalk outta his glove compartment and he came back and made like X marks on the sidewalk Did you talk to him Rebecca asks Did you ask him what he was doing Miz Vilas I dont talk to cops unless its like you got no other choice know what I mean Cheetah he never even saw me The guy wouldnt of said nothing anyhow He had this expression on his face  it was like Jeez I hope I get to the crapper before I drop a load in my pants that kind of expression Then he just drove away Just like that Twenty minutes later two other cops showed up Rebecca raises both hands closes her eyes and presses her fingertips to her forehead giving Pete Wexler an excellent opportunity of which he does not fail to take full advantage to admire the shape of her breasts underneath her blouse It may not be as great as the view from the bottom of the ladder but itll do all right yes it will As far as Ebbies dad is concerned a sight like Rebecca Vilass Hottentots pushing out against her dress is like a good fire on a cold night They are bigger than youd expect on a slender little thing like her and you know what When the arms go up the Hottentots go up too Hey if he had known she was going to put on a show like this he would have told her about Cheetah and the bicycle as soon as it happened All right okay she says still flattening the tips of her fingers against her head She lifts her chin raising her arms another few inches and frowns in concentration for a moment looking like a figure on a plinth Hooray and hallelujah Pete thinks Theres a bright side to everything If another little snotnose gets grabbed off the sidewalk tomorrow morning it wont be soon enough for me Rebecca says Okay okay okay opens her eyes and lowers her arms Pete Wexler is staring firmly at a point over her shoulder his face blank with a false innocence she immediately comprehends Good God what a caveman Its not as bad as I thought In the first place all you saw was a policeman picking up a bike Maybe it was stolen Maybe some other kid borrowed the bike dumped it and ran away The cop could have been looking for it Or the kid who owned the bike could have been hit by a car or something And even if the worst did happen I dont see any way that it could hurt us Maxtons isnt responsible for whatever goes on outside the grounds She turns to Henry who looks as though he wishes he were a hundred miles away Sorry I know that sounded awfully cold Im as distressed about this Fisherman business as everyone else what with those two poor kids and the missing girl Were all so upset we can hardly think straight But Id hate to see us dragged into the mess dont you see I see perfectly Henry says Being one of those blind men George Rathbun is always yelling about Hah Pete Wexler barks And you agree with me dont you Im a gentleman I agree with everybody Henry says I agree with Pete that another child may well have been abducted by our local monster Officer Cheetah or whatever his name is sounded too anxious to be just picking up a lost bicycle And I agree with you that Maxtons cannot be blamed for anything that happened Good Rebecca says Unless of course someone here is involved in the murders of these children But thats impossible Rebecca says Most of our male clients cant even remember their own names A tenyearold girl could take most of these feebs Pete says Even the ones who dont have oldtimers disease walk around covered in their own    you know Youre forgetting about the staff Henry says Oh now Rebecca says momentarily rendered nearly wordless Come on Thats    thats a totally irresponsible thing to say True It is But if this goes on nobody will be above suspicion Thats my point Pete Wexler feels a sudden chill  if the town clowns start grilling Maxtons residents his private amusements might come to light and wouldnt Wendell Green have a field day with that stuff  A gleaming new idea comes to him and he brings it forth hoping to impress Miz Vilas You know what The cops should talk to that California guy the bigtime detective who nailed that Kinderling asshole twothree years ago He lives around here somewhere dont he Someone like that hes the guy we need on this The cops here theyre way outta their depth That guy hes like a whaddayacallit a goddamn resource Odd you should say that Henry says I couldnt agree with you more It is about time Jack Sawyer did his thing Ill work on him again You know him Rebecca asks Oh yes Henry says That I do But isnt it about time for me to do my own thing Soon Theyre all still outside Rebecca leads him down the rest of the corridor and into the common room where all three of them move across to the big platform Henrys microphone stands beside a table mounted with his speakers and turntable With unnerving accuracy Henry says Lot of space in here You can tell that she asks Piece of cake Henry says We must be getting close now Its right in front of you Do you need any help Henry extends one foot and taps the side of the flat He glides a hand down the edge of the table locates the mike stand says Not at the moment darlin and steps neatly up onto the platform Guided by touch he moves to the back of the table and locates the turntable All is copacetic he says Pete would you please put the record boxes on the table The one on top goes here and the other one right next to it Whats he like your friend Jack Rebecca asks An orphan of the storm A pussycat but an extremely difficult pussycat I have to say he can be a real pain in the bunghole Crowd noises a buzz of conversation interlaced with childrens voices and songs thumped out on an old upright piano have been audible through the windows since they entered the room and when Pete has placed the record boxes on the table he says I better get out there cuz Chippers probly lookin for me Gonna be a shitload of cleanup once they come inside Pete shambles out rolling the handcart before him Rebecca asks if there is anything more Henry would like her to do for him The overhead lights are on arent they Please turn them off and wait for the first wave to come in Then switch on the pink spot and prepare to jitterbug your heart out You want me to turn off the lights Youll see Rebecca moves back across to the door turns off the overhead lights and does see just as Henry had promised A soft dim illumination from the rank of windows hovers in the air replacing the former brightness and harshness with a vague mellow haze as if the room lay behind a scrim That pink spotlight is going to look pretty good in here Rebecca thinks Outside on the lawn the predance wingding is winding down Lots of old men and women are busily polishing off their strawberry shortcakes and soda pop at the picnic tables and the pianoplaying gent in the straw boater and red sleeve garters comes to the end of Heart and Soul ba bump ba bump ba ba bump bump bump no finesse but plenty of volume closes the lid of the upright and stands up to a scattering of applause Grandchildren who had earlier complained about having to come to the great fest dodge through the tables and wheelchairs evading their parents glances and hoping to wheedle a last balloon from the balloon lady in the clown suit and frizzy red wig oh joy unbounded Alice Weathers applauds the piano player as well she might forty years ago he reluctantly absorbed the rudiments of pianism at her hands just well enough to pick up a few bucks at occasions like this when not obliged to perform his usual function that of selling sweatshirts and baseball caps on Chase Street Charles Burnside who having been scrubbed clean by goodhearted Butch Yerxa decked himself out in an old white shirt and a pair of loose filthy trousers stands slightly apart from the throng in the shade of a large oak not applauding but sneering The unbuttoned collar of the shirt droops around his ropy neck Now and then he wipes his mouth or picks his teeth with a ragged thumbnail but mainly he does not move at all He looks as though someone plunked him down by the side of a road and drove off Whenever the careering grandkids swerve near Burny they instantly veer away as if repelled by a force field Between Alice and Burny threefourths of the residents of Maxtons belly up to the tables stump around on their walkers sit beneath the trees occupy their wheelchairs hobble here and there  yakking dozing chuckling farting dabbing at fresh strawberrycolored stains on their clothing staring at their relatives staring at their trembling hands staring at nothing Half a dozen of the most vacant among them wear conical party hats of hard flat red and hard flat blue the shades of enforced gaiety The women from the kitchen have begun to circulate through the tables with big black garbage bags for soon they must retire to their domain to prepare the evenings great feast of potato salad mashed potatoes creamed potatoes baked beans JellO salad marshmallow salad and whippedcream salad plus of course more mighty strawberry shortcake The undisputed and hereditary sovereign of this realm Chipper Maxton whose disposition generally resembles that of a skunk trapped in a muddy hole has spent the previous ninety minutes ambling about smiling and shaking hands and he has had enough Pete he growls what the hell took you so long Start racking up the folding chairs okay And help shift these people into the common room Lets get a goddamn move on here Wagons west Pete scurries off and Chipper claps his hands twice loudly then raises his outstretched arms Hey everybody he bellows can you truly believe what a goldurn gorgeous day the good Lord gave us for this beautiful event Isnt this something Half a dozen feeble voices rise in agreement Come on people you can do better than that I want to hear it for this wonderful day this wonderful time were all having and for all the wonderful help and assistance given us by our volunteers and staff A slightly more exuberant clamor rewards his efforts All right Hey you know what As George Rathbun would say even a blind man could see what a great time were all having I know I am and were not done yet We got the greatest deejay you ever heard a fellow called Symphonic Stan the BigBand Man waiting to put on a great great show in the common room music and dancing right up to the big Strawberry Fest dinner and we got him cheap too  but dont tell him I said that So friends and family its time to say your goodbyes and let your loved ones cut a rug to the golden oldies just like them ha ha Golden oldies one and all thats all of us here at Maxtons Even Im not as young as I used to be ha ha so I might take a spin across the floor with some lucky lady Seriously folks its time for us to put on our dancing shoes Please kiss Dad or Mom Granddad or Grandma goodbye and on your way out you may wish to leave a contribution toward our expenses in the basket on top of Ragtime Willies piano right over here ten dollars five dollars anything you can spare helps us cover the costs of giving your mom your dad a bright bright day We do it out of love but half of that love is your love And in what may seem to us a surprisingly short amount of time but does not to Chipper Maxton who understands that very few people wish to linger in an eldercare facility any longer than they must the relatives bestow their final hugs and kisses round up the exhausted kiddies and file down the paths and over the grass into the parking lot along the way a good number depositing bills in the basket atop Ragtime Willies upright piano No sooner does this exodus begin than Pete Wexler and Chipper Maxton set about persuading with all the art available to them the oldsters back into the building Chipper says things like Now dont you know how much we all want to see you trip the light fantastic Mrs Syverson while Pete takes the more direct approach of Move along bud time to stir your stumps but both men employ the techniques of subtle and notsosubtle nudges pushes elbow grasping and wheelchair rolling to get their doddering charges through the door At her post Rebecca Vilas watches the residents enter the hazy common room some of them traveling at a rate a touch too brisk for their own good Henry Leyden stands motionless behind his boxes of LPs His suit shimmers his head is merely a dark silhouette before the windows For once too busy to ogle Rebeccas chest Pete Wexler moves past with one hand on the elbow of Elmer Jesperson deposits him eight feet inside the room and whirls around to locate Thorvald Thorvaldson Elmers dearest enemy and fellow inhabitant of D Alice Weathers wafts in under her own guidance and folds her hands beneath her chin waiting for the music to begin Tall scrawny hollowcheeked at the center of an empty space that is his alone Charles Burnside slides through the door and quickly moves a good distance off to the side When his dead eyes indifferently meet hers Rebecca shivers The next pair of eyes to meet hers belong to Chipper who pushes Flora Flostads wheelchair as if it held a crate of oranges and gives her an impatient glare completely at odds with the easy smile on his face Time is money you bet but money is money too lets get this show on the road pronto The first wave Henry had told her  is that what they have here the first wave She glances across the room wondering how to ask and sees that the question has already been answered for as soon as she looks up Henry flashes her the okay sign Rebecca flips the switch for the pink spot and nearly everybody in the room including a number of old parties who had appeared well beyond response of any kind utters a soft aaah His suit his shirt his spats blazing in the cone of light a transformed Henry Leyden glides and dips toward the microphone as a twelveinch LP seemingly magicked out of the air twirls like a top on the palm of his right hand His teeth shine his sleek hair gleams the sapphires wink from the bows of his enchanted sunglasses Henry seems almost to be dancing himself with his sweet clever sidestepping glide    only he is no longer Henry Leyden no way Renee as George Rathbun likes to roar The suit the spats the slickedback hair the shades even the wondrously effective pink spot are mere stage dressing The real magic here is Henry that uniquely malleable creature When he is George Rathbun he is all George Ditto the Wisconsin Rat ditto Henry Shake It has been eighteen months since he took Symphonic Stan from the closet and fit into him like a hand into a glove to dazzle the crowd at a Madison VFW record hop but the clothes still fit oh yes they fit and he fits within them a hipster reborn whole into a past he never saw firsthand On his extended palm the spinning LP resembles a solid unmoving black beachball Whenever Symphonic Stan puts on a hop he always begins with In the Mood Although he does not detest Glenn Miller as some jazz aficionados do over the years he has grown tired of this number But it always does the job Even if the customers have no choice but to dance with one foot in the grave and the other on the proverbial banana peel they do dance Besides he knows that after Miller was drafted he told the arranger Billy May of his plan to come out of this war as some kind of hero and hell he was as good as his word wasnt he Henry reaches the mike and slips the revolving record onto the platter with a negligent gesture of his right hand The crowd applauds him with an exhaled oooh Welcome welcome all you hepcats and hepkitties Henry says The words emerge from the speakers wrapped in the smooth slightly aboveitall voice of a true broadcaster in  or  one of the men who did live remotes from dance halls and nightclubs located from Boston to Catalina Honey poured through their throats these muses of the night and they never missed a beat Say tell me this you gates and gators can you think of a better way to kick off a swingin soiree than with Glenn Miller Come on brothers and sisters give me yeahhh From the residents of Maxtons  some of whom are already out on the floor others wheelchairbound on its edges in various postures of confusion or vacuity  comes a whispery response less a party cry than the rustle of an autumn wind through bare branches Symphonic Stan grins like a shark and holds up his hands as if to still a hoppedup multitude then twirls and spins like a Savoy Ballroom dancer inspired by Chick Webb His coattails spread like wings his sparkling feet fly and land and fly again The moment evaporates and two black beachballs appear on the deejays palms one of them spinning back into its sleeve the other down to meet the needle Allreety allrighty allrooty you hoppin hens and boppin bunnies here comes the Sentimental Gentleman Mr Tommy Dorsey so get off your money and grab your honey while vocalist Dick Haymes the pride of Buenos Aires Argentina asks the musical question How Am I to Know You Frank Sinatra hasnt entered the building yet brethren and sistren but life is still fine as mmmmmm wine Rebecca Vilas cannot believe what she is seeing This guy is getting just about everyone out onto the floor even some of the wheelchair cases who are dipping and swirling with the best of them Dolled up in his exotic astonishing outfit Symphonic Stan  Henry Leyden she reminds herself  is corny and breathtaking absurd and convincing all at once Hes like    some kind of time capsule locked into both his role and what these old people want to hear He has charmed them back into life back into whatever youth they had left in them Unbelievable No other word will do People she had written off as shuffling basket cases are blooming right in front of her As for Symphonic Stan hes carrying on like an elegant dervish making her think of words like suave polished urbane unhinged sexy graceful words that do not connect except in him And that thing he does with the records How is that possible She does not realize that she is tapping her foot and swaying in time to the music until Henry puts on Artie Shaws Begin the Beguine when she literally begins her own beguine by starting to dance by herself Henrys hepcat jivedance the sight of so many whitehaired bluehaired and baldheaded people gliding around the floor Alice Weathers beaming happily in the arms of none other than gloomy Thorvald Thorvaldson Ada Meyerhoff and Tom Tom Boettcher twirling around each other in their wheelchairs the sweeping pulse of the music driving everything beneath the molten radiance of Artie Shaws clarinet all of these things abruptly magically coalesce into a vision of earthly beauty that brings tears stinging to her eyes Smiling she raises her arms spins and finds herself expertly grasped by Tom Toms twin brother eightysixyearold Hermie Boettcher the retired geography teacher in A formerly considered something of a stick who without a word foxtrots her right out to the middle of the floor Shame to see a pretty girl dancing all on her lonesome Hermie says Hermie Id follow you anywhere she tells him Lets us get closer to the bandstand he says I want a better look at that hotshot in the fancy suit They say hes blind as a bat but I dont believe it His hand planted firmly at the base of her spine his hips swerving in time to Artie Shaw Hermie guides her to within a foot of the platform where the Symphonic One is already doing his trick with a new record as he waits for the last bar of the present one Rebecca could swear that StanHenry not only senses her presence before him but actually winks at her But that is truly impossible    isnt it The Symphonic One twirls the Shaw record into its sleeve the new one onto the platter and says Can you say Vout Can you say Solid Now that were all limbered up lets get jumpin and jivin with Woody Herman and Wild Root This tune is dedicated to all you beautiful ladies especially the lady wearing Calyx Rebecca laughs and says Oh dear He could smell her perfume he recognized it Undaunted by the steamy tempo of Wild Root Hermie Boettcher slides into a back step extends his arm and spins Rebecca around On the first beat of the next bar he catches her in his arms and reverses direction spinning them both toward the far end of the platform where Alice Weathers stands next to Mr Thorvaldson gazing up at Symphonic Stan The special lady must be you Hermie says Because that perfume of yours is worth a dedication Rebecca asks Whered you learn to dance like this My brother and I we were town boys Learned how to dance in front of the jukebox at Alouettes over by Arden Rebecca knows Alouettes on Ardens Main Street but what was once a soda fountain is now a lunch counter and the jukebox disappeared around the time Johnny Mathis dropped off the charts You want a good dancer you find yourself a town boy Tom Tom now he was always the slickest dancer around and you can plunk him in that chair but you cant take away his rhythm Mr Stan yoohoo Mr Stan Alice Weathers has tilted her head and cupped her hands around her mouth Do you take requests A voice as flat and hard as the sound of two stones grinding together says I was here first old woman This implacable rudeness brings Rebecca to a halt Hermies right foot comes gently down atop her left then swiftly moves off doing her no more injury than a kiss Towering over Alice Charles Burnside glares at Thorvald Thorvaldson Thorvaldson steps back and tugs at Alices hand Certainly my dear says Stan bending down Tell me your name and what youd like to hear I am Alice Weathers and   I was here first Burny loudly repeats Rebecca glances at Hermie who shakes his head and makes a sour face Town boy or not he is as intimidated as Mr Thorvaldson  Moonglow please By Benny Goodman Its my turn you jackass I want that Woody Herman number called Lady Magowans Nightmare That ones good Hermie leans toward Rebeccas ear Nobody likes that fella but he gets his own way Not this time Rebecca says Mr Burnside I want you to   Symphonic Stan silences her with a wave of his hand He turns to face the owner of the remarkably unpleasant voice No can do mister The song is called Lady Magowans Dream and I didnt bring that snappy little item with me this afternoon sorry Okay bud how about I Cant Get Started the one Bunny Berigan did Oh I love that Alice says Yes play I Cant Get Started  Happy to oblige Stan says in Henry Leydens normal voice Without bothering to jive around or spin the records on his hands he simply exchanges the LP on the turntable for one from the first box He seems oddly wilted as he steps to the mike and says Ive flown around the world on a plane I settled revolutions in Spain Cant get started Dedicated to the lovely Alice Blue Gown and the One Who Walks by Night Youre no bettern a monkey on a stick says Burny The music begins Rebecca taps Hermie on the arm and moves up alongside Charles Burnside for whom she has never felt anything but mild revulsion Now that she has him in focus her outrage and disgust cause her to say Mr Burnside you are going to apologize to Alice and to our guest here Youre a crude obnoxious bully and after you apologize I want you to get back into your room where you belong Her words have no effect Burnsides shoulders have slumped He has a wide sloppy grin on his face and he is staring emptyeyed at nothing in particular He looks too far gone to remember his own name much less Bunny Berigans In any case Alice Weathers has danced away and Symphonic Stan back at the far end of the platform and out of the pink spot appears to be deep in thought The elderly couples sway back and forth on the dance floor Off to the side Hermie Boettcher pantomimes dancing and quizzes her with a look Im sorry about that she says to StanHenry No need to apologize I Cant Get Started was my wifes favorite record Ive been thinking about her a lot the past few days Sort of took me by surprise He runs a hand over his sleek hair and shakes out his arms visibly getting back into his role Rebecca decides to leave him alone In fact she wants to leave everyone alone for a little while Signaling regret and the press of duty to Hermie she makes her way through the crowd and exits the common room Somehow old Burny has beaten her to the corridor He shuffles absently toward Daisy wing head drooping feet scuffing the floor Mr Burnside she says your act may fool everyone else but I want you to know that it doesnt fool me Moving by increments the old man turns around First one foot shifts then a knee the spavined waist the second foot finally the cadaverous trunk The ugly bloom of Burnys head droops on its thin stalk offering Rebecca a view of his mottled scalp His long nose protrudes like a warped rudder With the same dreadful slowness his head lifts to reveal muddy eyes and a slack mouth A flash of sheer vindictiveness rises into the dull eyes and the dead lips writhe Frightened Rebecca takes an instinctive step backward Burnys mouth has moved all the way into a horrible grin Rebecca wants to escape but anger at having been humiliated by this miserable jerk lets her hold her ground Lady Magowan had a bad bad nightmare Burny informs her He sounds drugged or half asleep And Lady Sophie had a nightmare Only hers was worse He giggles The king was in his countinghouse counting out his honeys Thats what Sophie saw when she fell asleep His giggling rises in pitch and he says something that might be Mr Munching His lips flap revealing yellow irregular teeth and his sunken face undergoes a subtle change A new kind of intelligence seems to sharpen his features Does you know Mr Munshun Mr Munshun and his lil friend Gorg Does you know what happened in Chicago Stop this right now Mr Burnside Duz you know uff Fridz Haarman him who wazz zo loffly Dey called him dey called him dey called him da Vamp Vamp Vamp of Hanover yez dey dud dud dud Evveybuddy evveybuddy evveybuddy haz godz nidemarez all da dime dime dime ha ha ho ho Stop talking like that Rebecca shoutsYoure not fooling me For a moment the new intelligence flares within Burnys dim eyes It almost instantly retreats He licks his lips and says Waygup BurnBurn Whatever Rebecca says Dinner is downstairs at seven if you want it Go take a nap or something will you Burny gives her a peeved murky look and plops a foot down on the floor beginning the tedious process that will turn him around again You could write it down Fritz Haarman In Hanover His mouth twists into a smile of unsettling slyness When the king comes here maybe we can dance together No thanks Rebecca turns her back on the old horror and clacks down the hallway on her high heels uncomfortably aware of his eyes following her Rebeccas nice little Coach handbag lies flat on her desk in the windowless vestibule to Chippers office Before going in she pauses to rip off a sheet of notepaper write down Fritz Harmann Hanover and slip the paper into the bags central compartment It might be nothing  it probably is  but who knows She is furious that she let Burnside frighten her and if she can find a way to use his nonsense against him she will do her best to expel him from Maxtons Kiddo is that you Chipper calls out No its Lady Magowan and her freakin nightmare She strides into Chippers office and finds him behind his desk happily counting out the bills contributed that afternoon by the sons and daughters of his clientele My lil Becky looks all ticked off he says What happened one of our zombies stomp on your foot Dont call me Becky Hey hey cheer up You wont believe how much your silvertongued boyfriend conned out of the relatives today A hundred and twentysix smackers Free money Okay what went wrong anyhow Charles Burnside spooked me thats what He ought to be in a mental hospital Are you kidding That particular zombie is worth his weight in gold As long as Charles Burnside can draw breath into his body he will always have a place in my heart Grinning he brandishes a handful of bills And if you have a place in my heart honeybaby youll always have a place at Maxtons The memory of Burnside saying The king was in his countinghouse counting out his honeys makes her feel unclean If Chipper were not grinning in that exultant looselipped way Rebecca supposes he would not remind her so unpleasantly of his favorite resident Evveybuddy haz godz nidemarez all da dime dime dime  that wasnt a bad description of the Fishermans French Landing Funny you wouldnt think Old Burny would take more notice of those murders than Chipper Rebecca had never heard him mention the Fishermans crimes apart from the time he groused that he would not be able to tell anyone he was going fishing until Dale Gilbertson finally got off his big fat butt and what kind of crappy deal was that TWO TELEPHONE CALLS and another private matter one he is doing his best to deny have conspired to pluck Jack Sawyer from his cocoon in Norway Valley and put him on the road to French Landing Sumner Street and the police station The first call had been from Henry and Henry calling from the Maxton cafeteria during one of the Symphonic Ones breaks had insisted on speaking his mind A child had apparently been abducted from the sidewalk in front of Maxtons earlier that day Whatever Jacks reasons for staying out of the case which by the way he had never explained they didnt count anymore sorry This made four children who had been lost to the Fisherman because Jack didnt really think Irma Freneau was going to walk in her front door anytime soon did he Four children  No Henry had said I didnt hear about it on the radio It happened this morning  From a janitor at Maxtons Henry had said He saw a worriedlooking cop pick up a bicycle and put it in his trunk  All right Henry had said maybe I dont know for certain but I am certain By tonight Dale will identify the poor kid and tomorrow his name will be all over the newspaper And then this whole county is going to flip out Dont you get it Just knowing you are involved will do a lot to keep people calm You no longer have the luxury of retirement Jack You have to do your part Jack had told him he was jumping to conclusions and that they would talk about it later Fortyfive minutes later Dale Gilbertson had called with the news that a boy named Tyler Marshall had vanished from in front of Maxtons sometime that morning and that Tylers father Fred Marshall was down there right now in the station demanding to see Jack Sawyer Fred was a great guy a real straight arrow and family man a solid citizen a friend of Dales you could say but at the moment he was at the end of his rope Apparently Judy his wife had been having some kind of mental problems even before the trouble started and Tylers disappearance had driven her off the edge She talked in gibberish injured herself tore the house apart  And I kind of know Judy Marshall Dale had said Beautiful beautiful woman a little thing but tough as all getout on the inside both feet on the ground a great person a tremendous person someone youd think would never lose her grip no matter what It seems she thought knew whatever that Tyler had been snatched even before his bicycle turned up Late this afternoon she got so bad Fred had to call Dr Skarda and get her over to French County Lutheran in Arden where they took one look at her and put her in Ward D the mental wing So you can imagine what kind of shape Freds in He insists on talking to you I have no confidence in you he said to me  Well Dale had said if you dont come down here Fred Marshall is going to show up at your house thats whatll happen I cant put the guy on a leash and Im not going to lock him up just to keep him away from you On top of everything else we need you here Jack  All right Dale had said I know youre not making any promises But you know what you should do Would these conversations have been enough to get him into his pickup and on the road to Sumner Street Very likely Jack imagines which renders the third factor the secret barely acknowledged one inconsequential It means nothing A silly attack of nerves a buildup of anxiety completely natural under the circumstances The kind of thing that could happen to anybody He felt like getting out of the house so what No one could accuse him of escaping He was traveling toward not running away from that which he most wanted to escape  the dark undertow of the Fishermans crimes Neither was he committing himself to any deeper involvement A friend of Dales and the father of a child apparently missing this Fred Marshall insisted on talking to him fine let him talk If half an hour with a retired detective could help Fred Marshall get a handle on his problems the retired detective was willing to give him the time Everything else was merely personal Waking dreams and robins eggs messed with your mind but that was merely personal It could be outwaited outwitted figured out No rational person took that stuff seriously like a summer storm it blew in it blew out Now as he coasted through the green light at Centralia and noted with a cops reflexive awareness the row of Harleys lined up in the Sand Bars parking lot he felt himself coming into alignment with the afternoons difficulties It made perfect sense that he should have found himself unable  well let us say unwilling  to open the refrigerator door Nasty surprises made you think twice A light in his living room had expired and when he had gone to the drawer that contained half a dozen new halogen bulbs he had been unable to open it In fact he had not quite been able to open any drawer cabinet or closet in his house which had denied him the capacity to make a cup of tea change his clothes prepare lunch or do anything but leaf half heartedly through books and watch television When the flap of the mailbox had threatened to conceal a pyramid of small blue eggs he had decided to put off collecting the mail until the next day Anyhow all he ever got were financial statements magazines and junk mail Lets not make it sound worse than it was Jack says to himself I could have opened every door drawer and cabinet in the place but I didnt want to I wasnt afraid that robins eggs were going to come spilling out of the refrigerator or the closet  its just that I didnt want to take the chance of finding one of the blasted things Show me a psychiatrist who says thats neurotic and Ill show you a moron who doesnt understand psychology All the oldtimers used to tell me that working homicide messed with your head Hell thats why I retired in the first place What was I supposed to do stay on the force until I ate my gun Youre a smart guy Henry Leyden and I love you but there are some things you dont GET All right he was going to Sumner Street Everybody was yelling at him to do something and thats what he was doing Hed say hello to Dale greet the boys sit down with this Fred Marshall the solid citizen with a missing son and give him the usual oatmeal about everything possible being done blah blah the FBI is working hand in glove with us on this one and the bureau has the finest investigators in the world That oatmeal As far as Jack was concerned his primary duty was to stroke Fred Marshalls fur as if to soothe the feelings of an injured cat when Marshall had calmed down Jacks supposed obligation to the community  an obligation that existed entirely in the minds of others  would be fulfilled freeing him to go back to the privacy he had earned If Dale didnt like it he could take a running jump into the Mississippi if Henry didnt like it Jack would refuse to read Bleak House and force him to listen instead to Lawrence Welk Vaughn Monroe or something equally excruciating Bad Dixieland Years ago someone had given Jack a CD called Fats Manassas  His Muskrat All Stars Stompin the Ramble Thirty seconds of Fats Manassas and Henry would be begging for mercy This image makes Jack feel comfortable enough to prove that his hesitation before cupboards and drawers had been merely a temporary unwillingness not phobic inability Even while his attention was elsewhere as it chiefly was the shovedin ashtray below the dash has mocked and taunted him since he first climbed into the pickup A kind of sinister suggestiveness an aura of latent malice surrounds the ashtrays flat little panel Does he fear that a small blue egg lurks behind the little panel Of course not Nothing is in there but air and molded black plastic In that case he can pull it out The buildings on the outskirts of French Landing glide past the pickups windows Jack has reached almost the exact point at which Henry pulled the plug on Dirtysperm Obviously he can open the ashtray Nothing could be simpler You just get your fingers under there and tug Easiest thing in the world He extends a hand Before his fingers touch the panel he snatches the hand back Drops of perspiration glide down his forehead and lodge in his eyebrows It isnt a big deal he says aloud You got some kind of problem here Jackyboy Again he extends his hand to the ashtray Abruptly aware that he is paying more attention to the bottom of his dashboard than to the road he glances up and cuts his speed by half He refuses to hit his brakes Its just an ashtray for Gods sake His fingers meet the panel then curl under its lip Jack glances at the road once more Then with the decisivesness of a nurse ripping a strip of tape off a patients hairy abdomen he yanks out the sliding tray The lighter attachment which he had unknowingly dislodged in his driveway that morning bounces three inches into the air greatly resembling to Jacks appalled eye a flying blackandsilver egg He veers off the road bumps over the weedy shoulder and heads toward a looming telephone pole The lighter drops back into the tray with a loud metallic thwack no egg in the world could have produced The telephone pole swims closer and nearly fills the windshield Jack stamps on the brake and jerks to a halt arousing a flurry of ticks and rattles from the ashtray If he had not cut his speed before opening the ashtray he would have driven straight into the pole which stands about four feet from the hood of the pickup Jack wipes the sweat off his face and picks up the lighter Shit on a shingle He clicks the attachment into its receptacle and collapses backward against the seat No wonder they say smoking can kill you he says The joke is too feeble to amuse him and for a couple of seconds he does nothing but slump against the seat and regard the sparse traffic on Lyall Road When his heart rate drops back to something like normal he reminds himself that he did after all open the ashtray Blond rumpled Tom Lund has evidently been prepped for his arrival for when Jack walks past three bicycles lined up next to the door and enters the station the young officer takes off from behind his desk and rushes forward to whisper that Dale and Fred Marshall are waiting for him in Dales office and he will show him right in Theyll be glad to see him thats for sure I am too Lieutenant Sawyer Lund adds Boy I gotta say it What you got I think we need Call me Jack Im not a lieutenant anymore Im not even a cop anymore Jack had met Tom Lund during the Kinderling investigation and he had liked the young mans eagerness and dedication In love with his job his uniform and his badge respectful of his chief and awed by Jack Lund had uncomplainingly logged hundreds of hours on the telephone in records offices and in his car checking and rechecking the often contradictory details spun off by the collision between a Wisconsin farminsurance salesman and two Sunset Strip working girls All the while Tom Lund had retained the energetic sparkle of a high school quarterback running onto the field for his first game He does not look that way anymore Jack observes Dark smudges hang beneath his eyes and the bones in his face are more prominent More than sleeplessness and exhaustion lie behind Lunds affect his eyes bear the helplessly startled expression of those who have suffered a great moral shock The Fisherman has stolen a good part of Tom Lunds youth But Ill see what I can do Jack says offering the promise of a commitment greater than he intends We can sure use anything you can give us Lund says It is too much too servile and as Lund turns away and leads him to the office Jack thinks I didnt come here to be your savior The thought instantly makes him feel guilty Lund knocks opens the door to announce Jack shows him in and vanishes like a ghost utterly unnoticed by the two men who rise from their chairs and fasten their eyes upon their visitors face one with visible gratitude the other with an enormous degree of the same emotion mixed with naked need which makes Jack even more uncomfortable Over Dales garbled introduction Fred Marshall says Thank you for agreeing to come thank you so much Thats all I can    His right arm sticks out like a pump handle When Jack takes his hand an even greater quantity of feeling floods into Fred Marshalls face His hand fastens on Jacks and seems almost to claim it as an animal claims its prey He squeezes hard a considerable number of times His eyes fill I cant    Marshall pulls his hand away and scrubs the tears off his face Now his eyes look raw and intensely vulnerable Boy oh boy he says Im really glad youre here Mr Sawyer Or should I say Lieutenant Jack is fine Why dont the two of you fill me in on what happened today Dale points toward a waiting chair the three men take their places the painful but essentially simple story of Fred Judy and Tyler Marshall begins Fred speaks first at some length In his version of the story a valiant lionhearted woman a devoted wife and mother succumbs to baffling multifaceted transformations and disorders and develops mysterious symptoms overlooked by her ignorant stupid selfcentered husband She blurts out nonsense words she writes crazy stuff on sheets of notepaper rams the papers into her mouth and tries to swallow them She sees the tragedy coming in advance and it unhinges her Sounds crazy but the selfcentered husband thinks its the truth That is he thinks he thinks its the truth because hes been thinking about it since he first talked to Dale and even though it sounds crazy it kind of makes sense Because what other explanation could there be So thats what he thinks he thinks  that his wife started to lose her mind because she knew that the Fisherman was on the way Things like that are possible he guesses For example the brave afflicted wife knew that her beautiful wonderful son was missing even before the stupid selfish husband who went to work exactly as if it were a normal day told her about the bicycle That pretty much proved what he was talking about The beautiful little boy went out with his three friends but only the three friends came back and Officer Danny Tcheda found the little sons Schwinn bike and one of his poor sneakers on the sidewalk outside Maxtons Danny Cheetah asks Jack who like Fred Marshall is beginning to think he thinks a number of alarming things Tcheda says Dale and spells it for him Dale tells his own far shorter version of the story In Dale Gilbertsons story a boy goes out for a ride on his bicycle and vanishes perhaps as a result of abduction from the sidewalk in front of Maxtons That is all of the story Dale knows and he trusts that Jack Sawyer will be able to fill in many of the surrounding blanks Jack Sawyer at whom both of the other men in the room are staring takes time to adjust to the three thoughts he now thinks he thinks The first is not so much a thought as a response that embodies a hidden thought from the moment Fred Marshall clutched his hand and said Boy oh boy Jack found himself liking the man an unanticipated turn in the evenings plot Fred Marshall strikes him as something like the poster boy for smalltown life If you put his picture on billboards advertising French County real estate you could sell a lot of second homes to people in Milwaukee and Chicago Marshalls friendly goodlooking face and slender runners body are as good as testimonials to responsibility decency good manners and good neighborliness modesty and a generous heart The more Fred Marshall accuses himself of selfishness and stupidity the more Jack likes him And the more he likes him the more he sympathizes with his terrible plight the more he wishes to help the man Jack had come to the station expecting that he would respond to Dales friend like a policeman but his cop reflexes have rusted from disuse He is responding like a fellow citizen Cops as Jack well knows seldom view the civilians caught up in the backwash of a crime as fellow citizens certainly never in the early stages of an investigation The thought hidden at the center of Jacks response to the man before him is that Fred Marshall being what he is cannot harbor suspicions about anyone with whom he is on good terms Jacks second thought is that of both a cop and a fellow citizen and while he continues his adjustment to the third which is wholly the product of his rusty yet still accurate cop reflexes he makes it public The bikes I saw outside belong to Tylers friends Is someone questioning them now Bobby Dulac Dale says I talked to them when they came in but I didnt get anywhere According to them they were all together on Chase Street and Tyler rode off by himself They claim they didnt see anything Maybe they didnt But you think theres more Honest to God I do But I dont know what the dickens it could be and we have to send them home before their parents get bent out of shape Who are they what are their names Fred Marshall wraps his fingers together as if around the handle of an invisible baseball bat Ebbie Wexler T J Renniker and Ronnie Metzger Theyre the kids Tys been hanging around with this summer An unspoken judgment hovers about this last sentence It sounds like you dont consider them the best possible company for your son Well no says Fred caught between his desire to tell the truth and his innate wish to avoid the appearance of unfairness Not if you put it like that Ebbie seems like kind of a bully and the other two are maybe a little on the    slow side I hope    or I was hoping    that Ty would realize he could do better and spend his free time with kids who are more on you know    More on his level Right The trouble is my son is sort of small for his age and Ebbie Wexler is    um    Heavyset and tall for his age Jack says The perfect situation for a bully Youre saying you know Ebbie Wexler No but I saw him this morning He was with the other two boys and your son Dale jolts upright in his chair and Fred Marshall drops his invisible bat When was that Dale asks At the same time Fred Marshall asks Where Chase Street about ten past eight I came in to pick up Henry Leyden and drive him home When we were on our way out of town the boys drove their bikes into the road right in front of me I got a good look at your son Mr Marshall He seemed like a great kid Fred Marshalls widening eyes indicate that some kind of hope some promise is taking shape before him Dale relaxes That pretty much matches their story It would have been right before Ty took off on his own If he did Or they took off and left him says Tys father They were faster on their bikes than Ty and sometimes they you know    they teased him By racing ahead and leaving him alone Jack says Fred Marshalls glum nod speaks of boyhood humiliations shared with this sympathetic father Jack remembers the inflamed hostile face and raised finger of Ebbie Wexler and wonders if and how the boy might be protecting himself Dale had said that he smelled the presence of falsity in the boys story but why would they lie Whatever their reasons the lie almost certainly began with Ebbie Wexler The other two followed orders For the moment setting aside the third of his thoughts Jack says I want to talk to the boys before you send them home Where are they The interrogation room top of the stairs Dale aims a finger at the ceiling Tom will take you up With its battleshipgray walls gray metal table and single window narrow as a slit in a castle wall the room at the top of the stairs seems designed to elicit confessions through boredom and despair and when Tom Lund leads Jack through the door the four inhabitants of the interrogation room appear to have succumbed to its leaden atmosphere Bobby Dulac looks sideways stops drumming a pencil on the tabletop and says Well hooray for Hollywood Dale said you were coming down Even Bobby gleams a little less conspicuously in this gloom Did you want to interrogate these here hoodlums Lieutenant In a minute maybe Two of the three hoodlums on the far side of the table watch Jack move alongside Bobby Dulac as if fearing he will clap them in a cell The words interrogate and Lieutenant have had the bracing effect of a cold wind from Canada Ebbie Wexler squints at Jack trying to look tough and the boy beside him Ronnie Metzger wriggles in his chair his eyes like dinner plates The third boy T J Renniker has dropped his head atop his crossed arms and appears to be asleep Wake him up Jack says I have something to say and I want you all to hear it In fact he has nothing to say but he needs these boys to pay attention to him He already knows that Dale was right If they are not lying they are at least holding something back Thats why his abrupt appearance within their dozy scene frightened them If Jack had been in charge he would have separated the boys and questioned them individually but now he must deal with Bobby Dulacs mistake He has to treat them collectively to begin with and he has to work on their fear He does not want to terrorize the boys merely to get their hearts pumping a bit faster after that he can separate them The weakest guiltiest link has already declared himself Jack feels no compunction about telling lies to get information Ronnie Metzger shoves TJs shoulder and says Wake up bumdell    dumbbell The sleeping boy moans lifts his head from the table begins to stretch out his arms His eyes fasten on Jack and blinking and swallowing he snaps into an upright position Welcome back Jack says I want to introduce myself and explain what I am doing here My name is Jack Sawyer and I am a lieutenant in the Homicide Division of the Los Angeles Police Department I have an excellent record and a roomful of citations and medals When I go after a bad guy I usually wind up arresting him Three years ago I came here on a case from Los Angeles Two weeks later a man named Thornberg Kinderling was shipped back to LA in chains Because I know this area and have worked with its law enforcement officers the LAPD asked me to assist your local force in its investigation of the Fisherman murders He glances down to see if Bobby Dulac is grinning at this nonsense but Bobby is staring frozenfaced across the table Your friend Tyler Marshall was with you before he disappeared this morning Did the Fisherman take him I hate to say it but I think he did Maybe we can get Tyler back and maybe we cant but if I am going to stop the Fisherman I need you to tell me exactly what happened down to the last detail You have to be completely honest with me because if you lie or keep anything secret you will be guilty of obstruction of justice Obstruction of justice is a serious serious crime Officer Dulac what is the minimum sentence for that crime in the state of Wisconsin Five years Im pretty sure Bobby Dulac says Ebbie Wexler bites the inside of his cheek Ronnie Metzger looks away and frowns at the table T J Renniker dully contemplates the narrow window Jack sits down beside Bobby Dulac Incidentally I was the guy in the pickup one of you gave the finger to this morning I cant say Im thrilled to see you again Two heads swivel toward Ebbie who squints ferociously trying to solve this brandnew problem I did not he says having settled on outright denial Maybe it looked like I did but I didnt Youre lying and we havent even started to talk about Tyler Marshall yet Ill give you one more chance Tell me the truth Ebbie smirks I dont go around flipping the bird at people I dont know Stand up Jack says Ebbie glances from side to side but his friends are unable to meet his gaze He shoves back his chair and stands up uncertainly Officer Dulac Jack says take this boy outside and hold him there Bobby Dulac performs his role perfectly He uncoils from his chair and keeps his eyes on Ebbie as he glides toward him He resembles a panther on the way to a sumptuous meal Ebbie Wexler jumps back and tries to stay Bobby with a raised palm No dont  I take it back  I did it okay Too late Jack says He watches as Bobby grasps the boys elbow and pulls him toward the door Redfaced and sweating Ebbie plants his feet on the floor and the forward pressure applied to his arm folds him over the bulge of his stomach He staggers forward yelping and scattering tears Bobbie Dulac opens the door and hauls him into the bleak secondfloor corridor The door slams shut and cuts off a wail of fear The two remaining boys have turned the color of skim milk and seem incapable of movement Dont worry about him Jack says Hell be fine In fifteen twenty minutes youll be free to go home I didnt think there was any point in talking to someone who lies from the gitgo thats all Remember even lousy cops know when theyre being lied to and I am a great cop So this is what we are going to do now Were going to talk about what happened this morning about what Tyler was doing the way you separated from him where you were what you did afterward anyone you might have seen that kind of thing He leans back and flattens his hands on the table Go on tell me what happened Ronnie and TJ look at each other TJ inserts his right index finger into his mouth and begins to worry the nail with his front teeth Ebbie flipped you Ronnie says No kidding After that Uh Ty said he hadda go someplace He hadda go someplace TJ chimes in Where were you right then Uh    outside the Allsorts Pomorium Emporium TJ says Its not a pomorium mushhead its a emporeeum And And Ty said   Ronnie glances at TJ Ty said he hadda go somewhere Which way did he go east or west The boys treat this question as though it were asked in a foreign language by puzzling over it mutely Toward the river or away from the river They consult each other again The question has been asked in English but no proper answer exists Finally Ronnie says I dont know How about you TJ Do you know TJ shakes his head Good Thats honest You dont know because you didnt see him leave did you And he didnt really say he had to go somewhere did he I bet Ebbie made that up TJ wriggles and Ronnie gazes at Jack with wondering awe He has just revealed himself to be Sherlock Holmes Remember when I drove past in my truck They nod in unison Tyler was with you They nod again Youd already left the sidewalk in front of the Allsorts Emporium and you were riding east on Chase Street  away from the river I saw you in my rearview mirror Ebbie was pedaling very fast The two of you could almost keep up with him Tyler was smaller than the rest of you and he fell behind So I know he didnt go off on his own He couldnt keep up Ronnie Metzger wails And he got way way behind and the Misherfun came out and grabbed him He promptly bursts into tears Jack leans forward Did you see it happen Either one of you Noooaa Ronnie sobs TJ slowly shakes his head You didnt see anyone talking with Ty or a car stopping or him going into a shop or anything like that The boys utter an incoherent overlapping babble to the effect that they saw nothing When did you realize he was gone TJ opens his mouth then closes it Ronnie says When we were having the Slurpees His face pursed with tension TJ nods in agreement Two more questions reveal that they had enjoyed the Slurpees at the Eleven where they also purchased Magic cards and that it had probably taken them no more than a couple of minutes to notice Tyler Marshalls absence Ebbie said Ty would buy us some more cards helpful Ronnie adds They have reached the moment for which Jack has been waiting Whatever the secret may be it took place soon after the boys came out of the Eleven and saw that Tyler had still not joined them And the secret is TJs alone The kid is practically sweating blood while the memory of the Slurpees and Magic cards has calmed down his friend to a remarkable degree There is only one more question he wishes to ask the two of them So Ebbie wanted to find Tyler Did you all get on your bikes and search around or did Ebbie send just one of you Huh Ronnie says TJ drops his chin and crosses his arms on the top of his head as if to ward off a blow Tyler went somewheres Ronnie says We didnt look for him we went to the park To trade the Magic cards I see Jack says Ronnie thank you You have been very helpful Id like you to go outside and stay with Ebbie and Officer Dulac while I have a short conversation with TJ It shouldnt take more than five minutes if that I can go At Jacks nod Ronnie moves hesitantly out of his chair When he reaches the door TJ emits a whimper Then Ronnie is gone and TJ jerks backward into his chair and tries to become as small as possible while staring at Jack with eyes that have become shiny flat and perfectly round TJ Jack says you have nothing to worry about I promise you Now that he is alone with the boy who had declared his guilt by falling asleep in the interrogation room Jack Sawyer wants above all to absolve him of that guilt He knows TJs secret and the secret is nothing it is useless No matter what you tell me Im not going to arrest you Thats a promise too Youre not in any trouble son In fact Im glad you and your friends could come down here and help us straighten things out He goes on in this vein for another three or four minutes in the course of which T J Renniker formerly condemned to death by firing squad gradually comprehends that his pardon has come through and his release from what his buddy Ronnie would call vurance dile is imminent A little color returns to his face He returns to his former size and his eyes lose their horrorstricken glaze Tell me what Ebbie did Jack says Just between you and me I wont tell him anything Honest I wont rat you out He wanted Ty to buy more Magic cards TJ says feeling his way through unknown territory If Ty was there he woulda Ebbie can get kind of mean So    so he told me go downstreet and get the slowpoke or Ill give you an Indian burn You got on your bike and rode back down Chase Street Uhhuh I looked but I didnt see Ty anywheres I thought I would you know Because where else could he be And     Jack reels in the answer he knows is coming by winding his hand through the air And I still didnt see him And I got to Queen Street where the old folks home is with the big hedge out front And um I saw his bike there On the sidewalk in front of the hedge His sneaker was there too And some leaves off the hedge There it is the worthless secret Maybe not entirely worthless it gives them a pretty accurate fix on the time of the boys disappearance  say or  The bike lay on the sidewalk next to the sneaker for something like four hours before Danny Tcheda spotted them Maxtons takes up just about all the land on that section of Queen Street and no one was showing up for the Strawberry Fest until noon TJ describes being afraid  if the Fisherman pulled Ty into that hedge maybe hed come back for more In answer to Jacks final question the boy says Ebbie told us to say Ty rode away from in front of the Allsorts so people wouldnt like blame us In case he was killed Ty isnt really killed is he Kids like Ty dont get killed I hope not Jack says Me too TJ snuffles and wipes his nose on his arm Lets get you on your way home Jack says leaving his chair TJ stands up and begins to move along the side of the table Oh I just remembered What I saw feathers on the sidewalk The floor beneath Jacks feet seems to roll left then right like the deck of a ship He steadies himself by grasping the back of a chair Really He takes care to compose himself before turning to the boy What do you mean feathers Black ones Big They looked like they came off a crow One was next to the bike and the other was in the sneaker Thats funny says Jack buying time until he ceases to reverberate from the unexpected appearance of feathers in his conversation with T J Renniker That he should respond at all is ridiculous that he should have felt even for a second that he was likely to faint is grotesque TJs feathers were real crow feathers on a real sidewalk His were dream feathers feathers from unreal robins illusory as everything else in a dream Jack tells himself a number of helpful things like this and soon he does feel normal once again but we should be aware that for the rest of the night and much of the next day the word feathers floats surrounded by an aura as charged as an electrical storm beneath and through his thoughts now and then surfacing with the sizzling crackle of a lightning bolt Its weird TJ says Like how did a feather get in his sneaker Maybe the wind blew it there Jack says conveniently ignoring the nonexistence of wind this day Reassured by the stability of the floor he waves TJ into the hallway then follows him out Ebbie Wexler pushes himself off the wall and stamps up alongside Bobby Dulac Still in character Bobby might have been carved from a block of marble Ronnie Metzger sidles away We can send these boys home Jack says Theyve done their duty TJ what did you say Ebbie asks glowering He made it clear that you know nothing about your friends disappearance Jack says Ebbie relaxes though not without distributing scowls all around The final and most malignant scowl is for Jack who raises his eyebrows I didnt cry Ebbie says I was scared but I didnt cry You were scared all right Jack says Next time dont lie to me You had your chance to help the police and you blew it Ebbie struggles with this notion and succeeds at least partially in absorbing it Okay but I wasnt really flippin at you It was the stupid music I hated it too The guy who was with me insisted on playing it You know who he was In the face of Ebbies suspicious glower Jack says George Rathbun It is like saying Superman or Arnold Schwarzenegger Ebbies suspicion evaporates and his face transforms Innocent wonder fills his small closeset eyes You know George Rathbun Hes one of my best friends Jack says not adding that most of his other best friends are in a sense also George Rathbun Cool Ebbie says In the background TJ and Ronnie echo Cool George is pretty cool Jack says Ill tell him you said that Lets go downstairs and get you kids on your bikes Still wrapped in the glory of having gazed upon the great the tremendous George Rathbun the boys mount their bicycles pedal away down Sumner Street and swerve off onto Second Bobby Dulac says That was a good trick what you said about George Rathbun Sent them away happy It wasnt a trick So startled that he jostles back into the station house side by side with Jack Bobby says George Rathbun is a friend of yours Yep Jack says And sometimes he can be a real pain in the ass Dale and Fred Marshall look up as Jack enters the office Dale with a cautious expectancy Fred Marshall with what Jack sees heartbreakingly as hope Well Dale says  feathers You were right they were hiding something but it isnt much Fred Marshall slumps against the back of his chair letting some of his belief in a future hope leak out of him like air from a punctured tire Not long after they got to the Eleven the Wexler boy sent TJ down the street to look for your son Jack says When TJ got to Queen Street he saw the bike and the sneaker lying on the sidewalk Of course they all thought of the Fisherman Ebbie Wexler figured they might get blamed for leaving him behind and he came up with the story you heard  that Tyler left them instead of the other way around If you saw all four boys around ten past eight that means Tyler disappeared only a few minutes later What does this guy do lurk in hedges Maybe he does exactly that Jack says Did you have people check out that hedge  feathers The staties went over it through it and under it Leaves and dirt thats what they came up with As if driving a spike with his hand Fred Marshall bangs his fist down onto the desk My son was gone for four hours before anyone noticed his bike Now its almost seventhirty Hes been missing for most of the day I shouldnt be sitting here I should be driving around looking for him Everybody is looking for your son Fred Dale says My guys the staties even the FBI I have no faith in them Fred says They havent found Irma Freneau have they Why should they find my son As far as I can see Ive got one chance here When he looks at Jack emotion turns his eyes into lamps That chance is you Lieutenant Will you help me Jacks third and most troubling thought withheld until now and purely that of an experienced policeman causes him to say Id like to talk to your wife If youre planning on visiting her tomorrow would you mind if I came along Dale blinks and says Maybe we should talk about this Do you think it would do some good It might Jack says Seeing you might do her some good anyhow Fred says Dont you live in Norway Valley Thats on the way to Arden I can pick you up about nine Jack Dale says See you at nine Jack says ignoring the signals of mingled distress and anger emanating from his friend also the little voice that whispers  feather Amazing says Henry Leyden I dont know whether to thank you or congratulate you Both I suppose Its too late in the game to make bitchrod like me but I think you could have a shot at dope  Dont lose your head The only reason I went down there was to keep the boys father from coming to my house That wasnt the only reason Youre right I was feeling sort of edgy and hemmed in I felt like getting out changing the scenery But there was also another reason Henry you are hipdeep in pigshit do you know that You want to think I acted out of civic duty or honor or compassion or altruism or something but I didnt I dont like having to say this but Im a lot less goodhearted and responsible than you think I am  Hipdeep in pigshit Man you are absolutely on the money I have been hipdeep in pigshit not to mention chestdeep and even chindeep in pigshit most of my life Nice of you to admit it However you misunderstand me Youre right I do think you are a good decent person I dont just think it I know it Youre modest youre compassionate youre honorable youre responsible  no matter what you think of yourself right now But that wasnt what I was talking about What did you mean then The other reason you decided to go to the police station is connected to this problem this concern whatever it is thats been bugging you for the past couple of weeks Its like youve been walking around under a shadow Huh Jack said This problem this secret of yours takes up half your attention so youre only half present the rest of you is somewhere else Sweetie dont you think I can tell when youre worried and preoccupied I might be blind but I can see Okay Lets suppose that something has been on my mind lately What could that have to do with going to the station house There are two possibilities Either you were going off to confront it or you were fleeing from it Jack does not speak All of which suggests that this problem has to do with your life as a policeman It could be some old case coming back to haunt you Maybe a psychotic thug you put in jail was released and is threatening to kill you Or hell Im completely full of shit and you found out you have liver cancer and a life expectancy of three months I dont have cancer at least as far as I know and no excon wants to kill me All of my old cases most of them anyway are safely asleep in the records warehouse of the LAPD Of course something has been bothering me lately and I should have expected you to see that But I didnt want to I dont know burden you with it until I managed to figure it out for myself Tell me one thing will you Were you going toward it or running away Theres no answer to that question We shall see Isnt the food ready by now Im starving literally starving You cook too slow I would have been done ten minutes ago Hold your horses Jack says Coming right up The problem is this crazy kitchen of yours Most rational kitchen in America Maybe in the world After ducking out of the police station quickly enough to avoid a useless conversation with Dale Jack had yielded to impulse and called Henry with the offer of making dinner for both of them A couple of good steaks a nice bottle of wine grilled mushrooms a big salad He could pick up everything they needed in French Landing Jack had cooked for Henry on three or four previous occasions and Henry had prepared one stupendously bizarre dinner for Jack The housekeeper had taken all the herbs and spices off their rack to wash it and she had put everything back in the wrong place What was he doing in French Landing Hed explain that when he got there At eightthirty he had pulled up before Henrys roomy white farmhouse greeted Henry and carried the groceries and his copy of Bleak House into the kitchen He had tossed the book to the far end of the table opened the wine poured a glass for his host and one for himself and started cooking Hed had to spend several minutes reacquainting himself with the eccentricities of Henrys kitchen in which objects were not located by kind  pans with pans knives with knives pots with pots  but according to what sort of meal required their usage If Henry wanted to whip up a grilled trout and some new potatoes he had only to open the proper cabinet to find all the necessary utensils These were arranged in four basic groups meat fish poultry and vegetables with many subgroups and subsubgroups within each category The filing system confounded Jack who often had to peer into several widely separated realms before coming upon the frying pan or spatula he was looking for As Jack chopped wandered the shelves and cooked Henry had laid the table in the kitchen with plates and silverware and sat down to quiz his troubled friend Now the steaks rare are transported to the plates the mushrooms arrayed around them and the enormous wooden salad bowl installed on the center of the table Henry pronounces the meal delicious takes a sip of his wine and says If you still wont talk about your trouble whatever it is youd better at least tell me what happened at the station I suppose theres very little doubt that another child was snatched Next to none Im sorry to say Its a boy named Tyler Marshall His fathers name is Fred Marshall and he works out at Goltzs Do you know him Been a long time since I bought a combine Henry says The first thing that struck me was that Fred Marshall was a very nice guy Jack says and goes on to recount in great detail and leaving nothing out the evenings events and revelations except for one matter that of his third his unspoken thought You actually asked to visit Marshalls wife In the mental wing at French County Lutheran Yes I did Jack says Im going there tomorrow I dont get it Henry eats by hunting the food with his knife spearing it with his fork and measuring off a narrow strip of steak Why would you want to see the mother Because one way or another I think shes involved Jack says Oh come off it The boys own mother Im not saying shes the Fisherman because of course she isnt But according to her husband Judy Marshalls behavior started to change before Amy St Pierre disappeared She got worse and worse as the murders went on and on the day her son vanished she flipped out completely Her husband had to have her committed Wouldnt you say she had an excellent reason to break down She flipped out before anyone told her about her son Her husband thinks she has ESP He said she saw the murders in advance she knew the Fisherman was on the way And she knew her son was gone before they found the bike  when Fred Marshall came home he found her tearing at the walls and talking nonsense Completely out of control You hear about lots of cases where a mother is suddenly aware of some threat or injury to her child A pyschic bond Sounds like mumbo jumbo but I guess it happens I dont believe in ESP and I dont believe in coincidence So what are you saying Judy Marshall knows something and whatever she knows is a real showstopper Fred cant see it  hes much too close  and Dale cant see it either You should have heard him talk about her So what is she supposed to know I think she may know the doer I think it has to be someone close to her Whoever he is she knows his name and its driving her crazy Henry frowns and uses his inchworm technique to entrap another piece of steak So youre going to the hospital to open her up he finally says Yes Basically A mysterious silence follows this statement Henry quietly whittles away at the meat chews what he whittles and washes it down with Jordan cabernet How did your deejay gig go Was it okay It was a thing of beauty All the adorable old swingers cut loose on the dance floor even the ones in wheelchairs One guy sort of rubbed me the wrong way He was rude to a woman named Alice and he asked me to play Lady Magowans Nightmare which doesnt exist as you probably know   Its Lady Magowans Dream Woody Herman Good boy The thing was he had this terrible voice It sounded like something out of hell Anyhow I didnt have the Woody Herman record and he asked for the Bunny Berigan I Cant Get Started Which happened to be Rhodas favorite record What with my goofy ear hallucinations and all it shook me up I dont know why For a few minutes they concentrate on their plates Jack says What do you think Henry Henry tilts his head auditing an inner voice Scowling he sets down his fork The inner voice continues to demand his attention He adjusts his shades and faces Jack In spite of everything you say you still think like a cop Jack bridles at the suspicion that Henry is not paying him a compliment What do you mean by that Cops see differently than people who arent cops When a cop looks at someone he wonders what hes guilty of The possibility of innocence never enters his mind To a longtime cop a guy whos put in ten years or more everyone who isnt a cop is guilty Only most of them havent been caught yet Henry has described the mindset of dozens of men Jack once worked with Henry how do you know about that I can see it in their eyes Henry says Thats the way policemen approach the world You are a policeman Jack blurts out I am a coppiceman Appalled he blushes Sorry that stupid phrase has been running around and around in my head and it just popped out Why dont we clear the dishes and start on Bleak House When their few dishes have been stacked beside the sink Jack takes the book from the far side of the table and follows Henry toward the living room pausing on the way to glance as he always does at his friends studio A door with a large glass insert opens into a small soundproofed chamber bristling with electronic equipment the microphone and turntable back from Maxtons and reinstalled before Henrys wellpadded swiveling chair a disc changer and matching digitalanalog converter mount close at hand beside a mixing board and a massive tape recorder adjacent to the other larger window which looks into the kitchen When Henry had been planning the studio Rhoda requested the windows because shed said she wanted to be able to see him at work There isnt a wire in sight The entire studio has the disciplined neatness of the captains quarters on a ship Looks like youre going to work tonight Jack says I want to get two more Henry Shakes ready to send and Im working on something for a birthday salute to Lester Young and Charlie Parker Were they born on the same day Close enough August twentyseventh and twentyninth You know I cant quite tell if youll want the lights on or not Lets turn them on Jack says And so Henry Leyden switches on the two lamps beside the window and Jack Sawyer moves to the overstuffed chair near the fireplace and turns on the tall lamp at one of its rounded arms and watches as his friend walks unerringly to the light just inside the front door and the ornate fixture alongside his own his favorite resting place the Missionstyle sofa clicking first one then the other into life then settles down onto the sofa with one leg stretched out along its length Even low light pervades the long room and swells into greater brightness around Jacks chair Bleak House by Charles Dickens he says He clears his throat Okay Henry were off to the races London Michaelmas Term lately over he reads and marches into a world made of soot and mud Muddy dogs muddy horses muddy people a day without light Soon he has reached the second paragraph Fog everywhere Fog up the river where it flows among green aits and meadows fog down the river where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great and dirty city Fog on the Essex marshes fog on the Kentish heights Fog creeping into the cabooses of collierbrigs fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats His voice catches and his mind temporarily drifts offfocus What he is reading unhappily reminds him of French Landing of Sumner Street and Chase Street of the lights in the window of the Oak Tree Inn the Thunder Five lurking in Nailhouse Row and the gray ascent from the river of Queen Street and Maxtons hedges the little houses spreading out on grids all of it choked by unseen fog  which engulfs a battered NO TRESPASSING sign on the highway and swallows the Sand Bar and glides hungry and searching down the valleys Sorry he says I was just thinking   I was too Henry says Go on please But for that brief flicker of an old NO TRESPASSING sign completely unaware of the black house he one day will have to enter Jack concentrates again on the page and continues reading Bleak House The windows darken as the lamps grow warmer The case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce grinds through the courts aided or impeded by attorneys Chizzle Mizzle and Drizzle Lady Dedlock leaves Sir Leicester Dedlock alone at their great estate with its moldy chapel stagnant river and Ghosts Walk Esther Summerson begins to chirp away in the first person Our friends decide that the appearance of Esther demands a small libation if they are to get through much more chirping Henry unfolds from the sofa sails into the kitchen and returns with two short fat glasses onethird filled with Balvenie Doublewood singlemalt whiskey as well as a glass of plain water for the reader A couple of sips a few murmurs of appreciation and Jack resumes Esther Esther Esther but beneath the water torture of her relentless sunniness the story gathers steam and carries both reader and listener along in its train Having come to a convenient stopping point Jack closes the book and yawns Henry stands up and stretches They move to the door and Henry follows Jack outside beneath a vast night sky brilliantly scattered with stars Tell me one thing Henry says Shoot When you were in the station house did you really feel like a cop Or did you feel like you were pretending to be one Actually it was kind of surprising Jack says In no time at all I felt like a cop again Good Why is that good Because it means you were running toward that mysterious secret not away from it Shaking his head and smiling deliberately not giving Henry the satisfaction of a reply Jack steps up into his vehicle and says goodbye from the slight but distinct elevation of the drivers seat The engine coughs and churns his headlights snap into being and Jack is on his way home NOT MANY HOURS later Jack finds himself walking down the midway of a deserted amusement park under a gray autumn sky On either side of him are boardedover concessions the Fenway Franks hot dog stand the Annie Oakley Shooting Gallery the PitchTilUWin Rain has fallen and more is coming the air is sharp with moisture Not far away he can hear the lonely thunder of waves hurling themselves against a deserted shingle of beach From closer by comes the snappy sound of guitar picking It should be cheerful but to Jack it is dread set to music He shouldnt be here This is an old place a dangerous place He passes a boardedup ride A sign out front reads THE SPEEDY OPOPANAX WILL RE OPEN MEMORIAL DAY   SEE YA THEN Opopanax Jack thinks only he is no longer Jack now hes Jacky Hes Jackyboy and he and his mother are on the run From whom From Sloat of course From hustlin bustlin Uncle Morgan Speedy Jack thinks and as if he has given a telepathic cue a warm slightly slurry voice begins to sing When the red red robin comes bob bob bobbin along  Therell be no more sobbin when he starts throbbin his old sweet song    No Jack thinks I dont want to see you I dont want to hear your old sweet song You cant be here anyway youre dead Dead on the Santa Monica Pier Old bald black man dead in the shadow of a frozen merrygoround horse Oh but no When the old cop logic comes back it takes hold like a tumor even in dreams and it doesnt take much of it to realize that this isnt Santa Monica  its too cold and too old This is the land of ago when Jacky and the Queen of the Bs fled out of California like the fugitives they had become And didnt stop running until they got to the other coast the place where Lily Cavanaugh Sawyer  No I dont think of this I never think of this  had come to die Wake up wake up you sleepyhead The voice of his old friend Friend my ass Hes the one who put me on the road of trials the one who came between me and Richard my real friend Hes the one who almost got me killed almost drove me crazy Wake up wake up get out of bed Waygup waygup waygup Time to face the fearsome opopanax Time to get back to your notsosweet usedtobe No Jacky whispers and then the midway ends Ahead is the carousel sort of like the one on the Santa Monica Pier and sort of like the one he remembers from    well from ago It is a hybrid in other words a dream specialty neither here nor there But theres no mistaking the man who sits beneath one of the frozen rearing horses with his guitar on his knee Jackyboy would know that face anywhere and all the old love rises in his heart He fights it but that is a fight few people win especially not those who have been turned back to the age of twelve Speedy he cries The old man looks at him and his brown face cracks open in a smile Travelin Jack he says How I have missed you son Ive missed you too he says But I dont travel anymore Ive settled down in Wisconsin This    He gestures at his magically restored boys body clad in jeans and a Tshirt This is just a dream Maybe so maybe not In any case you got a mite more traveling to do Jack I been telling you that for some time What do you mean Speedys grin is sly in the middle exasperated at the corners Dont play the fool with me Jacky Sent you the feathers didnt I Sent you a robins egg didnt I Sent you moren one Why cant people leave me alone Jack asks His voice is suspiciously close to a whine Not a pretty sound You    Henry    Dale    Quit on it now Speedy says growing stern Aint got no more time to ask you nice The game has gotten rough Aint it Speedy   You got your job and I got mine Same job too Dont you whine at me Jack and dont make me chase you no mo Youre a coppiceman same as ever was Im retired   Shit on your retired The kids he killed thats bad enough The kids he might kill if hes let to go on thats worse But the one hes got    Speedy leans forward dark eyes blazing in his dark face That boy has got to be brought back and soon If you cant get him back you got to kill him yourself little as I like to think of it Because hes a Breaker A powerful one One more might be all he needs to take it down Who might need Jack asks The Crimson King And what is it this Crimson King wants to take down Speedy looks at him a moment then starts to play that perky tune again instead of answering Therell be no more sobbin when he starts throbbin his old sweet song    Speedy I cant The tune ends in a discordant jangle of strings Speedy looks at twelveyearold Jack Sawyer with a coldness that chills the boy inward all the way to the hidden mans heart And when he speaks again Speedy Parkers faint southern accent has deepened It has filled with a contempt that is almost liquid You get busy now hear me Yall quit whinin and cryin and slackin off Yall pick up yo guts from wherever you left em and get busy Jack steps back A heavy hand falls on his shoulder and he thinks Its Uncle Morgan Him or maybe Sunlight Gardener Its  and Ive got to do it all over again  But that is a boys thought and this is a mans dream Jack Sawyer as he is now thrusts the childs acquiescing despair away No not at all I deny that I have put those faces and those places aside It was hard work and I wont see it all undone by a few phantom feathers a few phantom eggs and one bad dream Find yourself another boy Speedy This one grew up He turns ready to fight but no ones there Lying behind him on the boardwalk on its side like a dead pony is a boys bicycle Theres a license plate on the back reading BIG MAC Scattered around it are shiny crows feathers And now Jack hears another voice cold and cracked ugly and unmistakably evil He knows its the voice of the thing that touched him Thats right asswipe Stay out of it You mess with me and Ill strew your guts from Racine to La Riviere A spinning hole opens in the boardwalk just in front of the bike It widens like a startled eye It continues to widen and Jack dives for it Its the way back The way out The contemptuous voice follows him Thats right jackoff it says Run Run from the abbalah Run from the King Run for your miserable fucking life The voice dissolves into laughter and it is the mad sound of that laughter which follows Jack Sawyer down into the darkness between worlds Hours later Jack stands naked at his bedroom window absently scratching his ass and watching the sky lighten in the east Hes been awake since four He cant remember much of his dream his defenses may be bending but even now they have not quite broken yet enough of it lingers for him to be sure of one thing the corpse on the Santa Monica Pier upset him so badly that he quit his job because it reminded him of someone he once knew All of that never happened he tells the coming day in a falsely patient voice I had a kind of preadolescent breakdown brought on by stress My mother thought she had cancer she grabbed me and we ran all the way to the East Coast All the way to New Hampshire She thought she was going back to the Great Happy Place to die Turned out to be mostly vapors some goddamn actress midlife crisis but what does a kid know I was stressed I had dreams Jack sighs I dreamed I saved my mothers life The phone behind him rings the sound shrill and broken in the shadowy room Jack Sawyer screams I woke you up Fred Marshall says and Jack knows at once that this man has been up all night sitting in his wifeless sonless home Looking at photo albums perhaps while the TV plays Knowing he is rubbing salt into the wounds but unable to quit No Jack says actually I was   He stops The phones beside the bed and theres a pad beside the phone Theres a note written on the pad Jack must have written it since hes the only one here  ellafuckingmentry my dear Watson  but it isnt in his handwriting At some point in his dream he wrote this note in his dead mothers handwriting The Tower The Beams If the Beams are broken Jackyboy if the Beams are broken and the Tower falls Theres no more There is only poor old Fred Marshall who has discovered how quickly things can go bad in the sunniest midwestern life Jacks mouth has attempted to say a couple of things while his mind is occupied with this forgery from his subconscious probably not very sensible things but that doesnt bother Fred he simply goes droning along with none of the stops and drops that folks usually employ to indicate the ends of sentences or changes of thought Fred is just getting it out unloading and even in his own distressed state Jack realizes that Fred Marshall of  Robin Hood Lane that sweet little Cape Cod honey of a home is nearing the edge of his endurance If things dont turn around for him soon he wont need to visit his wife in Ward D of French County Lutheran theyll be roommates And it is their proposed visit to Judy of which Fred is speaking Jack realizes He quits trying to interrupt and simply listens frowning down at the note he has written to himself as he does so Tower and Beams What kind of beams Sunbeams Hornbeams Raise high the roof beam carpenters   know I said Id pick you up at nine but Dr Spiegleman thats her doctor up there Spiegleman his name is he said she had a very bad night with a lot of yelling and screaming and then trying to get up the wallpaper and eat it and maybe a seizure of some kind so theyre trying her on a new medication he might have said Pamizene or Patizone I didnt write it down Spiegleman called me fifteen minutes ago I wonder if those guys ever sleep and said we should be able to see her around four he thinks shell be more stabilized by four and we could see her then so could I pick you up at three or maybe you have   Three would be fine Jack says quietly   other stuff to do other plans Id understand that but I could come by if you dont its mostly that I dont want to go alone   Ill be waiting for you Jack said Well go in my pickup   thought maybe Id hear from Ty or from whoever snatched him like maybe a ransom demand but no one called only Spiegleman hes my wifes doctor up there at   Fred Im going to find your boy Jack is appalled at this bald assurance at the suicidal confidence he hears in his own voice but it serves at least one purpose bringing Freds flood of dead words to an end There is blessed silence from the other end of the line At last Fred speaks in a trembling whisper Oh sir If only I could believe that I want you to try Jack says And maybe we can find your wifes mind while were at it Maybe both are in the same place he thinks but this he does not say Liquid sounds come from the other end of the line Fred has begun to cry Fred Yes Youre coming to my place at three Yes A mighty sniff a miserable cry that is mostly choked back Jack has some comprehension of how empty Fred Marshalls house must feel at this moment and even that dim understanding is bad enough My place in Norway Valley Come past Roys Store over Tamarack Creek   I know where it is A faint edge of impatience has crept into Freds voice Jack is very glad to hear it Good Ill see you You bet Jack hears a ghost of Freds salesman cheer and it twists his heart What time Ththree Then with marginal assurance Three Thats right Well take my truck Maybe have a bite of supper at Gerties Kitchen on our way back Goodbye Fred Goodbye sir And thank you Jack hangs up the phone Looks a moment longer at his memorys reproduction of his mothers handwriting and wonders what youd call such a thing in copspeak Autoforgery He snorts then crumples the note up and starts getting dressed He will drink a glass of juice then go out walking for an hour or so Blow all the bad dreams out of his head And blow away the sound of Fred Marshalls awful droning voice while hes at it Then after a shower he might or might not call Dale Gilbertson and ask if there have been any developments If hes really going to get involved in this therell be a lot of paperwork to catch up on    hell want to reinterview the parents    take a look at the old folks home close to where the Marshall kid disappeared    With his mind full of such thoughts  pleasant thoughts actually although if this had been suggested to him he would have strenuously denied it Jack almost stumbles over the box sitting on the welcome mat just outside his front door Its where Buck Evitz the postman leaves packages when he has packages to leave but its not gone sixthirty yet and Buck wont be along in his little blue truck for another three hours Jack bends down and cautiously picks the package up Its the size of a shoe box covered with brown paper that has been cut raggedly and secured not with tape but with big drools of red sealing wax In addition to this there are complicated loops of white string secured with a childs oversized bow Theres a cluster of stamps in the upper corner ten or a dozen featuring various birds No robins however Jack notes this with understandable relief Theres something not right about those stamps but at first Jack doesnt see what it is Hes too focused on the address which is spectacularly not right Theres no box number no RFD number no zip code No name not really The address consists of a single word scrawled in large capital letters J A C K Y Looking at those bedraggled letters Jack imagines a fisted hand clutching a Sharpie marker narrowed eyes a tongue poked from the corner of some lunatics mouth His heartbeat has sped up to doubletime Im not liking this he breathes I am so not liking this And of course there are perfectly good reasons coppiceman reasons not to It is a shoe box he can feel the edge of the top right through the brown paper and nutters have been known to put bombs in shoe boxes Hed be crazy to open it but he has an idea he will open it just the same If it blows him skyhigh at least hell be able to opt out of the Fisherman investigation Jack raises the package to listen for ticking fully aware that ticking bombs are as outofdate as Betty Boop cartoons He hears nothing but he does see whats wrong with the stamps which arent stamps at all Someone has carefully cut the front panels from a dozen or so cafeteria sugar packets and taped them to this wrapped shoe box A grunt of humorless laughter escapes Jack Some nut sent him this all right Some nut in a locked facility with easier access to sugar packets than to stamps But how has it gotten here Who left it with the fake stamps uncanceled while he was dreaming his confused dreams And who in this part of the world could possibly know him as Jacky His Jacky days are long gone No they aint Travelin Jack a voice whispers Not by half Time to stop your sobbin and get bobbobbobbin along boy Start by seein whats in that box Resolutely ignoring his own mental voice which tells him hes being dangerously stupid Jack snaps the twine and uses his thumbnail to cut through the sloppy blobs of red wax Who uses sealing wax in this day and age anyway He sets the wrapping paper aside Something else for the forensics boys maybe It isnt a shoe box but a sneaker box A New Balance sneaker box to be exact Size  A childs size And at that Jacks heart speeds up to tripletime He feels beads of cold sweat springing up on his forehead His gorge and sphincter are both tightening up This is also familiar It is how coppicemen get cocked and locked ready to look at something awful And this will be awful Jack has no doubt about it and no doubt about who the package is from This is my last chance to back out he thinks After this its all aboard and heighho for the    the wherever But even that is a lie he realizes Dale will be looking for him at the police station on Sumner Street by noon Fred Marshall is coming to Jacks place at three oclock and they are going to see the Mad Housewife of Robin Hood Lane The backout point has already come and gone Jack still isnt sure how it happened but it looks like hes back in harness And if Henry Leyden has the temerity to congratulate him on this Jack thinks hell probably kick Henrys blind ass for him A voice from his dream whispers up from beneath the floorboards of Jacks consciousness like a whiff of rotten air  Ill strew your guts from Racine to La Riviere  but this bothers him less than the madness inherent in the sugarpack stamps and the laboriously printed letters of his old nickname He has dealt with crazies before Not to mention his share of threats He sits down on the steps with the sneaker box on his thighs Beyond him in the north field all is still and gray Bunny Boettcher son of Tom Tom came and did the second cutting only a week ago and now a fine mist hangs above the anklehigh stubble Above it the sky has just begun to brighten Not a single cloud as yet marks its calm nocolor Somewhere a bird calls out Jack breathes deeply and thinks If this is where I go out I could do worse A lot worse Then very carefully he takes the lid off the box and sets it aside Nothing explodes But it looks as if someone has filled the New Balance sneaker box with night Then he realizes that its been packed with shiny black crow feathers and his arms roughen with goose bumps He reaches toward them then hesitates He wants to touch those feathers about as much as hed want to touch the corpse of a halfdecayed plague victim but theres something beneath them He can see it Should he get some gloves There are gloves in the front hall closet  Fuck the gloves Jack says and dumps the box onto the brown paper wrapping lying beside him on the porch Theres a flood of feathers which swirl a bit even in the perfectly still morning air Then a thump as the object around which the feathers were packed lands on Jacks porch The smell hits Jacks nose a moment later an odor like rotting baloney Someone has delivered a childs bloodstained sneaker chez Sawyer on Norway Valley Road Something has gnawed at it pretty briskly and even more briskly at whats inside it He sees a lining of bloody white cotton  that would be a sock And inside the sock tatters of skin This is a childs New Balance sneaker with a childs foot inside it one that has been badly used by some animal He sent it Jack thinks The Fisherman Taunting him Telling him If you want in come on in The waters fine Jackyboy the water is fine Jack gets up His heart is hammering the beats now too close together to count The beads of sweat on his forehead have swelled and broken and gone running down his face like tears his lips and hands and feet are numb    yet he tells himself he is calm That he has seen worse much worse piled up against bridge abutments and freeway underpasses in LA Nor is this his first severed body part Once in  he and his partner Kirby Tessier found a single testicle sitting on top of a toilet tank in the Culver City public library like an ancient softboiled egg So he tells himself he is calm He gets up and walks down the porch steps He walks past the hood of his burgundycolored Dodge Ram with the worldclass sound system inside he walks past the bird hotel he and Dale put up at the edge of the north field a month or two after Jack moved into this the most perfect house in the universe He tells himself he is calm He tells himself that its evidence thats all Just one more loop in the hangmans noose that the Fisherman will eventually put around his own neck He tells himself not to think of it as part of a kid part of a little girl named Irma but as Exhibit A He can feel dew wetting his sockless ankles and the cuffs of his pants knows that any sort of extended stroll through the hay stubble is going to ruin a fivehundreddollar pair of Gucci loafers And so what if it does Hes rich well beyond the point of vulgarity he can have as many shoes as Imelda Marcos if he wants The important thing is hes calm Someone brought him a shoe box with a human foot inside it laid it on his porch in the dark of night but hes calm Its evidence thats all And he He is a coppiceman Evidence is his meat and drink He just needs to get a little air needs to clear his nose of the rotted baloney smell that came puffing out of the box  Jack makes a strangled gagging urking sound and begins to hurry on a little faster There is a sense of approaching climax growing in his mind my calm mind he tells himself  Something is getting ready to break    or change    or change back That last idea is particularly alarming and Jack begins to run across the field knees lifting higher arms pumping His passage draws a dark line through the stubble a diagonal that starts at the driveway and might end anywhere Canada maybe Or the North Pole White moths startled out of their dewheavy morning doze flutter up in lacy swirls and then slump back into the cut stubble He runs faster away from the chewed and bloody sneaker lying on the porch of the perfect house away from his own horror But that sense of coming climax stays with him Faces begin to rise in his mind each with its own accompanying snippet of sound track Faces and voices he has ignored for twenty years or more When these faces rise or those voices mutter he has until now told himself the old lie that once there was a frightened boy who caught his mothers neurotic terror like a cold and made up a story a grand fantasy with good old Momsaving Jack Sawyer at its center None of it was real and it was forgotten by the time he was sixteen By then he was calm Just as hes calm now running across his north field like a lunatic leaving that dark track and those clouds of startled moths behind him but doing it calmly Narrow face narrow eyes under a tilted white paper cap If you can run me out a keg when I need one you can have the job Smokey Updike from Oatley New York where they drank the beer and then ate the glass Oatley where thered been something in the tunnel outside of town and where Smokey had kept him prisoner Until  Prying eyes false smile brilliant white suit Ive met you before Jack    where Tell me Confess Sunlight Gardener an Indiana preacher whose name had also been Osmond Osmond in some other world The broad hairy face and frightened eyes of a boy who wasnt a boy at all This is a bad place Jacky Wolf knows And it was it was a very bad place They put him in a box put good old Wolf in a box and finally they killed him Wolf died of a disease called America Wolf the running man in the field gasps Wolf ah God Im sorry Faces and voices all those faces and voices rising in front of his eyes dinning into his ears demanding to be seen and heard filling him with that sense of climax every defense on the verge of being washed away like a breakwater before a tidal wave Nausea roars through him and tilts the world He makes that urking sound again and this time it fills the back of his throat with a taste he remembers the taste of cheap rough wine And suddenly its New Hampshire again Arcadia Funworld again He and Speedy are standing beside the carousel again all those frozen horses All carousel horses is named dont you know that Jack and Speedy is holding out a bottle of wine and telling him its magic juice one little sip and hell go over flip over  No Jack cries knowing its already too late I dont want to go over The world tilts the other way and he falls into the grass on his hands and knees with his eyes squeezed shut He doesnt need to open them the richer deeper smells that suddenly fill his nose tell him everything he needs to know That and the sense of coming home after so many dark years when almost every waking motion and decision has in some way been dedicated to canceling or at least postponing the arrival of this very moment This is Jack Sawyer ladies and gentlemen down on his knees in a vast field of sweet grass under a morning sky untainted by a single particle of pollution He is weeping He knows what has happened and he is weeping His heart bursts with fear and joy This is Jack Sawyer twenty years along grown to be a man and back in the Territories again at last It is the voice of his old friend Richard  sometimes known as Rational Richard  that saves him Richard as he is now head of his own law firm Sloat  Associates Ltd not Richard as he was when Jack perhaps knew him best during long vacation days on Seabrook Island in South Carolina The Richard of Seabrook Island had been imaginative quickspoken fast on his feet moptopped skinny as a morning shadow The current Richard Corporate Law Richard is thinning on top thick in the middle much in favor of sitting and Bushmills Also he has crushed his imagination so brilliantly playful in those Seabrook Island days like a troublesome fly Richard Sloats life has been one of reduction Jack has sometimes thought but one thing has been added probably in law school the pompous sheeplike sound of hesitation particularly annoying on the phone which is now Richards vocal signature This sound starts with the lips closed then opens out as Richards lips spring wide making him look like an absurd combination of Vienna choirboy and Lord HawHaw Now kneeling with his eyes shut in the vast green reach of what used to be his very own north field smelling the new deeper smells that he remembers so well and has longed for so fiercely without even realizing it Jack hears Richard Sloat begin speaking in the middle of his head What a relief those words are He knows its only his own mind mimicking Richards voice but its still wonderful If Richard were here Jack thinks hed embrace his old friend and say May you pontificate forever Richieboy Sheep bray and all Rational Richard says You realize youre dreaming Jack dont you    bahaaaa    the stress of opening that package no doubt    bahaaaa    no doubt caused you to pass out and that in turn has caused    baHAAAA    the dream you are having now Down on his knees eyes still closed and hair hanging in his face Jack says In other words its what we used to call   Correct What we used to call    bahaaaa    Seabrook Island stuff But Seabrook Island was a long time ago Jack so I suggest you open your eyes get back on your feet and remind yourself that should you see anything out of the ordinary    bhaa    its not really there Not really there Jack murmurs He stands up and opens his eyes He knows from the very first look that it is really here but he holds Richards pompous IlookthirtyfivebutImreallysixty voice in his head shielding himself with it Thus he is able to maintain a precarious balance instead of passing out for real or  perhaps  cracking up entirely Above him the sky is an infinitely clear dark blue Around him the hay and timothy is ribhigh instead of anklehigh there has been no Bunny Boettcher in this part of creation to cut it In fact there is no house back the way he came only a picturesque old barn with a windmill standing off to one side Where are the flying men Jack thinks looking up into the sky then shakes his head briskly No flying men no twoheaded parrots no werewolves All that was Seabrook Island stuff a neurosis he picked up from his mother and even passed on to Richard for a while It was all nothing but    bahaaa    bullshit He accepts this knowing at the same time that the real bullshit would be not believing whats all around him The smell of the grass now so strong and sweet mixed with the more flowery smell of clover and the deeper basso profundo smell of black earth The endless sound of the crickets in this grass living their unthinking cricket lives The fluttering white field moths The unblemished cheek of the sky not marked by a single telephone wire or electrical cable or jet contrail What strikes Jack most deeply however is the perfection of the field around him Theres a matted circle where he fell on his knees the dewheavy grass crushed to the ground But there is no path leading to the circle not a mark of passage through the wet and tender grass He might have dropped out of the sky Thats impossible of course more Seabrook Island stuff but  I did sort of fall out of the sky though Jack says in a remarkably steady voice I came here from Wisconsin I flipped here Richards voice protests this strenuously exploding in a flurry of hrrumphs and bahaaas but Jack hardly notices Its just good old Rational Richard doing his Rational Richard thing inside his head Richard had lived through stuff like this once before and come out the other side with his mind more or less intact    but hed been twelve Theyd both been twelve that fall and when youre twelve the mind and body are more elastic Jack has been turning in a slow circle seeing nothing but open fields the mist over them now fading to a faint haze in the days growing warmth and bluegray woods beyond them Now theres something else To the southwest theres a dirt road about a mile away Beyond it at the horizon or perhaps just beyond the perfect summer sky is a little stained with smoke Not woodstoves Jack thinks not in July but maybe small manufactories And    He hears a whistle  three long blasts made faint with distance His heart seems to grow large in his chest and the corners of his mouth stretch up in a kind of helpless grin The Mississippis that way by God he says and around him the field moths seem to dance their agreement lace of the morning Thats the Mississippi or whatever they call it over here And the whistle friends and neighbors   Two more blasts roll across the making summer day They are faint with distance yes but up close they would be mighty Jack knows this Thats a riverboat A damn big one Maybe a paddle wheeler Jack begins to walk toward the road telling himself that this is all a dream not believing a bit of that but using it as an acrobat uses his balance pole After hes gone a hundred yards or so he turns and looks back A dark line cuts through the timothy beginning at the place where he landed and cutting straight to where he is It is the mark of his passage The only mark of it Far to the left in fact almost behind him now are the barn and the windmill Thats my house and garage Jack thinks At least thats what they are in the world of Chevrolets Mideast warfare and the Oprah Winfrey show He walks on and has almost reached the road when he realizes there is more than smoke in the southwest There is a kind of vibration as well It beats into his head like the start of a migraine headache And its strangely variable If he stands with his face pointed dead south that unpleasant pulse is less Turn east and its gone North and its almost gone Then as he continues to turn it comes all the way back to full Worse than ever now that hes noticed it the way the buzz of a fly or the knock of a radiator in a hotel room is worse after you really start to notice it Jack turns another slow full circle South and the vibration sinks East its gone North its starting to come back West its coming on strong Southwest and hes locked in like the SEEK button on a car radio Pow pow pow A black and nasty vibration like a headache a smell like ancient smoke    No no no not smoke Jack says Hes standing almost up to his chest in summer grass pants soaked white moths flittering around his head like a halfassed halo eyes wide cheeks once more pale In this moment he looks twelve again It is eerie how he has rejoined his younger and perhaps better self Not smoke that smells like    He suddenly makes that urking sound again Because the smell  not in his nose but in the center of his head  is rotted baloney The smell of Irma Freneaus halfrotted severed foot Im smelling him Jack whispers knowing its not a smell he means He can make that pulse whatever he wants    including he realizes gone Im smelling the Fisherman Either him or    I dont know He starts walking and a hundred yards later he stops again The pulse in his head is indeed gone It has faded out the way radio stations do when the day warms and the temperature thickens Its a relief Jack has almost reached the road which no doubt leads one way to some version of Arden and the other way to versions of Centralia and French Landing when he hears an irregular drumming sound He feels it as well running up his legs like a Gene Krupa backbeat He turns to the left then shouts in mingled surprise and delight Three enormous brown creatures with long lolloping ears go leaping past Jacks position rising above the grass sinking back into it then rising above it again They look like rabbits crossed with kangaroos Their protruding black eyes stare with comic terror Across the road they go their flat feet whitefurred instead of brown slapping up dust Christ Jack says halflaughing and halfsobbing He whacks himself in the center of his forehead with the heel of his palm What was that Richieboy Got any comments on that Richie of course does He tells Jack that Jack has just suffered an extremely vivid    bahaaa    hallucination Of course Jack says Giant bunny rabbits Get me to the nearest AA meeting Then as he steps out onto the road he looks toward the southwestern horizon again At the haze of smoke there A village And do the residents fear as the shadows of the evening come on Fear the coming of the night Fear the creature that is taking their children Do they need a coppiceman Of course they do Of course they  Something is lying on the road Jack bends down and picks up a Milwaukee Brewers baseball cap jarringly out of place in this world of giant hopping range rabbits but indubitably real Judging from the plastic adjustment band in the back its a childs baseball cap Jack looks inside knowing what hell find and there it is carefully inked on the bill TY MARSHALL The caps not as wet as Jacks jeans which are soaked with morning dew but its not dry either It has been lying here on the edge of the road he thinks since yesterday The logical assumption would be that Tys abductor brought Ty this way but Jack doesnt believe that Perhaps it is the lingering pulse of vibration that gives rise to a different thought a different image the Fisherman with Ty carefully stashed away walking out this dirt road Under his arm is a wrapped shoe box decorated with bogus stamps On his head is Tys baseball hat kind of balancing there because its really too small for the Fisherman Still he doesnt want to change the adjustment band Doesnt want Jack to mistake it for a mans cap even for a single second Because he is teasing Jack inviting Jack into the game Took the boy in our world Jack mutters Escaped with him to this world Stashed him someplace safe like a spider stashing a fly Alive Dead Alive I think Dont know why Maybe its just what I want to believe Leave it Then he went to wherever he stashed Irma Took her foot and brought it to me Brought it through this world then flipped back to my world to leave it on the porch Lost the hat on the way maybe Lost it off his head Jack doesnt think so Jack thinks this fuck this skell this worldhopping dirtbag left the cap on purpose Knew that if Jack walked this road hed find it Holding the hat to his chest like a Miller Park fan showing respect to the flag during the national anthem Jack closes his eyes and concentrates Its easier than he would have expected but he supposes some things you never forget  how to peel an orange how to ride a bike how to flip back and forth between worlds Boy like you dont need no cheap wine anyhow he hears his old friend Speedy Parker say and theres the edge of a laugh in Speedys voice At the same time that sense of vertigo twists through Jack again A moment later he hears the alarming sound of an oncoming car He steps back opening his eyes as he does so Catches a glimpse of a tarred road  Norway Valley Road but  A horn blares and a dusty old Ford slams by him the passenger sideview mirror less than nine inches from Jack Sawyers nose Warm air once again filled with the faint but pungent odor of hydrocarbons surfs over Jacks cheeks and brow along with some farm kids indignant voice   hell out of the road assshollle   Resent being called an asshole by some cowcollege graduate Jack says in his best Rational Richard voice and although he adds a pompous Bahaaa for good measure his heart is pumping hard Man hed almost flipped back right in front of that guy Please Jack spare me Richard said You dreamed the whole thing Jack knows better Although he looks around himself in total amazement the core of his heart isnt amazed at all no not even a little bit He still has the cap for one thing  Ty Marshalls Brewers cap And for another the bridge across Tamarack Creek is just over the next rise In the other world the one where giant rabbits went hopping past you he has walked maybe a mile In this one hes come at least four Thats the way it was before he thinks thats the way it was when Jacky was six When everybody lived in California and nobody lived anywhere else But thats wrong Somehow wrong Jack stands at the side of the road that was dirt a few seconds ago and is tarred now stands looking down into Ty Marshalls baseball cap and trying to figure out exactly what is wrong and how its wrong knowing he probably wont be able to turn the trick All that was a long time ago and besides hes worked at burying his admittedly bizarre childhood memories since he was thirteen More than half his life in other words A person cant dedicate that much time to forgetting then suddenly just snap his fingers and expect  Jack snaps his fingers Says to the warming summer morning What happened when Jacky was six And answers his own question When Jacky was six Daddy played the horn What does that mean Not Daddy Jack says suddenly Not my daddy Dexter Gordon The tune was called Daddy Played the Horn Or maybe the album The LP He stands there shaking his head then nods Plays Daddy Plays Daddy Plays the Horn  And just like that it all comes back Dexter Gordon playing on the hifi Jacky Sawyer behind the couch playing with his toy London taxi so satisfying because of its weight which somehow made it seem more real than a toy His father and Richards father talking Phil Sawyer and Morgan Sloat Imagine what this guy would be like over there Uncle Morgan had said and that had been Jack Sawyers first hint of the Territories When Jacky was six Jacky got the word And  When Jacky was twelve Jacky actually went there he says Ridiculous Morgans son trumpets Utterly    bahaaa    ridiculous Next youll be telling me there really were men in the sky But before Jack can tell his mental version of his old pal that or anything else another car arrives This one pulls up beside him Looking suspiciously out of the drivers window the expression is habitual Jack has found and means nothing in itself  is Elvena Morton Henry Leydens housekeeper What in the tarnal are you doin way down here Jack Sawyer she asks He gives her a smile Didnt sleep very well Mrs Morton Thought Id take a little walk to clear my head And do you always go walking through the dews and the damps when you want to clear your head she asks casting her eyes down at his jeans which are wet to the knee and even a bit beyond Does that help I guess I got lost in my own thoughts he says I guess you did she says Get in and Ill give you a lift most of the way back to your place Unless that is youve got a little more head clearing to do Jack has to grin Thats a good one Reminds him of his late mother actually When asked by her impatient son what was for dinner and when it would be served Lily Cavanaugh was apt to say Fried farts with onions wind pudding and air sauce for dessert come and get it at ha past a pickle I guess my heads as clear as I can expect today he says and goes around the front of Mrs Mortons old brown Toyota Theres a brown bag on the passenger seat with leafy stuff poking out of it Jack moves it to the middle then sits down I dont know if the early bird gets the worm she says driving on but the early shopper gets the best greens at Roys I can tell you that Also I like to get there before the layabouts Layabouts Mrs Morton She gives him her best suspicious look eyes cutting to the side right corner of her mouth quirked down as if at the taste of something sour Take up space at the lunch counter and talk about the Fisherman this and the Fisherman that Who he might be what he might be  a Swede or a Pole or an Irish  and of course what theyll do to him when hes caught which he would have been long ago if anyone but that nummiesquarehead Dale Gilbertson was in charge of things So says they Easy to take charge when you got your ass cozied down on one of Roy Soderholms stools cuppa coffee in one hand and a sinker in the other So thinks I Course half of ems also got the unemployment check in their back pockets but they wont talk about that My father used to say Show me a man whos too good to hay in July and Ill show you a man that wont turn a hand the rest of the year neither  Jack settles in the passenger bucket knees against the dash and watches the road unroll Theyll be back in no time His pants are starting to dry and he feels oddly at peace The nice thing about Elvena Morton is that you dont have to hold up your end of the conversation because she is glad to take care of everything Another Lilyism occurs to him Of a very talkative person Uncle Morgan for instance she was apt to say that Soandsos tongue was hung in the middle and running on both ends He grins a little and raises a casual hand to hide his mouth from Mrs M Shed ask him what was so funny and what would he tell her That he had just been thinking her tongue was hung in the middle But its also funny how the thoughts and memories are flooding back Did he just yesterday try to call his mother forgetting she was dead That now seems like something he might have done in a different life Maybe it was a different life God knows he doesnt seem like the same man who swung his legs out of bed this morning wearily and with a feeling best described as doomish He feels fully alive for the first time since    well since Dale first brought him out this very same road he supposes and showed him the nice little place that had once belonged to Dales father Elvena Morton meanwhile rolls on Although I also admit that I take any excuse to get out of the house when he starts with the Mad Mongoloid she says The Mad Mongoloid is Mrs Mortons term for Henrys Wisconsin Rat persona Jack nods understanding not knowing that before many hours are passed he will be meeting a fellow nicknamed the Mad Hungarian Lifes little coincidences Its always early in the morning that he takes it into his head to do the Mad Mongoloid and Ive told him Henry if you have to scream like that and say awful things and then play that awful music by kids who never should have been let near a tuba let alone an electrical guitar why do you do it in the morning when you know it spoils you for the whole day And it does he gets a headache four times out of every five he pretends to be the Mad Mongoloid and by afternoon hes lying in his bedroom with an icebag on his poor forehead and not a bite of lunch will he take on those days neither Sometimes his supper will be gone when I check the next day  I always leave it in the same place in the refrigerator unless he tells me he wants to cook himself  but half the time its still there and even when its gone I think that sometimes he just tips it down the garbage disposer Jack grunts Its all he has to do Her words wash over him and he thinks of how he will put the sneaker in a Baggie handling it with the fire tongs and when he turns it over at the police station the chain of evidence will begin Hes thinking about how he needs to make sure theres nothing else in the sneaker box and check the wrapping paper He also wants to check those sugar packets Maybe theres a restaurant name printed under the bird pictures Its a longshot but  And he says Mrs M I cant help it Some days I just wake up as the Rat And although I pay for it later theres such joy in it while the fit is on me Such total joy And I asked him I said How can there be joy in music about children wanting to kill their parents and eat fetuses and have sex with animals  as one of those songs really was about Jack I heard it clear as day  and all of that I asked him and he said  Uhhp here we are They have indeed reached the driveway leading to Henrys house A quarter of a mile further along is the roof of Jacks own place His Ram pickup twinkles serenely in the driveway He cant see his porch most certainly cant see the horror that lies upon its boards waiting for someone to clean it up To clean it up in the name of decency I could run you all the way up she says Why dont I just do that Jack thinking of the sneaker and the rotten baloney smell hanging around it smiles shakes his head and quickly opens the passenger door Guess I need to do a little more thinking after all he says She looks at him with that expression of discontented suspicion which is Jack suspects love She knows that Jack has brightened Henry Leydens life and for that alone he believes she loves him He likes to hope so anyway It occurs to him that she never mentioned the baseball cap hes holding but why would she In this part of the world every mans got at least four He starts up the road hair flopping his days of styled cuts at ChezChez on Rodeo Drive are long behind him now  this is the Coulee Country and when he thinks of it at all he gets his hair cut by old Herb Roeper down on Chase Street next to the Amvets his gait as loose and lanky as a boys Mrs Morton leans out her window and calls after him Change out of those jeans Jack The minute you get back Dont let them dry on you Thats how arthritis starts He raises a hand without turning and calls back Right Five minutes later hes walking up his own driveway again At least temporarily the fear and depression have been burned out of him The ecstasy as well which is a relief The last thing a coppiceman needs is to go charging through an investigation in a state of ecstasy As he sights the box on the porch  and the wrapping paper and the feathers and the everpopular childs sneaker cant forget that  Jacks mind turns back to Mrs Morton quoting that great sage Henry Leyden I cant help it Some days I just wake up as the Rat And although I pay for it later theres such joy in it while the fit is on me Such total joy Total joy Jack has felt this from time to time as a detective sometimes while investigating a crime scene more often while questioning a witness who knows more than he or she is telling    and this is something Jack Sawyer almost always knows something he smells He supposes carpenters feel that joy when they are carpentering particularly well sculptors when theyre having a good nose or chin day architects when the lines are landing on their blueprints just right The only problem is someone in French Landing maybe one of the surrounding towns but Jack is guessing French Landing gets that feeling of joy by killing children and eating parts of their little bodies Someone in French Landing is more and more frequently waking up as the Fisherman Jack goes into his house by the back door He stops in the kitchen for the box of largesize Baggies a couple of wastebasket liners a dustpan and the whisk broom He opens the refrigerators icemaker compartment and loads about half the cubes into one of the plastic liners  as far as Jack Sawyer is concerned Irma Freneaus poor foot has reached its maximum state of decay He ducks into his study where he grabs a yellow legal pad a black marker and a ballpoint pen In the living room he gets the shorter set of fire tongs And by the time he steps back onto the porch he has pretty much put his secret identity as Jack Sawyer aside I am COPPICEMAN he thinks smiling Defender of the American Way friend of the lame the halt and the dead Then as he looks down at the sneaker surrounded by its pitiful little cloud of stink the smile fades He feels some of the tremendous mystery we felt when we first came upon Irma in the wreckage of the abandoned restaurant He will do his absolute best to honor this remnant just as we did our best to honor the child He thinks of autopsies he has attended of the true solemnity that lurks behind the jokes and butchershop crudities Irma is it you he asks quietly If it is you help me now Talk to me This is the time for the dead to help the living Without thinking about it Jack kisses his fingers and blows the kiss down toward the sneaker He thinks Id like to kill the man  or the thing  that did this String him up alive and screaming while he filled his pants Send him out in the stink of his own dirt But such thoughts are not honorable and he banishes them The first Baggie is for the sneaker with the remains of the foot inside it Use the tongs Zip it closed Mark the date on the Baggie with the marker Note the nature of the evidence on the pad with the ballpoint Put it in the wastebasket liner with the ice in it The second is for the cap No need for the tongs here hes already handled the item He puts it in the Baggie Zips it closed Marks the date notes the nature of the evidence on the pad The third bag is for the brown wrapping paper He holds it up for a moment in the tongs examining the bogus bird stamps MANUFACTURED BY DOMINO is printed below each picture but thats all No restaurant name nothing of that sort Into the Baggie Zip it closed Mark the date Note the nature of the evidence He sweeps up the feathers and puts them in a fourth Baggie There are more feathers in the box He picks the box up with the tongs dumps the feathers inside onto the dustpan and then his heart takes a sudden hard leap in his chest seeming to knock against the left side of his rib cage like a fist Something is written on the boxs bottom The same Sharpie marker has been used to make the same straggling letters And whoever wrote this knew who he was writing to Not the outer Jack Sawyer or else he  the Fisherman  would have no doubt called him Hollywood This message is addressed to the inner man and to the child who was here before Jack Hollywood Sawyer was ever thought of Try Eds Eats and Dogs coppiceman Your fiend THE FISHERMAN Your fiend Jack murmurs Yes He picks up the box with the tongs and puts it into the second wastebasket liner he doesnt have any Baggies quite big enough for it Then he gathers all the evidence beside him in a neat little pile This stuff always looks the same at once grisly and prosaic like the kind of photographs you used to see in those truecrime magazines He goes inside and dials Henrys number Hes afraid hell get Mrs Morton but it turns out to be Henry instead thank God His current fit of Ratism has apparently passed although theres a residue even over the phone Jack can hear the faint thump and bray of electrical guitars He knows Eds Eats well Henry says but why in the world would Jack want to know about a place like that Its nothing but a wreck now Ed Gilbertson died quite a time ago and there are people in French Landing whod call that a blessing Jack The place was a ptomaine palace if ever there was one A gutache waiting to happen Youd have expected the board of health to shut him down but Ed knew people Dale Gilbertson for one The two of them related Jack asks and when Henry replies Fuck yeah something his friend would never say in the ordinary course of things Jack understands that while Henry may have avoided a migraine this time that Rat is still running in his head Jack has heard similar bits of George Rathbun pop out from time to time unexpected fat exultations from Henrys slim throat and there is the way Henry often says goodbye throwing a Dingdong or Iveydivey over his shoulder thats just the Sheik the Shake the Shook coming up for air Where exactly is it Jack asks Thats hard to say Henry replies He now sounds a bit testy Out by the farm equipment place    Goltzs As I recall the driveways so long you might as well call it an access road And if there was ever a sign its long gone When Ed Gilbertson sold his last microbeinfested chili dog Jack you were probably in the first grade Whats all this about Jack knows that what hes thinking of doing is ridiculous by normal investigatory standards  you dont invite a John Q to a crime scene especially not a murder scene  but this is no normal investigation He has one piece of bagged evidence that he recovered in another world hows that for abnormal Of course he can find the longdefunct Eds Eats someone at Goltzs will no doubt point him right at it But  The Fisherman just sent me one of Irma Freneaus sneakers Jack says With Irmas foot still inside it Henrys initial response is a deep sharp intake of breath Henry Are you all right Yes Henrys voice is shocked but steady How terrible for the girl and her mother He pauses And for you For Dale Another pause For this town Yes Jack do you want me to take you to Eds Henry can do that Jack knows Easy as pie Iveydivey And lets get real  why did he call Henry in the first place Yes he says Have you called the police No Hell ask me why not and what will I say That I dont want Bobby Dulac Tom Lund and the rest of them tromping around out there mixing their scents with the doers scent until I get a chance to smell for myself That I dont trust a mothers son of them not to fuck things up and that includes Dale himself But Henry doesnt ask Ill be standing at the end of my driveway he said Just tell me when Jack calculates his remaining chores with the evidence chores that will end with stowing everything in the lockbox in the bed of his truck Reminds himself to take his cell phone which usually does nothing but stand on its little charging device in his study Hell want to call everything in as soon as he has seen Irmas remains in situ and finished that vital first walkthrough Let Dale and his boys come then Let them bring along the high school marching band if they want to He glances at his watch and sees that its almost eight oclock How did it get so late so early Distances are shorter in the other place this he remembers but does time go faster as well Or has he simply lost track Ill be there at eightfifteen Jack says And when we get to Eds Eats youre going to sit in my truck like a good little boy until I tell you you can get out Understood mon capitaine Dingdong Jack hangs up and heads back out to the porch Things arent going to turn out the way Jack hopes Hes not going to get that clear first look and smell In fact by this afternoon the situation in French Landing volatile already will be on the verge of spinning out of control Although there are many factors at work here the chief cause of this latest escalation will be the Mad Hungarian Theres a dose of good old smalltown humor in this nickname like calling the skinny bank clerk Big Joe or the trifocalwearing bookstore proprietor Hawkeye Arnold Hrabowski at five foot six and one hundred and fifty pounds is the smallest man on Dale Gilbertsons current roster In fact hes the smallest person on Dales current roster as both Debbi Anderson and Pam Stevens outweigh him and stand taller at sixone Debbi could eat scrambled eggs off Arnold Hrabowskis head The Mad Hungarian is also a fairly inoffensive fellow the sort of guy who continues to apologize for giving tickets no matter how many times Dale has told him that this is a very bad policy and who has been known to start interrogations with such unfortunate phrases as Excuse me but I was wondering As a result Dale keeps him on desk as much as possible or downtown where everyone knows him and most treat him with absent respect He tours the county grammar schools as Officer Friendly The little ones unaware that they are getting their first lessons on the evils of pot from the Mad Hungarian adore him When he gives tougher lectures on dope drink and reckless driving at the high school the kids doze or pass notes although they do think the federally funded DARE car he drives  a low sleek Pontiac with JUST SAY NO emblazoned on the doors  is way cool Basically Officer Hrabowski is about as exciting as a tuna on white hold the mayo But in the seventies you see there was this relief pitcher for St Louis and then the Kansas City Royals a very fearsome fellow indeed and his name was Al Hrabosky He stalked rather than walked in from the bullpen and before beginning to pitch usually in the ninth inning with the bases juiced and the game on the line Al Hrabosky would turn from the plate lower his head clench his fists and pump them once very hard psyching himself up Then he would turn and begin throwing nasty fastballs many of them within kissing distance of the batters chins He was of course called the Mad Hungarian and even a blind man could see he was the best damn reliever in the majors And of course Arnold Hrabowski is now known must be known as the Mad Hungarian He even tried to grow a Fu Manchu mustache a few years back like the one the famed reliever wore But whereas Al Hraboskys Fu was as fearsome as Zulu warpaint Arnolds only provoked chuckles  a Fu sprouting on that mild accountants face just imagine  and so he shaved it off The Mad Hungarian of French Landing is not a bad fellow he does his absolute level best and under normal circumstances his level best is good enough But these arent ordinary days in French Landing these are the slippery slippage days the abbalahopopanax days and he is exactly the sort of officer of whom Jack is afraid And this morning he is quite without meaning to going to make a bad situation very much worse The call from the Fisherman comes in to the  phone at  AM while Jack is finishing his notes on the yellow legal pad and Henry is strolling down his driveway smelling the summer morning with great pleasure in spite of the shadow Jacks news has cast over his mind Unlike some of the officers Bobby Dulac for instance the Mad Hungarian reads the script taped next to the  phone word for word ARNOLD HRABOWSKI Hello this is the French Landing Police Department Officer Hrabowski speaking Youve dialed  Do you have an emergency Unintelligible sound    throatclearing AH Hello This is Officer Hrabowski answering on  Do you  CALLER Hello asswipe AH Who is this Do you have an emergency C You have an emergency Not me You AH Who is this please C Your worst nightmare AH Sir could I ask

Caller rolls rs turning the word into verrry tasty AH Where are you Who is this If this is a joke  C Tell the coppiceman I said hello When the call began the Mad Hungarians pulse was lubdubbing along at a perfectly normal sixtyeight beats a minute When it ends at  Arnold Hrabowskis ticker is in overdrive His face is pale Halfway through the call he looked at the Caller ID readout and wrote down the number displayed there with a hand shaking so badly that the numbers jigged up and down over three lines on his pad When the Fisherman hangs up and he hears the sound of an open line Hrabowski is so flustered that he tries to dial the callback on the red phone forgetting that  is a oneway street His fingers strike the smooth plastic front of the phone and he drops it back into the cradle with a frightened curse He looks at it like something that has bitten him Hrabowski grabs the receiver from the black telephone beside  starts to punch in the callback but his fingers betray him and hit two numbers at once He curses again and Tom Lund passing by with a cup of coffee says Whats wrong there Arnie Get Dale the Mad Hungarian shouts startling Tom so badly he spills coffee on his fingers Get him out here now What the hells wrong with y   NOWgoddamnit Tom stares at Hrabowski a moment longer eyebrows raised then goes to tell Dale that the Mad Hungarian seems to have really gone mad The second time Hrabowski tries he succeeds in dialing the callback number It rings It rings And it rings some more Dale Gilbertson appears with his own cup of coffee There are dark circles under his eyes and the lines at the corners of his mouth are a lot more prominent than they used to be Arnie Whats   Play back the last call Arnold Hrabowski says I think it was    hello He barks this last sitting forward behind the dispatch desk and shoving papers every which way Hello who is this Listens Its the police thats who it is Officer Hrabowski FLPD Now you talk to me Who is this Dale meanwhile has got the earphones on his head and is listening to the most recent call to French Landing  with mounting horror Oh dear God he thinks His first impulse  the very first  is to call Jack Sawyer and ask for help To bawl for it like a little kid with his hand caught in a door Then he tells himself to take hold that this is his job like it or not and he had better take hold and try to do it Besides Jack has gone up to Arden with Fred Marshall to see Freds crazy wife At least that was the plan Cops meanwhile are clustering around the dispatch desk Lund Tcheda Stevens What Dale sees when he looks at them is nothing but big eyes and pale bewildered faces And the ones on patrol The ones currently off duty No better With the possible exception of Bobby Dulac no better He feels despair as well as horror Oh this is a nightmare A truck with no brakes rolling downhill toward a crowded school playground He pulls the earphones off tearing a small cut by his ear not feeling it Whered it come from he asks Hrabowski The Mad Hungarian has hung up the telephone and is just sitting there stunned Dale grabs his shoulder and gives it a shake Whered it come from The Eleven the Mad Hungarian replies and Dale hears Danny Tcheda grunt Not too far from where the Marshall boys bike disappeared in other words I just spoke with Mr Rajan Patel the day clerk He says the callback number belongs to the pay phone just outside Did he see who made the call No He was out back taking a beer delivery You positive Patel himself didnt   Yeah Hes got an Indian accent Heavy The guy on     Dale you heard him He sounded like anybody Whats going on Pam Stevens asks She has a good idea though they all do Its just a question of details Whats happened Because its the quickest way to get them up to speed Dale replays the call this time on speaker In the stunned silence that follows Dale says Im going out to Eds Eats Tom youre coming with me Yessir Tom Lund says He looks almost ill with excitement Four more cruisers to follow me Most of Dales mind is frozen this procedural stuff skates giddily on top of the ice Im okay at procedure and organization he thinks Its just catching the goddamn psycho murderer thats giving me a little trouble All pairs Danny you and Pam in the first Leave five minutes after Tom and I do Five minutes by the clock and no lights or siren Were going to keep this quiet just as long as we can Danny Tcheda and Pam Stevens look at each other nod then look back at Dale Dale is looking at Arnold the Mad Hungarian Hrabowski He ticks off three more pairs ending with Dit Jesperson and Bobby Dulac Bobby is the only one he really wants out there the others are just insurance and  God grant it not be necessary  crowd control All of them are to come at fiveminute intervals Let me go out too Arnie Hrabowski pleads Come on boss what do you say Dale opens his mouth to say he wants Arnie right where he is but then he sees the hopeful look in those watery brown eyes Even in his own deep distress Dale cant help responding to that at least a little For Arnie police life is too often standing on the sidewalk while the parade goes by Some parade he thinks I tell you what Arn he says When you finish all your other calls buzz Debbi If you can get her in here you can come out to Eds Arnold nods excitedly and Dale almost smiles The Mad Hungarian will have Debbi in here by ninethirty he guesses even if he has to drag her by the hair like Alley Oop Who do I pair with Dale Come by yourself Dale says In the DARE car why dont you But Arnie if you leave this desk without relief waiting to drop into the chair the second you leave it youll be looking for a new job come tomorrow Oh dont worry Hrabowski says and Hungarian or not in his excitement he sounds positively Suhveedish Nor is that surprising since Centralia where he grew up was once known as Swede Town Come on Tom Dale says Well grab the evidence kit on our   Uh    boss What Arnie Meaning of course What now Should I call those State Police guys Brown and Black Danny Tcheda and Pam Stevens snicker Tom smiles Dale doesnt do either His heart already in the cellar now goes even lower Subbasement ladies and gentlemen  false hopes on your left lost causes on your right Last stop everybody out Perry Brown and Jeff Black He had forgotten them how funny Brown and Black who would now almost certainly take his case away from him Theyre still out at the Paradise Motel the Mad Hungarian goes on although I think the FBI guy went back to Milwaukee I   And County the Hungarian plows relentlessly along Dont forget them You want me to call the ME first or the evidence wagon The evidence wagon is a blue Ford Econoline van packed with everything from quickdrying plaster for taking tire impressions to a rolling video studio Stuff the French Landing PD will never have access to Dale stands where he is head lowered looking dismally at the floor They are going to take the case away from him With every word Hrabowski says that is clearer And suddenly he wants it for his own In spite of how he hates it and how it scares him he wants it with all his heart The Fisherman is a monster but hes not a county monster a state monster or a Federal Bureau of Investigation monster The Fisherman is a French Landing monster Dale Gilbertsons monster and he wants to keep the case for reasons that have nothing to do with personal prestige or even the practical matter of holding on to his job He wants him because the Fisherman is an offense against everything Dale wants and needs and believes in Those are things you cant say out loud without sounding corny and stupid but they are true for all that He feels a sudden foolish anger at Jack If Jack had come on board sooner maybe  And if wishes were horses beggars would ride He has to notify County if only to get the medical examiner out at the scene and he has to notify the State Police in the persons of Detectives Brown and Black as well But not until he has a look at whats out there in the field beyond Goltzs At what the Fisherman has left By God not until then And perhaps has one final swing at the bastard Get our guys rolling at fiveminute intervals he said just as I told you Then get Debbi in the dispatch chair Have her call State and County Arnold Hrabowskis puzzled face makes Dale feels like screaming but somehow he retains his patience I want some lead time Oh Arnie says and then when he actually does get it Oh And dont tell anyone other than our guys about the call or our response Anyone Youd likely start a panic Do you understand Absolutely boss says the Hungarian Dale glances at the clock  AM Come on Tom he says Lets get moving Tempus fugit The Mad Hungarian has never been more efficient and things fall into place like a dream Even Debbi Anderson is a good sport about the desk And yet through it all the voice on the phone stays with him Hoarse raspy with just a tinge of accent  the kind anyone living in this part of the world might pick up Nothing unusual about that Yet it haunts him Not that the guy called him an asswipe  hes been called much worse by your ordinary Saturday night drunks  but some of the other stuff There are whips in hell and chains in shayol My name is legion Stuff like that And abbalah What was an abbalah Arnold Hrabowski doesnt know He only knows that the very sound of it in his head makes him feel bad and scared Its like a word in a secret book the kind you might use to conjure up a demon When he gets the willies theres only one person who can take them away and thats his wife He knows Dale told him not to tell anybody about what was going down and he understands the reasons but surely the chief didnt mean Paula They have been married twenty years and Paula isnt like another person at all Shes like the rest of him So more in order to dispel his bad case of the willies than to gossip lets at least give Arnold that much the Mad Hungarian makes the terrible mistake of trusting his wifes discretion He calls Paula and tells her that he spoke to the Fisherman not half an hour ago Yes really the Fisherman He tells her about the body that is supposedly waiting for Dale and Tom Lund out at Eds Eats She asks him if hes all right Her voice is trembling with awe and excitement and the Mad Hungarian finds this quite satisfying since hes feeling awed and excited himself They talk a little more and when Arnold hangs up he feels better The terror of that rough strangely knowing voice on the phone has receded a little Paula Hrabowski is discretion itself the very soul of discretion She tells only her two best friends about the call Arnie got from the Fisherman and the body at Eds Eats and swears them both to secrecy Both say they will never tell a soul and this is why one hour later even before the State Police and the county medical and forensics guys have been called everyone knows that the police have found a slaughterhouse out at Eds Eats Half a dozen murdered kids Maybe more AS THE CRUISER with Tom Lund behind the wheel noses down Third Street to Chase  roofrack lights decorously dark siren off  Dale takes out his wallet and begins digging through the mess in the back business cards people have given him a few dogeared photographs little licks of foldedover notebook paper On one of the latter he finds what he wants Whatcha doin boss Tom asks None of your beeswax Just drive the car Dale grabs the phone from its spot on the console grimaces and wipes off the residue of someones powdered doughnut then without much hope dials the number of Jack Sawyers cell phone He starts to smile when the phone is answered on the fourth ring but the smile metamorphoses into a frown of puzzlement He knows that voice and should recognize it but  Hello says the person who has apparently answered Jacks cell phone Speak now whoever you are or forever hold your peace Then Dale knows Would have known immediately if he had been at home or in his office but in this context  Henry he says knowing he sounds stupid but not able to help it Uncle Henry is that you Jack is piloting his truck across the Tamarack Bridge when the cell phone in his pants pocket starts its annoying little tweet He takes it out and taps the back of Henrys hand with it Deal with this he says Cell phones give you brain cancer Which is okay for me but not for you More or less yeah Thats what I love about you Jack Henry says and opens the phone with a nonchalant flick of the wrist Hello And after a pause Speak now whoever you are or forever hold your peace Jack glances at him then back at the road Theyre coming up on Roys Store where the early shopper gets the best greens Yes Dale It is indeed your esteemed   Henry listens frowning a little bit and smiling a little bit Im in Jacks truck with Jack he says George Rathbun isnt working this morning because KDCU is covering the Summer Marathon over in La Riv   He listens some more then says If its a Nokia  which is what it feels like and sounds like  then its digital rather than analog Wait He looks at Jack Your cell he says Its a Nokia Yes but why   Because digital phones are supposedly harder to snoop Henry says and goes back to the phone Its a digital and Ill put him on Im sure Jack can explain everything Henry hands him the telephone folds his hands primly in his lap and looks out the window exactly as he would if surveying the scenery And maybe he is Jack thinks Maybe in some weird fruitbat way he really is He pulls over to the shoulder on Highway  He doesnt like the cell phone to begin with  twentyfirstcentury slave bracelets he thinks them  but he absolutely loathes driving while talking on one Besides Irma Freneau isnt going anywhere this morning Dale he says Where are you Dale asks and Jack knows at once that the Fisherman has been busy elsewhere too As long as its not another dead kid he thinks Not that not yet please How come youre with Henry Is Fred Marshall there too Jack tells him about the change in plan and is about to go on when Dale breaks in Whatever youre doing I want you to get your ass out to a place called Eds Eats and Dawgs near Goltzs Henry can help you find it The Fisherman called the station Jack He called  Told us Irma Freneaus body is out there Well not in so many words but he did say she Dale is not quite babbling but almost Jack notes this as any good clinician would note the symptoms of a patient I need you Jack I really   Thats where we were headed anyway Jack says quietly although they are going absolutely nowhere at this moment just sitting on the shoulder while the occasional car blips past on  What Hoping that Dale and Henry are right about the virtues of digital technology Jack tells French Landings police chief about his morning delivery aware that Henry although still looking out the window is listening sharply He tells Dale that Ty Marshalls cap was on top of the box with the feathers and Irmas foot inside it Holy    Dale says sounding out of breath Holy shit Tell me what youve done Jack says and Dale does It sounds pretty good  so far at least  but Jack doesnt like the part about Arnold Hrabowski The Mad Hungarian has impressed him as the sort of fellow who will never be able to behave like a real cop no matter how hard he tries Back in LA they used to call the Arnie Hrabowskis of the world Mayberry RFDs Dale what about the phone at the Eleven Its a pay phone Dale says as if speaking to a child Yes but there could be fingerprints Jack says I mean there are going to be billions of fingerprints but forensics can isolate the freshest Easily He might have worn gloves but maybe not If hes leaving messages and calling cards as well as writing to the parents hes gone Stage Two Killing isnt enough for him anymore He wants to play you now Play with you Maybe he even wants to be caught and stopped like Son of Sam The phone Fresh fingerprints on the phone Dale sounds badly humiliated and Jacks heart goes out to him Jack I cant do this Im lost This is something to which Jack chooses not to speak Instead he says Whove you got who can see to the phone Dit Jesperson and Bobby Dulac I guess Bobby Jack thinks is entirely too good to waste for long at the Eleven outside town Just have them crisscross the phone with yellow tape and talk to the guy on duty Then they can come on out to the site Okay Dale hesitates then asks a question The defeat in it the sense of almost complete abrogation makes Jack sad Anything else Have you called the State Police County Does that FBI guy know The one who thinks he looks like Tommy Lee Jones Dale snorts Uh    actually Id decided to sit on notification for a little while Good Jack says and the savage satisfaction in his voice causes Henry to turn from his blind regard of the countryside and regard his friend instead eyebrows raised Let us rise up again  on wings as eagles as the Reverend Lance Hovdahl French Landings Lutheran pastor might say  and fly down the black ribbon of Highway  back toward town We reach Route  and turn right Closer and to our right is the overgrown lane that leads not to a dragons hidden gold or secret dwarf mines but to that peculiarly unpleasant black house A little farther on we can see the futuristic dome shape of Goltzs well    it seemed futuristic in the seventies at least All our landmarks are in place including the rubbly weedy path that shoots off from the main road to the left This is the track that leads to the remains of Ed Gilbertsons erstwhile palace of guilty pleasures Let us flutter onto the telephone line just across from this track Hot gossip tickles our birdy feet Paula Hrabowskis friend Myrtle Harrington passing on the news of the dead body or bodies at Eds to Richie Bumstead who will in turn pass it on to Beezer St Pierre grieving father and spiritual leader of the Thunder Five This passage of voices through the wire probably shouldnt please us but it does Gossip is no doubt nasty stuff but it does energize the human spirit Now from the west comes the cruiser with Tom Lund at the wheel and Dale Gilbertson in the shotgun seat And from the east comes Jacks burgundycolored Ram pickup They reach the turnoff to Eds at the same time Jack motions for Dale to go first then follows him We take wing fly above and then ahead of them We roost on the rusty Esso gas pump to watch developments Jack drives slowly down the lane to the halfcollapsed building that stands in a scruff of high weeds and goldenrod Hes looking for any sign of passage and sees only the fresh tracks made by Dale and Toms police car Weve got the place to ourselves he informs Henry Yes but for how long Not very would have been Jacks answer had he bothered to give one Instead he pulls up next to Dales car and gets out Henry rolls down his window but stays put as ordered Eds was once a simple wooden building about the length of a Burlington Northern boxcar and with a boxcars flat roof At the south end you could buy sofserve ice cream from one of three windows At the north end you could get your nasty hot dog or your even nastier order of fish and chips to go In the middle was a small sitdown restaurant featuring a counter and redtop stools Now the south end has entirely collapsed probably from the weight of snow All the windows have been broken in Theres some graffiti  Soandso chugs cock we fucked Patty Jarvis untill she howelled TROY LUVS MARYANN  but not as much as Jack might have expected All but one of the stools have been looted Crickets are conversing in the grass Theyre loud but not as loud as the flies inside the ruined restaurant There are lots of flies in there a regular fly convention in progress And  Do you smell it Dale asks him Jack nods Of course he does Hes smelled it already today but now its worse Because theres more of Irma out here to send up a stink Much more than what would fit into a single shoe box Tom Lund has produced a handkerchief and is mopping his broad distressed face Its warm but not warm enough to account for the sweat streaming off his face and brow And his skin is pasty Officer Lund Jack says Huh Tom jumps and looks rather wildly around at Jack You may have to vomit If you feel you must do it over there Jack points to an overgrown track even more ancient and illdefined than the one leading in from the main road This one seems to meander in the direction of Goltzs Ill be okay Tom says I know you will But if you need to unload dont do it on what may turn out to be evidence I want you to start stringing yellow tape around the entire building Dale tells his officer Jack A word Dale puts a hand on Jacks forearm and starts walking back toward the truck Although hes got a good many things on his mind Jack notices how strong that hand is And no tremble in it Not yet anyway What is it Jack asks impatiently when theyre standing near the passenger window of the truck We want a look before the whole world gets here dont we Wasnt that the idea or am I   You need to get the foot Jack Dale says And then Hello Uncle Henry you look spiff Thanks Henry says What are you talking about Jack asks That foot is evidence Dale nods I think it ought to be evidence found here though Unless of course you relish the idea of spending twentyfour hours or so answering questions in Madison Jack opens his mouth to tell Dale not to waste what little time they have with arrant idiocies then closes it again It suddenly occurs to him how his possession of that foot might look to minorleague smarties like Detectives Brown and Black Maybe even to a majorleague smarty like John Redding of the FBI Brilliant cop retires at an impossibly young age and to the impossibly bucolic town of French Landing Wisconsin He has plenty of scratch but the source of income is blurry to say the least And oh look at this all at once theres a serial killer operating in the neighborhood Maybe the brilliant cop has got a loose screw Maybe hes like those firemen who enjoy the pretty flames so much they get into the arson game themselves Certainly Dales Color Posse would have to wonder why the Fisherman would send an early retiree like Jack a victims body part And the hat Jack thinks Dont forget Tys baseball cap All at once he knows how Dale felt when Jack told him that the phone at the Eleven had to be cordoned off Exactly Oh man he says Youre right He looks at Tom Lund industriously running yellow POLICE LINE tape while butterflies dance around his shoulders and the flies continue their drunken buzzing from the shadows of Eds Eats What about him Tom will keep his mouth shut Dale says and on that Jack decides to trust him He wouldnt had it been the Hungarian I owe you one Jack says Yep Henry agrees from his place in the passenger seat Even a blind man could see he owes you one Shut up Uncle Henry Dale says Yes mon capitaine What about the cap Jack asks If we find anything else of Ty Marshalls    Dale pauses then swallows Or Ty himself well leave it If not you keep it for the time being I think maybe you just saved me a lot of major irritation Jack says leading Dale to the back of the truck He opens the stainless steel box behind the cab which he hasnt bothered to lock for the run out here and takes out one of the trashcan liners From inside it comes the slosh of water and the clink of a few remaining ice cubes The next time you get feeling dumb you might remind yourself of that Dale ignores this completely Ohgod he says making it one word Hes looking at the Baggie that has just emerged from the trashcan liner There are beads of water clinging to the transparent sides The smell of it Henry says with undeniable distress Oh the poor child You can smell it even through the plastic Jack asks Yes indeed And coming from there Henry points at the ruined restaurant and then produces his cigarettes If Id known I would have brought a jar of Vicks and an El Producto In any case theres no need to walk the Baggie with the gruesome artifact inside it past Tom Lund who has now disappeared behind the ruins with his reel of yellow tape Go on in Dale instructs Jack quietly Get a look and take care of the thing in that Baggie if you find    you know    her I want to speak to Tom Jack steps through the warped doorless doorway into the thickening stench Outside he can hear Dale instructing Tom to send Pam Stevens and Danny Tcheda back down to the end of the access road as soon as they arrive where they will serve as passport control The interior of Eds Eats will probably be bright by afternoon but now it is shadowy lit mostly by crazed crisscrossing rays of sun Galaxies of dust spin lazily through them Jack steps carefully wishing he had a flashlight not wanting to go back and get one from the cruiser until hes taken care of the foot He thinks of this as redeployment There are human tracks through the dust trash and drifts of old gray feathers The tracks are mansized Weaving in and out of them are a dogs pawprints Off to his left Jack spies a neat little pile of droppings He steps around the rusty remains of an overturned gas grill and follows both sets of tracks around the filthy counter Outside the second French Landing cruiser is rolling up In here in this darker world the sound of the flies has become a soft roar and the stench    the stench    Jack fishes a handkerchief from his pocket and places it over his nose as he follows the tracks into the kitchen Here the pawprints multiply and the human footprints disappear completely Jack thinks grimly of the circle of beatendown grass he made in the field of that other world a circle with no path of beatendown grass leading to it Lying against the far wall near a pool of dried blood is what remains of Irma Freneau The mop of her filthy strawberryblond hair mercifully obscures her face Above her on a rusty piece of tin that probably once served as a heat shield for the deepfat fryers two words have been written with what Jack feels sure was a black Sharpie marker Hello boys Ah fuck Dale Gilbertson says from almost directly behind him and Jack nearly screams Outside the snafu starts almost immediately Halfway back down the access road Danny and Pam not in the least disappointed to have been assigned guard duty once they have actually seen the slumped ruin of Eds and smelled the aroma drifting from it nearly have a headon with an old International Harvester pickup that is bucketing toward Eds at a good forty miles an hour Luckily Pam swings the cruiser to the right and the driver of the pickup  Teddy Runkleman  swings left The vehicles miss each other by inches and swerve into the grass on either side of this poor excuse for a road The pickups rusty bumper thumps against a small birch Pam and Danny get out of their unit hearts pumping adrenaline spurting Four men come spilling out of the pickups cab like clowns out of the little car in the circus Mrs Morton would recognize them all as regulars at Roys Store Layabouts she would call them What in the name of God are you doing Danny Tcheda roars His hand drops to the butt of his gun and then falls away a bit reluctantly Hes getting a headache The men Runkleman is the only one the officers know by name although between them they recognize the faces of the other three are goggleeyed with excitement How many ja find one of them spits Pam can actually see the spittle spraying out in the morning air a sight she could have done without How manyd the bastid kill Pam and Danny exchange a single dismayed look And before they can reply holy God here comes an old Chevrolet Bel Air with another four or five men inside it No one of them is a woman They pull up and spill out also like clowns from the little car But were the real clowns Pam thinks Us Pam and Danny are surrounded by eight semihysterical men and one semihysterical woman all of them throwing questions Hell Im going up there and see for myself Teddy Runkleman shouts almost jubilantly and Danny realizes the situation is on the verge of spinning out of control If these fools get the rest of the way up the access road Dale will first tear him a new asshole and then salt it down HOLD IT RIGHT THERE ALL OF YOU he bawls and actually draws his gun Its a first for him and he hates the weight of it in his hand  these are ordinary people after all not bad guys  but it gets their attention This is a crime scene Pam says finally able to speak in a normal tone of voice They mutter and look at one another worst fears confirmed She steps to the driver of the Chevrolet Who are you sir A Saknessum You look like a Saknessum Freddy he admits Well you get back in your vehicle Freddy Saknessum and the rest of you who came with him also get in and you back the hell right out of here Dont bother trying to turn around youll just get stuck But   the woman begins Pam thinks shes a Sanger a clan of fools if ever there was one Stow it and go Pam tells her And you right behind him Danny tells Teddy Runkleman He just hopes to Christ no more will come along or theyll end up trying to manage a parade in reverse He doesnt know how the news got out and at this moment cant afford to care Unless you want a summons for interfering with a police investigation That can get you five years He has no idea if there is such a charge but it gets them moving even better than the sight of his pistol The Chevrolet backs out rear end wagging from side to side like a dogs tail Runklemans pickup goes next with two of the men standing up in back and peering over the cab trying to catch sight of the old restaurants roof at least Their curiosity lends them a look of unpleasant vacuity The PD unit comes last herding the old car and older truck like a corgi herding sheep roofrack lights now pulsing Pam is forced to ride mostly on the brake and as she drives she lets loose a lowpitched stream of words her mother never taught her Do you kiss your kids goodnight with that mouth Danny asks not without admiration Shut up she says Then You got any aspirin I was going to ask you the same thing Danny says They get back out to the main road just in time Three more vehicles are coming from the direction of French Landing two from the direction of Centralia and Arden A siren rises in the warming air Another cruiser the third in what was supposed to be an unobtrusive line is coming along passing the lookieloos from town Oh man Danny sounds close to tears Oh man oh man oh man Its gonna be a carnival and I bet the staties still dont know Theyll have kittens Dale is gonna have kittens Itll be all right Pam says Calm down Well just pull across the road and park Also stick your gun back in the fucking holster Yes Mother He stows his piece as Pam swings across the access road pulling back to let the third cruiser through then pulling forward again to block the way Yeah maybe we caught it in time to put a lid on it Course we did They relax a little Both of them have forgotten the old stretch of road that runs between Eds and Goltzs but there are plenty of folks in town who know about it Beezer St Pierre and his boys for instance And while Wendell Green does not guys like him always seem able to find the back way Theyve got an instinct for it BEEZERS JOURNEY BEGAN with Myrtle Harrington the loving wife of Michael Harrington whispering down the telephone line to Richie Bumstead on whom she has an industrialstrength crush in spite of his having been married to her secondbest friend Glad who dropped down dead in her kitchen at the amazing age of thirtyone For his part Richie Bumstead has had enough macaronituna casseroles and whispervoiced phone calls from Myrtle to last him through two more lifetimes but this is one set of whispers hes glad even oddly relieved to listen to because he drives a truck for the Kingsland Brewing Company and has come to know Beezer St Pierre and the rest of the boys at least a little bit At first Richie thought the Thunder Five was a bunch of hoodlums those big guys with scraggly shoulderlength hair and foaming beards roaring through town on their Harleys but one Friday he happened to be standing alongside the one called Mouse in the paywindow line and Mouse looked down at him and said something funny about how working for love never made the paycheck look bigger and they got into a conversation that made Richie Bumsteads head spin Two nights later he saw Beezer St Pierre and the one called Doc shooting the breeze in the yard when he came offshift and after he got his rig locked down for the night he went over and got into another conversation that made him feel like hed walked into a combination of a raunchy blues bar and a Jeopardy championship These guys  Beezer Mouse Doc Sonny and Kaiser Bill  looked like rockin stompin redeyed violence but they were smart Beezer it turned out was head brewmaster in Kingsland Ales specialprojects division and the other guys were just under him They had all gone to college They were interested in making great beer and having a good time and Richie sort of wished he could get a bike and let it all hang out like them but a long Saturday afternoon and evening at the Sand Bar proved that the line between a high old time and utter abandon was too fine for him He didnt have the stamina to put away two pitchers of Kingsland play a decent game of pool drink two more pitchers while talking about the influences of Sherwood Anderson and Gertrude Stein on the young Hemingway get into some serious headbutting put down another couple of pitchers emerge clearheaded enough to go barrelassing through the countryside pick up a couple of experimental Madison girls smoke a lot of highgrade shit and romp until dawn You have to respect people who can do that and still hold down good jobs As far as Richie is concerned he has a duty to tell Beezer that the police have finally learned the whereabouts of Irma Freneaus body That busybody Myrtle said it was a secret Richie has to keep to himself but hes pretty sure that right after Myrtle gave him the news she called four or five other people Those people will call their best friends and in no time at all half of French Landing is going to be heading over on  to be in on the action Beezer has a better right to be there than most doesnt he Less than thirty seconds after getting rid of Myrtle Harrington Richie Bumstead looks up Beezer St Pierre in the directory and dials the number Richie I sure hope you arent shitting me Beezer says He called in yeah Beezer wants Richie to repeat it That worthless piece of shit in the DARE car the Mad Hungarian    And he said the girl was where Fuck the whole town is gonna be out there Beezer says But thanks man thanks a lot I owe you In the instant before the receiver slams down Richie thinks he hears Beezer start to say something else that gets dissolved in a scalding rush of emotion And in the little house on Nailhouse Row Beezer St Pierre swipes tears into his beard gently moves the telephone a few inches back on the table and turns to face Bear Girl his commonlaw spouse his old lady Amys mother whose real name is Susan Osgood and who is staring up at him from beneath her thick blond bangs one finger holding her place in a book Its the Freneau girl he says I gotta go Go Bear Girl tells him Take the cell phone and call me as soon as you can Yeah he says and plucks the cell phone from its charger and rams it into a front pocket of his jeans Instead of moving to the door he thrusts a hand into the huge redbrown tangle of his beard and absentmindedly combs it with his fingers His feet are rooted to the floor his eyes have lost focus The Fisherman called  he says Can you believe this shit They couldnt find the Freneau girl by themselves they needed him to tell them where to find her body Listen to me Bear Girl says and gets up and travels the space between them far more quickly than she seems to She snuggles her compact little body into his massive bulk and Beezer inhales a chestful of her clean soothing scent a combination of soap and fresh bread When you and the boys get out there its going to be up to you to keep them in line So you have to keep yourself in line Beezer No matter how angry you are you cant go nuts and start beating on people Cops especially I suppose you think I shouldnt go You have to I just dont want you to wind up in jail Hey he says Im a brewer not a brawler Dont forget it she says and pats him on the back Are you going to call them Street telephone Beezer walks to the door bends down to pick up his helmet and marches out Sweat slides down his forehead and crawls through his beard Two strides bring him to his motorcycle He puts one hand on the saddle wipes his forehead and bellows THE FUCKING FISHERMAN TOLD THAT FUCKING HUNGARIAN COP WHERE TO FIND IRMA FRENEAUS BODY WHOS COMING WITH ME On both sides of Nailhouse Row bearded heads pop out of windows and loud voices shout Wait Up Holy Shit and Yo Four vast men in leather jackets jeans and boots come barreling out of four front doors Beezer almost has to smile  he loves these guys but sometimes they remind him of cartoon characters Even before they reach him he starts explaining about Richie Bumstead and the  call and by the time he finishes Mouse Doc Sonny and Kaiser Bill are on their bikes and waiting for the signal But this heres the deal Beezer says Two things Were going out there for Amy and Irma Freneau and Johnny Irkenham not for ourselves We want to make sure everything gets done the right way and were not gonna bust anybodys head open not unless they ask for it You got that The others rumble mumble and grumble apparently in assent Four tangled beards wag up and down And number two when we do bust open somebodys head its gonna be the Fishermans Because we have put up with enough crap around here and now I am pretty damn sure its our turn to hunt down the fucking bastard who killed my little girl   Beezers voice catches in his throat and he raises his fist before continuing And dumped this other little girl in that fucking shack out on  Because I am going to get my hands on that fucking fuckhead and when I do I am gonna get RIGHTEOUS on his ass His boys his crew his posse shake their fists in the air and bellow Five motorcycles surge noisily into life Well take a look at the place from the highway and double back to the road behind Goltzs Beezer shouts and charges down the road and uphill on Chase Street with the others in his slipstream Through the middle of town they roll Beezer in the lead Mouse and Sonny practically on his tailpipe Doc and the Kaiser right behind their beards flowing in the wind The thunder of their bikes rattles the windows in Schmitts Allsorts and sends starlings flapping up from the marquee of the Agincourt Theater Hanging over the bars of his Harley Beezer looks a little bit like King Kong getting set to rip apart a jungle gym Once they get past the Eleven Kaiser and Doc move up alongside Sonny and Mouse and take up the entire width of the highway People driving west on  look at the figures charging toward them and swerve onto the shoulder drivers who see them in their rearview mirrors drift to the side of the road stick their arms out of their windows and wave them on As they near Centralia Beezer passes about twice as many cars as really ought to be traveling down a country highway on a weekend morning The situation is even worse than he figured it would be Dale Gilbertson is bound to have a couple of cops blocking traffic turning in from  but two cops couldnt handle more than ten or twelve ghouls dead set on seeing really seeing the Fishermans handiwork French Landing doesnt have enough cops to keep a lid on all the screwballs homing in on Eds Eats Beezer curses picturing himself losing control turning a bunch of twisted Fisherman geeks into tent pegs Losing control is exactly what he cannot afford to do not if he expects any cooperation from Dale Gilbertson and his flunkies Beezer leads his companions around a crappedout old red Toyota and is visited by an idea so perfect that he forgets to strike unreasoning terror into the beaters driver by looking him in the eye and snarling I make Kingsland Ale the best beer in the world you dimwit cur He has done this to two drivers this morning and neither one let him down The people who earn this treatment by either lousy driving or the possession of a truly ugly vehicle imagine that he is threatening them with some grotesque form of sexual assault and they freeze like rabbits they stiffen right up Jolly good fun as the citizens of Emerald City sang in The Wizard of Oz The idea that has distracted Beezer from his harmless pleasures possesses the simplicity of most valid inspirations The best way to get cooperation is to give it He knows exactly how to soften up Dale Gilbertson the answer is putting on a baseball cap grabbing its car keys and heading out the door  the answer lies all around him One small part of that answer sits behind the wheel of the red Toyota just being overtaken by Beezer and his jolly crew Wendell Green earned the mock rebuke he failed to receive on both of the conventional grounds His little car may not have been ugly to begin with but by now it is so disfigured by multiple dents and scrapes that it resembles a rolling sneer and Green drives with an unyielding arrogance he thinks of as dash He zooms through yellow lights changes lanes recklessly and tailgates as a means of intimidation Of course he blasts his horn at the slightest provocation Wendell is a menace The way he handles his car perfectly expresses his character being inconsiderate thoughtless and riddled with grandiosity At the moment he is driving even worse than usual because as he tries to overtake every other vehicle on the road most of his concentration is focused on the pocket tape recorder he holds up to his mouth and the golden words his equally golden voice pours into the precious machine Wendell often regrets the shortsightedness of the local radio stations in devoting so much air time to fools like George Rathbun and Henry Shake when they could move up to a new level simply by letting him give an ongoing commentary on the news for an hour or so every day Ah the delicious combination of Wendells words and Wendells voice  Edward R Murrow in his heyday never sounded so eloquent so resonant Here is what he is saying This morning I joined a virtual caravan of the shocked the grieving and the merely curious in a mournful pilgrimage winding eastward along bucolic Highway  Not for the first time this journalist was struck and struck deeply by the immense contrast between the loveliness and peace of the Coulee Countrys landscape and the ugliness and savagery one deranged human being has wrought in its unsuspecting bosom New paragraph The news had spread like wildfire Neighbor called neighbor friend called friend According to a morning  call to the French Landing police station the mutilated body of little Irma Freneau lies within the ruins of a former icecream parlor and caf called Eds Eats and Dawgs And who had placed the call Surely some dutiful citizen Not at all ladies and gentlemen not at all    Ladies and gentlemen this is frontline reportage this is the news being written while it happens a concept that cannot but murmur Pulitzer Prize to an experienced journalist The scoop had come to Wendell Green by way of his barber Roy Royal who heard it from his wife Tillie Royal who had been clued in by Myrtle Harrington herself and Wendell Green has done his duty to his readers he grabbed his tape recorder and his camera and ran out to his nasty little vehicle without pausing to telephone his editors at the Herald He doesnt need a photographer he can take all the photographs he needs with that dependable old Nikon FA on the passenger seat A seamless blend of words and pictures  a penetrating examination of the new centurys most hideous crime  a thoughtful exploration into the nature of evil  a compassionate portrayal of one communitys suffering  an unsparing expos of one police departments ineptitude  With all this going on in his mind as his mellifluous words drip one by one into the microphone of his upheld cassette recorder is it any wonder that Wendell Green fails to hear the sound of motorcycles or to take in the presence of the Thunder Five in any way until he happens to glance sideways in search of the perfect phrase Glance sideways he does and with a spurt of panic observes no more than two feet to his left Beezer St Pierre astride his roaring Harley apparently singing to judge from his own moving lips singing huh Cant be nope In Wendells experience Beezer St Pierre is far more likely to be cursing like a navvy in a waterfront brawl When after the death of Amy St Pierre Wendell who was merely obeying the ancient rules of his trade dropped in at  Nailhouse Row and inquired of the grieving father how it felt to know that his daughter had been slaughtered like a pig and partially eaten by a monster in human form Beezer had gripped the innocent newshound by the throat unleashed a torrent of obscenities and concluded by bellowing that if he should ever see Mr Green again he would tear off his head and use the stump as a sexual orifice It is this threat that causes Wendells moment of panic He glances into his rearview mirror and sees Beezers cohorts strung out across the road like an invading army of Goths In his imagination they are waving skulls on ropes made of human skin and yelling about what they are going to do to his neck after they rip his head off Whatever he was about to dictate into the invaluable machine instantly evaporates along with his daydreams of winning the Pulitzer Prize His stomach clenches and sweat bursts from every pore on his broad ruddy face His left hand trembles on the wheel his right shakes the cassette recorder like a castanet Wendell lifts his foot from the accelerator and slides down on the car seat turning his head as far to the right as he dares His basic desire is to curl up in the well beneath the dashboard and pretend to be a fetus The huge roar of sound behind him grows louder and his heart leaps in his chest like a fish Wendell whimpers A rank of kettledrums batters the air beyond the fragile skin of the car door Then the motorcycles swoop past him and race off up the highway Wendell Green wipes his face Slowly he persuades his body to sit up straight His heart ceases its attempt to escape his chest The world on the other side of his windshield which had contracted to the size of a housefly expands back to its normal size It occurs to Wendell that he was no more afraid than any normal human being would be under the circumstances Selfregard fills him like helium fills a balloon Most guys he knows would have driven right off the road he thinks most guys would have crapped in their pants What did Wendell Green do He slowed down a little thats all He acted like a gentleman and let the assholes of the Thunder Five drive past him When it comes to Beezer and his apes Wendell thinks being a gentleman is the better part of valor He picks up speed watching the bikers race on ahead In his hand the cassette recorder is still running Wendell raises it to his mouth licks his lips and discovers that he has forgotten what he was going to say Blank tape whirls from spool to spool Damn he says and pushes the OFF button An inspired phrase a melodious cadence has vanished into the ether perhaps for good But the situation is far more frustrating than that It seems to Wendell that a whole series of logical connections has vanished with the lost phrase he can remember seeing the shape of a vast outline for at least half a dozen penetrating articles that would go beyond the Fisherman to    do what Win him the Pulitzer for sure but how The area in his mind that had given him the immense outline still holds its shape but the shape is empty Beezer St Pierre and his goons murdered what now seems the greatest idea Wendell Green ever had and Wendell has no certainty that he can bring it back to life What are these biker freaks doing out here anyhow The question answers itself some creepy dogooder thought Beezer ought to know about the Fishermans  call and now the biker freaks are headed to the ruins of Eds just like him Fortunately so many other people are going to the same place that Wendell figures he can steer clear of his nemesis Taking no chances he drops a couple of cars behind the bikers The traffic thickens and slows down up ahead the bikers form a single line and zoom up alongside the line crawling toward the dusty old lane to Eds place From seventy or eighty yards back Wendell can see two cops a man and a woman trying to wave the rubberneckers along Every time a fresh car pulls up in front of them they have to go through the same pantomine of turning its occupants away and pointing down the road To reinforce the message a police car is parked sideways across the lane blocking anyone who should try to get fancy This spectacle troubles Wendell not at all for the press has automatic access to such scenes Journalists are the medium the aperture through which otherwise prohibited places and events reach the general public Wendell Green is the peoples representative here and the most distinguished journalist in western Wisconsin besides After he has inched along another thirty feet he sees that the cops riding herd on the traffic are Danny Tcheda and Pam Stevens and his complacency wavers A couple of days ago both Tcheda and Stevens had responded to his request for information by telling him to go to hell Pam Stevens is a knowitall bitch anyhow a professional ballbreaker Why else would a reasonably okaylooking dame want to be a cop Stevens would turn him away from the scene for the sheer hell of it  shed enjoy it Probably Wendell realizes he will have to sneak in somehow He pictures himself crawling through the fields on his belly and shivers with distaste At least he can have the pleasure of watching the cops giving the finger to Beezer and crew The bikers roar past another halfdozen cars without slowing down so Wendell supposes they plan on going into a flashy skidding turn dodging right by those two dumbbells in blue and zooming around the patrol car as if it didnt exist What will the cops do then Wendell wonders  drag out their guns and try to look fierce Fire warning shots and hit each other in the foot Astonishingly Beezer and his train of fellow bikers pay no attention to the cars attempting to move into the lane to Tcheda and Stevens or to anything else up there They do not even turn their heads to gape up at the ruined shack the chiefs car the pickup truck  which Wendell instantly recognizes  and the men standing on the beaten grass two of whom are Dale Gilbertson and the pickups owner Hollywood Jack Sawyer that snooty LA prick The third guy who is wearing an icecream hat sunglasses and a spiffy vest makes no sense at all at least not to Wendell He looks like he dropped in from some old Humphrey Bogart movie No they blast on by the whole messy scene with their helmets pointed straight ahead as if all they have in mind is cruising into Centralia and busting up the fixtures in the Sand Bar On they go all five of the bastards indifferent as a pack of wild dogs As soon as they hit open road again the other four move into parallel formation behind Beezer and fan out across the highway Then as one they veer off to the left send up five great plumes of dust and gravel and spin into five Uturns Without breaking stride  without even appearing to slow down  they separate into their onetwotwo pattern and come streaking back westward toward the crime scene and French Landing Ill be damned Wendell thinks Beezer turned tail and gave up What a wimp The knot of bikers grows larger and larger as it swoops toward him and soon the amazed Wendell Green makes out Beezer St Pierres grim face which beneath its helmet also gets larger and larger as it approaches I never figured you for a quitter Wendell says watching Beezer loom ever nearer The wind has parted his beard into two equal sections that flare out behind him on both sides of his head Behind his goggles Beezers eyes look as if he is aiming down the barrel of a rifle The thought that Beezer might turn those hunters eyes on him makes Wendells bowels feel dangerously loose Loser he says not very loudly With an earpounding roar Beezer flashes past the dented Toyota The rest of the Thunder Five hammer the air then streak down the road This evidence of Beezers cowardice brightens Wendells heart as he watches the bikers diminish in his rearview mirror but a thought he cannot ignore begins to worm its way upward through the synapses of his brain Wendell may not be the Edward R Murrow of the present day but he has been a reporter for nearly thirty years and he has developed a few instincts The thought winding through his mental channels sets off a series of wavelike alarms that at last push it into consciousness Wendell gets it  he sees the hidden design he understands whats going down Well hot doggy he says and with a wide grin blasts his horn cranks his wheel to the left and jolts into a turn with only minimal damage to his fender and that of the car in front of him You sneaky bastard he says nearly chuckling with delight The Toyota squeezes out of the line of vehicles pointed eastward and drifts over into the westbound lanes Clanking and farting it shoots away in pursuit of the crafty bikers There will be no crawling through cornfields for Wendell Green that sneaky bastard Beezer St Pierre knows a back way to Eds Eats All our star reporter has to do is hang back far enough to stay out of sight and he gets a free pass into the scene Beautiful Ah the irony Beezer gives the press a helpful hand  many thanks you arrogant thug Wendell hardly supposes that Dale Gilbertson will give him the run of the place but it will be harder to throw him out than to turn him away In the time he has he can ask a few probing questions snap a few telling photos and  above all  soak up enough atmosphere to produce one of his legendary color pieces With a cheerful heart Wendell poodles down the highway at fifty miles per hour letting the bikers race far ahead of him without ever letting them pass out of sight The number of cars coming toward him thins out to widely spaced groups of two and three then to a few single cars then to nothing As if they have been waiting to be unobserved Beezer and his friends swerve across the highway and go blasting up the driveway to Goltzs spaceage dome Wendell feels an unwelcome trickle of selfdoubt but he is not about to assume that Beezer and his louts have a sudden yearning for tractor hitches and riding lawn mowers He speeds up wondering if they have spotted him and are trying to throw him off their trail As far as he knows there is nothing up on that rise except the showroom the maintenance garage and the parking lot Damn place looks like a wasteland Beyond the parking lot    what On one side he remembers a scrubby field stretching away to the horizon on the other a bunch of trees like a forest only not as thick He can see the trees from where he is now running downhill like a windbreak Without bothering to signal he speeds across the oncoming lanes and into Goltzs driveway The sound of the motorcycles is still audible but growing softer and Wendell experiences a jolt of fear that they have somehow tricked him and are getting away jeering at him At the top of the rise he zooms around the front of the showroom and drives into the big lot Two huge yellow tractors stand in front of the equipment garage but his is the only car in sight At the far end of the empty lot a low concrete wall rises to bumper height between the asphalt and the meadow bordered by trees On the other side of the tree line the wall ends at the swoop of asphalt drive coming around from the back of the showroom Wendell cranks the wheel and speeds toward the far end of the wall He can still hear the motorcycles but they sound like a distant swarm of bees They must be about a half mile away Wendell thinks and jumps out of the Toyota He jams the cassette recorder in a jacket pocket slings the Nikon on its strap around his neck and runs around the low wall and into the meadow Even before he reaches the tree line he can see the remains of an old macadam road broken and overgrown cutting downhill between the trees Wendell imagines overestimating that Eds old place is about a mile distant and he wonders if his car could go the distance on this rough uneven surface In some places the macadam has fissured into tectonic plates in others it has crumbled away to black gravel Sinkholes and weedy rills radiate out from the thick snaking roots of the trees A biker could jounce over this mess reasonably well but Wendell sees that his legs will manage the journey better than his Toyota so he sets off down the old track through the trees From what he took in while he was on the highway he still has plenty of time before the medical examiner and the evidence wagon show up Even with the help of the famous Hollywood Sawyer the local cops are mooning around in a daze The sound of motorcycles grows louder as Wendell picks his way along as if the boys stopped moving in order to talk things over when they came to the far end of the old back road Thats perfect Wendell hopes they will keep jawing until he has nearly caught up with them he hopes they are shouting at one another and waving their fists in the air He wants to see them cranked to the gills on rage and adrenaline plus God knows what else those savages might have in their saddlebags Wendell would love to get a photograph of Beezer St Pierre knocking out Dale Gilbertsons front teeth with a wellaimed right or putting the choke hold on his buddy Sawyer The photograph Wendell wants most however and for the sake of which he is prepared to bribe every cop county functionary state official or innocent bystander capable of holding out his hand is a good clean dramatic picture of Irma Freneaus naked corpse Preferably one that leaves no doubt about the Fishermans depredations whatever they were Two would be ideal  one of her face for poignancy the other a fullbody shot for the perverts  but he will settle for the body shot if he has to An image like that would go around the world generating millions as it went The National Enquirer alone would fork over what  two hundred thousand three  for a photo of poor little Irma sprawled out in death mutilations clearly visible Talk about your gold mines talk about your Big Kahunas When Wendell has covered about a tenth of a mile of the miserable old road his concentration divided between gloating over all the money little Irma is going to siphon into his pockets and his fears of falling down and twisting his ankle the uproar caused by the Thunder Fives Harleys abruptly ceases The resulting silence seems immense then immediately fills with other quieter sounds Wendell can hear his breath struggling in and out and also some other noise a combined rattle and thud from behind him He whirls around and beholds far up the ruined road an ancient pickup lurching toward him Its almost funny the way the truck rocks from side to side as one tire then another sinks into an invisible depression or rolls up a tilting section of road surface That is it would be funny if these people were not horning in on his private access route to Irma Freneaus body Whenever the pickup climbs over a particularly muscularlooking length of tree root the four dark heads in the cab bob like marionettes Wendell takes a step forward intending to send these yokels back where they came from The trucks suspension scrapes against a flat rock and sparks leap from the undercarriage That thing must be thirty years old at least Wendell thinks  its one of the few vehicles on the road that looks even worse than his car When the truck jolts closer to him he sees that it is an International Harvester Weeds and twigs decorate the rusty bumper Does IH even make pickups anymore Wendell holds up his hand like a juror taking the oath and the truck jounces and dips over another few rutted feet before coming to a halt Its left side sits noticeably higher than the right In the darkness cast by the trees Wendell cannot quite make out the faces peering at him through the windshield but he has the feeling that at least two of them are familiar The man behind the wheel pokes his head out of the drivers window and says Hideyho Mr Bigshot Reporter They slam the front door in your face too It is Teddy Runkleman who regularly comes to Wendells attention while he is going over the days police reports The other three people in the cab bray like mules at Teddys wit Wendell knows two of them  Freddy Saknessum part of a lowlife clan that oozes in and out of various rundown shacks along the river and Toots Billinger a scrawny kid who somehow supports himself by scavenging scrap metal in La Riviere and French Landing Like Runkleman Toots has been arrested for a number of thirdrate crimes but never convicted of anything The hardworn scruffy woman between Freddy and Toots rings a bell too dim to identify Hello Teddy Wendell says And you Freddy and Toots No after I got a look at the mess out front I decided to come in the back way Hey Wendell doncha member me the woman says a touch pathetically Doodles Sanger in case your memorys all shot to hell I started out with a whole buncha guys in Freddys Bel Air and Teddy was with a whole nother bunch but after we got run off by Miss Bitch the rest of em wanted to go back to their barstools Of course he does remember her although the hardened face before him now only faintly resembles that of the bawdy party girl named Doodles Sanger who served up drinks at the Nelson Hotel a decade ago Wendell thinks she got fired more for drinking too much on the job than for stealing but God knows she did both Back then Wendell threw a lot of money across the bar at the Nelson Hotel He tries to remember if he ever hopped in the sack with Doodles He plays it safe and says Cripes Doodles how the hell could I forget a pretty little thing like you The boys get a big yuck out of this sally Doodles jabs her elbow into Toots Billingers vaporous ribs gives Wendell a pouty little smile and says Well thankee kind sir Yep he boffed her all right This would be the perfect time to order these morons back to their ratholes but Wendell is visited by gradeA inspiration How would you charming people like to assist a gentleman of the press and earn fifty bucks in the process Fifty each or all together asks Teddy Runkleman Come on all together Wendell says Doodles leans forward and says Twenty each all right bigtimer If we agree to do what you want Aw youre breakin my heart Wendell says and extracts his wallet from his back pocket and removes four twenties leaving only a ten and three singles to see him through the day They accept their payment and in a flash tuck it away Now this is what I want you to do Wendell says and leans toward the window and the four jackolantern faces in the cab A FEW MINUTES LATER the pickup lurches to a halt between the last of the trees where the macadam disappears into the weeds and tall grass The Thunder Fives motorcycles stand tilted in a neat row a few yards ahead and off to his left Wendell who has replaced Freddy Saknessum on the seat gets out and moves a few paces forward hoping that none of the ripe aroma of dried sweat unwashed flesh and stale beer emerging from his fellow passengers has clung to his clothing Behind him he hears Freddy jumping down from the back of the truck as the others climb out and shut the doors without making any more than twice as much noise as necessary All Wendell can see from his position is the colorless rotting rear wall of Eds Eats rising from a thick tangle of Queen Annes lace and tiger lilies Low voices one of them Beezer St Pierres come to him Wendell gives the Nikon a quick onceover removes the lens cap and cranks a new roll of film into place before moving with slow quiet steps past the bikes and along the side of the ruined structure Soon he is able to see the overgrown access road and the patrol car astride it like a barrier Down close to the highway Danny Tcheda and Pam Stevens wrangle with half a dozen men and women who have left their cars strewn like toys behind them Thats not going to work much longer if Tcheda and Stevens are supposed to be a dam the dam is about to spring some serious leaks Good news for Wendell a maximum amount of confusion would give him a lot more leeway and make for a more colorful story He wishes he could murmur into his recorder right now The inexperience of Chief Gilbertsons force was evident in the futile efforts of Officers Tcheda and Stevens to turn back the numbers of those citizens eager to witness for themselves the latest evidence of the Fishermans insanity    Ah something something then but this journalist was able to place himself at the heart of the scene where he felt proud and humbled to serve as the eyes and ears of his readers    Wendell hates to lose such splendid stuff but he cannot be sure he will remember it and he does not dare to take the risk of being overheard He moves closer to the front of Eds Eats The humble ears of the public take in the sound of Beezer St Pierre and Dale Gilbertson having a surprisingly amiable conversation directly in front of the building the humble eyes of the public observe Jack Sawyer walking into view an empty plastic bag and a baseball cap swinging from the fingers of his right hand The humble nose of the public reports a truly awful stench that guarantees the presence of a decomposing body in the shabby little structure to the right Jack is moving a little more quickly than usual and although it is clear that he is just going to his pickup he keeps glancing from side to side Whats going on here Golden Boy looks more than a little furtive Hes acting like a shoplifter just stuffing the goodies under his coat and golden boys shouldnt behave that way Wendell raises his camera and focuses in on his target There you are Jack old boy old fellow old sport crisp as a new bill and twice as sharp Look pretty for the camera now and let us see what youve got in your hand okay Wendell snaps a picture and watches through his viewfinder as Jack approaches his truck Golden Boy is going to stash those things in the glove compartment Wendell thinks and he doesnt want anyone to see him do it Too bad kid youre on Candid Camera And too bad for the proud yet humble eyes and ears of French County because when Jack Sawyer reaches his truck he does not climb in but leans over the side and fiddles around with something giving our noble journalist a fine view of his back and nothing else The noble journalist takes a picture anyhow to establish a sequence with the next photo in which Jack Sawyer turns away from his truck emptyhanded and no longer furtive He stashed his grubby treasures back there and got them out of sight but what made them treasures Then a lightning bolt strikes Wendell Green His scalp shivers and his crinkly hair threatens to straighten out A great story just became unbelievably great Fiendish Murderer Mutilated Dead Child and    the Downfall of a Hero Jack Sawyer walks out of the ruin carrying a plastic bag and a Brewers cap tries to make sure he is unobserved and hides the stuff in his truck He found those things in Eds Eats and he squirreled them away right under the nose of his friend and admirer Dale Gilbertson Golden Boy removed evidence from the scene of a crime And Wendell has the proof on film Wendell has the goods on the highandmighty Jack Sawyer Wendell is going to bring him down with one godalmighty huge crash Man oh man Wendell feels like dancing he does and is unable to restrain himself from executing a clumsy jig with the wonderful camera in his hands and a sloppy grin on his face He feels so good so triumphant that he almost decides to forget about the four idiots waiting for his signal and just pack it in But hey lets not get all warm and fuzzy here The supermarket tabloids are panting for a nice gruesome photograph of Irma Freneaus dead body and Wendell Green is the man to give it to them Wendell takes another cautious step toward the front of the ruined building and sees something that stops him cold Four of the bikers have gone down to the end of the overgrown lane where they seem to be helping Tcheda and Stevens turn away the people who want to get a good look at all the bodies Teddy Runkleman heard that the Fisherman stowed at least six maybe eight halfeaten kids in that shack the news grew more and more sensational as it filtered through the community So the cops can use the extra help but Wendell wishes that Beezer and crew were blowing the lid off things instead of helping to keep it on He comes to the end of the building and peers around it to see everything that is going on If he is to get what he wants he will have to wait for the perfect moment A second FLPD car noses in through the vehicles hovering out on  and moves up past Tchedas car to swing onto the weeds and rubble in front of the old store Two youngish parttime cops named Holtz and Nestler get out and stroll toward Dale Gilbertson trying hard not to react to the stench that gets more sickening with each step they take Wendell can see that these lads have even more difficulty concealing their dismay and astonishment at seeing their chief engaged in apparently amiable conversation with Beezer St Pierre whom they probably suspect of myriad nameless crimes They are farm boys UWCRiver Falls dropouts who split a single salary and are trying so hard to make the grade as police officers that they tend to see things in rigid blackandwhite Dale calms them down and Beezer who could pick each of them up with one hand and smash their skulls like softboiled eggs smiles benignly In response to what must have been Dales orders the new boys trot back down to the highway on the way casting worshipful glances at Jack Sawyer the poor saps Jack wanders up to Dale for a little confab Too bad Dale doesnt know that his buddy is concealing evidence hah Or Wendell considers does he know  is he in on it too One things for sure it will all come out in the wash once the Herald runs the telltale pictures In the meantime the dude in the straw hat and the sunglasses just stands there with his arms folded across his chest looking serene and confident like he has everything so under control that even the smell cant reach him This guy is obviously a key player Wendell thinks He calls the shots Golden Boy and Dale want to keep him happy you can see it in their body language A touch of respect of deference If they are covering something up theyre doing it for him But why And what the devil is he The guy is middleaged somewhere in his fifties a generation older than Jack and Dale he is too stylish to live in the country so hes from Madison maybe or Milwaukee He is obviously not a cop and he doesnt look like a businessman either This is one selfreliant mother that comes through loud and clear Then another police car breaches the defenses down on  and rolls up beside the parttimers Golden Boy and Gilbertson walk up to it and greet Bobby Dulac and that other one the fat boy Dit Jesperson but the dude in the hat doesnt even look their way Now thats cool He stands there all by himself like a general surveying his troops Wendell watches the mystery man produce a cigarette light up and exhale a plume of white smoke Jack and Dale walk the new arrivals into the old store and this bird keeps on smoking his cigarette sublimely detached from everything around him Through the rotting wall Wendell can hear Dulac and Jesperson complaining about the smell then one of them grunts Uh when he sees the body Hello boys Dulac says Is this shit for real Hello boys The voices give Wendell a good fix on the location of the corpse way back against the far wall Before the three cops and Sawyer begin to shuffle toward the front end of the store Wendell leans out aims his camera and snaps a photograph of the mystery man To his horror the Cat in the Hat instantly looks in his direction and says Who took my picture Wendell jerks himself back into the protection of the wall but he knows the guy must have seen him Those sunglasses were pointed right at him The guy has ears like a bat  he picked up the noise of the shutter Come on out Wendell hears him say Theres no point in hiding I know youre there From his reduced vantage point Wendell can just see a State Police car followed by French Landings DARE Pontiac barreling up from the congestion at the end of the lane Things seem to have reached the boiling point down there Unless Wendell is wrong he thinks he glimpses one of the bikers pulling a man out through the window of a nicelooking green Olds Time to call in the cavalry for sure Wendell steps back from the front of the building and waves to the troops Teddy Runkleman yells Hoo boy Doodles screeches like a cat in heat and Wendells four assistants charge past him making all the noise he could wish for DANNY TCHEDA and Pam Stevens already have their hands full with wouldbe gatecrashers when they hear the sound of motorcycles gunning toward them and the arrival of the Thunder Five is all they need to make their day really complete Getting rid of Teddy Runkleman and Freddy Saknessum had been easy enough but not five minutes later the eastbound lanes of Highway  filled up with people who thought they had a perfect right to gawk at all the little corpses that were supposed to be stacked up in the wreckage of Eds Eats For every car they finally manage to send away two more show up in its place Everybody demands a long explanation of why they as taxpayers and concerned citizens should not be allowed to enter a crime scene especially one so tragic so poignant so    well so exciting Most of them refuse to believe that the only body inside that tumbledown building is Irma Freneaus three people in a row accuse Danny of abetting a coverup and one of them actually uses the word Fishergate Yikes In a weird way lots of these corpse hunters almost think that the local police are protecting the Fisherman Some of them finger rosaries while they chew him out One lady waves a crucifix in his face and tells him he has a dirty soul and is bound for hell At least half of the people he turns away are carrying cameras What kind of person sets off on a Saturday morning to take pictures of dead children What gets Danny is this they all think theyre perfectly normal Whos the creep He is The husband of an elderly couple from Maid Marian Way says Young man apparently you are the only person in this county who does not understand that history is happening all around us Madge and I feel we have the right to a keepsake A keepsake Sweaty out of sorts and completely fed up Danny loses his cool Buddy I agree with you right down the line he says If it was up to me you and your lovely wife would be able to drive away with a bloodstained Tshirt maybe even a severed finger or two in your trunk But what can I say The chief is a very unreasonable guy Off zooms Maid Marian Way too shocked to speak The next guy in line starts yelling the moment Danny leans down to his window He looks exactly like Dannys image of George Rathbun but his voice is raspier and slightly higher in pitch Dont think I cant see what youre doing buster Danny says good because hes trying to protect a crime scene and the George Rathbun guy who is driving an old blue Dodge Caravan minus the front bumper and the right sideview mirror shouts I been sitting here twenty minutes while you and that dame do doodlysquat I hope you wont be surprised when you see some VIGILANTE ACTION around here It is at this tender moment that Danny hears the unmistakable rumble of the Thunder Five charging toward him down the highway He has not felt right since he found Tyler Marshalls bicycle in front of the old folks home and the thought of wrangling with Beezer St Pierre fills his brain with dark oily smoke and whirling red sparks He lowers his head and stares directly into the eyes of the redfaced George Rathbun lookalike His voice emerges in a low dead monotone Sir if you continue on your present course I will handcuff you park you in the back of my car until I am free to leave and then take you to the station and charge you with everything that comes to mind That is a promise Now do yourself a favor and get the hell out of here The mans mouth opens and closes goldfishlike Splotches of brighter red appear on his jowly already flushed face Danny keeps staring into his eyes almost hoping for an excuse to truss him in handcuffs and roast him in the back seat of his car The guy considers his options and caution wins He drops his eyes moves the shift lever to R and nearly backs into the Miata behind him I dont believe this is happening Pam says What dumb soandso spilled the beans Like Danny she is watching Beezer and his friends roar toward them past the row of waiting cars I dont know but Id like to ram my nightstick down his throat And after him Im looking for Wendell Green You wont have to look very far Hes about six cars back in the line Pam points to Wendells traveling sneer Good God Danny says Actually Im sort of glad to see that miserable blowhard Now I can tell him exactly what I think of him Smiling he bends down to speak to the teenaged boy at the wheel of the Miata The boy leaves and Danny waves off the driver behind him while watching the Thunder Five get closer and closer He says to Pam At this point if Beezer climbs up in my face and even looks like he wants to get physical Im pulling out my roscoe honest to God Paperwork paperwork Pam says I really dont give a damn Well here we go she says telling him that if he pulls his gun she will back him up Even the drivers trying to argue their way into the lane are taking time out to watch Beezer and the boys In motion hair and beards blowing faces set they look ready to commit as much mayhem as possible Danny Tchedas heart begins to speed and he feels his sphincter tighten But the Thunder Five bikers race past without so much as turning their heads one after another Beezer Mouse Doc Sonny and the Kaiser  there they go leaving the scene Well damn Danny says unable to decide if he feels relieved or disappointed The abrupt jolt of dismay he registers when the bikers wheel around in a comprehensive gravelspraying Uturn thirty yards up ahead tells him that what he had felt was relief Oh please no Pam says In the waiting automobiles every head turns as the motorcycles flash by again returning the way they came For a couple of seconds the only sound to be heard is the receding furor of five HarleyDavidson cycles Danny Tcheda takes off his uniform hat and wipes his forehead Pam Stevens arches her back and exhales Then someone blasts his horn and two other horns join in and a guy with a graying walrus mustache and a denim shirt is holding up a threequartersized badge in a leather case and explaining that he is the cousin of a countycircuit judge and an honorary member of the La Riviere police force which basically means he never gets speeding or parking tickets and can go wherever he likes The mustache spreads out in a big grin So just let me get by and you can go back to your business Officer Not letting him get by is his business Danny says and he is forced to repeat this message several times before he can get on to the next case After sending away a few more disgruntled citizens he checks to see how long he must wait before he can tell off Wendell Green Surely the reporter cannot be more than two or three cars back As soon as Danny raises his head horns blast and people start shouting at him Let us in Hey bud I pay your salary remember I wanna talk to Dale I wanna talk to Dale A few men have gotten out of their cars Their fingers are pointing at Danny their mouths are working but he cannot make out what they are yelling A band of pain runs like a redhot iron bar from behind his left eye to the middle of his brain Something is wrong he cannot see Greens ugly red car Where the hell is it Damn damn and double damn Green must have eased out of the line and driven into the field alongside Eds Danny snaps around and inspects the field Angry voices and car horns boil up at his back No beatup red Toyota no Wendell Green What do you know the windbag gave up A few minutes later the traffic thins out and Danny and Pam think their job is pretty much over All four lanes of Highway  are empty their usual condition on a Saturday morning The one truck that rolls along keeps on rolling on its way to Centralia Think we ought to go up there Pam asks nodding toward the remains of the store Maybe in a couple minutes Danny is not eager to get within range of that smell He would be perfectly happy to stay down here until the ME and the evidence wagon come along What gets into people anyhow He would happily surrender two days pay to be spared the sight of Irma Freneaus poor body Then he and Pam hear two distinct sounds at once and neither one makes them comfortable The first is that of a fresh wave of vehicles racing down the highway to their position the second the rumble of motorcycles descending upon the scene from somewhere behind the old store Is there a back road to this place he asks incredulous Pam shrugs Sounds like it But look  Dalell have to deal with Beezers goons because were gonna have our hands full down here Aw cripes Danny says Maybe thirty cars and pickups are converging on the end of the little lane and both he and Pam can see that these people are angrier and more determined than the first bunch At the far end of the crowd some men and women are leaving their vehicles on the shoulder and walking toward the two officers The drivers at the front of the pack are waving their fists and shouting even before they try to turn in Incredibly a woman and two teenage kids are holding up a long banner that reads WE WANT THE FISHERMAN A man in a dusty old Caddy thrusts his arm through the window and displays a handmade placard GILBERTSON MUST GO Danny looks over his shoulder and sees that the Thunder Five must have found a back road because four of them are standing out in front of Eds looking oddly like Secret Service agents while Beezer St Pierre is deep in discussion with the chief And what they look like it occurs to Danny is two heads of state working out a trade agreement This makes no sense at all and Danny turns back to the cars the lunatics with signs and the men and women working their way toward him and Pam A barrelchested seventyoneyearold man with a white goatee Hoover Dalrymple plants himself in front of Pam and starts demanding his inalienable rights Danny remembers his name because Dalrymple initiated a brawl in the bar of the Nelson Hotel about six months earlier and now here he is all over again getting his revenge I will not speak to your partner he yells and I will not listen to anything he says because your partner has no interest in the rights of the people of this community Danny sends away an orange Subaru driven by a sullen teenage boy in a Black Sabbath Tshirt then a black Corvette with La Riviere dealers plates and a strikingly pretty strikingly foulmouthed young woman Where do these people come from He does not recognize anyone except Hoover Dalrymple Most of the people in front of him now Danny supposes were hailed in from out of town He has set out to help Pam when a hand closes on his shoulder and he looks behind him to see Dale Gilbertson side by side with Beezer St Pierre The four other bikers hover a few feet away The one called Mouse who is of course roughly the size of a haystack catches Dales eye and grins What are you doing Danny asks Calm down Dale says Mr St Pierres friends have volunteered to assist our crowdcontrol efforts and I think we can use all the help they can give us Out of the side of his eye Danny glimpses the Neary twins breaking out of the front of the crowd and he holds up a hand to stop them What do they get out of this Simple information the chief says Okay boys get to work Beezers friends move apart and approach the crowd The chief moves beside Pam who first looks at him in amazement then nods Mouse snarls at Hoover Dalrymple and says By the power invested in me I order you to get the fuck out of here Hoover The old man vanishes so quickly he seems to have dematerialized The rest of the bikers have the same effect on the angry sightseers Danny hopes they can maintain their cool in the face of steady abuse a threehundredpound man who looks like a Hells Angel on a knife edge between selfcontrol and mounting fury works wonders on a rebellious crowd The biker nearest Danny sends Floyd and Frank Neary away just by raising his fist at them As they melt back to their car the biker winks at Danny and introduces himself as Kaiser Bill Beezers friend enjoys the process of controlling a crowd and an immense grin threatens to break through his scowl yet molten anger bubbles underneath just the same Who are the other guys Danny asks Kaiser Bill identifies Doc and Sonny who are dispersing the crowd to Dannys right Why are you guys doing this The Kaiser lowers his head so that his face hangs two inches from Dannys It is like confronting a bull Heat and rage pour from the broad features and hairy skin Danny almost expects to see steam puffing from the mans wide nostrils One of the pupils is smaller than the other explosive red wires tangle through the whites Why Were doing it for Amy Isnt that clear to you Officer Tcheda Sorry Danny mutters Of course He hopes Dale will be able to keep a lid on these monsters Watching Kaiser Bill rock an ancient Mustang belonging to a fool kid who failed to back up in time he is extremely happy that the bikers dont have any blunt instruments Through the vacant space formerly occupied by the kids Mustang a police car rolls toward Danny and the Kaiser As it makes its way through the crowd a woman wearing a sleeveless Tshirt and Capri pants bangs her hand against the passenger windows When the car reaches Danny the two parttimers Bob Holtz and Paul Nestler jump out gape at the Kaiser and ask if he and Pam need help Go up and talk to the chief Danny says though he should not have to Holtz and Nestler are nice guys but they have a lot to learn about chain of command along with everything else About a minute and a half later Bobby Dulac and Dit Jesperson show up Danny and Pam wave them through as the bikers charge into the fray and drag chanting citizens off the sides and hoods of their vehicles Sounds of struggle reach Danny over angry shouts coming from the mob before him It seems that he has been out here for hours Thrusting people out of the way with great backswings of his arms Sonny emerges to stand beside Pam who is doing her best Mouse and Doc wade into the clear A trail of blood leaking from his nose a red smear darkening his beard at the corner of his mouth the Kaiser strides up beside Danny Just as the crowd begins chanting HELL NO WE WONT GO HELL NO WE WONT GO Holtz and Nestler return to bolster the line Hell no we wont go Danny wonders Isnt that supposed to be about Vietnam Only dimly aware of the sound of a police siren Danny sees Mouse wade into the crowd and knock out the first three people he can reach Doc settles his hands on the open window of an alltoofamiliar Oldsmobile and asks the small balding driver what the hell he thinks he is doing Doc leave him alone Danny says but the siren whoops again and drowns out his words Although the little man at the wheel of the Olds looks like an ineffectual math teacher or a lowlevel civic functionary he possesses the determination of a gladiator He is the Reverend Lance Hovdahl Dannys old Sunday school teacher I thought I could help the reverend says What with all this racket I cant really hear you too good Let me help you get closer Doc says He reaches in through the window as the siren whoops again and a State Police car slides by on the other side Hold it Doc STOP Danny shouts seeing the two men in the state car Brown and Black craning their necks to stare at the spectacle of a bearded man built like a grizzly bear dragging a Lutheran minister out through the window of his car Creeping along behind them another surprise is Arnold Hrabowski the Mad Hungarian goggling through the windshield of his DAREmobile as if terrified by the chaos around him The end of the lane is like a war zone now Danny strides into the screaming mob and shoves a few people aside on his way to Doc and his old Sunday school teacher who looks shaken but not at all injured Well Danny my goodness the minister says Im certainly glad to see you here Doc glares at the two of them You know each other Reverend Hovdahl this is Doc Danny says Doc this is Reverend Hovdahl the pastor at Mount Hebron Lutheran Holy moly says Doc and immediately begins to pat the little mans lapels and tug at the hem of his jacket as if to pull him into shape Sorry Reverend I hope I didnt hurt you none The state cops and the Mad Hungarian manage at last to squeeze out of the crowd The sound level decreases to a mild hubbub  one way or another Docs friends have silenced the loudest members of the opposition Fortunately the window is wider than I am the reverend says Say maybe I could come over and talk to you someday says Doc Ive been doing a lot of reading about firstcentury Christianity lately You know Gza Verms John Dominic Crossan Paula Fredriksen stuff like that Id like to bounce some ideas off you Whatever Reverend Hovdahl intends to say is obliterated by the sudden explosion of noise from the other end of the lane A womans voice rises like a banshees in an inhuman screeching that shivers the hairs on the nape of Dannys neck It sounds to him as though escaped lunatics a thousand times more dangerous than the Thunder Five are raving through the landscape What the devil could have happened up there  Hello boys Unable to contain his indignation Bobby Dulac turns to stare first at Dale then at Jack His voice rises hardens Is this shit for real Hello boys Dale coughs into his fist and shrugs He wanted us to find her Well of course Jack says He told us to come here Why would he do that though Bobby asks Hes proud of his work From some dim crossroads in Jacks memory an ugly voice says Stay out of it You mess with me and Ill strew your guts from Racine to La Riviere Whose voice had that been With no more evidence than his conviction Jack understands that if he could place that voice he would put a name to the Fisherman He cannot all Jack Sawyer can do at this moment is remember a stink worse than the foul cloud that fills this crumbling building  a hideous smell that came from the southwest of another world That was the Fisherman too or whatever the Fisherman was in that world A thought worthy of the former rising star of the LAPDs Homicide Division awakens in his mind and he says Dale I think you should let Henry hear that  tape I dont get it What for Henrys tuned in to stuff even bats cant hear Even if he doesnt recognize the voice hell learn a hundred times more than what we know now Well Uncle Henry never forgets a voice thats true Okay lets get out of here The ME and the evidence wagon should show up in a couple of minutes Trailing behind the other two men Jack thinks of Tyler Marshalls Brewers cap and where he found it  that world he has spent more than half his life denying and his return to which this morning continues to send shocks through his system The Fisherman left the cap for him in the Territories the land he had first heard of when Jacky was six  when Jacky was six and Daddy played the horn It is all coming back to him that immense adventure not because he wishes it but because it has to come back forces outside himself are picking him up by the scruff of his neck and carrying him forward Forward into his own past The Fisherman is proud of his handiwork yes the Fisherman is deliberately taunting them  a truth so obvious none of the three men had to speak it aloud  but really the Fisherman is baiting only Jack Sawyer who alone has seen the Territories And if thats true as it has to be then   then the Territories and all they contain are involved somehow in these wretched crimes and he has been thrust into a drama of enormous consequence he cannot possibly grasp right now The Tower The Beam He had seen this in his mothers handwriting something about the Tower falling and the Beams breaking these things are parts of the puzzle whatever they mean as is Jacks gut conviction that Tyler Marshall is still alive tucked away in some pocket of the other world The recognition that he can never speak of all this to anyone else not even Henry Leyden makes him feel intensely alone Jacks thoughts blow away in the noisy chaos that erupts alongside and in front of the shack It sounds like an Indian attack in a cowboy movie whooping and yelling and the sound of running feet A woman sends up a shrill scream eerily like the blipblips of the police siren he had halfnoted a few moments ago Dale mutters Jeez and breaks into a run followed by Bobby and Jack Outside what appears to be a half dozen crazy people are racing around in the weedy gravel in front of Eds Dit Jesperson and Beezer still too stunned to react watch them caper back and forth The crazy people make an amazing amount of noise One man yells KILL THE FISHERMAN KILL THE DIRTY BASTARD Another is shouting LAW N ORDER N FREE BEER A scrawny character in bib overalls picks up FREE BEER WE WANT FREE BEER A harpy too old for her tank top and blue jeans skitters around waving her arms and screeching at the top of her lungs The grins on their faces indicate that these people are engaged in some dimwitted prank They are having the time of their lives Up from the end of the lane comes a State Police car with the Mad Hungarians DARE Pontiac right behind it In the middle of the chaos Henry Leyden tilts his head and smiles to himself When he sees his chief take off after one of the men fat Dit Jesperson lurches into action and spots Doodles Sanger against whom he has borne a grudge ever since she turned him down late one night in the Nelson Hotel Dit recognizes Teddy Runkleman the tall galoot with the broken nose Dale is chasing and he knows Freddy Saknessum but Freddy is undoubtedly too fast for him and besides Dit has the feeling that if he put his hands on Freddy Saknessum about eight hours later he would probably come down with something really nasty Bobby Dulac is on the skinny guys case so Doodles is Dits target and he looks forward to pulling her down into the weeds and making her pay for calling him what she did six years ago in the Nelsons filthy bar In front of maybe a dozen of French Landings most raffish characters Doodles had compared him to the then chiefs smelly waddling old mongrel Tubby Dit looks her in the eye and for a second she stops jumping around to stand flatfooted on the ground and give him a little comehither gesture with the fingers of both hands He launches himself at her but when he gets to where she was she is six feet off to the right shifting on her feet like a basketball player TubbyTubby she says Come and get it TubTub Furious Dit reaches misses and nearly loses his balance Doodles prances away laughing and mouths the hateful expression Dit doesnt get it  why doesnt Doodles just break away and take off  Its like she almost wants to get caught but first she has to run out the clock After another serious lunge that misses the target by only an inch or two Dit Jesperson wipes the sweat off his face and checks out the scene Bobby Dulac is snapping cuffs on the skinny guy but Dale and Hollywood Sawyer are faring only a little better than he is Teddy Runkleman and Freddy Saknessum dodge and bob away from their pursuers both of them cackling like idiots and shouting their halfwit slogans Why is lowlife scum always so agile Dit supposes that rodents like Runkleman and Saknessum get more practice in being light on their feet than regular people He charges Doodles who slips past him and goes into a chuckling highstepping diddleybop Over her shoulder Dit sees Hollywood finally fake out Saknessum wrap an arm around his waist and throw him to the ground You didnt have to get all physical on my ass Saknessum says His eyes shift and he gives a brief nod Hey Runks Teddy Runkleman glances at him and his eyes shift too He stops moving The chief says What you run out of gas Partys over Runkleman says Hey we were just funnin you know Aw Runksie I wanna play some more Doodles says throwing a few hip wiggles into the diddleybop In a flash Beezer St Pierre thrusts his mountainous self between her and Dit He steps forward rumbling like a semi going up a steep grade Doodles tries to dance backward but Beezer envelops her and carries her toward the chief Beezie doncha love me no more Doodles asks Beezer grunts in disgust and deposits her in front of the chief The two state cops Perry Brown and Jeff Black are hanging back looking even more disgusted than the biker If Dits mental processes were to be transcribed from their shorthand into standard English the result would be Hes gotta have something on the ball if he brews that Kingsland Ale because that is some fine fine beer And look at the chief Hes so ready to bust a gut he cant even see that were about to lose this case You were FUNNIN the chief roars Whats the MATTER with you idiots Dont you have any respect for that poor girl in there As the state cops step forward to take charge Dit sees Beezer go rigid with shock for a moment then move as inconspicuously as possible away from the group No one but Dit Jesperson pays any attention to him  the enormous biker has done his bit and now his part is over Arnold Hrabowski who had been more or less concealed behind Brown and Black shoves his hands in his pockets hunches his shoulders and gives Dit a glance of shamefaced apology Dit doesnt get it What does the Mad Hungarian have to feel so guilty about Hell he just got here Dit looks back at Beezer who is advancing ponderously toward the side of the shack and  surprise surprise  everybodys best pal and favorite reporter Mr Wendell Green now appearing a little alarmed Guess more than one kind of scum just rose to the surface Dit thinks Beezer likes women who are smart and levelheaded like Bear Girl brainless skanks like Doodles drive him crazy He reaches out grabs two handfuls of pasty rayoncovered flesh and scoops wriggling Doodles under his arm Doodles says Beezie doncha love me no more He lowers the dumb mutt to the ground in front of Dale Gilbertson When Dale finally explodes at these four grownup juvenile delinquents Beezer remembers the signal Freddy had given Runksie and looks over the chiefs shoulder at the front of the old store To the left of the rotting gray entrance Wendell Green is aiming his camera at the group before him getting fancy bending and leaning stepping to one side and another as he snaps pictures When he sees Beezer looking at him through his lens Wendell straightens up and lowers his camera He has an awkward little smile on his face Green must have slithered in through the back way Beezer imagines because theres no way the cops down front would give him a pass Come to think of it Doodles and the Dodos must have come the same way He hopes all of them did not learn of the back road by following him but thats a possibility The reporter lets his camera hang from its strap and keeping his eyes on Beezer sidles away from the old shanty The guilty frightened way he moves reminds Beezer of a hyenas slink toward its carrion Wendell Green does fear Beezer and Beezer cannot blame him Green is lucky that Beezer did not actually rip off his head instead of merely talking about it Yet    Greens hyenalike crawl strikes Beezer as pretty strange under the circumstances He cant be afraid of getting beaten up in front of all these cops can he Greens uneasiness forms a link in Beezers mind to the communication he had seen pass between Runkleman and Freddy When their eyes shifted when they looked away they were looking at the reporter He had set the whole thing up in advance Green was using the Dodos as a distraction from whatever he was doing with his camera of course Such total sleaziness such moral ugliness infuriates Beezer Galvanized by loathing he moves quietly away from Dale and the other policemen and walks toward Wendell Green keeping his eyes locked on the reporters He sees Wendell consider making a break for it then reject the idea most likely because he knows he doesnt have a chance of getting away When Beezer comes to within ten feet of him Green says We dont need any trouble here Mr St Pierre Im just doing my job Surely you can understand that I understand a lot of things Beezer says How much did you pay those clowns Who What clowns Wendell pretends to notice Doodles and the others for the first time Oh them Are they the ones who were making all that ruckus And why would they go do a thing like that Because theyre animals I guess The expression on Wendells face communicates a great desire to align himself with Beezer on the side of human beings as opposed to animals like Runkleman and Saknessum Taking care to fix Greens eyes instead of his camera with his own Beezer moves in closer and says Wendy youre a real piece of work you know that Wendell holds up his hands to ward off Beezer Hey we may have had our differences in the past but   Still looking him in the eye Beezer folds his right hand around the camera and plants his left on Wendell Greens chest He jerks the right hand back and gives Green a massive shove with the left One of two things is going to break Greens neck or the camera strap and he does not much care which it is to be To a sound like the crack of a whip the reporter flails backward barely managing to remain upright Beezer is pulling the camera out of the case from which dangle two strips of severed leather He drops the case and rotates the camera in his big hands Hey dont do that Wendell says his voice louder than speech but softer than a shout What is it an old FA If you know that you know its a classic Give it back to me Im not going to hurt it Im going to clean it out Beezer snaps open the back of the camera gets one thick finger under the exposed length of film and rips out the entire roll He smiles at the reporter and tosses the film into the weeds See how much better it feels without all that crap in there This is a nice little machine  you shouldnt fill it with garbage Wendell does not dare show how furious he is Rubbing the sore spot on the back of his neck he growls That socalled garbage is my livelihood you oaf you moron Now give me back my camera Beezer casually holds it out before him I didnt quite catch all of that What did you say His only response a bleak glance Wendell snatches the camera from Beezers hand When the two state cops finally step forward Jack feels a mixture of disappointment and relief What they are going to do is obvious so let them do it Perry Brown and Jeff Black will take the Fisherman case away from Dale and run their own investigation From now on Dale will be lucky to get random scraps from the states table Jacks greatest regret is that Brown and Black should have walked into this madhouse this circus They have been waiting for their moment all along  in a sense waiting for the local guy to prove his incompetence  but what is going on now is a public humiliation for Dale and Jack wishes it werent happening He could not have imagined feeling grateful for the arrival of a biker gang at a crime scene but thats how bad it is Beezer St Pierre and his companions kept the crowd away more efficiently than Dales officers The question is how did all those people find out Apart from the damage to Dales reputation and selfesteem however Jack has few regrets about the case passing to another jurisdiction Let Brown and Black scour every basement in French County Jack has the feeling they wont get any further than the Fisherman permits To go further he thinks youd have to travel in directions Brown and Black could never understand visit places they are certain do not exist Going further means making friends with opopanax and men like Brown and Black distrust anything that even smells like opopanax Which means that in spite of everything Jack has said to himself since the murder of Amy St Pierre he will have to catch the Fisherman by himself Or maybe not entirely by himself Dale is going to have a lot more time on his hands after all and no matter what the State Police do to him Dale is too wrapped up in this case to walk away from it Chief Gilbertson says Perry Brown I believe we have seen enough here Is this what you call securing an area Dale gives up on Teddy Runkleman and turns in frustration to the state cops who stand side by side like storm troopers In his expression Jack can see that he knows exactly what is going to happen and that he hopes it will not be humiliatingly brutal I did everything in my power to make this area secure Dale says After the  call came in I talked to my men face to face and ordered them to come out in pairs at reasonable intervals to keep from arousing any curiosity Chief you must have used your radio says Jeff Black Because for sure somebody was tuned in I did not use the radio Dale says And my people knew better than to spread the news But you know what Officer Black If the Fisherman called us on  maybe he also made a couple of anonymous calls to the citizens Teddy Runkleman has been attending to this discussion like a spectator at a tennis final Perry Brown says Lets handle first things first What do you intend to do with this man and his friends Are you going to charge them The sight of his face is getting on my nerves Dale thinks for a moment then says Im not going to charge them Get out of here Runkleman Teddy moves backward and Dale says Hold it for a second How did you get here The back road Teddy says Comes straight down from behind Goltzs Thunder Five came the same way So did that bigshot reporter Mr Green Wendell Green is here Teddy points to the side of the ruin Dale glances over his shoulder and Jack looks in the same direction and witnesses Beezer St Pierre ripping film from the back of a camera while Wendell Green watches in dismay One more question Dale says How did you learn that the Freneau girls body was out here They was five or six bodies up at Eds is what I heard My brother Erland called up and told me He heard it from his girlfriend Go on get out of here Dale says and Teddy Runkleman ambles away as if he has been awarded a medal for good citizenship All right Perry Brown says Chief Gilbertson you have reached the end of your leash As of now this investigation is to be conducted by Lieutenant Black and myself Ill want a copy of the  tape and copies of all notes and statements taken by you and your officers Your role is to be entirely subordinate to the states investigation and to cooperate fully when called upon You will be given updates at the discretion of Lieutenant Black and myself If you ask me Chief Gilbertson you are getting far more than you deserve I have never seen a more disorganized crime scene You violated the security of this site to an unbelievable degree How many of you walked into the    the structure Three Dale says Myself Officer Dulac and Lieutenant Sawyer Lieutenant Sawyer Brown says Excuse me has Lieutenant Sawyer rejoined the LAPD Has he become an official member of your department And if not why did you give him access to that structure In fact what is Mr Sawyer doing here in the first place Hes cleared more homicide cases than you and me ever will no matter how long we live Brown gives Jack an evil glance and Jeff Black stares straight ahead Beyond the two state cops Arnold Hrabowski also glances at Jack Sawyer though not at all the way Perry Brown did Arnolds expression is that of a man who deeply wishes to be invisible and when he finds Jacks eye on him he quickly glances sideways and shifts on his feet Oh Jack thinks Of course the Mad Mad Mad Mad Mad Hungarian there you go Perry Brown asks Dale what Mr St Pierre and his friends are doing on the scene and Dale replies that they are assisting with crowd control Did Dale advise Mr St Pierre that in exchange for this service he would be kept uptodate on the investigation It was something like that yes Jack steps back and begins to move sideways along a gentle arc that will bring him to Arnold Hrabowski Incredible says Brown Tell me Chief Gilbertson did you decide to delay a little bit before passing the news on to Lieutenant Black and myself  I did everything according to procedure Dale says In answer to the next question he says that yes he has called for the medical examiner and the evidence wagon which by the way he can see coming up the lane right now The Mad Hungarians efforts at selfcontrol succeed only in making him look as though he urgently needs to urinate When Jack places a hand on his shoulder he stiffens like a cigarstore Indian Calm down Arnold Jack says then raises his voice Lieutenant Black if youre taking over this case theres some information you should have Brown and Black turn their attention to him The man who made the  call used the pay phone at the Eleven store on Highway  in French Landing Dale had the phone taped off and the owner knows to keep people from handling it You might get some useful prints from that phone Black scribbles something in his notebook and Brown says Gentlemen I think your role is finished here Chief use your people to disperse those individuals at the bottom of the lane By the time the ME and I come out of that structure I dont want to see a single person down there including you and your officers Youll get a call later in the week if I have any new information Wordlessly Dale turns away and points Bobby Dulac down the path where the crowd has dwindled to a few stubborn souls leaning against their cars Brown and Black shake hands with the medical examiner and confer with the specialists in charge of the evidence wagon Now Arnold Jack says you like being a cop dont you Me I love being a cop Arnold cannot quite force himself to meet Jacks eyes And I could be a good one I know I could but the chief doesnt have enough faith in me He thrusts his trembling hands into his pants pockets Jack is torn between feeling pity for this pathetic wannabe and the impulse to kick him all the way down to the end of the lane A good cop Arnold couldnt even be a good scoutmaster Thanks to him Dale Gilbertson got a public dressingdown that probably made him feel as though hed been put in the stocks But you didnt follow orders did you Arnold Arnold quivers like a tree struck by lightning What I didnt do anything You told someone Maybe you told a couple of people No Arnold shakes his head violently I just called my wife thats all He looks imploringly at Jack The Fisherman talked to me he told me where he put the girls body and I wanted Paula to know Honest Holl  Lieutenant Sawyer I didnt think shed call anybody I just wanted to tell her Bad move Arnold Jack says You are going to tell the chief what you did and youre going to do it right now Because Dale deserves to know what went wrong and he shouldnt have to blame himself You like Dale dont you The chief  Arnolds voice wobbles with respect for his chief Sure I do Hes hes    hes great But isnt he going to fire me Thats up to him Arnold Jack says If you ask me you deserve it but maybe youll get lucky The Mad Hungarian shuffles off toward Dale Jack watches their conversation for a second then walks past them to the side of the old store where Beezer St Pierre and Wendell Green face each other in unhappy silence Hello Mr St Pierre he says And hello to you Wendell Im lodging a complaint Green says Im covering the biggest story of my life and this lout spoils a whole roll of film You cant treat the press that way we have a right to photograph whatever the hell we like I guess you woulda said you had a right to photograph my daughters dead body too Beezer glares at Jack This piece of shit paid Teddy and the other lunkheads to go nuts so nobody would notice him sneaking inside there He took pictures of the girl Wendell jabs a finger at Jacks chest He has no proof of that But Ill tell you something Sawyer I did get pictures of you You were concealing evidence in the back of your truck and I got you dead to rights So think twice before you try to mess with me because Ill hang you out to dry A dangerous red mist seems to fill Jacks head Were you going to sell photographs of that girls body Whats it to you An ugly smirk widens Wendell Greens mouth Youre not exactly lilywhite either are you Maybe we can do each other some good huh The red mist darkens and fills Jacks eyes We can do each other some good Standing beside Jack Beezer St Pierre clenches and unclenches his enormous fists Beezer Jack knows catches his tone perfectly but the vision of dollar signs has so gripped Wendell Green that he hears Jacks threat as a straightforward question You let me reload my camera and get the pictures I need and I keep quiet about you Beezer lowers his head and balls his hands again Tell you what Im a generous guy  maybe I could even cut you in say ten percent of my total Jack would prefer to break his nose but he contents himself with a hard punch to the reporters stomach Green clutches his gut and folds in half then falls to the ground His face has turned a hectic pink and he struggles for breath His eyes register shock and disbelief See Im a generous guy too Wendell I probably saved you thousands of dollars in dental work plus a broken jaw Dont forget the plastic surgery says Beezer grinding a fist into the palm of the other hand He looks as if someone just stole his favorite dessert off the dinner table Wendells face has become a reddish shade of purple For your information Wendell no matter what you think you saw I am not concealing evidence If anything I am revealing it though I hardly expect you to understand Green manages to wheeze in something like a cubic inch of air When your wind starts to come back get out of here Crawl if you have to Go back to your car and drive away And for Gods sake make it snappy or our friend here is likely to put you in a wheelchair for the rest of your life Slowly Wendell Green gets to his knees takes another noisy sip of oxygen and levers himself semiupright He waggles one open hand at them but his meaning is unclear He could be telling Beezer and Jack to stay away from him or that he will trouble them no further or both His trunk tilted over his belt his hands pressed to his stomach Green stumbles around the side of the building I guess I oughta thank you Beezer says You let me keep my promise to my old lady But I have to say Wendell Green is one guy Id really like to deconstruct Man Jack says I wasnt sure if I could get in before you did Its true my restraint was crumbling Both men smile Beezer St Pierre Beezer says and sticks out a hand Jack Sawyer Jack takes his hand and experiences no more than a second of pain Are you gonna let the state guys do all the work or will you keep going on your own What do you think Jack says If you ever need any help or you want reinforcements all you have to do is ask Because I do want to get this son of a bitch and I figure you have a better chance of finding him than anyone else On the drive back to Norway Valley Henry says Oh Wendell took a picture of the body all right When you came out of the building and went to your truck I heard someone take a couple of pictures but I thought it might have been Dale Then I heard it again when you and Dale were inside with Bobby Dulac and I realized someone was taking a picture of me Well now I say to myself this must be Mr Wendell Green and I told him to come out from behind the wall Thats when those people charged out yelling and screaming As soon as that happened I heard Mr Green trot around from the side go into the building and shoot a few pictures Then he sneaked out and stood by the side of the building which is where your friend Beezer caught up with him and took care of things Beezer is a remarkable fellow isnt he Henry were you going to tell me about this Of course but you were running around all over the place and I knew Wendell Green wasnt going to leave until he was thrown out Ill never read another word he writes Never Same here Jack says But youre not giving up on the Fisherman are you In spite of what that pompous state cop said I cant give up now To tell you the truth I think those waking dreams I mentioned yesterday were connected to this case Iveydivey Now lets get back to Beezer Didnt I hear him say he wanted to deconstruct Wendell Yeah I think so He must be a fascinating man I gather from my nephew that the Thunder Five spends Saturday afternoons and evenings in the Sand Bar Next week maybe Ill start up Rhodas old car and drive to Centralia have a few beers and a nice gab with Mr St Pierre Im sure he has interesting taste in music You want to drive to Centralia Jack stares at Henry whose only concession to the absurdity of this suggestion is a little smile Blind people can drive perfectly well Henry says Probably they can drive better than most sighted people Ray Charles can anyhow Come on Henry Why would you think Ray Charles can drive a car Why you ask Because one night in Seattle this was oh forty years ago back when I had a gig at KIRO Ray took me out for a spin Smooth as Lady Godivas backside No trouble at all We stuck to the side roads of course but Ray got up to fiftyfive Im pretty sure Assuming this really happened werent you scared Scared Of course not I was his navigator I certainly dont think Id have a problem navigating to Centralia along this sleepy stretch of backcountry highway The only reason blind people dont drive is that other people wont let them Its a power issue They want us to stay marginalized Beezer St Pierre would understand perfectly And here I was thinking I was going to visit the madhouse this afternoon Jack says AT THE TOP of the steep hill between Norway Valley and Arden the zigzag hairpin turns of Highway  now narrowed to two lanes straighten out for the long skislope descent into the town and on the eastern side of the highway the hilltop widens into a grassy plateau Two weatherbeaten red picnic tables wait for those who choose to stop for a few minutes and appreciate the spectacular view A patchwork of quilted farms stretches out over fifteen miles of gentle landscape not quite flat threaded with streams and country roads A solid row of bumpy bluegreen hills form the horizon In the immense sky sunwashed white clouds hang like fresh laundry Fred Marshall steers his Ford Explorer onto the gravel shoulder comes to a halt and says Let me show you something When he climbed into the Explorer at his farmhouse Jack was carrying a slightly worn black leather briefcase and the case is now lying flat across his knees Jacks fathers initials PSS for Philip Stevenson Sawyer are stamped in gold beside the handle at the top of the case Fred has glanced curiously at the briefcase a couple of times but has not asked about it and Jack has volunteered nothing There will be time for showandtell Jack thinks after he talks to Judy Marshall Fred gets out of the car and Jack slides his fathers old briefcase behind his legs and props it against the seat before he follows the other man across the pliant grass When they reach the first of the picnic tables Fred gestures toward the landscape We dont have a lot of what you could call tourist attractions around here but this is pretty good isnt it Its very beautiful Jack says But I think everything here is beautiful Judy really likes this view Whenever we go over to Arden on a decent day she has to stop here and get out of the car relax and look around for a while You know sort of store up on the important things before getting back into the grind Me sometimes I get impatient and think Come on youve seen that view a thousand times I have to get back to work but Im a guy right So every time we turn in here and sit down for a few minutes I realize my wife knows more than I do and I should just listen to what she says Jack smiles and sits down at the bench waiting for the rest of it Since picking him up Fred Marshall has spoken only two or three sentences of gratitude but it is clear that he has chosen this place to get something off his chest I went over to the hospital this morning and she  well shes different To look at her to talk to her youd have to say shes in much better shape than yesterday Even though shes still worried sick about Tyler its different Do you think that could be due to the medication I dont even know what theyre giving her Can you have a normal conversation with her From time to time yeah For instance this morning she was telling me about a story in yesterdays paper on a little girl from La Riviere who nearly took third place in the statewide spelling bee except she couldnt spell this crazy word nobody ever heard of Popoplax or something like that Opopanax Jack says He sounds like he has a fishbone caught in his throat You saw that story too Thats interesting you both picking up on that word Kind of gave her a kick She asked the nurses to find out what it meant and one of them looked it up in a couple of dictionaries Couldnt find it Jack had found the word in his Concise Oxford Dictionary its literal meaning was unimportant Thats probably the definition of opopanax Jack says   A word not to be found in the dictionary  A fearful mystery  Hah Fred Marshall has been moving nervously around the lookout area and now he stations himself beside Jack whose upward glance finds the other man surveying the long panorama Maybe that is what it means Freds eyes remain fixed on the landscape He is still not quite ready but he is making progress It was great to see her interested in something like that a tiny little item in the Herald    He wipes tears from his eyes and takes a step toward the horizon When he turns around he looks directly at Jack Uh before you meet Judy I want to tell you a few things about her Trouble is I dont know how this is going to sound to you Even to me it sounds    I dont know Give it a try Jack says Fred says Okay knits his fingers together and bows his head Then he looks up again and his eyes are as vulnerable as a babys Ahhh    I dont know how to put this Okay Ill just say it With part of my brain I think Judy knows something Anyhow I want to think that On the other hand I dont want to fool myself into believing that just because she seems to be better she cant be crazy anymore But I do want to believe that Boy oh boy do I ever Believe that she knows something The eerie feeling aroused by opopanax diminishes before this validation of his theory Something that isnt even real clear to her Fred says But do you remember She knew Ty was gone even before I told her He gives Jack an anguished look and steps away He knocks his fists together and stares at the ground Another internal barrier topples before his need to explain his dilemma Okay look This is what you have to understand about Judy Shes a special person All right a lot of guys would say their wives are special but Judys special in a special way First of all shes sort of amazingly beautiful but thats not even what Im talking about And shes tremendously brave but thats not it either Its like shes connected to something the rest of us cant even begin to understand But can that be real How crazy is that Maybe when youre going crazy at first you put up a big fight and get hysterical and then youre too crazy to fight anymore and you get all calm and accepting I have to talk to her doctor because this is tearing me apart What kinds of things does she say Does she explain why shes so much calmer Fred Marshalls eyes burn into Jacks Well for one thing Judy seems to think that Ty is still alive and that youre the only person who can find him All right Jack says unwilling to say more until after he can speak to Judy Tell me does Judy ever mention someone she used to know  or a cousin of hers or an old boyfriend  she thinks might have taken him His theory seems less convincing than it had in Henry Leydens ultrarational thoroughly bizarre kitchen Fred Marshalls response weakens it further Not unless hes named the Crimson King or Gorg or Abbalah All I can tell you is Judy thinks she sees something and even though it makes no sense I sure as hell hope its there A sudden vision of the world where he found a boys Brewers cap pierces Jack Sawyer like a steeltipped lance And thats where Tyler is If part of me didnt think that might just possibly be true Id go out of my mind right here and now Fred says Unless Im already out of my gourd Lets go talk to your wife Jack says From the outside French County Lutheran Hospital resembles a nineteenthcentury madhouse in the north of England dirty redbrick walls with blackened buttresses and lancet arches a peaked roof with finialcapped pinnacles swollen turrets miserly windows and all of the long facade stippled black with ancient filth Set within a walled parkland dense with oaks on Ardens western boundary the enormous building Gothic without the grandeur looks punitive devoid of mercy Jack halfexpects to hear the shrieking organ music from a Vincent Price movie They pass through a narrow peaked wooden door and enter a reassuringly familiar lobby A bored uniformed man at a central desk directs visitors to the elevators stuffed animals and sprays of flowers fill the gift shops window bathrobed patients tethered to IV poles occupy randomly placed tables with their families and other patients perch on the chairs lined against the side walls two whitecoated doctors confer in a corner Far overhead two dusty ornate chandeliers distribute a soft ocher light that momentarily seems to gild the luxurious heads of the lilies arrayed in tall vases beside the entrance of the gift shop Wow it sure looks better on the inside Jack says Most of it does Fred says They approach the man behind the desk and Fred says Ward D With a mild flicker of interest the man gives them two rectangular cards stamped VISITOR and waves them through The elevator clanks down and admits them to a woodpaneled enclosure the size of a broom closet Fred Marshall pushes the button marked  and the elevator shudders upward The same soft golden light pervades the comically tiny interior Ten years ago an elevator remarkably similar to this though situated in a grand Paris hotel had held Jack and a UCLA arthistory graduate student named Iliana Tedesco captive for two and a half hours in the course of which Ms Tedesco announced that their relationship had reached its final destination thank you despite her gratitude for what had been at least until that moment a rewarding journey together After thinking it over Jack decides not to trouble Fred Marshall with this information Better behaved than its French cousin the elevator trembles to a stop and with only a slight display of resistance slides open its door and releases Jack Sawyer and Fred Marshall to the fifth floor where the beautiful light seems a touch darker than in both the elevator and the lobby Unfortunately its way over on the other side Fred tells Jack An apparently endless corridor yawns like an exercise in perspective off to their left and Fred points the way with his finger They go through two big sets of double doors past the corridor to Ward B past two vast rooms lined with curtained cubicles turn left again at the closed entrance to Gerontology down a long long hallway lined with bulletin boards past the opening to Ward C then take an abrupt right at the mens and womens bathrooms pass Ambulatory Ophthalmology and Records Annex and at last come to a corridor marked WARD D As they proceed the light seems progressively to darken the walls to contract the windows to shrink Shadows lurk in the corridor to Ward D and a small pool of water glimmers on the floor Were in the oldest part of the building now Fred says You must want to get Judy out of here as soon as possible Well sure soon as Pat Skarda thinks shes ready But youll be surprised Judy kind of likes it in here I think its helping What she told me was she feels completely safe and the ones that can talk some of them are extremely interesting Its like being on a cruise she says Jack laughs in surprise and disbelief and Fred Marshall touches his shoulder and says Does that mean shes a lot better or a lot worse At the end of the corridor they emerge directly into a goodsized room that seems to have been preserved unaltered for a hundred years Dark brown wainscoting rises four feet from the dark brown wooden floor Far up in the gray wall to their right two tall narrow windows framed like paintings admit filtered gray light A man seated behind a polished wooden counter pushes a button that unlocks a doublesized metal door with a WARD D sign and a small window of reinforced glass You can go in Mr Marshall but who is he His name is Jack Sawyer Hes here with me Is he either a relative or a medical professional No but my wife wants to see him Wait here a moment The attendant disappears through the metal door and locks it behind him with a prisonlike clang A minute later the attendant reappears with a nurse whose heavy lined face big arms and hands and thick legs make her look like a man in drag She introduces herself as Jane Bond the head nurse of Ward D a combination of words and circumstances that irresistibly suggest at least a couple of nicknames The nurse subjects Fred and Jack then only Jack to a barrage of questions before she vanishes back behind the great door Ward Bond Jack says unable not to We call her Warden Bond says the attendant Shes tough but on the other hand shes unfair He coughs and stares up at the high windows We got this orderly calls her Doubleoh Zero A few minutes later Head Nurse Warden Bond Agent OO Zero swings open the metal door and says You may enter now but pay attention to what I say At first the ward resembles a huge airport hangar divided into a section with a row of padded benches a section with round tables and plastic chairs and a third section where two long tables are stacked with drawing paper boxes of crayons and watercolor sets In the vast space these furnishings look like dollhouse furniture Here and there on the cement floor painted a smooth anonymous shade of gray lie padded rectangular mats twenty feet above the floor small barred windows punctuate the far wall of red brick long ago given a couple of coats of white paint In a glass enclosure to the left of the door a nurse behind a desk looks up from a book Far down to the right well past the tables with art supplies three locked metal doors open into worlds of their own The sense of being in a hangar gradually yields to a sense of a benign but inflexible imprisonment A low hum of voices comes from the twenty to thirty men and women scattered throughout the enormous room Only a very few of these men and women are talking to visible companions They pace in circles stand frozen in place lie curled like infants on the mats they count on their fingers and scribble in notebooks they twitch yawn weep stare into space and into themselves Some of them wear green hospital robes others civilian clothes of all kinds Tshirts and shorts sweat suits running outfits ordinary shirts and slacks jerseys and pants No one wears a belt and none of the shoes have laces Two muscular men with closecropped hair and in brilliant white Tshirts sit at one of the round tables with the air of patient watchdogs Jack tries to locate Judy Marshall but he cannot pick her out I asked for your attention Mr Sawyer Sorry Jack says I wasnt expecting it to be so big Wed better be big Mr Sawyer We serve an expanding population She waits for an acknowledgment of her significance and Jack nods Very well Im going to give you some basic ground rules If you listen to what I say your visit here will be as pleasant as possible for all of us Dont stare at the patients and dont be alarmed by what they say Dont act as though you find anything they do or say unusual or distressing Just be polite and eventually they will leave you alone If they ask you for things do as you choose within reason But please refrain from giving them money any sharp objects or edibles not previously cleared by one of the physicians  some medications interact adversely with certain kinds of food At some point an elderly woman named Estelle Packard will probably come up to you and ask if you are her father Answer however you like but if you say no she will go away disappointed and if you say yes youll make her day Do you have any questions Mr Sawyer Where is Judy Marshall Shes on this side with her back to us on the farthest bench Can you see her Mr Marshall I saw her right away Fred says Have there been any changes since this morning Not as far as I know Her admitting physician Dr Spiegleman will be here in about half an hour and he might have more information for you Would you like me to take you and Mr Sawyer to your wife or would you prefer going by yourself  Well be fine Fred Marshall says How long can we stay Im giving you fifteen minutes twenty max Judy is still in the eval stage and I want to keep her stress level at a minimum She looks pretty peaceful now but shes also deeply disconnected and quite frankly delusional I wouldnt be surprised by another hysterical episode and we dont want to prolong her evaluation period by introducing new medication at this point do we So please Mr Marshall keep the conversation stressfree light and positive You think shes delusional Nurse Bond smiles pityingly In all likelihood Mr Marshall your wife has been delusional for years Oh shes managed to keep it hidden but ideations like hers dont spring up overnight no no These things take years to construct and all the time the person can appear to be a normally functioning human being Then something triggers the psychosis into fullblown expression In this case of course it was your sons disappearance By the way I want to extend my sympathies to you at this time What a terrible thing to have happened Yes it was says Fred Marshall But Judy started acting strange even before    Same thing Im afraid She needed to be comforted and her delusions  her delusional world  came into plain view because that world provided exactly the comfort she needed You must have heard some of it this morning Mr Marshall Did your wife mention anything about going to other worlds Going to other worlds Jack asks startled A fairly typical schizophrenic ideation Nurse Bond says More than half the people on this ward have similar fantasies You think my wife is schizophrenic Nurse Bond looks past Fred to take a comprehensive inventory of the patients in her domain Im not a psychiatrist Mr Marshall but I have had twenty long years of experience in dealing with the mentally ill On the basis of that experience I have to tell you in my opinion your wife manifests the classic symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia I wish I had better news for you She glances back at Fred Marshall Of course Dr Spiegleman will make the final diagnosis and he will be able to answer all your questions explain your treatment options and so forth The smile she gives Jack seems to congeal the moment it appears I always tell my new visitors its tougher on the family than it is on the patient Some of these people they dont have a care in the world Really you almost have to envy them Sure Jack says Who wouldnt Go on then she says with a trace of peevishness Enjoy your visit A number of heads turn as they walk slowly across the dusty wooden floor to the nearest row of benches many pairs of eyes track their progress Curiosity indifference confusion suspicion pleasure and an impersonal anger show in the pallid faces To Jack it seems as though every patient on the ward is inching toward them A flabby middleaged man in a bathrobe has begun to cut through the tables looking as though he fears missing his bus to work At the end of the nearest bench a thin old woman with streaming white hair stands up and beseeches Jack with her eyes Her clasped upraised hands tremble violently Jack forces himself not to meet her eyes When he passes her she halfcroons halfwhispers My duckywucky was behind the door but I didnt know it and there he was in all that water Um Fred says Judy told me her baby son drowned in the bath Through the side of his eye Jack has been watching the fuzzyhaired man in the bathrobe rush toward them openmouthed When he and Fred reach the back of Judy Marshalls bench the man raises one finger as if signaling the bus to wait for him and trots forward Jack watches him approach nuts to Warden Bonds advice Hes not going to let this lunatic climb all over him no way The upraised finger comes to within a foot of Jacks nose and the mans murky eyes search his face The eyes retreat the mouth snaps shut Instantly the man whirls around and darts off his robe flying his finger still searching out its target What was that Jack wonders Wrong bus Judy Marshall has not moved She must have heard the man rushing past her his rapid breath when he stopped then his flapping departure but her back is still straight in the loose green robe her head still faces forward at the same upright angle She seems detached from everything around her If her hair were washed brushed and combed if she were conventionally dressed and had a suitcase beside her she would look exactly like a woman on a bench at the train station waiting for the hour of departure So even before Jack sees Judy Marshalls face before she speaks a single word there is about her this sense of leavetaking of journeys begun and begun again  this suggestion of travel this hint of a possible elsewhere Ill tell her were here Fred whispers and ducks around the end of the bench to kneel in front of his wife The back of her head tilts forward over the erect spine as if to answer the tangled combination of heartbreak love and anxiety burning in her husbands handsome face Dark blond hair mingled with gold lies flat against the girlish curve of Judy Marshalls skull Behind her ear dozens of varicolored strands clump together in a cobwebby knot How you feeling sweetie Fred softly asks his wife Im managing to enjoy myself she says You know honey I should stay here for at least a little while The head nurse is positive Im absolutely crazy Isnt that convenient Jack Sawyers here Would you like to see him Judy reaches out and pats his upraised knee Tell Mr Sawyer to come around in front and you sit right here beside me Fred Jack is already coming forward his eyes on Judy Marshalls once again upright head which does not turn Kneeling Fred has taken her extended hand in both of his as if he intends to kiss it He looks like a lovelorn knight before a queen When he presses her hand to his cheek Jack sees the white gauze wrapped around the tips of her fingers Judys cheekbone comes into view then the side of her gravely unsmiling mouth then her entire profile is visible as sharp as the crack of ice on the first day of spring It is the regal idealized profile on a cameo or on a coin the slight upward curve of the lips the crisp chiseled downstroke of the nose the sweep of the jawline every angle in perfect tender oddly familiar alignment with the whole It staggers him this unexpected beauty for a fraction of a second it slows him with the deep grainy nostalgia of its fragmentary notquite evocation of anothers face Grace Kelly Catherine Deneuve No neither of these it comes to him that Judys profile reminds him of someone he has still to meet Then the odd second passes Fred Marshall gets to his feet Judys face in threequarter profile loses its regal quality as she watches her husband sit beside her on the bench and Jack rejects what has just occurred to him as an absurdity She does not raise her eyes until he stands before her Her hair is dull and messy beneath the hospital gown she is wearing an old blue lacetrimmed nightdress that looked dowdy when it was new Despite these disadvantages Judy Marshall claims him for her own at the moment her eyes meet his An electrical current beginning at his optic nerves seems to pulse downward through his body and he helplessly concludes that she has to be the most stunningly beautiful woman he has ever seen He fears that the force of his reaction to her will knock him off his feet then  even worse  that she will see what is going on and think him a fool He desperately does not want to come off as a fool in her eyes Brooke Greer Claire Evinrude Iliana Tedesco gorgeous as each of them was in her own way look like little girls in Halloween costumes next to her Judy Marshall puts his former beloveds on the shelf she exposes them as whims and fancies riddled with false ego and a hundred crippling insecurities Judys beauty is not put on in front of a mirror but grows with breathtaking simplicity straight from her innermost being what you see is only the small visible portion of a far greater more comprehensive radiant and formal quality within Jack can scarcely believe that agreeable goodhearted Fred Marshall actually had the fantastic luck to marry this woman Does he know how great how literally marvelous she is Jack would marry her in an instant if she were single It seems to him that he fell in love with her as soon as he saw the back of her head But he cannot be in love with her She is Fred Marshalls wife and the mother of their son and he will simply have to live without her She utters a short sentence that passes through him in a vibrating wave of sound Jack bends forward muttering an apology and Judy smilingly offers him a sweep of her hand that invites him to sit before her He folds to the floor and crosses his ankles in front of him still reverberating from the shock of having first seen her Her face fills beautifully with feeling She has seen exactly what just happened to him and it is all right She does not think less of him for it Jack opens his mouth to ask a question Although he does not know what the question is to be he must ask it The nature of the question is unimportant The most idiotic query will serve he cannot sit here staring at that wondrous face Before he speaks one version of reality snaps soundlessly into another and without transition Judy Marshall becomes a tiredlooking woman in her midthirties with tangled hair and smudges under her eyes who regards him steadily from a bench in a locked mental ward It should seem like a restoration of his sanity but it feels instead like a kind of trick as though Judy Marshall has done this herself to make their encounter easier on him The words that escape him are as banal as he feared they might be Jack listens to himself say that it is nice to meet her Its nice to meet you too Mr Sawyer Ive heard so many wonderful things about you He looks for a sign that she acknowledges the enormity of the moment that has just passed but he sees only her smiling warmth Under the circumstances that seems like acknowledgment enough How are you getting on in here he asks and the balance shifts even more in his direction The company takes some getting used to but the people here got lost and couldnt find their way back thats all Some of them are very intelligent Ive had conversations in here that were a lot more interesting than the ones in my church group or the PTA Maybe I should have come to Ward D sooner Being here has helped me learn some things Like what Like there are many different ways to get lost for one and getting lost is easier to do than anyone ever admits The people in here cant hide how they feel and most of them never found out how to deal with their fear How are you supposed to deal with that Why you deal with it by taking it on thats how You dont just say Im lost and I dont know how to get back  you keep on going in the same direction You put one foot in front of the other until you get more lost Everybody should know that Especially you Jack Sawyer Especial   Before he can finish the question an elderly woman with a lined sweet face appears beside him and touches his shoulder Excuse me She tucks her chin toward her throat with the shyness of a child I want to ask you a question Are you my father Jack smiles at her Let me ask you a question first Is your name Estelle Packard Eyes shining the old woman nods Then yes I am your father Estelle Packard clasps her hands in front of her mouth dips her head in a bow and shuffles backward glowing with pleasure When she is nine or ten feet away she gives Jack a little byebye wave of one hand and twirls away When Jack looks again at Judy Marshall it is as if she has parted her veil of ordinariness just wide enough to reveal a small portion of her enormous soul Youre a very nice man arent you Jack Sawyer I wouldnt have known that right away Youre a good man too Of course youre also charming but charm and decency dont always go together Should I tell you a few other things about yourself  Jack looks up at Fred who is holding his wifes hand and beaming I want you to say whatever you feel like saying There are things I cant say no matter how I feel but you might hear them anyhow I can say this however your good looks havent made you vain Youre not shallow and that might have something to do with it Mainly though you had the gift of a good upbringing Id say you had a wonderful mother Im right arent I Jack laughs touched by this unexpected insight I didnt know it showed You know one way it shows In the way you treat other people Im pretty sure you come from a background people around here only know from the movies but it hasnt gone to your head You see us as people not hicks and thats why I know I can trust you Its obvious that your mother did a great job I was a good mother too or at least I tried to be and I know what Im talking about I can see You say you were a good mother Why use   The past tense Because I was talking about before Freds smile fades into an expression of illconcealed concern What do you mean before Mr Sawyer might know she says giving Jack what he thinks is a look of encouragement Sorry I dont think I do he says I mean before I wound up here and finally started to think a little bit Before the things that were happening to me stopped scaring me out of my mind  before I realized I could look inside myself and examine these feelings Ive had over and over all my life Before I had time to travel I think Im still a good mother but Im not exactly the same mother Honey please says Fred You are the same you just had a kind of breakdown We ought to talk about Tyler We are talking about Tyler Mr Sawyer do you know that lookout point on Highway  right where it reaches the top of the big hill about a mile south of Arden I saw it today Jack says Fred showed it to me You saw all those farms that keep going and going And the hills off in the distance Yes Fred told me you loved the view from up there I always want to stop and get out of the car I love everything about that view You can see for miles and miles and then  whoops  it stops and you cant see any farther But the sky keeps going doesnt it The sky proves that theres a world on the other side of those hills If you travel you can get there Yes you can Suddenly there are goose bumps on Jacks forearms and the back of his neck is tingling Me I can only travel in my mind Mr Sawyer and I only remembered how to do that because I landed in the loony bin But it came to me that you can get there  to the other side of the hills His mouth is dry He registers Fred Marshalls growing distress without being able to reduce it Wanting to ask her a thousand questions he begins with the simplest one How did it come to you What do you mean by that Judy Marshall takes her hand from her husband and holds it out to Jack and he holds it in both of his If she ever looked like an ordinary woman now is not the time She is blazing away like a lighthouse like a bonfire on a distant cliff Lets say    late at night or if I was alone for a long time someone used to whisper to me It wasnt that concrete but lets say it was as if a person were whispering on the other side of a thick wall A girl like me a girl my age And if I fell asleep then I would almost always dream about the place where that girl lived I called it Faraway and it was like this world the Coulee Country only brighter and cleaner and more magical In Faraway people rode in carriages and lived in great white tents In Faraway there were men who could fly Youre right he says Fred looks from his wife to Jack in painful uncertainty and Jack says It sounds crazy but shes right By the time these bad things started to happen in French Landing I had pretty much forgotten about Faraway I hadnt thought about it since I was about twelve or thirteen But the closer the bad things came to Fred and Ty and me I mean the worse my dreams got and the less and less real my life seemed to be I wrote words without knowing I was doing it I said crazy things I was falling apart I didnt understand that Faraway was trying to tell me something The girl was whispering to me from the other side of the wall again only now she was grown up and scared half to death What made you think I could help It was just a feeling I had back when you arrested that Kinderling man and your picture was in the paper The first thing I thought when I looked at your picture was He knows about Faraway I didnt wonder how or how I could tell from looking at a picture I simply understood that you knew And then when Ty disappeared and I lost my mind and woke up in this place I thought if you could see into some of these peoples heads Ward D wouldnt be all that different from Faraway and I remembered seeing your picture And thats when I started to understand about traveling All this morning I have been walking through Faraway in my head Seeing it touching it Smelling that unbelievable air Did you know Mr Sawyer that over there they have jackrabbits the size of kangaroos It makes you laugh just to look at them Jack breaks into a wide grin and he bends to kiss her hand in a gesture much like her husbands Gently she takes her hand from his grasp When Fred told me he had met you and that you were helping the police I knew that you were here for a reason What this woman has done astonishes Jack At the worst moment of her life with her son lost and her sanity crumbling she used a monumental feat of memory to summon all of her strength and in effect accomplish a miracle She found within herself the capacity to travel From a locked ward she moved halfway out of this world and into another known only from childhood dreams Nothing but the immense courage her husband had described could have enabled her to have taken this mysterious step You did something once didnt you Judy asks him You were there in Faraway and you did something  something tremendous You dont have to say yes because I can see it in you its as plain as day But you have to say yes so I can hear it so say it say yes Yes Did what Fred asks In this dream country How can you say yes Wait Jack tells him I have something to show you later and returns to the extraordinary woman seated before him Judy Marshall is aflame with insight courage and faith and although she is forbidden to him now seems to be the only woman in this world or any other whom he could love for the rest of his life You were like me she says You forgot all about that world And you went out and became a policeman a detective In fact you became one of the best detectives that ever lived Do you know why you did that I guess the work appealed to me What about it appealed to you in particular Helping the community Protecting innocent people Putting away the bad guys It was interesting work And you thought it would never stop being interesting Because there would always be a new problem to solve a new question in need of an answer She has struck a bullseye that until this moment he did not know existed Thats right You were a great detective because even though you didnt know it there was something  something vital  you needed to detect I am a coppiceman Jack remembers His own little voice in the night speaking to him from the other side of a thick thick wall Something you had to find for the sake of your own soul Yes Jack says Her words have penetrated straight into the center of his being and tears spring to his eyes I always wanted to find what was missing My whole life was about the search for a secret explanation In memory as vivid as a strip of film he sees a great tented pavilion a white room where a beautiful and wasted queen lay dying and a little girl two or three years younger than his twelveyearold self amid her attendants Did you call it Faraway Judy asks I called it the Territories Speaking the words aloud feels like the opening of a chest filled with a treasure he can share at last Thats a good name Fred wont understand this but when I was on my long walk this morning I felt that my son was somewhere in Faraway  in your Territories Somewhere out of sight and hidden away In grave danger but still alive and unharmed In a cell Sleeping on the floor But alive Unharmed Do you think that could be true Mr Sawyer Wait a second Fred says I know you feel that way and I want to believe it too but this is the real world were talking about here I think there are lots of real worlds Jack says And yes I believe Tyler is somewhere in Faraway Can you rescue him Mr Sawyer Can you bring him back Its like you said before Mrs Marshall Jack says I must be here for a reason Sawyer I hope whatever youre going to show me makes more sense than the two of you do says Fred Were through for now anyhow Here comes the warden Driving out of the hospital parking lot Fred Marshall glances at the briefcase lying flat on Jacks lap but says nothing He holds his silence until he turns back onto  when he says Im glad you came with me Thank you Jack says I am too I feel sort of out of my depth here you know but Id like to get your impressions of what went on in there Do you think it went pretty well I think it went better than that Your wife is    I hardly know how to describe her I dont have the vocabulary to tell you how great I think she is Fred nods and sneaks a glance at Jack So you dont think shes out of her head I guess If thats crazy Id like to be crazy right along with her The twolane blacktop highway that stretches before them lifts up along the steep angle of the hillside and at its top seems to extend into the dimensionless blue of the enormous sky Another wary glance from Fred And you say youve seen this this place she calls Faraway I have yes As hard as that is to believe No crap No bs On your mothers grave On my mothers grave Youve been there And not just in a dream really been there The summer I was twelve Could I go there too Probably not Jack says This is not the truth since Fred could go to the Territories if Jack took him there but Jack wants to shut this door as firmly as possible He can imagine bringing Judy Marshall into that other world Fred is another matter Judy has more than earned a journey into the Territories while Fred is still incapable of believing in its existence Judy would feel at home over there but her husband would be like an anchor Jack had to drag along with him like Richard Sloat I didnt think so says Fred If you dont mind Id like to pull over again when we get to the top Id like that Jack says Fred drives to the crest of the hill and crosses the narrow highway to park in the gravel turnout Instead of getting out of the car he points at the briefcase lying flat on Jacks knees Is what youre going to show me in there Yes Jack says I was going to show it to you earlier but after we stopped here the first time I wanted to wait until I heard what Judy had to say And Im glad I did It might make more sense to you now that youve heard at least part of the explanation of how I found it Jack snaps open the briefcase raises the top and from its pale leatherlined interior removes the Brewers cap he had found that morning Take a look he says and hands over the cap Ohmygod Fred Marshall says in a startled rush of words Is this    is it     He looks inside the cap and exhales hugely at the sight of his sons name His eyes leap to Jacks Its Tylers Good Lord its Tylers Oh Lordy He crushes the cap to his chest and takes two deep breaths still holding Jacks gaze Where did you find this How long ago was it I found it on the road this morning Jack says In the place your wife calls Faraway With a long moan Fred Marshall opens his door and jumps out of the car By the time Jack catches up with him he is at the far edge of the lookout holding the cap to his chest and staring at the bluegreen hills beyond the long quilt of farmland He whirls to stare at Jack Do you think hes still alive I think hes alive Jack says In that world Fred points to the hills Tears leap from his eyes and his mouth softens The world thats over there somewhere Judy says In that world Then you go there and find him Fred shouts His face shining with tears he gestures wildly toward the horizon with the baseball cap Go there and bring him back damn you I cant do it so you have to He steps forward as if to throw a punch then wraps his arms around Jack Sawyer and sobs When Freds shoulders stop trembling and his breath comes in gasps Jack says Ill do everything I can I know you will He steps away and wipes his face Im sorry I yelled at you like that I know youre going to help us The two men turn around to walk back to the car Far off to the west a loose woolly smudge of pale gray blankets the land beside the river Whats that Jack asks Rain No fog Fred says Coming in off the Mississippi BY EVENING the temperature has dropped fifteen degrees as a minor cold front pushes through our little patch of the Coulee Country There are no thunderstorms but as the sky tinges toward violet the fog arrives Its born out of the river and rises up the inclined ramp of Chase Street first obscuring the gutters then the sidewalks then blurring the buildings themselves It cannot completely hide them as the fogs of spring and winter sometimes do but the blurring is somehow worse it steals colors and softens shapes The fog makes the ordinary look alien And theres the smell the ancient seagully odor that works deep into your nose and awakens the back part of your brain the part that is perfectly capable of believing in monsters when the sight lines shorten and the heart is uneasy On Sumner Street Debbi Anderson is still working dispatch Arnold the Mad Hungarian Hrabowski has been sent home without his badge  in fact suspended  and feels he must ask his wife a few pointed questions his belief that he already knows the answers makes him even more heartsick Debbi is now standing at the window a cup of coffee in her hand and a puckery little frown on her face Dont like this she says to Bobby Dulac who is glumly and silently writing reports It reminds me of the Hammer pictures I used to watch on TV back when I was in junior high Hammer pictures Bobby asks looking up Horror pictures she says looking out into the deepening fog A lot of them were about Dracula Also Jack the Ripper I dont want to hear nothing about Jack the Ripper Bobby says You mind me Debster And resumes writing In the parking lot of the Eleven Mr Rajan Patel stands beside his telephone still crisscrossed by yellow police tape and when it will be all right again for using this Mr Patel could not be telling us He looks toward downtown which now seems to rise from a vast bowl of cream The buildings on Chase Street descend into this bowl Those at Chases lowest point are visible only from the second story up If he is down there Mr Patel says softly and to no one but himself tonight he will be doing whatever he wants He crosses his arms over his chest and shivers Dale Gilbertson is at home for a wonder He plans to have a sitdown dinner with his wife and child even if the world ends because of it He comes out of his den where he has spent twenty minutes talking with WSP officer Jeff Black a conversation in which he has had to exercise all his discipline to keep from shouting and sees his wife standing at the window and looking out Her posture is almost exactly the same as Debbi Andersons only shes got a glass of wine in her hand instead of a cup of coffee The puckery little frown is identical River fog Sarah says dismally Isnt that ducky If hes out there   Dale points at her Dont say it Dont even think it But he knows that neither of them can help thinking about it The streets of French Landing  the foggy streets of French Landing  will be deserted right now no one shopping in the stores no one idling along the sidewalks no one in the parks Especially no children The parents will be keeping them in Even on Nailhouse Row where good parenting is the exception rather than the rule the parents will be keeping their kids inside I wont say it she allows That much I can do Whats for dinner How does chicken pot pie sound Ordinarily such a hot dish on a July evening would strike him as an awful choice but tonight with the fog coming in it sounds like just the thing He steps up behind her gives her a brief squeeze and says Great And earlier would be better She turns disappointed Going back in I shouldnt have to not with Brown and Black rolling the ball   Those pricks she says I never liked them Dale smiles He knows that the former Sarah Asbury has never cared much for the way he earns his living and this makes her furious loyalty all the more touching And tonight it feels vital as well Its been the most painful day of his career in law enforcement ending with the suspension of Arnold Hrabowski Arnie Dale knows believes he will be back on duty before long And the shitty truth is that Arnie may be right Based on the way things are going Dale may need even such an exquisite example of ineptitude as the Mad Hungarian Anyway I shouldnt have to go back in but    You have a feeling I do Good or bad She has come to respect her husbands intuitions not in the least because of Dales intense desire to see Jack Sawyer settled close enough to reach with seven keystrokes instead of eleven Tonight that looks to her like  pardon the pun  a pretty good call Both Dale says and then without explaining or giving Sarah a chance to question further Wheres Dave At the kitchen table with his crayons At six young David Gilbertson is enjoying a violent love affair with Crayolas has gone through two boxes since school let out Dale and Sarahs strong hope expressed even to each other only at night lying side by side before sleep is that they may be raising a real artist The next Norman Rockwell Sarah said once Dale  who helped Jack Sawyer hang his strange and wonderful pictures  has higher hopes for the boy Too high to express really even in the marriage bed after the lights are out With his own glass of wine in hand Dale ambles out to the kitchen What you drawing Dave What   He stops The crayons have been abandoned The picture  a halffinished drawing of what might be either a flying saucer or perhaps just a round coffee table  has also been abandoned The back door is open Looking out at the whiteness that hides Davids swing and jungle gym Dale feels a terrible fear leap up his throat choking him All at once he can smell Irma Freneau again that terrible smell of raw spoiled meat Any sense that his family lives in a protected magic circle  it may happen to others but it can never never happen to us  is gone now What has replaced it is stark certainty David is gone The Fisherman has enticed him out of the house and spirited him away into the fog Dale can see the grin on the Fishermans face He can see the gloved hand  its yellow  covering his sons mouth but not the bulging terrified childs eyes Into the fog and out of the known world David He moves forward across the kitchen on legs that feel boneless as well as nerveless He puts his wineglass down on the table the stem landing atilt on a crayon not noticing when it spills and covers Davids halffinished drawing with something that looks horribly like venous blood Hes out the door and although he means to yell his voice comes out in a weak and almost strengthless sigh David    Dave For a moment that seems to last a thousand years there is nothing Then he hears the soft thud of running feet on damp grass Blue jeans and a redstriped rugby shirt materialize out of the thickening soup A moment later he sees his sons dear grinning face and mop of yellow hair Dad Daddy I was swinging in the fog It was like being in a cloud Dale snatches him up There is a bad blinding impulse to slap the kid across the face to hurt him for scaring his father so It passes as quickly as it came He kisses David instead I know he says That must have been fun but its time to come in now Why Daddy Because sometimes little boys get lost in the fog he says looking out into the white yard He can see the patio table but it is only a ghost he wouldnt know what he was looking at if he hadnt seen it a thousand times He kisses his son again Sometimes little boys get lost he repeats Oh we could check in with any number of friends both old and new Jack and Fred Marshall have returned from Arden neither suggested stopping at Gerties Kitchen in Centralia when they passed it and both are now in their otherwise deserted houses For the balance of the ride back to French Landing Fred never once let go of his sons baseball cap and he has a hand on it even now as he eats a microwaved TV dinner in his too empty living room and watches Action News Five Tonights news is mostly about Irma Freneau of course Fred picks up the remote when they switch from shakycam footage of Eds Eats to a taped report from the Holiday Trailer Park The cameraman has focused on one shabby trailer in particular A few flowers brave but doomed straggle in the dust by the stoop which consists of three boards laid across two cement blocks Here on the outskirts of French Landing Irma Freneaus grieving mother is in seclusion says the onscene correspondent One can only imagine this single mothers feelings tonight The reporter is prettier than Wendell Green but exudes much the same aura of glittering unhealthy excitement Fred hits the OFF button on the remote and growls Why cant you leave the poor woman alone He looks down at his chipped beef on toast but he has lost his appetite Slowly he raises Tylers hat and puts it on his own head It doesnt fit and Fred for a moment thinks of letting out the plastic band at the back The idea shocks him Suppose that was all it took to kill his son That one simple deadly modification The idea strikes him as both ridiculous and utterly inarguable He supposes that if this keeps up hell soon be as mad as his wife    or Sawyer Trusting Sawyer is as crazy as thinking he might kill his son by changing the size of the boys hat    and yet he believes in both things He picks up his fork and begins to eat again Tys Brewers cap sitting on his head like Spankys beanie in an old Our Gang onereeler Beezer St Pierre is sitting on his sofa in his underwear a book open on his lap it is in fact a book of William Blakes poems but unread Bear Girls asleep in the other room and hes fighting the urge to bop on down to the Sand Bar and score some crank his old vice untouched for going on five years now Since Amy died he fights this urge every single day and lately he wins only by reminding himself that he wont be able to find the Fisherman  and punish him as he deserves to be punished  if hes fucked up on devil dust Henry Leyden is in his studio with a huge pair of Akai headphones on his head listening to Warren Vach John Bunch and Phil Flanigan dreamboat their way through I Remember April He can smell the fog even through the walls and to him it smells like the air at Eds Eats Like bad death in other words Hes wondering how Jack made out in good old Ward D at French County Lutheran And hes thinking about his wife who lately especially since the record hop at Maxtons although he doesnt consciously realize this seems closer than ever And unquiet Yes indeed all sorts of friends are available for our inspection but at least one seems to have dropped out of sight Charles Burnside isnt in the common room at Maxtons where an old episode of Family Ties is currently running on the ancient color TV bolted to the wall nor in the dining hall where snacks are available in the early evening nor in his own room where the sheets are currently clean but where the air still smells vaguely of old shit What about the bathroom Nope Thorvald Thorvaldson has stopped in to have a pee and a handwash but otherwise the place is empty One oddity theres a fuzzy slipper lying on its side in one of the stalls With its bright black and yellow stripes it looks like the corpse of a huge dead bumblebee And yes its the stall second from the left Burnys favorite Should we look for him Maybe we should Maybe not knowing exactly where that rascal is makes us uneasy Let us slip through the fog then silent as a dream down to lower Chase Street Here is the Nelson Hotel its ground floor now submerged in river fog the ocher stripe marking high water of that ancient flood no more than a whisper of color in the fading light On one side of it is Wisconsin Shoe now closed for the day On the other is Luckys Tavern where an old woman with bowlegs her name is Bertha Van Dusen if you care is currently bent over with her hands planted on her large knees yarking a bellyful of Kingsland OldTime Lager into the gutter She makes sounds like a bad driver grinding a manual transmission In the doorway of the Nelson Hotel itself sits a patient old mongrel who will wait until Bertha has gone back into the tavern then slink over to eat the halfdigested cocktail franks floating in the beer From Luckys comes the tired twanging voice of the late Dick Curless Ole Country OneEye singing about those Hainesville Woods where theres a tombstone every mile The dog gives a single disinterested growl as we pass him and slip into the Nelsons lobby where motheaten heads  a wolf a bear an elk and an ancient halfbald bison with a single glass eye  look at empty sofas empty chairs the elevator that hasnt worked since  or so and the empty registration desk Morty Fine the clerk is in the office with his feet propped up on an empty filecabinet drawer reading People and picking his nose The lobby of the Nelson Hotel always smells of the river  its in the pores of the place  but this evening the smell is heavier than usual Its a smell that makes us think of bad ideas blown investments forged checks deteriorating health stolen office supplies unpaid alimony empty promises skin tumors lost ambition abandoned sample cases filled with cheap novelties dead hope dead skin and fallen arches This is the kind of place you dont come to unless youve been here before and all your other options are pretty much foreclosed Its a place where men who left their families two decades before now lie on narrow beds with peestained mattresses coughing and smoking cigarettes The scuzzy old lounge where scuzzy old Hoover Dalrymple once held court and knocked heads most every Friday and Saturday night has been closed by unanimous vote of the town council since early June when Dale Gilbertson scandalized the local political elite by showing them a video of three traveling strippers who billed themselves as the Anal University Trio performing a synchronized cucumber routine on the tiny stage FLPD cameraman Officer Tom Lund lets give him a hand but the Nelsons residents still have only to go next door to get a beer its convenient You pay by the week at the Nelson You can keep a hot plate in your room but only by permission and after the cord has been inspected You can die on a fixed income at the Nelson and the last sound you hear could well be the creaking of bedsprings over your head as some other helpless old loser jacks off Let us rise up the first flight past the old canvas firehose in its glass box Turn right at the secondfloor landing past the pay phone with its yellowing OUT OF ORDER sign and continue to rise When we reach the third floor the smell of river fog is joined by the smell of chicken soup warming on someones hot plate the cord duly approved either by Morty Fine or George Smith the day manager The smell is coming from  If we slip through the keyhole there have never been keycards at the Nelson and never will be well be in the presence of Andrew Railsback seventy balding scrawny goodhumored He once sold vacuum cleaners for Electrolux and appliances for Sylvania but those days are behind him now These are his golden years A candidate for Maxtons we might think but Andy Railsback knows that place and places like it Not for him thanks Hes sociable enough but he doesnt want people telling him when to go to bed when to get up and when he can have a little nip of Early Times He has friends in Maxtons visits them often and has from time to time met the sparkling shallow predatory eye of our pal Chipper He has thought on more than one such occasion that Mr Maxton looks like the sort of fellow who would happily turn the corpses of his graduates into soap if he thought he could turn a buck on it No for Andy Railsback the third floor of the Nelson Hotel is good enough He has his hot plate he has his bottle of hooch hes got four packs of Bicycles and plays bigpicture solitaire on nights when the sandman loses his way This evening he has made three Lipton CupASoups thinking hell invite Irving Throneberry in for a bowl and a chat Maybe afterward theyll go next door to Luckys and grab a beer He checks the soup sees it has attained a nice simmer sniffs the fragrant steam and nods He also has saltines which go well with soup He leaves the room to make his way upstairs and knock on Irvs door but what he sees in the hallway stops him cold Its an old man in a shapeless blue robe walking away from him with suspicious quickness Beneath the hem of the robe the strangers legs are as white as a carps belly and marked with blue snarls of varicose veins On his left foot is a fuzzy blackandyellow slipper His right foot is bare Although our new friend cant tell for sure  not with the guys back to him  he doesnt look like anyone Andy knows Also hes trying doorknobs as he wends his way along the main thirdfloor hall He gives each one a single hard quick shake Like a turnkey Or a thief A fucking thief Yeah Although the man is obviously old  older than Andy it looks like  and dressed as if for bed the idea of thievery resonates in Andys mind with queer certainty Even the one bare foot arguing that the fellow probably didnt come in off the street has no power over this strong intuition Andy opens his mouth to call out  something like Can I help you or Looking for someone  and then changes his mind He just has this feeling about the guy It has to do with the fleet way the stranger scurries along as he tries the knobs but thats not all of it Not all of it by any means Its a feeling of darkness and danger There are pockets in the geezers robe Andy can see them and there might be a weapon in one of them Thieves dont always have weapons but    The old guy turns the corner and is gone Andy stands where he is considering If he had a phone in his room he might call downstairs and alert Morty Fine but he doesnt So what to do After a brief interior debate he tiptoes down the hall to the corner and peeps around Here is a culdesac with three doors   and at the very end  the only room in that little appendix which is currently occupied The man in  has been there since the spring but almost all Andy knows about him is his name George Potter Andy has asked both Irv and Hoover Dalrymple about Potter but Hoover doesnt know jackshit and Irv has learned only a little more You must Andy objected  this conversation took place in late May or early June around the time the Buckhead Lounge downstairs went dark I seen you in Luckys with him havin a beer Irv had lifted one bushy eyebrow in that cynical way of his Seen me havin a beer with him What are you hed rasped My fuckin wife Im just saying You drink a beer with a man you have a little conversation   Usually maybe Not with him I sat down bought a pitcher and mostly got the dubious pleasure of listenin to myself think I say What do you think about the Brewers this year and he says Theyll suck same as last year I can get the Cubs at night on my rahdio    That the way he said it Rahdio Well it aint the way I say it is it You ever heard me say rahdio I say radio same as any normal person You want to hear this or not Dont sound like theres much to hear You got that right buddy He says I can get the Cubs at night on my rahdio and thats enough for me I always went to Wrigley with my dad when I was a kid So I found out he was from Chi but otherwise bupkes The first thought to pop into Andys mind upon glimpsing the fucking thief in the thirdfloor corridor had been Potter but Mr George IKeeptoMyself Potter is a tall drink of water maybe sixfour still with a pretty good head of saltandpepper hair Mr OneSlipper was shorter than that hunched over like a toad A poison toad at that is the thought that immediately rises in Andys mind Hes in there Andy thinks Fucking thiefs in Potters room maybe going through Potters drawers looking for a little stash Fifty or sixty rolled up in the toe of a sock like I used to do Or stealing Potters radio His fucking rahdio Well and what was that to him You passed Potter in the hallway gave him a civil good morning or good afternoon and what you got back was an uncivil grunt Bupkes in other words You saw him in Luckys he was drinking alone far side of the jukebox Andy guessed you could sit down with him and hed split a pitcher with you  Irvs little ttette with the man proved that much  but what good was that without a little chinjaw to go along with it Why should he Andrew Railsback risk the wrath of some poison toad in a bathrobe for the sake of an old grump who wouldnt give you a yes no or maybe Well    Because this is his home cheesy as it might be thats why Because when you saw some crazy old oneslipper fuck in search of loose cash or the easily lifted rahdio you didnt just turn your back and shuffle away Because the bad feeling he got from the scurrying old elf the bad vibe his grandchildren would have said was probably nothing but a case of the chickenshits Because  Suddenly Andy Railsback has an intuition that while not a direct hit is at least adjacent to the truth Suppose it is a guy from off the street Suppose its one of the old guys from Maxton Elder Care Its not that far away and he knows for a fact that from time to time an old feller or old gal will get mixed up in his or her head and wander off the reservation Under ordinary circumstances that person would be spotted and hauled back long before getting this far downtown  kind of hard to miss on the street in an institutional robe and single slipper  but this evening the fog has come in and the streets are all but deserted Look at you Andy berates himself Scared half to death of a feller thats probably got ten years on you and peanut butter for brains Wandered in here past the empty desk  not a chance in the goddamn world Fines out front hell be in back reading a magazine or a stroke book  and now hes looking for his room back at Maxtons trying every knob on the goddamn corridor no more idea of where he is than a squirrel on a freeway ramp Potters probably having a beer next door this at least turns out to be true and left his door unlocked this we may be assured is not And although hes still frightened Andy comes all the way around the corner and walks slowly toward the open door His heart is beating fast because half his mind is still convinced the old man is maybe dangerous There was after all that bad feeling he got just from looking at the strangers back  But he goes God help him he does Mister he calls when he reaches the open door Hey mister I think you got the wrong room Thats Mr Potters room Dont you   He stops No sense talking because the room is empty How is that possible Andy steps back and tries the knobs of  and  Both locked up tight as he knew they would be With that ascertained he steps into George Potters room and has a good look around  curiosity killed the cat satisfaction brought him back Potters digs are a little larger than his but otherwise not much different its a box with a high ceiling they made places a man could stand up in back in the old days you had to say that much for them The single bed is sagging in the middle but neatly made On the night table is a bottle of pills these turn out to be an antidepressant called Zoloft and a single framed picture of a woman Andy thinks she took a pretty good whopping with the ugly stick but Potter must see her differently He has after all put the picture in a place where its the first thing he looks at in the morning and the last thing he sees at night Potter Andy asks Anyone Hello He is suddenly overcome with a sense of someone standing behind him and whirls around lips drawn back from his dentures in a grinning snarl that is half a cringe One hand comes up to shield his face from the blow he is suddenly certain will fall    only theres no one there Is he lurking behind the corner at the end of this short addendum to the main corridor No Andy saw the stranger go scurrying around that corner No way he could have gotten behind him again    unless he crawled along the ceiling like some kind of fly    Andy looks up there knowing hes being absurd giving in to the whimwhams big time but theres no one here to see him so what the hey And nothing for him to see overhead either Just an ordinary tin ceiling now yellowed by age and decades of cigar and cigarette smoke The radio  oh excuse me all to hell rahdio  is sitting on the windowsill unmolested Damn fine one too a Bose the kind Paul Harvey always talks about on his noon show Beyond it on the other side of the dirty glass is the fire escape Ahhah Andy thinks and hurries across to the window One look at the turned thumb lock and his triumphant expression fades He peers out just the same and sees a short stretch of wet black iron descending into the fog No blue robe no scaly bald pate Of course not The knob shaker didnt go out that way unless he had some magic trick to move the windows inside thumb lock back into place once he was on the fire escape landing Andy turns stands where he is a moment thinking then drops to his knees and looks under the bed What he sees is an old tin ashtray with an unopened pack of Pall Malls and a Kingsland OldTime Lager disposable lighter in it Nothing else except dust kittens He puts his hand on the coverlet preparatory to standing up and his eyes fix on the closet door Its standing ajar There Andy breathes almost too low for his own ears to hear He gets up and crosses to the closet door The fog may or may not come in on little cat feet as Carl Sandburg said but that is certainly how Andy Railsback moves across George Potters room His heart is beating hard again hard enough to start the prominent vein in the center of his forehead pulsing The man he saw is in the closet Logic demands it Intuition screams it And if the doorknob shakers just a confused old soul who wandered into the Nelson Hotel out of the fog why hasnt he spoken to Andy Why has he concealed himself  Because he may be old but hes not confused thats why No more confused than Andy is himself The doorknob shakers a fucking thief and hes in the closet Hes maybe holding a knife that he has taken from the pocket of his tatty old robe Maybe a coat hanger that hes unwound and turned into a weapon Maybe hes just standing there in the dark eyes wide fingers hooked into claws Andy no longer cares You can scare him you bet  hes a retired salesman not Superman  but if you load enough tension on top of fright you turn it into anger same as enough pressure turns coal into a diamond And right now Andy is more pissed off than scared He closes his fingers around the cool glass knob of the closet door He squeezes down on it He takes one breath    a second    steeling himself getting ready    psyching himself up the grandkids would say    one more breath just for good luck and    With a low stressful sound  half growl and half howl  Andy yanks the closet door wide setting off a chatter of hangers He crouches hands up in fists looking like some ancient sparring partner from the Gym Time Forgot Come outta there you fucking   No one there Four shirts one jacket two ties and three pairs of pants hanging like dead skin A battered old suitcase that looks as if it has been kicked through every Greyhound Bus terminal in North America Nothing else Not a goddamn th  But there is Theres something on the floor beneath the shirts Several somethings Almost half a dozen somethings At first Andy Railsback either doesnt understand what hes seeing or doesnt want to understand Then it gets through to him imprints itself on his mind and memory like a hoofprint and he tries to scream He cant He tries again and nothing comes out but a rusty wheeze from lungs that feel no larger than old prune skins He tries to turn around and cant do that either He is sure George Potter is coming and if Potter finds him here Andys life will end He has seen something George Potter can never allow him to talk about But he cant turn Cant scream Cant take his eyes from the secret in George Potters closet Cant move Because of the fog nearly full dark has arrived in French Landing unnaturally early its barely sixthirty The blurry yellow lights of Maxton Elder Care look like the lights of a cruise ship lying becalmed at sea In Daisy wing home of the wonderful Alice Weathers and the far less wonderful Charles Burnside Pete Wexler and Butch Yerxa have both gone home for the day A broadshouldered peroxide blonde named Vera Hutchinson is now on the desk In front of her is a book entitled EZ Minute Crosswords She is currently puzzling over  Across Garfield for example Six letters first is F third is L sixth is E She hates these tricky ones Theres the swoosh of a bathroom door opening She looks up and sees Charles Burnside come shuffling out of the mens in his blue robe and a pair of yellowandblack striped slippers that look like great fuzzy bumblebees She recognizes them at once Charlie she asks putting her pencil in her crossword book and closing it Charlie just goes shuffling along jaw hanging down a long runner of drool also hanging down But he has an unpleasant half grin on his face that Vera doesnt care for This one may have lost most of his marbles but the few left in his head are mean marbles Sometimes she knows that Charlie Burnside genuinely doesnt hear her when she speaks or doesnt understand her but shes positive that sometimes he just pretends not to understand She has an idea this is one of the latter times Charlie what are you doing wearing Elmers bee slippers You know his greatgranddaughter gave those to him The old man  Burny to us Charlie to Vera  just goes shuffling along in a direction that will eventually take him back to D Assuming he stays on course that is Charlie stop Charlie stops He stands at the head of Daisys corridor like a machine that has been turned off His jaw hangs The string of drool snaps and all at once theres a little wet spot on the linoleum beside one of those absurd but amusing slippers Vera gets up goes to him kneels down before him If she knew what we know shed probably be a lot less willing to put her defenseless white neck within reach of those hanging hands which are twisted by arthritis but still powerful But of course she does not She grasps the left bee slipper Lift she says Charles Burnside lifts his right foot Oh quit being such a turkey she says Other one Burny lifts his left foot a little just enough for her to get the slipper off Now the right one Unseen by Vera who is looking at his feet Burny pulls his penis from the fly of his loose pajama pants and pretends to piss on Veras bowed head His grin widens At the same time he lifts his right foot and she removes the other slipper When she looks back up Burnys wrinkled old tool is back where it belongs He considered baptizing her he really did but he has created almost enough mischief for one evening One more little chore and hell be off to the land of dreamy dreams Hes an old monster now He needs his rest All right Vera says Want to tell me why one of these is dirtier than the other No answer She hasnt really expected one Okay beautiful Back to your room or down to the common room if you want Theres microwave popcorn and JellO pops tonight I think Theyre showing The Sound of Music Ill see that these slippers get back to where they belong and you taking them will be our little secret Take them again and Ill have to report you though Capisce Burny just stands there vacant    but with that nasty little grin lifting his wrinkled old chops And that light in his eyes He capisces all right Go on Vera says And you better not have dropped a load on the floor in there you old buzzard Again she expects no reply but this time she gets one Burnys voice is low but perfectly clear Keep a civil tongue you fat bitch or Ill eat it right out of your head She recoils as if slapped Burny stands there with his hands dangling and that little grin on his face Get out of here she says Or I really will report you And a great lot of good that would do Charlie is one of Maxtons cash cows and Vera knows it Charlie recommences his slow walk Pete Wexler has dubbed this particular gait the Old Fucks Shuffle now in his bare feet Then he turns back The bleary lamps of his eyes regard her The word youre looking for is feline Garfields a feline Got it Stupid cow With that he continues his trip down the corridor Vera stands where she is looking at him with her own jaw hanging She has forgotten all about her crossword puzzle In his room Burny lies down on his bed and slips his hands into the small of his back From there down he aches like a bugger Later he will buzz for the fat old bitch get her to bring him an ibuprofen For now though he has to stay sharp One more little trick still to do Found you Potter he murmurs Good    old    Potsie Burny hadnt been shaking doorknobs at all not that Andy Railsback will ever know this He had been feeling for the fellow who diddled him out of a sweet little Chicago housing deal back in the late seventies South Side home of the White Sox Blacktown in other words Lots of federal money in that one and several bushels of Illinois dough as well Enough skim available to last for years more angles than on a baseball field but George Go Fuck Your Mother Potter had gotten there first cash had changed hands beneath the proverbial table and Charles Burnside or perhaps then hed still been Carl Bierstone its hard to remember had been out in the cold But Burny has kept track of the thief for lo these many years Well not Burny himself actually but as we must by now have realized this is a man with powerful friends Old Potsie  what his friends called him in the days when he still had a few  declared bankruptcy in La Riviere back in the nineties and lost most of what he still had hidden away during the Great DotCom Wreck of Double Aught But thats not good enough for Burny Potsie requires further punishment and the coincidence of that particular fuckhead washing up in this particular fuckhole of a town is just too good to pass up Burnys principal motive  a brainless desire to keep stirring the pot to make sure bad goes to worse  hasnt changed but this will serve that purpose too So he traveled to the Nelson doing so in a way Jack understands and Judy Marshall has intuited homing in on Potsies room like some ancient bat And when he sensed Andy Railsback behind him he was of course delighted Railsback will save him having to make another anonymous call and Burny is in truth getting tired of doing all their work for them Now back in his room all comfycozy except for the arthritis that is he turns his mind away from George Potter and begins to Summon Looking up into the dark Charles Burnsides eyes begin to glow in a distinctly unsettling way Gorg he says Gorg teelee Dinnit a abbalah Samman Tansy Samman a montah a Irma Dinnit a abbalah Gorg Dinnit a Ram Abbalah Gorg Gorg come Serve the abbalah Find Tansy Find the mother of Irma Serve the abbalah Gorg Serve the Crimson King Burnys eyes slip closed He goes to sleep with a smile on his face And beneath their wrinkled lids his eyes continue to glow like hooded lamps Morty Fine the night manager of the Nelson Hotel is halfasleep over his magazine when Andy Railsback comes bursting in startling him so badly that Morty almost tumbles out of his chair His magazine falls to the floor with a flat slap Jesus Christ Andy you almost gave me a heart attack Morty cries You ever hear of knocking or at least clearing your goddam throat Andy takes no notice and Morty realizes the old fella is as white as a sheet Maybe hes the one having the heart attack It wouldnt be the first time one occurred in the Nelson You gotta call the police Andy says Theyre horrible Dear Jesus Morty theyre the most horrible pictures I ever saw    Polaroids    and oh man I thought he was going to come back in    come back in any second    but at first I was just froze and I    I    Slow down Morty says concerned What are you talking about Andy takes a deep breath and makes a visible effort to get himself under control Have you seen Potter he asks The guy in  Nope Morty says but most nights hes in Luckys around this time having a few beers and maybe a hamburger Although why anybody would eat anything in that place I dont know Then perhaps associating one ptomaine palace with another Hey have you heard what the cops found out at Eds Eats Trevor Gordon was by and he said   Never mind Andy sits in the chair on the other side of the desk and stares at Morty with wet terrified eyes Call the police Do it right now Tell them that the Fisherman is a man named George Potter and he lives on the third floor of the Nelson Hotel Andys face tightens in a hard grimace then relaxes again Right down the hall from yours truly Potter Youre dreaming Andy That guys nothing but a retired builder Wouldnt hurt a fly I dont know about flies but he hurt the hell out of some little kids I seen the Polaroids he took of them Theyre in his closet Theyre the worst things you ever saw Then Andy does something that amazes Morty and convinces him that this isnt a joke and probably not just a mistake either Andy Railsback begins to cry Tansy Freneau aka Irma Freneaus grieving mother is not actually grieving yet She knows she should be but grief has been deferred Right now she feels as if she is floating in a cloud of warm bright wool The doctor Pat Skardas associate Norma Whitestone gave her five milligrams of lorazepam four or five hours ago but thats only the start The Holiday Trailer Park where Tansy and Irma have lived since Cubby Freneau took off for Green Bay in ninetyeight is handy to the Sand Bar and she has a parttime thing going with Lester Moon one of the bartenders The Thunder Five has dubbed Lester Moon Stinky Cheese for some reason but Tansy unfailingly calls him Lester which he appreciates almost as much as the occasional boozy grapple in Tansys bedroom or out back of the Bar where theres a mattress and a black light in the storeroom Around five this evening Lester ran over with a quart of coffee brandy and four hundred milligrams of OxyContin all considerately crushed and ready for snorting Tansy has done half a dozen lines already and she is cruising Looking over old pictures of Irma and just    you know    cruising What a pretty baby she was Tansy thinks unaware that not far away a horrified hotel clerk is looking at a very different picture of her pretty baby a nightmare Polaroid he will never be able to forget It is a picture Tansy herself will never have to look at suggesting that perhaps there is a God in heaven She turns a page GOLDEN MEMORIES has been stamped on the front of her scrapbook and here are Tansy and Irma at the Mississippi Electrix company picnic back when Irma was four and Mississippi Electrix was still a year away from bankruptcy and everything was more or less all right In the photo Irma is wading with a bunch of other tykes her laughing face smeared with chocolate ice cream Looking fixedly at this snapshot Tansy reaches for her glass of coffee brandy and takes a small sip And suddenly from nowhere or the place from which all our more ominous and unconnected thoughts float out into the light of our regard she finds herself remembering that stupid Edgar Allan Poe poem they had to memorize in the ninth grade She hasnt thought of it in years and has no reason to now but the words of the opening stanza rise effortlessly and perfectly in her mind Looking at Irma she recites them aloud in a toneless pauseless voice that no doubt would have caused Mrs Normandie to clutch her stringy white hair and groan Tansys recitation doesnt affect us that way instead it gives us a deep and abiding chill It is like listening to a poetry reading given by a corpse Once upon a mihnigh dreary while I ponnered weak n weary over many a quaint n curris volume of forgotten lore while I nodded nearly nappin sunly there came a tappin as of someone genly rappin rappin at my chamber door   At this precise moment there comes a soft rapping at the cheap fiberboard door of Tansy Freneaus Airstream She looks up eyes floating lips pursed and glossed with coffee brandy Lesser Is that you It might be she supposes Not the TV people at least she hopes not She wouldnt talk to the TV people sent them packing She knows in some deep and sadly cunning part of her mind that they would lull her and comfort her only to make her look stupid in the glare of their lights the way that the people on the Jerry Springer Show always end up looking stupid No answer    and then it comes again Tap Taptap Tis some visitor she says getting up Its like getting up in a dream Tis some visitor I murmured tappin at my chamber door only this n nothin more Tap Taptap Not like curled knuckles Its a thinner sound than that A sound like a single fingernail Or a beak She crosses the room in her haze of drugs and brandy bare feet whispering on carpet that was once nubbly and is now balding the exmother She opens the door onto this foggy summer evening and sees nothing because shes looking too high Then something on the welcome mat rustles Something some black thing is looking up at her with bright inquiring eyes Its a raven omigod its Poes raven come to pay her a visit Jesus Im trippin Tansy says and runs her hands through her thin hair Jesus repeats the crow on the welcome mat And then chipper as a chickadee Gorg If asked Tansy would have said she was too stoned to be frightened but this is apparently not so because she gives out a disconcerted little cry and takes a step backward The crow hops briskly across the doorsill and strides onto the faded purple carpet still looking up at her with its bright eyes Its feathers glisten with condensed drops of mist It bops on past her then pauses to preen and fluff It looks around as if to ask Howm I doin sweetheart Go away Tansy says I dont know what the fuck you are or if youre here at all but   Gorg the crow insists then spreads its wings and fleets across the trailers living room a charred fleck burnt off the back of the night Tansy screams and cringes instinctively shielding her face but Gorg doesnt come near her It alights on the table beside her bottle there not being any bust of Pallas handy Tansy thinks It got disoriented in the fog thats all It could even be rabid or have that Key Lime disease whatever you call it I ought to go in the kitchen and get the broom Shoo it out before it shits around    But the kitchen is too far In her current state the kitchen seems hundreds of miles away somewhere in the vicinity of Colorado Springs And theres probably no crow here at all Thinking of that goddamn poem has caused her to hallucinate thats all    that and losing her daughter For the first time the pain gets through the haze and Tansy winces from its cruel and wiry heat She remembers the little hands that sometimes pressed so tidily against the sides of her neck The cries in the night summoning her from sleep The smell of her fresh from the bath Her name was Irma she suddenly shouts at the figment standing so boldly beside the brandy bottle Irma not fucking Lenore what kind of stupid name is Lenore Lets hear you say Irma Irma the visitor croaks obediently stunning her to silence And its eyes Ah Its glittering eyes draw her like the eyes of the Ancient Mariner in that other poem she was supposed to learn but never did IrmaIrmaIrmaIrma   Stop it She doesnt want to hear it after all She was wrong Her daughters name out of that alien throat is foul insupportable She wants to put her hands over her ears and cant Theyre too heavy Her hands have joined the stove and the refrigerator miserable halfbusted thing in Colorado Springs All she can do is look into those glittering black eyes It preens for her ruffling its ebony sateen feathers They make a loathsome little scuttering noise all up and down its back and she thinks Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil Certainty fills her heart like cold water What do you know she asks Why did you come Know croaks the Crow Gorg nodding its beak briskly up and down Come And does it wink Good God does it wink at her Who killed her Tansy Freneau whispers Who killed my pretty baby The crows eyes fix her turn her into a bug on a pin Slowly feeling more in a dream than ever but this is happening on some level she understands that perfectly she crosses to the table Still the crow watches her still the crow draws her on Nights Plutonian shore she thinks Nights Plutonian fuckin shore Who Tell me what you know The crow looks up at her with its bright black eyes Its beak opens and closes revealing a wet red interior in tiny peeks Tansy it croaks Come The strength runs out of her legs and she drops to her knees biting her tongue and making it bleed Crimson drops splatter her U of W sweatshirt Now her face is on a level with the birds face She can see one of its wings brushing up and down sensuously on the glass side of the coffeebrandy bottle The smell of Gorg is dust and heaped dead flies and ancient urns of buried spice Its eyes are shining black portholes looking into some other world Hell perhaps Or Sheol Who she whispers Gorg stretches its black and rustling neck until its black beak is actually in the cup of her ear It begins to whisper and eventually Tansy Freneau begins to nod The light of sanity has left her eyes And when will it return Oh I think we all know the answer to that one Can you say Nevermore  PM FRENCH LANDING is fogged out fagged out and uneasy in its heart but quiet The quiet wont last Once it has started slippage never stops for long At Maxtons Chipper has stayed late and considering the leisurely and really quite sensational blow job being administered to him by Rebecca Vilas as he sits sprawled in his office chair his decision to put in a little overtime isnt that surprising In the common room the old folks sit transfixed by Julie Andrews and The Sound of Music Alice Weathers is actually crying with happiness  Music is her alltime favorite movie Singin in the Rain comes close but close never won the cigar Among those MEC inmates who are ambulatory only Burny is missing    except no one here misses him at all Burny is deep in sleep The spirit that now controls him  the demon we might as well say  has its own agenda in French Landing and it has used Burny roughly over these last few weeks not that Burnys complaining he is a very willing accomplice On Norway Valley Road Jack Sawyer is just pulling his Dodge Ram into Henry Leydens driveway The fog out here is thinner but it still turns the trucks headlamps into soft coronas Tonight he will recommence Bleak House at chapter  The Ghosts Walk and hopefully reach the end of chapter  Covering a Multitude of Sins But before Dickens he has promised to listen to the Wisconsin Rats latest candidate for hot rotation a number called Gimme Back My Dog by Slobberbone Every five years or so another great rocknroll song comes breakdancing out of the woodwork Henry has told him over the phone and Jacks damned if he cant hear the Rat screaming around the edges of his friends voice popping wheelies out there on the edge of darkness This is a great rocknroll song If you say so Jack replies dubiously His idea of a great rocknroll song is Runaround Sue by Dion At  Robin Hood Lane that sweet little Cape Cod honey of a home Fred Marshall is down on his hands and knees wearing a pair of green rubber gloves and washing the floor Hes still got Tylers baseball cap balanced on his head and hes weeping Out at the Holiday Trailer Park the Crow Gorg is dripping poison into the porches of Tansy Freneaus ears In the sturdy brick house on Herman Street where he lives with the beautiful Sarah and the equally beautiful David Dale Gilbertson is just getting ready to head back to the office his movements slightly slowed by two helpings of chicken pot pie and a dish of bread pudding When the telephone rings he is not terribly surprised Hes had that feeling after all His caller is Debbi Anderson and from her first word he knows that something has popped He listens nodding asking an occasional question His wife stands in the kitchen doorway watching him with worried eyes Dale bends and jots on the pad beside the phone Sarah walks over and reads two names Andy Railsback and M Fine Youve still got Railsback on the line he asks Yes on hold   Patch me in Dale I dont know if I know how to do that Debbi sounds uncharacteristically flustered Dale closes his eyes a moment reminds himself that this isnt her usual job Ernies not there yet No Who is Bobby Dulac    I think Dit might be in the shower    Put Bobby on Dale says and is relieved when Bobby is able to patch him quickly and painlessly through to Andy Railsback in Morty Fines office The two men have been upstairs to room  and one look at the Polaroids scattered on the floor of George Potters closet has been enough for Morty Hes now as pale as Andy himself Maybe paler Outside the police station Ernie Therriault and Reginald Doc Amberson meet in the parking lot Doc has just arrived on his old but perfectly maintained Harley Fat Boy They exchange amiable greetings in the fog Ernie Therriault is another cop  sort of  but relax hes the last one well have to meet well there is an FBI agent running around here someplace but never mind him right now hes in Madison and hes a fool Ernie is a trim sixtyfive retired from fulltime police duty for almost twelve years and still four times the cop Arnold Hrabowski will ever be He supplements his pension by doing night dispatch at the FLPD he doesnt sleep so well these days thanks to a cranky prostate and pulling private security time at First Bank of Wisconsin on Fridays when the Wells Fargo people come at two and the Brinks people at four Doc looks every inch the Hells Angel with his long blackandgray beard which he sometimes braids with ribbons in the style of the pirate Edward Teach and he brews beer for a living but the two men get along very well For one thing they recognize each others intelligence Ernie doesnt know if Doc really is a doctor but he could be Maybe at one point he was Anything changed Doc asks Not that I know of my friend Ernie says One of the Five comes by every night in turn to check Tonight Docs got the duty Mind if I walk in with you Nope Ernie said Just as long as you respect the rule Doc nods Some of the other Fives can be pissy about the rule especially Sonny whos pissy about lots of stuff  but Doc abides by it one cup of coffee or five minutes whichever comes first then down the road you go Ernie who saw plenty of real Hells Angels when he was a cop in Phoenix back in the seventies appreciates how deeply patient Beezer St Pierre and his crew have been But of course they are not Hells Angels or Pagans or Beasts on Bikes or any of that nonsense Ernie doesnt know exactly what they are but he knows that they listen to Beezer and he suspects that Beezers patience is growing thin Ernie knows his would be by now Well then come on in Ernie says clapping the big man on the shoulder Lets see whats shaking Quite a lot as it turns out Dale finds he is able to think quickly and clearly His earlier fear has left him partly because the fuckup has already happened and the case  the official case anyway  has been taken away from him Mostly because he knows he can now call on Jack if he needs to and Jack will answer Jacks his safety net He listens to Railsbacks description of the Polaroids  mostly letting the old fella vent and settle a bit  and then asks a single question about the two photos of the boy Yellow Railsback replies with no hesitation The shirt was yellow I could read the word Kiwanis on it Nothing else The    the blood    Dale says he understands and tells Railsback an officer will join them shortly There is the sound of the phone shifting hands and then Fine is in his ear  a fellow Dale knows and doesnt much care for What if he comes back Chief  What if Potter comes back here to the hotel Can you see the lobby from where you are No Petulant Were in the office I told you that Then go out front Look busy If he comes in   I dont want to do that If youd seen those pitchers you wouldnt want to do it either You dont have to say boo to him Dale says Just call if he goes by But   Hang up the telephone sir Ive got a lot to do Sarah has put her hand on her husbands shoulder Dale puts his free one over hers There is a click in his ear loud enough to sound disgruntled Bobby are you on Right here Chief Debbi too and Dit Oh and Ernie just walked in He lowers his voice Hes got one of those motorcycle boys with him The one who calls himself Doc Dale thinks furiously Ernie Debbi Dit and Bobby all in uniform Not good for what he wants He comes to a sudden decision and says Put the hogger on What You heard me A moment later hes talking to Doc Amberson You want to help bust the fucker who killed Armand St Pierres little girl Hell yes No hesitation All right dont ask questions and dont make me repeat myself Im listening Doc says crisply Tell Officer Dulac to give you the blue cell phone in evidence storage the one we took off the doper who skipped Hell know the one I mean If anyone tries to star a call originating from that phone Dale knows they wont be able to trace it back to his shop and thats just as well He is after all supposed to be off the case Blue cell phone Then walk down to Luckys Tavern next to the Nelson Hotel I got my bike   No Walk Go inside Buy a lottery ticket Youll be looking for a tall man skinny saltandpepper hair about seventy khaki pants maybe a khaki shirt too Most likely alone His favorite roost is between the jukebox and the little hall that goes to the johns If hes there call the station Just hit  Got all that Yeah Go Really shuck your buns Doctor Doc doesnt even bother to say goodbye A moment later Bobbys back on the phone What are we gonna do Dale If hes there were gonna take the son of a bitch Dale says Hes still under control but he can feel his heartbeat accelerating really starting to crank The world stands out before him with a brilliance that hasnt been there since the first murder He can feel every finger of his wifes hand on his shoulder He can smell her makeup and her hairspray Get Tom Lund And lay out three of the Kevlar vests He thinks that over then says Make it four Youre going to call Hollywood Yeah he says but were not gonna wait for him On that he hangs up Because he wants to bolt he makes himself stand still for a moment Takes a deep breath Lets it out then takes another Sarah grasps his hands Be careful Oh yeah Dale says You can take that to the bank He starts for the door What about Jack she calls Ill get him from the car he says without slowing If Gods on our side well have the guy in lockup before he makes it halfway to the station Five minutes later Doc is standing at the bar in Luckys listening to Trace Adkins sing I Left Something Turned On at Home and scratching a Wisconsin instantwinner ticket It actually is a winner  ten bucks  but most of Docs attention is focused in the direction of the juke He bops his shaggy head a little bit as if hes really getting off on this particular example of Shitkicker Deluxe Sitting at the table in the corner with a plate of spaghetti in front of him the sauce as red as a nosebleed and a pitcher of beer close at hand is the man hes looking for tall even sitting down skinny lines grooving his tanned hound dogs face saltandpepper hair neatly combed back Doc cant really see the shirt because the guys got a napkin tucked into the collar but the long leg sticking out from under the table is dressed in khaki If Doc was entirely sure this was the babykilling puke who did Amy hed make a citizens arrest right now  an extremely rough one Fuck the cops and their Miranda shit But maybe the guys only a witness or an accomplice or something He takes his tenspot from the bartender turns down the suggestion that he stay for a beer and strolls back out into the fog Ten steps up the hill he takes the blue cell phone from his pocket and dials  This time its Debbi who answers Hes there Doc says What next Bring the phone back she says and hangs up Well fuck you very much Doc says mildly But hell be a good boy Hell play by their rules Only first  He dials another number on the blue phone which has one more chore to do before it passes out of our tale forever and Bear Girl answers Put him on sweetness he says hoping she wont tell him that Beezers gone down to the Sand Bar If the Beez ever goes down there alone itll be because hes after one thing A bad thing But a moment later Beezers voice is in his ear  rough as if hes been crying Yeah What Round em up and get your heavyset ass down to the police station parking lot Doc tells him Im not a hunnert percent certain but I think they might be getting ready to nail the motherfucker done it I might even have seen   Beezer is gone before Doc can get the phone off his ear and push the OFF button He stands in the fog looking up at the bleary lights of the French Landing cop shop wondering why he didnt tell Beezer and the boys to meet him outside of Luckys He supposes he knows the answer If Beezer got to that old guy before the cops spaghetti might turn out to be the old guys last meal Better to wait maybe Wait and see Theres nothing but a fine mist on Herman Street but the soup thickens almost as soon as Dale turns toward downtown He turns on his parking lights but theyre not enough He goes to low beams then calls Jacks He hears the recorded announcement start kills the call and dials Uncle Henrys And Uncle Henry answers In the background Dale can hear a howling fuzztone guitar and someone growling Gimme back my dog over and over Yes hes just arrived Henry allows Were currently in the Musical Appreciation phase of our evening Literature to follow Weve reached a critical juncture in Bleak House  Chesney Wold the Ghosts Walk Mrs Rouncewell all of that  and so unless your need is actually urgent   It is Put him on now Unc Henry sighs Oui mon capitaine A moment later hes talking to Jack who of course agrees to come at once This is good but French Landings police chief finds some of his friends reactions a trifle puzzling No Jack doesnt want Dale to hold the arrest until he arrives Very considerate of him to ask also very considerate of Dale to have saved him a Kevlar vest part of the law enforcement booty showered on the FLPD and thousands of other small police departments during the Reagan years but Jack believes Dale and his men can nab George Potter without much trouble The truth is Jack Sawyer seems only slightly interested in George Potter Ditto the horrific photos although they must certainly be authentic Railsback has IDd Johnny Irkenhams yellow Kiwanis Little League shirt a detail never given to the press Even the loathsome Wendell Green never ferreted out that particular fact What Jack asks about  not once but several times  is the guy Andy Railsback saw in the hallway Blue robe one slipper and thats all I know Dale is finally forced to admit Jesus Jack what does it matter Listen I have to get off the telephone Dingdong Jack replies equably enough and rings off Dale turns into the foggy parking lot He sees Ernie Therriault and the bikerbrewer called Doc standing outside the back door talking They are little more than shadows in the drifting fog Dales conversation with Jack has left him feeling very uneasy as if there are huge clues and signposts that he dullard that he is has entirely missed But what clues For Christs sake what signposts And now a dash of resentment flavors his unease Perhaps a highpowered Lucas Davenport type like Jack Sawyer just cant believe in the obvious Perhaps guys like him are always more interested in the dog that doesnt bark Sound travels well in the fog and halfway to the stations back door Dale hears motorcycle engines explode into life down by the river Down on Nailhouse Row Dale Ernie says He nods a greeting as if this were any ordinary evening Hey Chief Doc chips in Hes smoking an unfiltered cigarette looks to Dale like a Pall Mall or a Chesterfield Some doctor Dale thinks If I may egregiously misquote Misterogers Doc goes on its a beautiful night in the neighborhood Wouldnt you say You called them Dale says jerking his head in the direction of the revving motorcycles Two pairs of headlights swing into the parking lot Dale sees Tom Lund behind the wheel of the first car The second vehicle is almost certainly Danny Tchedas personal The troops are gathering once more Hopefully this time they can avoid any cataclysmic fuckups They better This time they could be playing for all the marbles Well I couldnt comment on that directly Doc says but I could ask If they were your friends what would you do Same damn thing Dale says and goes inside Henry Leyden once more sits primly in the passenger seat of the Ram pickup Tonight hes dressed in an opencollared white shirt and a pair of trim blue khakis Slim as a male model silvering hair combed back Did Sydney Carton look any cooler going to the guillotine Even in Charles Dickenss mind Jack doubts it Henry   I know Henry says Sit here in the truck like a good little boy until Im called With the doors locked And dont say Oui mon capitaine That ones wore out Will affirmative do Nicely The fog thickens as they near town and Jack dips his headlights  high beams are no good in this shit He looks at the dashboard clock  PM Things are speeding up Hes glad Do more think less Jack Sawyers recipe for EZ care sanity Ill whisk you inside as soon as theyve got Potter jugged You dont expect them to have a problem with that do you No Jack says then changes the subject You know you surprised me with that Slobberbone record He cant really call it a song not when the lead vocalist simply shrieked most of the lyrics at the top of his lungs That was good Its the lead guitar that makes the record Henry says picking up on Jacks careful use of the word Surprisingly sophisticated Usually the best you can hope for is in tune He unrolls his window sticks his head out like a dog then pulls it back in Speaking in that same conversational voice he says The whole town reeks Its the fog It pulls up the rivers stinkiest essence No Henry replies matteroffactly its death I smell it and I think you do too Only maybe not with your nose I smell it Jack admits Potters the wrong man I think so The man Railsback saw was a Judas goat The man Railsback saw was almost certainly the Fisherman They drive in silence for a while Henry Affirmative Whats the best record The best record and the best song Henry thinks about it Do you realize what a dreadfully personal question that is Yes Henry thinks some more then says  Stardust maybe Hoagy Carmichael For you The man behind the wheel thinks back all the way back to when Jacky was six His father and Uncle Morgan had been the jazz fiends his mother had had simpler tastes He remembers her playing the same song over and over one endless LA summer sitting and looking out the window and smoking Who is that lady Mom Jacky asks and his mother says Patsy Cline She died in an airplane crash  Crazy Arms  Jack says The Patsy Cline version Written by Ralph Mooney and Chuck Seals Thats the best record Thats the best song Henry says no more for the rest of the drive Jack is crying Henry can smell his tears Let us now take the wider view as some politician or other no doubt said We almost have to because things have begun to overlap While Beezer and the rest of the Thunder Five are arriving in the FLPD parking lot just off Sumner Street Dale and Tom Lund and Bobby Dulac  bulky in their Kevlar vests  are doubleparking in front of Luckys They park in the street because Dale wants plenty of room to swing the back door of the cruiser wide so that Potter can be bundled in as fast as possible Next door Dit Jesperson and Danny Tcheda are at the Nelson Hotel where they will cordon off room  with yellow POLICE LINE tape Once thats done their orders are to bring Andy Railsback and Morty Fine to the police station Inside the police station Ernie Therriault is calling WSP officers Brown and Black who will arrive after the fact    and if theyre pissed about that good deal At the Sand Bar a deadeyed Tansy Freneau has just pulled the plug on the jukebox killing the Wallflowers Listen to me everybody she cries in a voice thats not her own Theyve got him Theyve got the babymurdering son of a bitch His names Potter Theyll have him up in Madison by midnight and unless we do something some smart lawyer will have him back out on the street by next Monday WHO WANTS TO HELP ME DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT There is a moment of silence    and then a roar The halfstoned halfdrunk habitus of the Sand Bar know exactly what they want to do about it Jack and Henry meanwhile with no fog to slow them down until they hit town swing into the police station parking lot just behind the Thunder Five who park in a line around Docs Fat Boy The lot is filling up rapidly mostly with cops personal vehicles Word of the impending arrest has spread like fire in dry grass Inside one of Dales crew  we need not bother with exactly which one  spots the blue cell phone Doc used outside Luckys This cop grabs it and ducks into the closetsized room marked EVIDENCE STORAGE At the Oak Tree Inn where he has checked in for the duration of the Fisherman case Wendell Green is getting sullenly drunk In spite of three double whiskeys his neck still aches from having his camera pulled off by the biker asshole and his gut still aches from being sucker punched by the Hollywood asshole The parts of him that hurt most of all however are his pride and his pocketbook Sawyer concealed evidence just as sure as shit sticks to a blanket Wendell is halfway to believing that Sawyer himself is the Fisherman    but how can he prove either thing with his film gone When the bartender says he has a call Wendell almost tells him to stick the call up his ass But hes a professional goddamnit a professional news hawk and so he goes over to the bar and takes the phone Green he growls Hello asshole says the cop with the blue cell phone Wendell doesnt yet know his caller is a cop only that its some cheery ghoul poaching on his valuable drinking time You want to print some good news for a change Good news doesnt sell papers my pal This will We caught the guy What In spite of the three doubles Wendell Green is suddenly the most undrunk man on the planet Did I stutter The caller is positively gloating but Wendell Green no longer cares We caught the Fisherman Not the staties not the Feebs us Names George Potter Early seventies Retired builder Had Polaroids of all three dead kids If you hustle you can maybe be here to snap the picture when Dale takes him inside This thought  this shining possibility  explodes in Wendell Greens head like a firework Such a photo could be worth five times as much as one of little Irmas corpse because the reputable mags would want it And TV Also think of this What if someone shot the bastard as Marshall Dillon was taking him in Given the towns mood its far from impossible Wendell has a brief and brilliant memory of Lee Harvey Oswald clutching his stomach mouth open in his dying yawp Who is this he blurts Officer Fucking Friendly the voice on the other end says and clicks off In Luckys Tavern Patty Loveless is now informing those assembled older than the Sand Bar crowd and a good deal less interested in nonalcoholic substances that she cant get no satisfaction and her tractor cant get no traction George Potter has finished his spaghetti neatly folded his napkin which in the end had to catch only a single drop of redsauce and turned seriously to his beer Sitting close to the juke as he is he doesnt notice that the room has quieted with the entrance of three men only one in uniform but all three armed and wearing what look too much like bulletproof vests to be anything else George Potter someone says and George looks up With his glass in one hand and his pitcher of suds in the other he is a sitting duck Yeah what about it he asks and then he is snatched by the arms and shoulders and yanked from his spot His knees connect with the bottom of the table overturning it The spaghetti plate and the pitcher hit the floor The plate shatters The pitcher made of sterner stuff does not A woman screams A man says Yow in a low and respectful voice Potter holds on to his partly filled glass for a moment and then Tom Lund plucks this potential weapon from his hand A second later Dale Gilbertson is snapping on the cuffs and Dale has time to think that its the most satisfying sound hes ever heard in his life His tractor has finally gotten some traction by God This deal is lightyears from the snafu at Eds this is slick and tidy Less than ten seconds after Dale asked the only question  George Potter  the suspect is out the door and into the fog Tom has one elbow Bobby the other Dale is still rattling off the Miranda warning sounding like an auctioneer on amphetamines and George Potters feet never touch the sidewalk Jack Sawyer is fully alive for the first time since he was twelve years old riding back from California in a Cadillac Eldorado driven by a werewolf He has an idea that later on he will pay a high price for this regained vividness but he hopes he will just button his lip and fork over when the time comes Because the rest of his adult life now seems so gray He stands outside his truck looking in the window at Henry The air is dank and already charged with excitement He can hear the bluewhite parking lot lights sizzling like something frying in hot juices Henry Affirmative Do you know the hymn Amazing Grace Of course I do Everyone knows Amazing Grace  Jack says  Was blind but now I see I understand that now Henry turns his blind fearfully intelligent face toward Jack He is smiling It is the secondsweetest smile Jack has ever seen The blue ribbon still goes to Wolf that dear friend of his wandering twelfth autumn Good old Wolf who liked everything right here and now Youre back arent you Standing in the parking lot our old friend grins Jacks back thats affirmative Then go do what you came back to do Henry says I want you to roll up the windows And not be able to hear I think not Henry tells him pleasantly enough More cops are coming and this time the blue lights of the lead car are flashing and the siren is blurping Jack detects a celebratory note to those little blurps and decides he doesnt have time to stand here arguing with Henry about the Rams windows He heads for the back door of the police station and two of the bluewhite arcs cast his shadow double on the fog one dark head north and one south Parttime officers Holtz and Nestler pull in behind the car bearing Gilbertson Lund Dulac and Potter We dont care much about Holtz and Nestler Next in line is Jesperson and Tcheda with Railsback and Morton Fine in the back seat Morty is complaining about the lack of knee room We care about Railsback but he can wait Next into the lot  oh this is interesting if not entirely unexpected Wendell Greens beatup red Toyota with the man himself behind the wheel Around his neck is his backup camera a Minolta thatll keep taking pictures as long as Wendell keeps pressing the button No one from the Sand Bar  not yet  but there is one more car waiting to turn into the already crowded lot Its a discreet green Saab with a POLICE POWER sticker on the left side of the bumper and one reading HUGS NOT DRUGS on the right Behind the wheel of the Saab looking stunned but determined to do the right thing whatever the right thing might be is Arnold the Mad Hungarian Hrabowski Standing in a line against the brick wall of the police station are the Thunder Five They wear identical denim vests with gold s on the left breast Five sets of meaty arms are crossed on five broad chests Doc Kaiser Bill and Sonny wear their hair in thick ponytails Mouses is cornrowed tonight And Beezers floods down over his shoulders making him look to Jack a little like Bob Seger in his prime Earrings twinkle Tats flex on huge biceps Armand St Pierre Jack says to the one closest the door Jack Sawyer From Eds He holds out his hand and isnt exactly surprised when Beezer only looks at it Jack smiles pleasantly You helped bigtime out there Thanks Nothing from the Beez Is there going to be trouble with the intake of the prisoner do you think Jack asks He might be asking if Beezer thinks it will shower after midnight Beezer watches over Jacks shoulder as Dale Bobby and Tom help George Potter from the back of the cruiser and begin walking him briskly toward the back door Wendell Green raises his camera then is nearly knocked off his feet by Danny Tcheda who doesnt even have the pleasure of seeing which asshole hes bumped Watch it dickweed Wendell squawks Beezer meanwhile favors Jack  if that is the word  with a brief cold glance Wellnow he says Well have to see how it shakes out wont we Indeed we will Jack agrees He sounds almost happy He pushes in between Mouse and Kaiser Bill making himself a place the Thunder Five Plus One And perhaps because they sense he doesnt fear them the two wideboys make room Jack crosses his own arms over his chest If he had a vest an earring and a tattoo he really would fit right in The prisoner and his custodians kill the distance between the car and the building quickly Just before they reach it Beezer St Pierre spiritual leader of the Thunder Five and father of Amy whose liver and tongue were eaten steps in front of the door His arms are still folded In the heartless glare of the parking lot lights his massive biceps are blue Bobby and Tom suddenly look like guys with a moderate case of the flu Dale looks stony And Jack continues to smile gently arms placidly crossed seeming to gaze everywhere and nowhere at once Get out of the way Beezer Dale says I want to book this man And what of George Potter Is he stunned Resigned Both Its hard to tell But when Beezers bloodshot blue eyes meet Potters brown ones Potter does not drop his gaze Behind him the lookieloos in the parking lot fall silent Standing between Danny Tcheda and Dit Jesperson Andy Railsback and Morty Fine are gawking Wendell Green raises his camera and then holds his breath like a sniper whos lucked into a shot  just one mind you  at the commanding general Did you kill my daughter Beezer asks The gentle inquiry is somehow more terrible than any raw yell could have been and the world seems to hold its breath Dale makes no move In that moment he seems as frozen as the rest of them The world waits and the only sound is a low mournful hoot from some fogbound boat on the river Sir I never killed no one Potter says He speaks softly and without emphasis Although he has expected nothing else the words still box Jacks heart There is an unexpected painful dignity in them Its as if George Potter is speaking for all the lost good men of the world Stand aside Beezer Jack says gently You dont want to hurt this guy And Beezer looking suddenly not at all sure of himself does stand aside Before Dale can get his prisoner moving again a raucously cheerful voice  it can only be Wendells  yells out Hey Hey Fisherman Smile for the camera They all look around not just Potter They have to that cry is as insistent as fingernails dragged slowly down a slate blackboard White light strobes the foggy parking lot  one two three four  and Dale snarls Aw fuck me till I cry Come on you guys Jack Jack I want you From behind them one of the other cops calls Dale You want me to grab this creep Leave him alone Dale shouts and bulls his way inside Its not until the door is closed behind him and hes in the lower hall with Jack Tom and Bobby that Dale realizes how certain he was that Beezer would simply snatch the old man away from him And then crack his neck like a chicken bone Dale Debbi Anderson calls uncertainly from halfway down the stairs Is everything all right Dale looks at Jack who still has his arms crossed over his chest and is still smiling his little smile I think it is Dale says For now Twenty minutes later Jack and Henry the latter gentleman retrieved from the truck and still reetpetite sit in Dales office Beyond the closed door the ready room roars with conversation and laughter almost every cop on the FLPD force is out there and it sounds like a goddamn New Years Eve party There are occasional shouts and smacking sounds that can only be relieved boys and girls in blue highfiving each other In a little while Dale will put a stop to that shit but for now hes content to let them go ahead He understands how they feel even though he no longer feels that way himself George Potter has been printed and stuck in a cell upstairs to think things over Brown and Black of the State Police are on their way For now that is enough As for triumph    well something about his friends smile and his faraway eyes have put triumph on hold I didnt think you were going to give Beezer his moment Jack says Its a good thing you did There might have been trouble right here in River City if youd tried to face him down I suppose I have a better idea tonight of how he feels Dale replies I lost track of my own kid tonight and it scared the living shit out of me David Henry cries leaning forward Is David okay Yeah Uncle Henry Daves fine Dale returns his gaze to the man who now lives in his fathers house Hes remembering the first time Jack ever laid eyes on Thornberg Kinderling Dale had at that point known Jack only nine days  long enough to form some favorable opinions but not long enough to realize how really extraordinary Jack Sawyer was That was the day Janna Massengale at the Taproom told Jack about the trick Kinderling did when he was getting squiffy that little trick of pinching his nostrils shut with his palm turned out to the world They had just arrived back at the police station from interviewing Janna Dale in his personal unit that day and hed touched Jack on the shoulder just as Jack was about to get out of the car Speak a name see the face it belongs to before suppertime thats what my mother used to say He pointed down to Second Street where a broadshouldered bald fellow had just come out of News n Notions a newspaper under his arm and a fresh deck of smokes in his hand Thats Thornberg Kinderling his very own self Jack had bent forward without speaking looking with the sharpest and perhaps the most merciless eyes Dale had ever seen in his life Do you want to approach him Dale had asked No Hush And Jack simply sat with one leg in Dales car and one out of it not moving eyes narrowed So far as Dale could tell he didnt even breathe Jack watched Kinderling open his cigarettes tap one out put it in his mouth and light it He watched Kinderling glance at the headline of the Herald and then saunter to his own car an allwheeldrive Subaru Watched him get in Watched him drive away And by that time Dale realized he was holding his own breath Well hed asked when the Kinderlingmobile was gone What do you think And Jack had said I think hes the guy Only Dale had known better Even then he had known better Jack was saying I think only because he and Chief Dale Gilbertson of French Landing Wisconsin were still on short terms gettingtoknowyou gettingtoworkwithyou terms What he had meant was I know And although that was impossible Dale had quite believed him Now sitting in his office with Jack directly across the desk from him  his reluctant but scarily gifted deputy  Dale asks What do you think Did he do it Come on Dale how can I   Dont waste my time Jack because those assholes from WSP are going to be here any minute and theyll take Potter heighho over the hills You knew it was Kinderling the second you looked at him and you were halfway down the block You were close enough to Potter when I brought him in to count the hairs in his nose So what do you think Jack is quick at least spares him the suspense and just administers the chop No he says Not Potter Potters not the Fisherman Dale has known that Jack believes this  knew it from his face outside  but hearing it is still an unhappy thump He sits back disappointed Deduction or intuition Henry asks Both Jack says And stop looking like I plugged your mother Dale You may still have the key to this thing Railsback Jack makes a seesawing gesture with one hand  maybe maybe not it says Railsback probably saw what the Fisherman wanted him to see    although the single slipper is intriguing and I want to ask Railsback about it But if Mr OneSlipper was the Fisherman why would he lead Railsback  and us  to Potter To get us off his trail Dale says Oh have we been on it Jack asks politely and when neither of them answers But say he thinks were on his trail I can almost buy that especially if he just remembered some goof he might have made Nothing back yet on the Eleven phone one way or the other if thats what youre thinking of Dale tells him Jack appears to ignore this His eyes gaze off into the middle distance That little smile is back on his face Dale looks at Henry and sees Henry looking at Jack Uncs smile is easier to read relief and delight Look at that Dale thinks Hes doing what he was built to do By God even a blind man can see it Why Potter Jack finally repeats Why not one of the Thunder Five or the Hindu at the Eleven or Ardis Walker down at the bait shop Why not Reverend Hovdahl What motive usually surfaces when you uncover a frame job Dale thinks it over Payback he says at last Revenge In the ready room a phone rings Shut up shut up Ernie bellows to the others Lets try to act professional here for thirty seconds or so Jack meanwhile is nodding at Dale I think I need to question Potter and rather closely Dale looks alarmed Then you better get on it right away before Brown and Black   He comes to a halt frowning with his head cocked A rumbling sound has impinged on his attention Its low but rising Uncle Henry whats that Motors Henry says promptly A lot of them Theyre east of here but coming this way Edge of town And I dont know if youve noticed this but it sounds like the party next door is like over dude As if this were a cue Ernie Therriaults distressed cry comes through the door Ohhhh shit Dit Jesperson Whats   Ernie Get the chief Aw never mind Ill   There is a single perfunctory knock and then Ernies looking in at the brain trust Hes as collected and soldierly as ever but his cheeks have paled considerably beneath his summer tan and a vein is pulsing in the middle of his forehead Chief I just took a call on the  twenty was the Sand Bar That hole Dale mutters Caller was the bartender Says about fifty to seventy people are on their way By now the sound of approaching engines is very loud It sounds to Henry like the Indy  just before the pace car runs for dear life and the checkered flag drops Dont tell me Dale says What do I need to make my day complete Let me think Theyre coming to take my prisoner Umm yes sir thats what the caller said Ernie agrees Behind him the other cops are silent In that moment they dont look like cops at all to Dale They look like nothing but dismayed faces crudely drawn on a dozen or so white balloons also two black ones  cant forget Pam Stevens and Bob Holtz The sound of the engines continues to grow Also might want to know one other thing the caller said Christ what Said the um    Ernie searches for a word that isnt mob The protest group was being led by the Freneau girls mom Oh    my    Christ Dale says He gives Jack a look of sick panic and utter frustration  the look of a man who knows he is dreaming but cant seem to wake up no matter how hard he tries If I lose Potter Jack French Landing is going to be the lead story on CNN tomorrow morning Jack opens his mouth to reply and the cell phone in his pocket picks that moment to start up its annoying tweet Henry Leyden immediately crosses his arms and tucks his hands into his armpits Dont hand it to me he says Cell phones give you cancer We agreed on that Dale meanwhile has left the room As Jack digs for the cell phone thinking someone has picked a cataclysmically shitty time to ask him about his network television preferences Henry follows his nephew walking briskly with his hands now held slightly out fingers gently fluttering the air seeming to read the currents for obstacles Jack hears Dale saying that if he sees a single drawn weapon the person who drew it will join Arnie Hrabowski on the suspension list Jack is thinking exactly one thing no one is taking Potter anywhere until Jack Sawyer has had time to put a few pointed questions No way He flicks the cell phone open and says Not now whoever you are Weve got   Hideyho Travelin Jack says the voice from the phone and for Jack Sawyer the years once more roll away Speedy The very one Speedy says Then the drawl is gone The voice becomes brisk and businesslike And as one coppiceman to another son I think you ought to visit Chief Gilbertsons private bathroom Right now Outside there are enough vehicles arriving to shake the building Jack has a bad feeling about this has since he heard Ernie say who was leading the fools parade Speedy I dont exactly have the time to visit the facilities right n   You havent got time to visit anyplace else Speedy replies coldly Only now hes the other one The hard boy named Parkus What youre gonna find there you can use twice But if you dont use it almighty quick the first time you wont need it the second time Because that man is gonna be up a lamppost And just like that Speedy is gone When Tansy leads the willing patrons into the Sand Bars parking lot there is none of the carnival raucousness that was the keynote of the cluster fuck at Eds Eats  Dawgs Although most of the folks we met at Eds have been spending the evening in the Bar getting moderately to seriously tanked they are quiet even funereal as they follow Tansy out and fire up their cars and pickups But its a savage funereality She has taken something in from Gorg  some stone powerful poison  and passed it along to them In the belt of her slacks is a single crow feather Doodles Sanger takes her arm and guides her sweetly to Teddy Runklemans International Harvester pickup When Tansy heads for the truck bed which already holds two men and one hefty female in a white rayon waitresss uniform Doodles steers her toward the cab No honey Doodles says you sit up there Be comfy Doodles wants that last place in the truck bed Shes spotted something and knows just what to do with it Doodles is quick with her hands always has been The fog isnt thick this far from the river but after two dozen cars and trucks have spun out of the Bars dirt parking lot following Teddy Runklemans dented onetaillight IH you can barely see the tavern Inside only half a dozen people are left  these were somehow immune to Tansys eerily powerful voice One of them is Stinky Cheese the bartender Stinky has a lot of liquid assets to protect out here and isnt going anywhere When he calls  and speaks to Ernie Therriault it will be mostly in the spirit of petulance If he cant go along and enjoy the fun by God at least he can spoil it for the rest of those monkeys Twenty vehicles leave the Sand Bar By the time the caravan passes Eds Eats the lane leading to it cordoned off by yellow tape and the NO TRESPASSING sign alongside the overgrown lane to that queer forgotten house not cordoned off not even noticed for that matter the caravan has grown to thirty There are fifty cars and trucks rolling down both lanes of Highway  by the time the mob reaches Goltzs and by the time it passes the Eleven there must be eighty vehicles or more and maybe two hundred and fifty people Credit this unnaturally rapid swelling to the ubiquitous cell phone Teddy Runkleman oddly silent he is in fact afraid of the pallid woman sitting beside him  her snarling mouth and her wide unblinking eyes brings his old truck to a halt in front of the FLPD parking lot entrance Sumner Street is steep here and he sets the parking brake The other vehicles halt behind him filling the street from side to side rumbling through rusty mufflers and blatting through broken exhaust pipes Misaligned headlights stab the fog like searchlight beams at a movie premiere The nights dank wetfish smell has been overlaid with odors of burning gas boiling oil and cooking clutch lining After a moment doors begin to open and then clap shut But there is no conversation No yelling No indecorous yeehaw whooping Not tonight The newcomers stand in clusters around the vehicles that brought them watching as the people in the back of Teddys truck either jump over the sides or slip off the end of the tailgate watching as Teddy crosses to the passenger door at this moment as attentive as a young man arriving with his date at the junior prom watching as he helps down the slim young woman who has lost her daughter The mist seems to outline her somehow and give her a bizarre electric aura the same blue of the sodium lights on Beezers upper arms The crowd gives out a collective and weirdly amorous sigh when it sees her She is what connects them All her life Tansy Freneau has been the forgotten one  even Cubby Freneau forgot her eventually running off to Green Bay and leaving her here to work odd jobs and collect the ADC Only Irma remembered her only Irma cared and now Irma is dead Not here to see unless shes looking down from heaven Tansy thinks in some distant and everreceding part of her mind her mother suddenly idolized Tansy Freneau has tonight become the dearest subject of French Landings eye and heart Not its mind because its mind is temporarily gone perhaps in search of its conscience but certainly of its eye and heart yes And now as delicately as the girl she once was Doodles Sanger approaches this woman of the hour What Doodles spotted lying on the floor of Teddys truck bed was an old length of rope dirty and oily but thick enough to do the trick Below Doodless petite fist hangs the noose that her clever hands have fashioned on the ride into town She hands it to Tansy who holds it up in the misty light The crowd lets out another sigh Noose raised looking like a female Diogenes in search of an honest man rather than of a cannibal in need of lynching Tansy walks  delicate herself in her jeans and bloodstained sweatshirt  into the parking lot Teddy Doodles and Freddy Saknessum walk behind her and behind them come the rest They move toward the police station like the tide The Thunder Five are still standing with their backs to the brick wall and their arms folded What the fuck do we do Mouse asks I dont know about you Beezer says but Im gonna stand here until they grab me which they probably will Hes looking at the woman with the upraised noose Hes a big boy and hes been in a lot of hard corners but this chick frightens him with her blank wide eyes like the eyes of a statue And theres something stuck in her belt Something black Is it a knife Some kind of dagger And Im not gonna fight because it wont work Theyll lock the door right Doc asks nervously I mean the copsll lock the door I imagine Beezer says never taking his eyes from Tansy Freneau But if these folks want Potter theyll have him on the half shell Look at em for Christs sake Theres a couple of hundred Tansy stops the noose still held up Bring him out she says Her voice is louder than it should be as if some doctor has cunningly hidden an amplifying gadget in her throat Bring him out Give us the killer Doodles joins in Bring him out And Teddy Give us the killer And Freddy Bring him out Give us the killer And then the rest It could almost be the sound track of George Rathbuns Badger Barrage only instead of Block that kick or On Wisconsin they are screaming BRING HIM OUT GIVE US THE KILLER Theyre gonna take him Beezer murmurs He turns to his troops his eyes both fierce and frightened Sweat stands out on his broad forehead in large perfect drops When shes got em pumped up to high shell come and theyll be right on her ass Dont run dont even unfold your arms And when they grab you let it happen If you want to see daylight tomorrow let it happen The crowd stands kneedeep in fog like spoiled skim milk chanting BRING HIM OUT GIVE US THE KILLER Wendell Green is chanting right along with them but that doesnt keep him from continuing to take pictures Because shit this is the story of a lifetime From the door behind Beezer theres a click Yeah they locked it he thinks Thanks you whores But its the latch not the lock The door opens Jack Sawyer steps out He walks past Beezer without looking or reacting as Beez mutters Hey man I wouldnt go near her Jack advances slowly but not hesitantly into the nomansland between the building and the mob with the woman standing at its head Lady Liberty with the upraised hangmans noose instead of a torch in her hand In his simple gray collarless shirt and dark pants Jack looks like a cavalier from some old romantic tale advancing to propose marriage The flowers he holds in his own hand add to this impression These tiny white blooms are what Speedy left for him beside the sink in Dales bathroom a cluster of impossibly fragrant white blossoms They are lilies of the vale and they are from the Territories Speedy left him no explanation about how to use them but Jack needs none The crowd falls silent Only Tansy lost in the world Gorg has made for her continues to chant Bring him out Give us the killer She doesnt stop until Jack is directly in front of her and he doesnt kid himself that its his handsome face or dashing figure that ends the too loud repetition It is the smell of the flowers their sweet and vibrant smell the exact opposite of the meaty stench that hung over Eds Eats Her eyes clear    a little at least Bring him out she says to Jack Almost a question No he says and the word is filled with heartbreaking tenderness No dear Behind them Doodles Sanger suddenly thinks of her father for the first time in maybe twenty years and begins to weep Bring him out Tansy pleads Now her own eyes are filling Bring out the monster who killed my pretty baby If I had him maybe I would Jack says Maybe I would at that Although he knows better But the guy weve gots not the guy you want Hes not the one But Gorg said   Here is a word he knows One of the words Judy Marshall tried to eat Jack not in the Territories but not entirely in this world right now either reaches forward and plucks the feather from her belt Did Gorg give you this Yes   Jack lets it drop then steps on it For a moment he thinks  knows  that he feels it buzzing angrily beneath the sole of his shoe like a halfcrushed wasp Then it stills Gorg lies Tansy Whatever Gorg is he lies The man in there is not the one Tansy lets out a great wail and drops the rope Behind her the crowd sighs Jack puts his arm around her and again he thinks of George Potters painful dignity he thinks of all the lost struggling along without a single clean Territories dawn to light their way He hugs her to him smelling sweat and grief and madness and coffee brandy In her ear Jack whispers Ill catch him for you Tansy She stiffens You    Yes You    promise Yes Hes not the one No dear You swear Jack hands her the lilies and says On my mothers name She lowers her nose to the flowers and inhales deeply When her head comes up again Jack sees that the danger has left her but not the insanity Shes one of the lost ones now Something has gotten to her Maybe if the Fisherman is caught it will leave her Jack would like to believe that Someone needs to take this lady home Jack says He speaks in a mild conversational voice but it still carries to the crowd Shes very tired and full of sadness Ill do it Doodles says Her cheeks gleam with tears Ill take her in Teddys truck and if he dont give me the keys Ill knock him down I   And thats when the chant starts again this time from back in the crowd Bring him out Give us the killer Give us the Fisherman Bring out the Fisherman For a moment its a solo job and then a few other hesitant voices begin to join in and lend harmony Still standing with his back against the bricks Beezer St Pierre says Ah shit Here we go again Jack forbade Dale to come out into the parking lot with him saying that the sight of Dales uniform might set off the crowd He didnt mention the little bouquet of flowers he was holding and Dale barely noticed them he was too terrified of losing Potter to Wisconsins first lynching of the new millennium He followed Jack downstairs however and has now commandeered the peephole in the door by right of seniority The rest of the FLPD is still upstairs looking out of the readyroom windows Henry has ordered Bobby Dulac to give him a running playbyplay Even in his current state of worry about Jack Henry thinks theres at least a  percent chance the mob will either trample him or tear him apart Henry is amused and flattered to realize that Bobby is doing George Rathbun without even realizing it Okay Hollywoods out there    he approaches the woman    no sign of fear    the rest of them are quiet    Jack and the woman appear to be talking    and holy jeezum hes givin her a bouquet of flowers What a ploy Ploy is one of George Rathbuns favorite sports terms as in The Brew Crews hitandrun ploy failed yet again last night at Miller Park Shes turnin away Bobby yells jubilantly He grabs Henrys shoulder and shakes it Hot damn I think its over I think Jack turned her off Even a blind man could see he turned her off Henry says Just in time too Bobby says Heres Channel Five and theres another truck with one of those big orange poles on it    FoxMilwaukee I think    and   Bring him out a voice outside begins yelling It sounds cheated and indignant Give us the killer Give us the Fisherman Oh nooo Bobby says even now sounding like George Rathbun telling his morningafter audience how another Badger rally had started to fizzle Not nowwww not with the TV here Thats   Bring out the Fisherman Henry already knows who that is Even through two layers of chickenwirereinforced glass that high yapping cry is impossible to mistake Wendell Green understands his job  dont ever make the mistake of thinking he doesnt His job is to report the news to analyze the news to sometimes photojournalize the news His job is not to make the news But tonight he cant help it This is the second time in the last twelve hours that a career maker of a story has been extended to his grasping pleading hands only to be snatched away at the last second Bring him out Wendell bawls The raw strength in his voice surprises then thrills him Give us the killer Give us the Fisherman The sound of other voices joining in with his provides an incredible rush It is as his old college roommate used to say a real zipper buster Wendell takes a step forward his chest swelling his cheeks reddening his confidence building Hes vaguely aware that the Action News Five truck is rolling slowly toward him through the crowd Soon there will be ks and ks shining through the fog soon there will be TV cameras rolling tape by their harsh light So what If the woman in the bloodspattered sweatshirt was in the end too chicken to stand up for her own kid Wendell will do it for her Wendell Green shining exemplar of civic responsibility Wendell Green leader of the people He begins to pump his camera up and down Its exhilarating Like being back in college At a Skynyrd concert Stoned Its like  There is a huge flash in front of Wendell Greens eyes Then the lights go out All of them ARNIE HIT HIM WITH HIS FLASHLIGHT Bobby is screaming He grabs Dales blind uncle by the shoulders and whirls him in a delirious circle A thick aroma of Aqua Velva descends toward Henry who knows Bobbys going to kiss him on both cheeks French style a second before Bobby actually does this And when Bobbys narration resumes he sounds as transported as George Rathbun on those rare occasions when the local sports teams actually buck the odds and grab the gold Can you believe it the Mad Hungarian hit him with his everlovin flashlight and    GREENS DOWN THE FUCKIN HUNGARIAN HAS PUT EVERYONES FAVORITE ASSHOLE REPORTER ON THE MAT WAY TO GO HRABOWSKI All around them cops are cheering at the tops of their lungs Debbi Anderson starts chanting We Are the Champions and other voices quickly lend support These are strange days in French Landing Henry thinks He stands with his hands in his pockets smiling listening to the bedlam Theres no lie in the smile hes happy But hes also uneasy in his heart Afraid for Jack Afraid for all of them really That was good work man Beezer tells Jack I mean balls to the wall Jack nods Thanks Im not going to ask you again if that was the guy You say hes not hes not But anything we can do to help you find the right one you just call us The other members of the Thunder Five rumble assent Kaiser Bill gives Jack a friendly bop on the shoulder It will probably leave a bruise Thanks Jack says again Before he can knock on the door its opened Dale grabs him and gives him a crushing embrace When their chests touch Jack can feel Dales heart beating hard and fast You saved my ass Dale says into his ear Anything I can do   You can do something all right Jack says pulling him inside I saw another cop car behind the news trucks Couldnt tell for sure but I think this one was blue Ohoh Dale says Ohoh is right I need at least twenty minutes with Potter It might not get us anything but it might get us a lot Can you hold off Brown and Black for twenty minutes Dale gives his friend a grim little smile Ill see you get half an hour Minimum Thats great And the  tape of the Fishermans call do you still have that It went with the rest of the evidence we were holding after Brown and Black took the case A trooper picked it up this afternoon Dale no Easy big boy Ive got a cassette copy safe in my desk Jack pats his chest Dont scare me that way Sorry Dale says thinking Seeing you out there I wouldnt have guessed you were afraid of anything Halfway up the stairs Jack remembers Speedy telling him he could use what had been left in the bathroom twice    but he has given the flowers to Tansy Freneau Shit Then he cups his hands over his nose inhales and smiles Maybe he still has them after all GEORGE POTTER is sitting on the bunk in the third holding cell down a short corridor that smells of piss and disinfectant Hes looking out the window at the parking lot which has lately been the scene of so much excitement and which is still full of milling people He doesnt turn at the sound of Jacks approaching footfalls As he walks Jack passes two signs ONE CALL MEANS ONE CALL reads the first AA MEETINGS MON AT  PM NA MEETINGS THURS AT  PM reads the second Theres a dusty drinking fountain and an ancient fire extinguisher which some wit has labeled LAUGHING GAS Jack reaches the bars of the cell and raps on one with his house key Potter at last turns away from the window Jack still in that state of hyperawareness that he now recognizes as a kind of Territorial residue knows the essential truth of the man at a single look Its in the sunken eyes and the dark hollows beneath them its in the sallow cheeks and the slightly hollowed temples with their delicate nestles of veins its in the too sharp prominence of the nose Hello Mr Potter he says I want to talk to you and we have to make it fast They wanted me Potter remarks Yes Maybe you should have let em take me Another threefour months Im out of the race anyway In his breast pocket is the Magcard Dale has given him and Jack uses it to unlock the cell door Theres a harsh buzzing as it trundles back on its short track When Jack removes the key the buzzing stops Downstairs in the ready room an amber light marked HC  will now be glowing Jack comes in and sits down on the end of the bunk He has put his key ring away not wanting the metallic smell to corrupt the scent of lilies Where have you got it Without asking how Jack knows Potter raises one large gnarled hand  a carpenters hand  and touches his midsection Then he lets it drop Started in the gut That was five years ago I took the pills and the shots like a good boy La Riviere that was That stuff    man I was throwing up everwhere Corners and just about everwhere Once I threw up in my own bed and didnt even know it Woke up the next morning with puke drying on my chest You know anything about that son My mother had cancer Jack says quietly When I was twelve Then it went away She get five years More Lucky Potter says Got her in the end though didnt it Jack nods Potter nods back Theyre not quite friends yet but its edging that way Its how Jack works always has been That shit gets in and waits Potter tells him My theory is that it never goes away not really Anyway shots is done Pills is done too Except for the ones that kill the pain I come here for the finish Why This is not a thing Jack needs to know and time is short but its his technique and he wont abandon what works just because there are a couple of State Police jarheads downstairs waiting to take his boy Dale will have to hold them off thats all Seems like a nice enough little town And I like the river I go down ever day Like to watch the sun on the water Sometimes I think of all the jobs I did  Wisconsin Minnesota Illinois  and then sometimes I dont think about much of anything Sometimes I just sit there on the bank and feel at peace What was your line of work Mr Potter Started out as a carpenter just like Jesus Progressed to builder then got too big for my britches When that happens to a builder he usually goes around calling himself a contractor I made threefour million dollars had a Cadillac had a young woman who hauled my ashes Friday nights Nice young woman No trouble Then I lost it all Only thing I missed was the Cadillac It had a smoother ride than the woman Then I got my bad news and come here He looks at Jack You know what I think sometimes That French Landings close to a better world one where things look and smell better Maybe where people act better I dont go around with folks  Im not a friendly type person  but that doesnt mean I dont feel things I got this idea in my head that its not too late to be decent You think Im crazy No Jack tells him Thats pretty much why I came here myself Ill tell you how it is for me You know how if you put a thin blanket over a window the sun will still shine through George Potter looks at him with eyes that are suddenly alight Jack doesnt even have to finish the thought which is good He has found the wavelength  he almost always does its his gift  and now its time to get down to business You do know Potter says simply Jack nods You know why youre here They think I killed that ladys kid Potter nods toward the window The one out there that was holdin up the noose I didnt Thats what I know Okay thats a start Listen to me now Very quickly Jack lays out the chain of events that has brought Potter to this cell Potters brow furrows as Jack speaks and his big hands knot together Railsback he says at last I shoulda known Nosy goddamn old man always askin questions always askin do you want to play cards or maybe shoot some pool or I dunno play Parcheesi for Christs sake All so he can ask questions Goddamn nosey parker    Theres more in this vein and Jack lets him go on with it for a while Cancer or no cancer this old fellow has been ripped out of his ordinary routine without much mercy and needs to vent a little If Jack cuts him off to save time hell lose it instead Its hard to be patient how is Dale holding those two assholes off  Jack doesnt even want to know but patience is necessary When Potter begins to widen the scope of his attack however Morty Fine comes in for some abuse as does Andy Railsbacks pal Irv Throneberry Jack steps in The point is Mr Potter that Railsback followed someone to your room No thats the wrong way to put it Railsback was led to your room Potter doesnt reply just sits looking at his hands But he nods Hes old hes sick and getting sicker but hes four counties over from stupid The person who led Railsback was almost certainly the same person who left the Polaroids of the dead children in your closet Yar makes sense And if he had pictures of the dead kiddies he was probly the one who made em dead Right So I have to wonder   Potter waves an impatient hand I guess I know what you got to wonder Who there is around these parts whod like to see Chicago Potsie strung up by the neck Or the balls Exactly Dont want to put a stick in your spokes sonny but I cant think of nobody No Jack raises his eyebrows Never did business around here built a house or laid out a golf course Potter raises his head and gives Jack a grin Course I did How else dyou think I knew how nice it is Specially in the summer You know the part of town they call Libertyville Got all those ye olde streets like Camelot and Avalon Jack nods I built half of those Back in the seventies There was a fella around then    some moke I knew from Chicago    or thought I knew Was he in the business This last seems to be Potter addressing Potter In any case he gives his head a brief shake Cant remember Doesnt matter anyway How could it Fella was gettin on then must be dead now It was a long time ago But Jack who interrogates as Jerry Lee Lewis once played the piano thinks it does matter In the usually dim section of his mind where intuition keeps its headquarters lights are coming on Not a lot yet but maybe more than just a few A moke he says as if he has never heard the word before Whats that Potter gives him a brief irritated look A citizen who    well not exactly a citizen Someone who knows people who are connected Or maybe sometimes connected people call him Maybe they do each other favors A moke Its not the worlds best thing to be No Jack thinks but moking can get you a Cadillac with that nice smooth ride Were you ever a moke George Got to get a little more intimate now This is not a question Jack can address to a Mr Potter Maybe Potter says after a grudging considering pause Maybe I was Back in Chi In Chi you had to scratch backs and wet beaks if you wanted to land the big contracts I dont know how it is there now but in those days a clean contractor was a poor contractor You know Jack nods The biggest deal I ever made was a housing development on the South Side of Chicago Just like in that song about bad bad Leroy Brown Potter chuckles rustily For a moment hes not thinking about cancer or false accusations or almost being lynched Hes living in the past and it may be a little sleazy but its better than the present  the bunk chained to the wall the steel toilet the cancer spreading through his guts Man that one was big I kid you not Lots of federal money but the local hotshots decided where the dough went home at night And me and this other guy this moke we were in a horse race   He breaks off looking at Jack with wide eyes Holy shit what are you magic I dont know what you mean Im just sitting here That guy was the guy who showed up here That was the moke Im not following you George But Jack thinks he is And although hes starting to get excited he shows it no more than he did when the bartender told him about Kinderlings little nosepinching trick Its probably nothing Potter says Guy had plenty of reasons not to like yours truly but hes got to be dead Hed be in his eighties for Christs sake Tell me about him Jack says He was a moke Potter repeats as if this explains everything And he must have got in trouble in Chicago or somewhere around Chicago because when he showed up here Im pretty sure he was using a different name When did you swink him on the housingdevelopment deal George Potter smiles and something about the size of his teeth and the way they seem to jut from the gums allows Jack to see how fast death is rushing toward this man He feels a little shiver of gooseflesh but he returns the smile easily enough This is also how he works If were gonna talk about mokin and swinkin you better call me Potsie All right Potsie When did you swink this guy in Chicago That much is easy Potter says It was summer when the bids went out but the hotshots were still bellerin about how the hippies came to town the year before and gave the cops and the mayor a black eye So Id say  What happened was Id done the building commissioner a big favor and Id done another for this old woman who swung weight on this special Equal Opportunity Housing Commission that Mayor Daley had set up So when the bids went out mine got special consideration This other guy  the moke  I have no doubt that his bid was lower He knew his way around and he musta had his own contacts but that time I had the inside track He smiles The gruesome teeth appear then disappear again Mokes bid Somehow gets lost Comes in too late Bad luck Chicago Potsie nails the job Then four years later the moke shows up here bidding on the Libertyville job Only that time when I beat him everything was squarejohn I pulled no strings I met him in the bar at the Nelson Hotel the night after the contract was awarded just by accident And he says You were that guy in Chicago And I say There are lots of guys in Chicago Now this guy was a moke but he was a scary moke He had a kind of smell about him I cant put it any better than that Anyway I was big and strong in those days I could be mean but I was pretty meek that time Even after a drink or two I was pretty meek  Yeah he says there are a lot of guys in Chicago but only one who diddled me I still got a sore ass from that Potsie and I got a long memory Any other time any other guy I might have asked how good his memory stayed after he got his head knocked on the floor but with him I just took it No more words passed between us He walked out I dont think I ever saw him again but I heard about him from time to time while I was working the Libertyville job Mostly from my subs Seems like the moke was building a house of his own in French Landing For his retirement Not that he was old enough to retire back then but he was gettin up a little Fifties Id say    and that was in  He was building a house here in town Jack muses Yeah It had a name too like one of those English houses The Birches Lake House Beardsley Manor you know What name Shit I cant even remember the mokes name how do you expect me to remember the name of the house he built But one thing I do remember none of the subs liked it It got a reputation Bad The worst There were accidents One guy cut his hand clean off on a band saw almost bled to death before they got him to the hospital Another guy fell off a scaffolding and ended up paralyzed    what they call a quad You know what that is Jack nods Only house I ever heard of people were calling haunted even before it was all the way built I got the idea that he had to finish most of it himself What else did they say about this place Jack puts the question idly as if he doesnt care much one way or the other but he cares a lot He has never heard of a socalled haunted house in French Landing He knows he hasnt been here anywhere near long enough to hear all the tales and legends but something like this    youd think something like this would pop out of the deck early Ah man I cant remember Just that    He pauses eyes distant Outside the building the crowd is finally beginning to disperse Jack wonders how Dale is doing with Brown and Black The time seems to be racing and he hasnt gotten what he needs from Potter What hes gotten so far is just enough to tantalize One guy told me the sun never shone there even when it shone Potter says abruptly He said the house was a little way off the road in a clearing and it should have gotten sun at least five hours a day in the summer but it somehow    didnt He said the guys lost their shadows just like in a fairy tale and they didnt like it And sometimes they heard a dog growling in the woods Sounded like a big one A mean one But they never saw it You know how it is I imagine Stories get started and then they just kinda feed on themselves    Potters shoulders suddenly slump His head lowers Man thats all I can remember What was the mokes name when he was in Chicago Cant remember Jack suddenly thrusts his open hands under Potters nose With his head lowered Potter doesnt see them until theyre right there and he recoils gasping He gets a noseful of the dying smell on Jacks skin What     Jesus whats that Potter seizes one of Jacks hands and sniffs again greedily Boy thats nice What is it Lilies Jack says but its not what he thinks What he thinks is The memory of my mother What was the mokes name when he was in Chicago It    something like beer stein Thats not it but its close Best I can do Beer stein Jack says And what was his name when he got to French Landing three years later Suddenly there are loud arguing voices on the stairs I dont care someone shouts Jack thinks its Black the more officious one Its our case hes our prisoner and were taking him out Now Dale Im not arguing Im just saying that the paperwork   Brown Aw fuck the paperwork Well take it with us What was his name in French Landing Potsie I cant   Potsie takes Jacks hands again Potsies own hands are dry and cold He smells Jacks palms eyes closed On the long exhale of his breath he says Burnside Chummy Burnside Not that he was chummy The nickname was a joke I think his real handle might have been Charlie Jack takes his hands back Charles Chummy Burnside Once known as Beer Stein Or something like Beer Stein And the house What was the name of the house Brown and Black are coming down the corridor now with Dale scurrying after them Theres no time Jack thinks Damnit all if I had even five minutes more  And then Potsie says Black House I dont know if thats what he called it or what the subs workin the job got to calling it but that was the name all right Jacks eyes widen The image of Henry Leydens cozy living room crosses his mind sitting with a drink at his elbow and reading about Jarndyce and Jarndyce Did you say Bleak House Black Potsie reiterates impatiently Because it really was It was   Oh dear to Christ one of the state troopers says in a snotty lookwhatthecatdraggedin voice that makes Jack feel like rearranging his face Its Brown but when Jack glances up its Browns partner he looks at The coincidence of the other troopers name makes Jack smile Hello boys Jack says getting up from the bunk What are you doing here Hollywood Black asks Just batting the breeze and waiting for you Jack says and smiles brilliantly I suppose you want this guy Youre goddamn right Brown growls And if you fucked up our case   Gosh I dont think so Jack says Its a struggle but he manages to achieve a tone of amiability Then to Potsie Youll be safer with them than here in French Landing sir George Potter looks vacant again Resigned Dont matter much either way he says then smiles as a thought occurs to him If old Chummys still alive and you run across him you might ask him if his ass still hurts from that diddling I gave him back in  And tell him old Chicago Potsie says hello What the hell are you talking about Brown asks glowering He has his cuffs out and is clearly itching to snap them on George Potters wrists Old times Jack says He stuffs his fragrant hands in his pockets and leaves the cell He smiles at Brown and Black Nothing to concern you boys Trooper Black turns to Dale Youre out of this case he says Those are words of one syllable I cant make it any simpler So tell me once and mean it forever Chief Do you understand Of course I do Dale said Take the case and welcome But get off the tall white horse willya If you expected me to simply stand by and let a crowd of drunks from the Sand Bar take this man out of Luckys and lynch him   Dont make yourself look any stupider than you already are Brown snaps They picked his name up off your police calls I doubt that Dale says quietly thinking of the dopers cell phone borrowed out of evidence storage Black grabs Potters narrow shoulder gives it a vicious twist then thrusts him so hard toward the door at the end of the corridor that the man almost falls down Potter recovers his haggard face full of pain and dignity Troopers Jack says He doesnt speak loudly or angrily but they both turn Abuse that prisoner one more time in my sight and Ill be on the phone to the Madison shooflypies the minute you leave and believe me Troopers they will listen to me Your attitude is arrogant coercive and counterproductive to the resolution of this case Your interdepartmental cooperation skills are nonexistent Your demeanor is unprofessional and reflects badly upon the state of Wisconsin You will either behave yourselves or I guarantee you that by next Friday you will be looking for security jobs Although his voice remains even throughout Black and Brown seem to shrink as he speaks By the time he finishes they look like a pair of chastened children Dale is gazing at Jack with awe Only Potter seems unaffected hes gazing down at his cuffed hands with eyes that could be a thousand miles away Go on now Jack says Take your prisoner take your case records and get lost Black opens his mouth to speak then shuts it again They leave When the door closes behind them Dale looks at Jack and says very softly Wow What If you dont know Dale says Im not going to tell you Jack shrugs Potter will keep them occupied which frees us up to do a little actual work If theres a bright side to tonight thats it What did you get from him Anything A name Might mean nothing Charles Burnside Nicknamed Chummy Ever heard of him Dale sticks out his lower lip and pulls it thoughtfully Then he lets go and shakes his head The name itself seems to ring a faint bell but that might only be because its so common The nickname no He was a builder a contractor a wheelerdealer in Chicago over thirty years ago According to Potsie at least Potsie Dale says The tape is peeling off a corner of the ONE CALL MEANS ONE CALL sign and Dale smoothes it back down with the air of a man who doesnt really know what hes doing You and he got pretty chummy didnt you No Jack says Burnsides Chummy And Trooper Black doesnt own the Black House Youve gone dotty What black house First its a proper name Black capital B house capital H Black House You ever heard of a house named that around here Dale laughs God no Jack smiles back but all at once its his interrogation smile not his Imdiscussingthingswithmyfriend smile Because hes a coppiceman now And he has seen a funny little flicker in Dale Gilbertsons eyes Are you sure Take a minute Think about it Told you no People dont name their houses in these parts Oh I guess old Miss Graham and Miss Pentle call their place on the other side of the town library Honeysuckle because of the honeysuckle bushes all over the fence in front but thats the only one in these parts I ever heard named Again Jack sees that flicker Potter is the one who will be charged for murder by the Wisconsin State Police but Jack didnt see that deep flicker in Potters eyes a single time during their interview Because Potter was straight with him Dale isnt being straight But I have to be gentle with him Jack tells himself Because he doesnt know hes not being straight How is that possible As if in answer he hears Chicago Potsies voice One guy told me the sun never shone there even when it shone    he said the guys lost their shadows just like in a fairy tale Memory is a shadow any cop trying to reconstruct a crime or an accident from the conflicting accounts of eyewitnesses knows it well Is Potsies Black House like this Something that casts no shadow Dales response he has now turned fullface to the peeling poster working on it as seriously as he might work on a heart attack victim in the street administering CPR right out of the manual until the ambulance arrives suggests to Jack that it might be something like just that Three days ago he wouldnt have allowed himself to consider such an idea but three days ago he hadnt returned to the Territories According to Potsie this place got a reputation as a haunted house even before it was completely built Jack says pressing a little Nope Dale moves on to the sign about the AA and NA meetings He examines the tape studiously not looking at Jack Doesnt ring the old chimeroo Sure One man almost bled to death Another took a fall that paralyzed him People complained  listen to this Dale its good  according to Potsie people complained about losing their shadows Couldnt see them even at midday with the sun shining full force Isnt that something Sure is but I dont remember any stories like that As Jack walks toward Dale Dale moves away Almost scutters away although Chief Gilbertson is not ordinarily a scuttering man Its a little funny a little sad a little horrible He doesnt know hes doing it Jacks sure of that There is a shadow Jack sees it and on some level Dale knows he sees it If Jack should force him too hard Dale would have to see it too    and Dale doesnt want that Because its a bad shadow Is it worse than a monster who kills children and then eats selected portions of their bodies Apparently part of Dale thinks so I could make him see that shadow Jack thinks coldly Put my hands under his nose  my lilyscented hands  and make him see it Part of him even wants to see it The coppiceman part Then another part of Jacks mind speaks up in the Speedy Parker drawl he now remembers from his childhood You could push him over the edge of a nervous breakdown too Jack God knows hes close to one after all the goinsons since the Irkenham boy got took You want to chance that And for what He didnt know the name about that he was bein straight Dale Dale gives Jack a quick bright glance then looks away The furtive quality in that quick peek sort of breaks Jacks heart What Lets go get a cup of coffee At this change of subject Dales face fills with glad relief He claps Jack on the shoulder Good idea Godpounding good idea right here and now Jack thinks then smiles Theres more than one way to skin a cat and more than one way to find a Black House Its been a long day Best maybe to let this go At least for tonight What about Railsback Dale asks as they clatter down the stairs You still want to talk to him You bet Jack replies heartily enough but he holds out little hope for Andy Railsback a picked witness who saw exactly what the Fisherman wanted him to see With one little exception    perhaps The single slipper Jack doesnt know if it will ever come to anything but it might In court for instance    as an identifying link    This is never going to court and you know it It may not even finish in this w  His thoughts are broken by a wave of cheerful sound as they step into the combination ready room and dispatch center The members of the French Landing Police Department are standing and applauding Henry Leyden is also standing and applauding Dale joins in Jesus guys quit it Jack says laughing and blushing at the same time But he wont lie to himself try to tell himself he takes no pleasure in that round of applause He feels the warmth of them can see the light of their regard Those things arent important But it feels like coming home and that is When Jack and Henry step out of the police station an hour or so later Beezer Mouse and Kaiser Bill are still there The other two have gone back to the Row to fill in the various old ladies on tonights events Sawyer Beezer says Yes Jack says Anything we can do man Can you dig that Anything Jack looks at the biker thoughtfully wondering what his story is    other than grief that is A fathers grief Beezers eyes remain steady on his A little off to one side Henry Leyden stands with his head raised to smell the river fog humming deep down in his throat Im going to look in on Irmas mom tomorrow around eleven Jack says Do you suppose you and your friends could meet me in the Sand Bar around noon She lives close to there I understand Ill buy youse a round of lemonade Beezer doesnt smile but his eyes warm up slightly Well be there Thats good Jack says Mind telling me why Theres a place that needs finding Does it have to do with whoever killed Amy and the other kids Maybe Beezer nods Maybes good enough Jack drives back toward Norway Valley slowly and not just because of the fog Although its still early in the evening he is tired to the bone and has an idea that Henry feels the same way Not because hes quiet Jack has become used to Henrys occasional dormant stretches No its the quiet in the truck itself Under ordinary circumstances Henry is a restless compulsive radio tuner running through the La Riviere stations checking KDCU here in town then ranging outward hunting for Milwaukee Chicago maybe even Omaha Denver and St Louis if conditions are right An appetizer of bop here a salad of spiritual music there perhaps a dash of Perry Como way down at the foot of the dial hotdiggity dogdiggity boom whatyadotome Not tonight though Tonight Henry just sits quiet on his side of the truck with his hands folded in his lap At last when theyre no more than two miles from his driveway Henry says No Dickens tonight Jack Im going straight to bed The weariness in Henrys voice startles Jack makes him uneasy Henry doesnt sound like himself or any of his radio personae at this moment he just sounds old and tired on the way to being used up I am too Jack agrees trying not to let his concern show in his voice Henry picks up on every vocal nuance Hes eerie that way What do you have in mind for the Thunder Five may I ask Im not entirely sure Jack says and perhaps because hes tired he gets this untruth past Henry He intends to start Beezer and his buddies looking for the place Potsie told him about the place where shadows had a way of disappearing At least way back in the seventies they did He had also intended to ask Henry if hes ever heard of a French Landing domicile called Black House Not now though Not after hearing how beat Henry sounds Tomorrow maybe Almost certainly in fact because Henry is too good a resource not to use Best to let him recycle a little first though You have the tape right Henry pulls the cassette with the Fishermans  call on it partway out of his breast pocket then puts it back Yes Mother But I dont think I can listen to a killer of small children tonight Jack Not even if you come in and listen with me Tomorrow will be fine Jack says hoping he isnt condemning another of French Landings children to death by saying this Youre not entirely sure of that No Jack agrees but you listening to that tape with dull ears could do more harm than good I am sure of that First thing in the morning I promise Henrys house is up ahead now It looks lonely with only the one light on over the garage but of course Henry doesnt need lights inside to find his way Henry are you going to be all right Yes Henry says but to Jack he doesnt seem entirely sure No Rat tonight Jack tells him firmly No Ditto the Shake the Shook the Sheik Henrys lips lift in a small smile Not even a George Rathbun promo for French Landing Chevrolet where price is king and you never pay a dime of interest for the first six months with approved credit Straight to bed Me too Jack says But an hour after lying down and putting out the lamp on his bedside table Jack is still unable to sleep Faces and voices revolve in his mind like crazy clock hands Or a carousel on a deserted midway Tansy Freneau Bring out the monster who killed my pretty baby Beezer St Pierre Well have to see how it shakes out wont we George Potter That shit gets in and waits My theory is that it never goes away not really Speedy a voice from the distant past on the sort of telephone that was science fiction when Jack first met him Hideyho Travelin Jack    as one coppiceman to another son I think you ought to visit Chief Gilbertsons private bathroom Right now As one coppiceman to another right And most of all over and over again Judy Marshall You dont just say Im lost and I dont know how to get back  you keep on going    Yes but keep on going where Where At last he gets up and goes out onto the porch with his pillow under his arm The night is warm in Norway Valley where the fog was thin to begin with the last remnants have now disappeared blown away by a soft east wind Jack hesitates then goes on down the steps naked except for his underwear The porch is no good to him though Its where he found that hellish box with the sugarpacket stamps He walks past his truck past the bird hotel and into the north field Above him are a billion stars Crickets hum softly in the grass His fleeing path through the hay and timothy has disappeared or maybe now hes entering the field in a different place A little way in he lies down on his back puts the pillow under his head and looks up at the stars Just for a little while he thinks Just until all those ghost voices empty out of my head Just for a little while Thinking this he begins to drowse Thinking this he goes over Above his head the pattern of the stars changes He sees the new constellations form What is that one where the Big Dipper was a moment before Is it the Sacred Opopanax Perhaps it is He hears a low pleasant creaking sound and knows its the windmill he saw when he flipped just this morning a thousand years ago He doesnt need to look at it to be sure any more than he needs to look at where his house was and see that it has once more become a barn Creak    creak    creak vast wooden vanes turning in that same east wind Only now the wind is infinitely sweeter infinitely purer Jack touches the waistband of his underpants and feels some rough weave No Jockey shorts in this world His pillow has changed too Foam has become goosedown but its still comfortable More comfortable than ever in truth Sweet under his head Ill catch him Speedy Jack Sawyer whispers up at the new shapes in the new stars At least Ill try He sleeps When he awakens its early morning The breeze is gone In the direction from which it came theres a bright orange line on the horizon  the sun is on its way Hes stiff and his ass hurts and hes damp with dew but hes rested The steady rhythmic creaking is gone but that doesnt surprise him He knew from the moment he opened his eyes that hes in Wisconsin again And he knows something else he can go back Any time he wants The real Coulee Country the deep Coulee Country is just a wish and a motion away This fills him with joy and dread in equal parts Jack gets up and barefoots back to the house with his pillow under his arm He guesses its about five in the morning Another three hours sleep will make him ready for anything On the porch steps he touches the cotton of his Jockey shorts Although his skin is damp the shorts are almost dry Of course they are For most of the hours he spent sleeping rough as he spent so many nights that autumn when he was twelve they werent on him at all They were somewhere else In the Land of Opopanax Jack says and goes inside Three minutes later hes asleep again in his own bed When he wakes at eight with the sensible sun streaming in through his window he could almost believe that his latest journey was a dream But in his heart he knows better REMEMBER THOSE news vans that drove into the parking lot behind the police station And Wendell Greens contribution to the excitement before Officer Hrabowskis giant flashlight knocked him into the Land of Nod Once the crews inside the vans took in the seeming inevitability of a riot we can be sure they rose to the occasion for the next morning their footage of the wild night dominates television screens across the state By nine oclock people in Racine and Milwaukee people in Madison and Delafield and people who live so far north in the state that they need satellite dishes to get any television at all are looking up from their pancakes their bowls of Special K their fried eggs and their buttered English muffins to watch a small nervouslooking policeman finishing off a large florid reporters budding career as a demagogue by clocking him with a blunt instrument And we may also be sure of one other matter that nowhere is this footage watched as widely and compulsively as in French Landing and the neighboring communities of Centralia and Arden Thinking about several matters at once Jack Sawyer watches it all on a little portable TV placed on his kitchen counter He hopes that Dale Gilbertson will not revoke Arnold Hrabowskis suspension although he strongly suspects that the Mad Hungarian will soon be back in uniform Dale only thinks he wants him off the force for good he is too softhearted to listen to Arnies pleas  and after last night even a blind man can see that Arnie is going to plead  without relenting Jack also hopes that the awful Wendell Green will get fired or move away in disgrace Reporters are not supposed to thrust themselves into their stories and here is good old loudmouth Wendell baying for blood like a werewolf However Jack has the depressing feeling that Wendell Green will talk his way out of his present difficulties that is lie his way out of them and go on being a powerful nuisance And Jack is pondering Andy Railsbacks description of the creepy old man trying the doorknobs on the third floor of the Nelson Hotel There he was the Fisherman given form at last An old man in a blue robe and one slipper striped black and yellow like a bumblebee Andy Railsback had wondered if this unpleasantlooking old party had wandered away from the Maxton Elder Care Facility That was an interesting notion Jack thought If Chummy Burnside is the man who planted the photographs in George Potters room Maxtons would be a perfect hideyhole for him Wendell Green is watching the news on the Sony in his hotel room He cannot take his eyes off the screen although what he sees there afflicts him with a mixture of feelings  anger shame and humiliation  that makes his stomach boil The knot on his head throbs and every time he witnesses that poor excuse for a cop sneaking up behind him with his flashlight raised he pushes his fingers into the thick curly hair at the back of his head and gently palpates it The damn thing feels about the size of a ripe tomato and just as ready to burst Hes lucky not to have a concussion That pipsqueak could have killed him Okay maybe he went a little bit over the edge maybe he took a tiny step across a professional boundary he never claimed to be perfect The local news guys they piss him off all that guff about Jack Sawyer Who is the top guy covering the Fisherman story Who has been all over it from day one telling the citizens what they need to know Whos been putting himself on the line day after crummy goddamn day Who gave the guy his name Not those blowdried airheads Bucky and Stacey those wannabe news reporters and local anchors who smile into the camera to show off their capped teeth thats for sure Wendell Green is a legend around here a star the closest thing to a giant of journalism ever to come out of western Wisconsin Even over in Madison the name Wendell Green stands for    well unquestioned excellence And if the name Wendell Green is like the gold standard now just wait until he rides the Fishermans bloodspattered shoulders all the way to a Pulitzer Prize So Monday morning he has to go into the office and pacify his editor Big deal It isnt the first time and it wont be the last Good reporters make waves nobody admits it but thats the deal thats the fine print nobody reads until its too late When he walks into his editors office he knows what hes going to say Biggest story of the day and did you see any other reporters there And when he has the editor eating out of his hand again which will take about ten minutes flat he intends to drop in on a Goltzs salesman named Fred Marshall One of Wendells most valuable sources has suggested that Mr Marshall has some interesting information about his special special baby the Fisherman case Arnold Hrabowski now a hero to his darling wife Paula is watching the news in a postcoital glow and thinking that she is right he really should call Chief Gilbertson and ask to be taken off suspension Wondering with half his mind where he might look for George Potters old adversary Dale Gilbertson watches Bucky and Stacey cut away yet again to the spectacle of the Mad Hungarian taking care of Wendell Green and thinks that he really should reinstate the little guy Would you look at the beautiful swing Arnie took Dale cant help it  that swing really brightens up his day Its like watching Mark McGwire like watching Tiger Woods Alone in her dark little house off the highway Wanda Kinderling to whom we have made passing mention from time to time is listening to the radio Why is she listening to the radio Some months ago she had to decide between paying her cable bill and buying another half gallon of Aristocrat vodka and sorry Bucky and Stacey but Wanda followed her bliss she went with her heart Without cable service her television set brings in little more than snow and a heavy dark line that scrolls up over her screen in an endless loop Wanda always hated Bucky and Stacey anyhow along with almost everyone else on television especially if they looked content and well groomed She has a special loathing for the hosts of morning news programs and network anchors Wanda has not been content or well groomed since her husband Thorny was accused of terrible crimes he could never ever have committed by that high and mighty showoff Jack Sawyer Jack Sawyer ruined her life and Wanda is not about to forgive or forget That man trapped her husband He set him up He smeared Thornys innocent name and packed him off to jail just to make himself look good Wanda hopes they never catch the Fisherman because the Fisherman is exactly what they deserve those dirty bastards Play dirty you are dirty and people like that can go straight to the deepest bowels of hell  thats what Wanda Kinderling thinks The Fisherman is retribution  thats what Wanda thinks Let him kill a hundred brats let him kill a thousand and after that he can start in on their parents Thorny could not have killed those sluts down there in Los Angeles Those were sex murders and Thorny had no interest in sex thank the Lord The rest of him grew up but his manpart never did his thingie was about the size of his little finger It was impossible for him to care about nasty women and sex things But Jack Sawyer lived in Los Angeles didnt he So why couldnt he have killed those sluts those whores and blamed it all on Thorny The newscaster describes former Lieutenant Sawyers actions of the previous night and Wanda Kinderling spits up bile grabs the glass from her bedside table and douses the fire in her guts with three inches of vodka Gorg who would seem a natural visitor to the likes of Wanda pays no attention to the news for he is far away in Faraway In his bed at Maxtons Charles Burnside is enjoying dreams not precisely his for they emanate from another being from elsewhere and depict a world he has never seen on his own Ragged enslaved children plod on their bleeding foodzies past leaping flames turning giant wheels that turn yet larger wheels oho aha that power the beyoodiful engynes of destruction mounting mounting to the blackandred sky The Big Combination An acrid stink of molten metal and something truly vile something like dragon urine perfumes the air as does the leaden stench of despair Lizard demons with thick flickering tails whip the children along A din of clattering and banging of crashing and enormous thuds punishes the ears These are the dreams of Burnys dearest friend and loving master Mr Munshun a being of endless and perverse delight Down past the end of Daisy wing across the handsome lobby and through Rebecca Vilass little cubicle Chipper Maxton is concerned with matters considerably more mundane The little TV on a shelf over the safe broadcasts the wondrous image of Mad Hungarian Hrabowski clobbering Wendell Green with a nice clean sweep of his heavyduty flashlight but Chipper barely notices the splendid moment He has to come up with the thirteen thousand dollars he owes his bookie and he has only about half of that sum Yesterday lovely Rebecca drove to Miller to withdraw most of what he had stashed there and he can use about two thousand dollars from his own account as long as he replaces it before the end of the month That leaves about six grand an amount that will call for some seriously creative bookkeeping Fortunately creative bookkeeping is a speciality of Chippers and when he begins to think of his options he sees his current difficulty as an opportunity After all he went into business in the first place to steal as much money as possible didnt he Apart from being serviced by Ms Vilas stealing is about the only activity that makes him truly happy The amount is almost irrelevant as we have seen Chipper derives as much pleasure from conning chump change out of the visiting relatives after the Strawberry Fest as from screwing the government out of ten or fifteen thousand dollars The thrill lies in getting away with it So he needs six thousand why not take ten thousand That way he can leave his own account untouched and still have an extra two grand to play with He has two sets of books on his computer and he can easily draw the money from the companys bank account without setting off bells during his next state audit which is coming up in about a month Unless the auditors demand the bank records and even then there are a couple of tricks he can use Its too bad about the audit though  Chipper would like to have a little more time to paper over the cracks Losing the thirteen thousand wasnt the problem he thinks The problem was that he lost it at the wrong time In order to keep everything clear in his head Chipper pulls his keyboard toward him and tells the computer to print out complete statements of both sets of books for the past month By the time the auditors show up baby those pages will have been fed into the shredder and come out as macaroni Let us move from one form of insanity to another After the owner of the Holiday Trailer Park has extended a trembling index finger to point out the Freneau residence Jack drives toward it on the dusty path with gathering doubts Tansys Airstream is the last and least maintained of a row of four Two of the others have flowers in a bright border around them and the third has been dressed up with striped green awnings that make it look more like a house The fourth trailer displays no signs of decoration or improvement Dying flowers and skimpy weeds straggle in the beaten earth surrounding it The shades are pulled down An air of misery and waste hangs about it along with a quality Jack might define if he stopped to consider it as slippage In no obvious way the trailer looks wrong Unhappiness has distorted it as it can distort a person and when Jack gets out of his truck and walks toward the cinder blocks placed before the entrance his doubts increase He can no longer be sure why he has come to this place It occurs to Jack that he can give Tansy Freneau nothing but his pity and this thought makes him uneasy Then it occurs to him that these doubts mask his real feelings which have to do with the discomfort the trailer arouses in him He does not want to enter that thing Everything else is a rationalization he has no choice but to keep moving forward His eyes find the welcome mat a reassuring touch of the ordinary world he can feel already disappearing around him and he steps up onto the topmost board and knocks on the door Nothing happens Maybe she really is still asleep and would prefer to stay that way If he were Tansy he would stay in bed as long as possible If he were Tansy hed stay in bed for weeks Once more pushing away his reluctance Jack raps on the door again and says Tansy Are you up A little voice from within says Up where Uhoh Jack thinks and says Out of bed Im Jack Sawyer Tansy We met last night Im helping the police and I told you Id come over today He hears footsteps moving toward the door Are you the man who gave me the flowers He was a nice man That was me A lock clicks and the knob revolves The door cracks open A sliver of a faintly oliveskinned face and a single eye shine out of the inner darkness It is you Come in fast Fast She steps back opening the door just wide enough for him to pass through As soon as he is inside she slams it shut and locks it again The molten light burning at the edges of the curtains and the window shades deepens the darkness of the long trailers interior One soft lamp burns above the sink and another just as low illuminates a little table otherwise occupied by a bottle of coffee brandy a smeary glass decorated with a picture of a cartoon character and a scrapbook The circle of light cast by the lamp extends to take in half of a low fabriccovered chair next to the table Tansy Freneau pushes herself off the door and takes two light delicate steps toward him She tilts her head and folds her hands together beneath her chin The eager slightly glazed expression in her eyes dismays Jack By even the widest most comprehensive definition of sanity this woman is not sane He has no idea what to say to her Would you care to    sit down With a hostessy wave of her hand she indicates a highbacked wooden chair If its all right with you Why wouldnt it be all right Im going to sit down in my chair why shouldnt you sit down in that one Thank you Jack says and sits down watching her glide back to the door to check the lock Satisfied Tansy gives him a brilliant smile and pads back to her chair moving almost with the duckwaddle grace of a ballerina When she lowers herself to the chair he says Are you afraid of someone who might come here Tansy Is there someone you want to keep locked out Oh yes she says and leans forward pulling her eyebrows together in an exaggerated display of littlegirl seriousness But it isnt a someone its a thing And Im never never going to let him in my house again not ever But Ill let you in because youre a very nice man and you gave me those beautiful flowers And youre very handsome too Is Gorg the thing you want to keep out Tansy Are you afraid of Gorg Yes she says primly Would you care for a cup of tea No thank you Well Im going to have some Its very very good tea It tastes sort of like coffee She raises her eyebrows and gives him a bright questioning look He shakes his head Without moving from her chair Tansy pours two fingers of the brandy into her glass and sets the bottle back down on the table The figure on her glass Jack sees is ScoobyDoo Tansy sips from the glass Yummy Do you have a girlfriend I could be your girlfriend you know especially if you gave me more of those lovely flowers I put them in a vase She pronounces the word like a parody of a Boston matron vahhhz See On the kitchen counter the lilies of the vale droop in a mason jar halffilled with water Removed from the Territories they do not have long to live This world Jack supposes is poisoning them faster than they are able to deal with Every ounce of goodness they yield to their surroundings subtracts from their essence Tansy he realizes has been kept afloat on the residue of the Territories remaining in the lilies  when they die her protective littlegirl persona will crumble into dust and her madness may engulf her That madness came from Gorg hed bet his life on it I do have a boyfriend but he doesnt count His name is Lester Moon Beezer and his friends call him Stinky Cheese but I dont know why Lester isnt all that stinky at least not when hes sober Tell me about Gorg Jack says Extending her little finger away from the ScoobyDoo glass Tansy takes another sip of coffee brandy She frowns Oh thats a real icky thing to talk about I want to know about him Tansy If you help me I can make sure he never bothers you again Really And youd be helping me find the man who killed your daughter I cant talk about that now Its too upsetting Tansy flutters her free hand over her lap as if sweeping off a crumb Her face contracts and a new expression moves into her eyes For a second the desperate unprotected Tansy rises to the surface threatening to explode in a madness of grief and rage Does Gorg look like a person or like something else Tansy shakes her head from side to side with great slowness She is composing herself again reinstating a personality that can ignore her real emotions Gorg does not look like a person Not at all You said he gave you the feather you were wearing Does he look like a bird Gorg doesnt look like a bird he is a bird And do you know what kind She leans forward again and her face takes on the expression of a sixyearold girl about to tell the worst thing she knows A raven Thats what he is a big old raven All black But not shiny black Her eyes widen with the seriousness of what she has to say He came from Nights Plutonian shore Thats from a poem Mrs Normandie taught us in the sixth grade The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe Tansy straightens up having passed on this nugget of literary history Jack guesses that Mrs Normandie probably wore the same satisfied pedagogic expression that is now on Tansys face but without the bright unhealthy glaze in Tansys eyes Nights Plutonian shore is not part of this world Tansy continues Did you know that Its alongside this world and outside it You need to find a door if you want to go there This is like talking to Judy Marshall Jack abruptly realizes but a Judy without the depth of soul and the unbelievable courage that rescued her from madness The instant that Judy Marshall comes into his mind he wants to see her again so strongly that Judy feels like the one essential key to the puzzle all around him And if she is the key she is also the door the key opens Jack wants to be out of the dark warped atmosphere of Tansys Airstream he wants to put off the Thunder Five and speed up the highway and over the hill to Arden and the gloomy hospital where radiant Judy Marshall has found freedom in a locked mental ward But I dont ever want to find that door because I dont want to go there Tansy says in a singsong voice Nights Plutonian shore is a bad world Everythings on fire there How do you know that Gorg told me she whispers Tansys gaze skitters away from him and fastens on the ScoobyDoo glass Gorg likes fire But not because it makes him warm Because it burns things up and that makes him happy Gorg said    She shakes her head and lifts the glass to her mouth Instead of drinking from it she tilts the liquid toward the lip of the glass and laps at it with her tongue Her eyes slide up to meet his again I think my tea is magic I bet you do Jack thinks and his heart nearly bursts for delicate lost Tansy You cant cry in here she tells him You looked like you wanted to cry but you cant Mrs Normandie doesnt allow it You can kiss me though Do you want to kiss me Of course I do he says But Mrs Normandie doesnt allow kissing either Oh well Tansy laps again at her drink We can do it later when she leaves the room And you can put your arms around me like Lester Moon And everything Lester does you can do With me Thank you Jack says Tansy can you tell me some of the other things Gorg said She cants her head and pushes her lips in and out He said he came here through a burning hole With foldedback edges And he said I was a mother and I had to help my daughter In the poem her name is Lenore but her real name is Irma And he said    he said a mean old man ate her leg but there were worse things that could have happened to my Irma For a couple of seconds Tansy seems to recede into herself to vanish behind her stationary surface Her mouth remains half open she does not even blink When she returns from where she has gone it is like watching a statue slowly come to life Her voice is almost too soft to be heard I was supposed to fix that old man fix him but good Only you gave me my beautiful lilies and he wasnt the right man was he Jack feels like screaming He said there were worse things Tansy says in a whisper of disbelief But he didnt say what they were He showed me instead And when I saw I thought my eyes burned up Even though I could still see What did you see A big big place all made of fire Tansy says Going way high up She falls silent and an internal temblor runs through her beginning in her face and moving down and out through her fingers Irma isnt there No she isnt She got dead and a mean old man ate her leg He sent me a letter but I never got it So Gorg read it to me I dont want to think about that letter She sounds like a little girl describing something she has heard about thirdhand or has invented A thick curtain lies between Tansy and what she has seen and heard and that curtain allows her to function Jack again wonders what will happen to her when the lilies die And now she says if youre not going to kiss me its time you left I want to be alone for a while Surprised by her decisiveness Jack stands up and begins to say something polite and meaningless Tansy waves him toward the door Outside the air seems heavy with bad odors and unseen chemicals The lilies from the Territories retained more power than Jack had imagined enough to sweeten and purify Tansys air The ground beneath Jacks feet has been baked dry and a parched sourness hangs in the atmosphere Jack has nearly to force himself to breathe as he walks toward his truck but the more he breathes the more quickly he will readjust to the ordinary world His world though now it feels poisoned He wants to do one thing only drive up Highway  to Judy Marshalls lookout point and keep on going through Arden and into the parking lot past the hospital doors past the barriers of Dr Spiegleman and Warden Jane Bond until he can find himself once again in the lifegiving presence of Judy Marshall herself He almost thinks he loves Judy Marshall Maybe he does love her He knows he needs her Judy is his door and his key His door his key Whatever that means it is the truth All right the woman he needs is married to the extremely nice Fred Marshall but he doesnt want to marry her in fact he doesnt even want to sleep with her not exactly  he just wants to stand before her and see what happens Something will happen thats for sure but when he tries to picture it all he sees is an explosion of tiny red feathers hardly the image he was hoping for Feeling unsteady Jack props himself on the cab of his truck with one hand while he grabs the door handle with the other Both surfaces sear his hands and he waves them in the air for a little while When he gets into the cab the seat is hot too He rolls down his window and with a twinge of loss notices that the world smells normal to him again It smells fine It smells like summer Where is he going to go That is an interesting question he thinks but after he gets back on the road and travels no more than a hundred feet the low gray wooden shape of the Sand Bar appears on his left and without hesitating he turns into the absurdly extensive parking lot as if he knew where he was going all along Looking for a shady spot Jack cruises around to the back of the building and sees the Bars single hint of landscaping a broad maple tree that rises out of the asphalt at the far end of the lot He guides the Ram into the maples shadow and gets out leaving the windows cranked down Waves of heat ripple upward from the only other two cars in the lot It is  AM He is getting hungry too since his breakfast consisted of a cup of coffee and a slice of toast smeared with marmalade and that was three hours ago Jack has the feeling that the afternoon is going to be a long one He might as well have something to eat while he waits for the bikers The back door of the Sand Bar opens onto a narrow restroom alcove that leads into a long rectangular space with a gleaming bar at one side and a row of substantial wooden booths on the other Two big pool tables occupy the middle of the room and a jukebox stands set back against the wall between them At the front of the room a big television screen hangs where it can be seen by everyone suspended eight or nine feet above the clean wooden floor The sound has been muted on a commercial that never quite identifies the purpose of its product After the glare of the parking lot the Bar seems pleasantly dark and while Jacks eyes adjust the few low lamps appear to send out hazy beams of light The bartender whom Jack takes to be the famous Lester Stinky Cheese Moon looks up once as Jack enters then returns to the copy of the Herald folded open on the bar When Jack takes a stool a few feet to his right he looks up again Stinky Cheese is not as awful as Jack had expected He is wearing a clean shirt only a few shades whiter than his round smallfeatured face and his shaven head Moon has the unmistakable air half professional and half resentful of someone who has taken over the family business and suspects he could have done better elsewhere Jacks intuition tells him that this sense of weary frustration is the source of his nickname among the bikers because it gives him the look of one who expects to encounter a nasty smell any minute now Can I get something to eat here Jack asks him Its all listed on the board The bartender turns sideways and indicates a white board with movable letters that spell out the menu Hamburger cheeseburger hot dog bratwurst kielbasa sandwiches french fries onion rings The mans gesture is intended to make Jack feel unobservant and it works Sorry I didnt see the sign The bartender shrugs Cheeseburger medium with fries please Lunch dont start until eleventhirty which it says on the board See Another halfmocking gesture toward the sign But Mom is setting up in back I could give her the order now and shell start in on it when shes ready Jack thanks him and the bartender glances up at the television screen and walks down to the end of the bar and disappears around a corner A few seconds later he returns looks up at the screen and asks Jack what he would like to drink Ginger ale Jack says Watching the screen Lester Moon squirts ginger ale from a nozzle into a beer glass and pushes the glass toward Jack Then he slides his hand down the bar to pick up the remote control and says Hope you dont mind but I was watching this old movie Pretty funny He punches a button on the remote and from over his left shoulder Jack hears his mothers voice say Looks like Smokys coming in late today I wish that little rascal would learn how to handle his liquor Before he can turn sideways to face the screen Lester Moon is asking him if he remembers Lily Cavanaugh Oh yes I always liked her when I was a kid Same here Jack says As Jack had known instantly the movie is The Terror of Deadwood Gulch a  comic Western in which the thenfamous and still fondly remembered Bill Towns a sort of poor mans Bob Hope played a cowardly gambler and cardsharp who arrives in the little Potemkin community of Deadwood Gulch Arizona and is soon mistaken for a notorious gunfighter As the beautiful quickwitted owner of a saloon called the Lazy  the lively center of village social life Lily Cavanaugh is much appreciated by the crowd of cowpokes loungers ranchers merchants lawmen and riffraff who fill her place every night She makes her patrons check their revolvers at the door and mind their manners which tend toward the opopanax In the scene playing now which is about half an hour into the movie Lily is alone in her saloon trying to get rid of a persistent bee A bee for the Queen of the Bs Jack thinks and smiles At the buzzing nuisance Lily flaps a cleaning rag a flyswatter a mop a broom a gun belt The bee eludes her every effort zooming here and there from the bar to a card table to the top of a whiskey bottle the tops of three other bottles all in a row the lid of the upright piano often waiting while its adversary comes sneaking up by subtle indirection then taking off a second before the latest weapon slams down It is a lovely little sequence that verges on slapstick and when Jacky was six six six or maybe seven half hysterical with laughter at the sight of his competent mother failing repeatedly to vanquish this flying annoyance and suddenly curious as to how the movie guys had made the insect do all these things his mother had explained that it was not a real bee but an enchanted one produced by the specialeffects department Lester Moon says I could never figure out how they got the bee to go where they wanted Like what did they do train it First they filmed her alone on the set Jack says having concluded that after all Stinky Cheese is a pretty decent fellow with great taste in actresses Special effects put the bee in later It isnt a real bee its a drawing  an animation You really cant tell can you No way Are you sure How do you know that anyhow I read it in a book somewhere Jack says using his allpurpose response to such questions Resplendent in fancy cardsharp getup Bill Towns saunters through the Lazy s swinging doors and leers at its proprietress without noticing that she is edging toward the bee now once again installed upon the shiny bar He has romance in mind and he swaggers when he walks I see you came back for more hotshot Lily says You must like the place Baby this is the sweetest joint west of the wide Missouri Reminds me of the place where I beat Black Jack McGurk to the draw Poor Black Jack He never did know when to fold em With a noise like the revving of a B the enchanted bee a creature of fiction inside the fiction launches itself at Bill Townss slickly behatted head The comedians face turns rubbery with comic terror He waves his arms he jigs he screeches The enchanted bee performs aeronautic stunts around the panicky pseudogunfighter Townss splendid hat falls off his hair disarranges itself He edges toward a table and with a final flurry of hand waving dives under it and begs for help Eye fixed on the ambling bee Lily walks to the bar and picks up a glass and a folded newspaper She approaches the table watching the bee walking around in circles She jumps forward and lowers the glass trapping the bee It flies up and bumps the bottom of the glass Lily tilts the glass slides the folded paper underneath it and raises her hands holding the newspaper against the top of the glass The camera pulls back and we see the cowardly gambler peeking out from under the table as Lily pushes the doors open and releases the bee Behind him Lester Moon says Cheeseburgers ready mister For the next half hour Jack eats his burger and tries to lose himself in the movie The burger is great worldclass with that juicy taste you can get only from a greasedup griddle and the fries are perfect golden and crunchy on the outside but his concentration keeps wandering from The Terror of Deadwood Gulch The problem is not that he has seen the movie perhaps a dozen times the problem is Tansy Freneau Certain things she said trouble him The more he thinks about them the less he understands what is going on According to Tansy the crow  the raven  named Gorg came from a world alongside and outside the world we know She had to be talking about the Territories Using a phrase from Poes The Raven she called this other world Nights Plutonian shore which was pretty good for someone like Tansy but did not seem in any way applicable to the magical Territories Gorg had told Tansy that everything in his world was on fire and not even the Blasted Lands met that description Jack could remember the Blasted Lands and the odd train that had taken him and Rational Richard then a sick wasted Rational Richard across that vast red desert Strange creatures had lived there alligatormen and birds with the faces of bearded monkeys but it had certainly not been on fire The Blasted Lands were the product of some past disaster not the site of a present conflagration What had Tansy said A big big place made all of fire    going way high up What had she seen to what landscape had Gorg opened her eyes It sounded like a great burning tower or a tall building consumed by fire A burning tower a burning building in a burning world  how could that world be the Territories Jack has been in the Territories twice in the past fortyeight hours and what he has seen has been beautiful More than beautiful  cleansing The deepest truth Jack knows about the Territories is that they contain a kind of sacred magic the magic he saw in Judy Marshall Because of that magic the Territories can confer a wondrous blessing on human beings The life of that extraordinary tough beloved woman making fun of Bill Towns on the big screen before him was saved by an object from the Territories Because Jack had been in the Territories  and maybe because he had held the Talisman  almost every horse he bets on comes in first every stock he buys triples in value ever poker hand he holds takes the pot So what world is Tansy talking about And whats all this stuff about Gorg coming here through a burning hole When Jack flipped over yesterday he had sensed something unhappy something unhealthy far off to the southwest and he suspected that was where he would find the Fishermans Twinner Kill the Fisherman kill the Twinner it didnt matter which he did first the other one would weaken But    It still didnt make sense When you travel between worlds you just flip  you dont set a fire at the worlds edge and run through it into another one A few minutes before twelve the rumble of motorcycles drowns the voices on the screen Um mister you might want to take off says Moon Thats the   The Thunder Five Jack says I know Okay Its just they scare the shit out of some of my customers But as long as you treat em right they act okay I know Theres nothing to worry about I mean if you buy em a beer or something theyll think youre all right Jack gets off his stool and faces the bartender Lester there is no reason to be nervous Theyre coming here to meet me Lester blinks For the first time Jack notices that his eyebrows are thin curved wisps like those of a s vamp Id better start pourin a pitcher of Kingsland He grabs a pitcher from beneath the bar sets it under the Kingsland Ale tap and opens the valve A thick stream of amber liquid rushes into the pitcher and turns to foam The sound of the motorcycles builds to an uproar at the front of the building then cuts off Beezer St Pierre bangs through the door closely followed by Doc Mouse Sonny and Kaiser Bill They look like Vikings and Jack is overjoyed to see them Stinky turn that TV the fuck off Beezer roars And we didnt come here to drink so empty that pitcher into the drain The way you pour its all head anyhow And when youre done get back in the kitchen with your momma Our business with this mans got nothin to do with you Okay Beezer Moon says in a shaky voice All I need is a second Then thats what you got Beezer says Beezer and the others line up in front of the bar some of them staring at Stinky Cheese some more kindly at Jack Mouse is still wearing his cornrows and he has daubed some black antiglare substance beneath his eyes like a football player Kaiser Bill and Sonny have pulled their manes back into ponytails again Ale and foam slide out of the pitcher and seep into the drain Okay guys Moon says His footsteps retreat along the back of the bar A door closes The members of the Thunder Five separate and spread out in front of Jack Most of them have crossed their arms on their chests and muscles bulge Jack pushes his plate to the back of the bar stands up and says Before last night had any of you guys ever heard of George Potter From his perch on the edge of the pool table nearest to the front door Jack faces Beezer and Doc who lean forward on their bar stools Kaiser Bill one finger against his lips and his head bowed stands beside Beezer Mouse lies stretched out on the second pool table propping his head up with one hand Banging his fists together and scowling Sonny is pacing back and forth between the bar and the jukebox You sure he didnt say Bleak House like the Dickens novel Mouse says Im sure says Jack reminding himself that he should not be surprised every time one of these guys demonstrates that he went to college It was Black House  Jeez I almost think I    Mouse shakes his head What was the builders name again asks Beezer Burnside First name probably Charles sometimes known as Chummy A long time ago he changed it from something like Beer Stein  Beerstein Bernstein You got me Jack says And you think hes the Fisherman Jack nods Beezer is staring at him as if trying to see the back of his head How sure are you Ninetynine percent He planted the Polaroids in Potters room Damn Beezer pushes himself off his stool and walks around to the back of the bar I want to make sure nobody forgets the obvious He bends down and straightens up with a telephone book in one hand Know what I mean Beezer opens the directory on the bar flips a few pages flips back and runs his thick finger down a column of names No Burnside Too bad Good idea though Jack says This morning I tried the same thing myself Sonny pauses on his return journey from the jukebox and jabs a finger at Jack How long ago was this damn house built Nearly thirty years ago During the seventies Hell we were all kids then back in Illinois How are we supposed to know about that house You guys get around I thought there was a pretty good chance you might have seen it And the place is spooky People tend to talk about houses like that They did in normal cases at least Jack thought In normal cases spooky houses got that way because they had been empty for a couple of years or because something terrible had happened in them In this case he thought the house itself was terrible and the people who otherwise would have talked about it could barely remember seeing it Judging by Dales response Black House had vanished into its own nonexistent shadow He says Think about this Try to remember In the years youve been living in French Landing have you ever heard of a house that seemed to have a curse on it Black House caused injuries to the people who built it The workmen hated the place they were afraid of it They said you couldnt see your shadow when you got near it They were claiming it was haunted while they worked on it Eventually they all quit and Burnside had to finish the job himself Its off by itself somewhere Doc says Obviously this thing isnt sitting around in plain view Its not in some development like Libertyville Youre not going to find it on Robin Hood Lane Right Jack says I should have mentioned that before Potter told me it was built a little way off what he called the road in a kind of clearing So its in the woods Doc youre right Its isolated Hey hey hey Mouse says swinging his legs over the side of the pool table and grunting himself upright His eyes are screwed shut and he claps one meaty hand on his forehead If I could only remember    He lets out a howl of frustration What Beezers voice is at twice its normal volume and the word sounds like a paving stone hitting a cement sidewalk I know I saw that fucking place he says As soon as you started talking about it I had this feeling it sounded kinda familiar It kept hanging at the back of my mind but it wouldnt come out When I tried to think about it  you know make myself remember  I kept seeing these sparkly lights When Jack said it was back in the woods I knew what he was talking about I had a clear picture of the place Surrounded by all these sparkling lights That doesnt sound much like Black House Jack says Sure it does The lights werent really there I just saw them Mouse offers this observation as though it is completely rational Sonny utters a bark of laughter and Beezer shakes his head and says Shit I dont get it Jack says Beezer looks at Jack holds up one finger and asks Mouse Are we talking about July August two years ago Naturally Mouse says The summer of the Ultimate Acid He looks at Jack and smiles Two years ago we got this amazing amazing acid Drop a tab youre in for five or six hours of the most unbelievable head games Nobody ever had a bad experience with the stuff It was all groove know what I mean I suppose I can guess Jack says You could even do your job behind it For sure you could drive man Get on your hog go anywhere you could think of Doing anything normal was a piece of cake You werent fucked up you were operating way beyond your max Timothy Leary wasnt all wrong Doc says God that was great stuff Mouse says We did it until there was no more to do and then the whole thing was over The whole acid thing If you couldnt get that stuff there was no point in taking anything else I never knew where it came from You dont want to know where it came from says Beezer Trust me So you were doing this acid when you saw Black House Jack says Sure Thats why I saw the lights Very slowly Beezer asks Where is it Mouse I dont exactly know But hold on Beezer let me talk That was the summer I was tight with Little Nancy Hale remember Sure Beezer says That was a damn shame He glances at Jack Little Nancy died right after that summer Tore me apart Mouse says It was like she turned allergic to air and sunlight all of a sudden Sick all the time Rashes all over her body She couldnt stand being outside because the light hurt her eyes Doc couldnt figure out what was wrong with her so we took her to the big hospital in La Riviere but they couldnt find what was wrong either We talked to a couple of guys at Mayo but they werent any help She died hard man Broke your heart to see it happen Broke mine for sure He falls silent for a long moment during which he stares down at his gut and his knees and no one else says a word All right Mouse finally says raising his head Heres what I remember On this Saturday Little Nancy and I were tripping on the Ultimate just riding around to some places we liked We went to the riverfront park in La Riviere drove over to Dog Island and Lookout Point We came back this direction and went up on the bluff  beautiful man After that we didnt feel like going home so we just wheeled around Little Nancy noticed this NO TRESPASSING sign I must have passed about a thousand times before without seeing it He looks at Jack Sawyer I cant say for certain but I think it was on  Jack nods If we hadnt been on the Ultimate I dont think she ever would have seen that sign either Oh man its all coming back to me Whats that she says and I swear I had to look two or three times before I saw that sign  it was all beatup and bent with a couple rusty bullet holes in it Sort of leaning back into the trees Somebody wants to keep us off that road Little Nancy says What are they hiding up there anyhow Something like that What road I ask and then I see it Its hardly even what you could call a road About wide enough for a car to fit in if you have a compact Thick trees on both sides Hell I didnt think anything interesting was hidden up there unless it was an old shack Besides that I didnt like the way it looked He glances at Beezer What do you mean you didnt like the way it looked Beezer asks Ive seen you go into places you damn well knew were no good Or are you getting mystical on me Mouse Call it what you fucking want Im telling you how it was It was like that sign was saying KEEP OUT IF YOU KNOW WHATS GOOD FOR YOU Gave me a bad feeling On account of it was a bad place Sonny interrupts Ive seen some bad places They dont want you there and they let you know Beezer shoots him a measured look and says I dont care how evil this bad place is if its where the Fisherman lives Im going there And Im going with you says Mouse but just listen I wanted to bag it and get some fried chicken or something which combined with the Ultimate would have been like eating the food of Paradise or whatever Coleridge said but Little Nancy wanted to go in because she had the same feeling I did She was a game broad man Ornery too So I turned in and Little Nancys hanging on in back of me and shes saying Dont be a pussy Mouse lets haul ass so I gun it a little bit and everything feels all weird and shit but all I can sees this track curving away into the trees and the shit I know isnt there Like what asks Sonny in what sounds like the spirit of scientific inquiry These dark shapes coming up to the edge of the road and looking out through the trees A couple of them ran toward me but I rolled right through them like smoke I dont know maybe they were smoke Fuck that it was the acid Beezer says Maybe but it didnt feel that way Besides the Ultimate never turned on you remember It wasnt about darkness Anyhow right before the shit hit the fan all of a sudden I was thinking about Kiz Martin I can remember that all right It was like I could practically see her right in front of me  the way she looked when they loaded her in the ambulance Kiz Martin Beezer says Mouse turns to Jack Kiz was a girl I went out with when we were all at the university She used to beg us to let her ride with us and one day the Kaiser said okay she could borrow his bike Kiz was having a ball man shes diggin it And then she rolls over some damn little twig I think it was   Bigger than a twig Doc says Little branch Maybe two inches in diameter Which is just enough to test your balance especially if youre not used to hogs Mouse says She rolls over this little branch and the bike flops over and Kiz flies off and hits the road My heart damn near stopped man I knew she was gone the second I came up close enough to see the angle of her head says Doc There wasnt even any point in trying CPR We covered her with our jackets and I rode off to call an ambulance Ten minutes later they were loading her in One of the guys recognized me from my stint in the ER or they might have given us some trouble I wondered if you were really a doctor Jack says Completed my residency in surgery at UI walked away from the whole deal right there Doc smiles at him Hanging around with these guys getting into beer brewing sounded like more fun than spending all day cutting people up Mouse Beezer says Yeah I was just getting to the curve in the little road and it was like Kiz was standing right in front of me it was so vivid Her eyes closed and her head hanging like a leaf about to fall Oh man I said to myself this is not what I want to see at this particular moment I could feel it all over again  the way I felt when Kiz hit the road Sick dread Thats the word for it sick dread And we come around the curve and I hear this dog growling somewhere off in the woods Not just growling growling Like twenty big dogs are out there and theyre all mad as hell My head starts feeling like it wants to explode And I look up ahead of me to see if a pack of wolves or something is running toward us and it takes me a while to realize that the weird shadowy stuff I see up ahead is a house A black house Little Nancy is hitting me on the back and rapping my head screaming at me to stop Believe me I can get with the program because the last thing I want to do is get any closer to that place I stop the bike and Little Nancy jumps off and pukes on the side of the road She holds her head and she pukes some more Im feeling like my legs turned to rubber like something heavy is pressing on my chest That thing whatever it is is still going nuts in the woods and its getting closer I take another look up at the end of the road and that ugly damn house is stretching back into the woods like its crawling into them only its standing still It gets bigger the more you look at it Then I see the sparkly lights floating around it and they look dangerous  Stay away theyre telling me get out of here Mouse Theres another NO TRESPASSING sign leaning against the porch and that sign man    that sign kind of flashed like it was saying THIS TIME I MEAN IT BUDDY My head is splitting in half but I get Little Nancy on the bike and she sags against me like pure dead weight except shes hanging on and I kick the hog on and spin around and take off When we get back to my place she goes to bed and stays there for three days To me it seemed like I could hardly remember what happened The whole thing went kind of dark In my mind I hardly had time to think about it anyhow because Little Nancy got sick and I had to take care of her whenever I wasnt at work Doc gave her some stuff to get her temperature down and she got better so we could drink beer and smoke shit and ride around like before but she was never really the same End of August she started getting bad again and I had to put her in the hospital Second week of September hard as she was fighting Little Nancy passed away How big was Little Nancy Jack asks picturing a woman roughly the size of Mouse Little Nancy Hale was about the size and shape of Tansy Freneau Mouse says looking surprised by the question If she stood on my hand I could lift her up with one arm And you never talked about this with anyone Jack says How could I talk about it Mouse asks First I was crazy with worry about Little Nancy and then it went clean out of my head Weird shit will do that to you man Instead of sticking in your head it erases itself I know exactly what you mean Jack says I guess I do too says Beezer but Id say that the Ultimate kicked the shit out of your reality there for a while You did see the place though  Black House Damn straight says Mouse Beezer focuses on Jack And you say the Fisherman this creep Burnside built it Jack nods So maybe hes living there and he rigged up a bunch of gadgets to scare people away Could be Then I think were gonna let Mouse take us over on Highway  and see if he can find that little road he was talking about Are you coming with us I cant Jack says I have to see someone in Arden first someone who I think can also help us She has another piece of the puzzle but I cant explain it to you until I see her This woman knows something Oh yes Jack says She knows something All right Beezer says and stands up from his stool Your choice Well have to talk to you afterward Beezer I want to be with you when you go inside Black House Whatever we have to do in there whatever we see    Jack pauses trying to find the right words Beezer is rocking on his heels practically jumping out of his skin in his eagerness to hunt down the Fishermans lair Youre going to want me there Theres more to this business than you can imagine Beezer Youre going to know what Im talking about in a little while and youll be able to stand up to it  I think all of you will  but if I tried to describe it now you wouldnt believe me When the time comes youll need me to see you through if we get through Youll be glad I was there Were at a dangerous point here and none of us wants to mess it up What makes you think Ill mess it up Beezer asks with deceptive mildness Anyone would mess it up if they didnt have the last piece of the puzzle Go out there See if Mouse can find the house he saw two years ago Check it out Dont go in  to do that you need me After you check it out come back here and Ill see you as soon as I can I should be back before twothirty three at the latest Where are you going in Arden Maybe Ill want to call you French County Lutheran Hospital Ward D If you cant get me leave a message with a Dr Spiegleman Ward D huh Beezer says Okay I guess everybodys crazy today And I guess I can be satisfied with only a look at this house as long as I know that sometime this afternoon I can count on you to explain all these pieces Im too stupid to understand Itll be soon Beezer Were closing in And the last thing Id call you is stupid I guess you must have been one hell of a cop Beezer says Even though I think half the stuff you say is crap I cant help but believe it He turns around and brings his fists down on the bar Stinky Cheese Its safe now Drag your pale ass out of the kitchen JACK FOLLOWS THE Thunder Five out of the parking lot and for the moment we will let him go alone on his northward way on Highway  toward Judy Marshalls lookout and Judy Marshalls locked ward Like Jack the bikers are headed toward the unknown but their unknown lies westward on Highway  into the land of the steadily accumulating past and we want to know what they will find there These men do not appear to be nervous they still project the massive confidence with which they burst into the Sand Bar In truth they never really display nervousness for situations that would make other people worried or anxious generally make them get physical Fear affects them differently than it does other people too in the rare moments when they have experienced fear theyve tended on the whole to enjoy it In their eyes fear represents a Godgiven opportunity for focusing their collective concentration Due to their remarkable solidarity that concentration is formidable For those of us who are not members of a biker gang or the Marine Corps solidarity means little more than the compassionate impulse that leads us to comfort a bereft friend for Beezer and his merry band solidarity is the assurance that someones always got your back They are on each others hands and they know it For the Thunder Five safety really is in numbers Yet the encounter toward which they are flying has no precedents or analogues in their experience Black House is something new and its newness  the sheer strangeness of Mouses story  sinks tendrils down into their guts one and all Eight miles west of Centralia where the flatland around Potsies thirtyyearold development yields to the long stretch of woods that runs all the way to Maxtons Mouse and Beezer ride side by side in front of the others Beezer occasionally looks to his friend asking a wordless question The third time that Mouse shakes his head he follows the gesture with a backward wave of his hand that says Stop bugging me Ill tell you when were there Beezer drops back Sonny Kaiser Bill and Doc automatically assume Beezer is giving them a signal and they string out in a single line At the head of the column Mouse keeps taking his eyes off the highway to inspect the righthand side of the road The little road is hard to see Mouse knows and by now it will be more overgrown than it was two years ago He is trying to spot the white of the battered NO TRESPASSING sign It too may be partially hidden by new growth He slows down to thirtyfive The four men behind him match his change in pace with the smoothness of long practice Alone of the Thunder Five Mouse has already seen their destination and in the deepest places of his soul he can scarcely believe that he is going there again At first the ease and rapidity with which his memories had flown out of their dark vault had pleased him now instead of feeling that he has effortlessly reclaimed a lost part of his life he has the sense of being at the mercy of that lost afternoon A grave danger then  and he does not doubt that some great and dangerous force had brushed him with a warning hand  is an increased danger now Memory has returned a miserable conclusion he thrust away long ago that the hideous structure Jack Sawyer called Black House had killed Little Nancy Hale as surely as if its rafters had fallen in on her Moral more than physical Black Houses ugliness exhaled toxic fumes Little Nancy had been killed by the invisible poisons carried on the warning hand now Mouse had to look at that knowledge without blinking He can feel her hands on his shoulders and their thin bones are covered with rotting flesh If Id been five foot three and weighed one hundred and five pounds instead of being sixtwo and two hundred and ninety by now Id be rotting too he thinks Mouse may look for the narrow road and the sign beside it with the eyes of a fighter pilot but someone else has to see them because he never will His unconscious has taken a vote and the decision was unanimous Each of the other men Sonny Doc the Kaiser and even Beezer have also connected Little Nancys death with Black House and the same speculations about comparative size and weight have passed through their minds However Sonny Cantinaro Doc Amberson Kaiser Bill Strassner and especially Beezer St Pierre assume that whatever poison surrounded Black House had been concocted in a laboratory by human beings who knew what they were doing These four men derive the old primitive reassurance from one anothers company that they have enjoyed since college if anything makes them feel a touch uneasy it is that Mouse Baumann not Beezer leads their column Even though Beezer let Mouse wave him back Mouses position contains a hint of insurrection of mutiny the universe has been subtly disordered Twenty yards from the back end of the Maxton property Sonny decides to put an end to this farce guns his Softail roars past his friends and moves up parallel to Mouse Mouse glances at him with a trace of worry and Sonny motions to the side of the road When they have all pulled over Mouse says Whats your problem Sonny You are Sonny says Either you missed the turnoff or your whole storys all fucked up I said I wasnt sure where it is He notices with nearly immeasurable relief that Little Nancys dead hands no longer grip his shoulders Of course not You were ripped on acid Good acid Well theres no road up ahead I know that much Its just trees all the way to the old fucks home Mouse ponders the stretch of road ahead as if the road just might be up there after all although he knows it is not Shit Mouse were practically in town I can see Queen Street from here Yeah Mouse says Okay If he can get to Queen Street he thinks those hands will never fasten on him again Beezer walks his Electra Glide up to them and says Okay what Mouse You agree its farther back or is the road somewhere else Frowning Mouse turns his head to look back down the highway Goddamn I think its along here somewhere unless I got totally turned around that day Gee how could that have happened says Sonny I looked at every inch of ground we passed and I sure as hell didnt see a road Did you Beezer How about a NO TRESPASSING sign you happen to see one of those You dont get it Mouse says This shit doesnt want to be seen Maybe you shoulda gone to Ward D with Sawyer Sonny says People in there appreciate visionaries Can it Sonny Beezer says I was there before and you werent Mouse says Which one of us knows what hes talking about Ive heard enough out of both of you guys Beezer says Do you still think its along here somewhere Mouse As far as I can recollect yeah Then we missed it Well go back and check again and if we dont find it well look somewhere else If its not here its between two of the valleys along  or in the woods on the hill leading up to the lookout We have plenty of time What makes you so sure Sonny asks Mild anxiety about what they might come across is making him belligerent He would just as soon go back to the Sand Bar and down a pitcher of Kingsland while messing with Stinkys head as waste his time goofing along the highways Beezer looks at him and his eyes crackle You know anywhere else theres enough trees to call it a woods Sonny backs down immediately Beezer is never going to give up and go back to the Sand Bar Beezer is in this for keeps Most of that has to do with Amy but some of it relates to Jack Sawyer Sawyer impressed the shit out of Beezer the other night thats what happened and now Beezer thinks everything the guy says is golden To Sonny this makes no sense at all but Beezers the one who calls the shots so for now Sonny guesses they will all run around like junior Gmen for a while If this adoptacop program goes on for more than a couple of days Sonny plans to have a little chat with Mouse and the Kaiser Doc will always side with Beezer no matter what but the other two are capable of listening to reason All right then Beezer says Scratch from here to Queen Street We know theres no fuckin road along that stretch Well go back the way we came give it one more shot Single file the whole way Mouse youre point man again Mouse nods and prepares himself to feel those hands on his shoulders again Gunning his Fat Boy he rolls forward and takes his place at the head of the line Beezer moves in behind him and Sonny follows Beezer with Doc and the Kaiser in the last two slots Five pairs of eyes Sonny thinks If we dont see it this time we never will And we wont because that damned road is halfway across the state When Mouse and his old lady got buzzed on the Ultimate they could go for hundreds of miles and think theyd taken a spin around the block Everybody scans the opposite side of the road and the edge of the woods Five pairs of eyes as Sonny puts it register an unbroken line of oaks and pine trees Mouse has set a pace somewhere between a fast walk and a medium jog and the trees crawl by At this speed they can notice the moss blistering the trunks of the oaks and the bright smears of sunlight on the forests floor which is brownish gray and resembles a layer of rumpled felt A hidden world of upright trees shafts of light and deadfalls extends backward from the first sentinel row Within that world paths that are not paths wind mazelike between the thick trunks and lead to mysterious clearings Sonny becomes suddenly aware of a tribe of squirrels doing squirrel gymnastics in the map of branches that lace into an intermittent canopy And with the squirrels an aviary of birds pops into view All of this reminds him of the deep Pennsylvania woods he had explored as a boy before his parents sold their house and moved to Illinois Those woods had contained a rapture he had found nowhere else Sonnys conviction that Mouse got things wrong and they are looking in the wrong place takes on greater inner density Earlier Sonny had spoken about bad places of which he has seen at least one he was absolutely certain about In Sonnys experience bad places the ones that let you know you were not welcome tended to be on or near borders During the summer after his high school graduation he and his two best buddies all of them motorcycle freaks had taken their bikes to Rice Lake Wisconsin where he had two cousins cute enough to show off to his friends Sal and Harry were thrilled with the girls and the girls thought the bikers were sexy and exotic After a couple of days spent as a literal fifth wheel or fifth and sixth wheel depending on what you are counting Sonny proposed extending their trip by a week and in the interest of expanding their educations ballin the jack down to Chicago and spending the rest of their money on beer and hookers until they had to go home Sal and Harry loved the whole idea and on their third evening in Rice Lake they packed their rolls on their bikes and roared south making as much noise as possible By  they had managed to get completely lost It might have been the beer it might have been inattention but for one reason or another they had wandered off the highway and in the deep black of a rural night found themselves on the edge of an almost nonexistent town named Harko Harko could not be found on their gasstation road map but it had to be close to the Illinois border on either one side or the other Harko seemed to consist of an abandoned motel a collapsing general store and an empty grain mill When the boys reached the mill Sal and Harry groused about being exhausted and hungry and wanted to turn back to spend the night in the motel Sonny who was no less worn out rode back with them the second they rolled into the dark forecourt of the motel he had a bad feeling about the place The air seemed heavier the darkness darker than they should have been To Sonny it seemed that malign invisible presences haunted the place He could all but make them out as they flitted between the cabins Sal and Harry jeered at his reservations he was a coward a fairy a girl They broke down a door and unrolled their sleeping bags in a bare dusty rectangular room He carried his across the street and slept in a field Dawn awakened him and his face was wet with dew He jumped up pissed into the high grass and checked for the motorcycles on the other side of the road There they were all three of them listing over their stands outside a broken door The dead neon sign at the entrance of the forecourt read HONEYMOONERS BOWER He walked across the narrow road and swept a hand over the moisture shining black on the seats of the motorcycles A funny sound came from the room where his friends were sleeping Already tasting dread Sonny pushed open the broken door If he had not initially refused to make sense of what was before him what he saw in the room would have made him pass out His face streaked with blood and tears Sal Turso was sitting on the floor Harry Reillys severed head rested in his lap and an ocean of blood soaked the floor and daubed the walls Harrys body lay loose and disjointed on top of his bloodsoaked sleeping bag The body was naked Sal wore only a bloodred Tshirt Sal raised both his hands  the one holding his prize longbladed knife and the one holding only a palmful of blood  and lifted his contorted face to Sonnys frozen gaze I dont know what happened His voice was high and screechy not his I dont remember doing this how could I have done this Help me Sonny I dont know what happened Unable to speak Sonny had backed out and flown away on his cycle Hed had no clear idea of where he was going except that it was out of Harko Two miles down the road he came to a little town a real one with people in it and someone finally took him to the sheriffs office Harko there was a bad place In a way both of his high school friends had died there because Sal Turso hanged himself six months after being committed to a state penitentiary for life on a seconddegree murder charge In Harko you saw no redwinged blackbirds or woodpeckers Even sparrows steered clear of Harko This little stretch of  Nothing but a nice comfortable woodland Let me tell you Senator Sonny Cantinaro has seen Harko and this aint no Harko This dont even come close It might as well be in another world What meets Sonnys appraising eye and increasingly impatient spirit is about a mile and a quarter of beautiful wooded landscape You could call it a miniforest He thinks it would be cool to come out here by himself one day tuck the Harley out of sight and just walk around through the great oaks and pines that big pad of felt beneath his feet digging the birds and the crazy squirrels Sonny gazes at and through the sentinel trees on the far side of the road enjoying his anticipation of the pleasure to come and a flash of white jumps out at him from the darkness beside a huge oak tree Caught up in the vision of walking alone under that green canopy he almost dismisses it as a trick of the light a brief illusion Then he remembers what he is supposed to be looking for and he slows down and leans sideways and sees emerging from the tangle of underbrush at the base of the oak a rusty bullet hole and a large black letter N Sonny swerves across the road and the N expands into NO He doesnt believe it but there it is Mouses goddamn sign He rolls ahead another foot and the entire phrase comes into view Sonny puts the bike in neutral and plants one foot on the ground The darkness next to the oak stretches like a web to the next tree at the side of the road which is also an oak though not as huge Behind him Doc and the Kaiser cross the road and come to a halt He ignores them and looks at Beezer and Mouse who are already some thirty feet up the road intently scanning the trees Hey he shouts Beezer and Mouse do not hear him Hey Stop You got it Doc calls out Go up to those assholes and bring them back Sonny says Its here Doc asks peering into the trees What you think I found a body Of course its here Doc speeds up stops just behind Sonny and stares at the woods Doc you see it Kaiser Bill shouts and he speeds up too Nope Doc says You cant see it from there Sonny tells him Will you please get your ass in gear and tell Beezer to come back here Why dont you do it instead Doc says Because if I leave this spot I might not ever be able to fucking find it again Sonny says Mouse and Beezer now about sixty feet up the road continue blithely on their way Well I still dont see it Doc says Sonny sighs Come up alongside me Doc walks his Fat Boy to a point parallel with Sonnys bike then moves a couple of inches ahead There Sonny says pointing at the sign Doc squints and leans over putting his head above Sonnys handlebars Where Oh I see it now Its all beat to hell The top half of the sign curls over and shades the bottom half Some antisocial lad has happened along and creased the sign with his baseball bat His older brothers more advanced in the ways of crime had tried to kill it with their  rifles and he was just delivering the coup de grace Wheres the road supposed to be Doc asks Sonny who is a little troubled about this point indicates the flat sheet of darkness to the right of the sign and extending to the next smaller oak tree As he looks at it the darkness loses its twodimensionality and deepens backward like a cave or a black hole softly punched through the air The cave the black hole melts and widens into the earthen road about five and a half feet wide that it must have been all along That sure as hell is it says Kaiser Bill I dont know how all of us could have missed it the first time Sonny and Doc glance at each other realizing that the Kaiser came along too late to watch the road seem to materialize out of a black wall with the thickness of a sheet of paper Its kind of tricky Sonny says Your eyes have to adjust Doc says Okay says Kaiser Bill but if you two want to argue about who tells Mouse and the Beeze let me put you out of your misery He jams his bike into gear and tears off like a World War I messenger with a hot dispatch from the front By now a long way up the road Mouse and Beezer come to a halt and look back having apparently heard the sound of his bike I guess thats it Sonny says with an uneasy glance at Doc Our eyes had to adjust Couldnt be anything else Less convinced than they would like to be both men let it drop in favor of watching Kaiser Bill conversing with Beezer and Mouse The Kaiser points at Sonny and Doc Beezer points Then Mouse points at them and the Kaiser points again It looks like a discussion in an extremely unevolved version of sign language When everybody has gotten the point Kaiser Bill spins his bike around and comes roaring back down the road with Beezer and Mouse on his tail There is always that feeling of disorder of misrule when Beezer is not in the lead The Kaiser stops on the side of the narrow road Beezer and Mouse halt beside him and Mouse winds up stationed directly in front of the opening in the woods Shouldnt have been that hard to see Beezer says But there she is anyhow I was beginning to have my doubts Mousie Uhhuh says Mouse His customary manner that of an intellectual roughneck with a playful take on the world has lost all of its buoyancy Beneath his bikers fairweather sunburn his skin looks pale and curdlike I want to tell you guys the truth Beezer says If Sawyer is right about this place the creepy fuck who built it could have set up booby traps and all sorts of surprises It was a long time ago but if he really is the Fisherman he has more reason than ever to keep people away from his crib So we gotta watch our backs The best way to do that is to go in strong and go in ready Put your weapons where you can reach them in a hurry all right Beezer opens one of his saddlebags and draws out a Colt mm pistol with ivory grips and a bluesteel barrel He chambers a round and unlocks the safety Under his gaze Sonny pulls his massive  Magnum from his bag Doc a Colt identical to Beezers and Kaiser Bill an old SW  Special he has owned since the late seventies They shove the weapons which until this moment have seen use only on firing ranges into the pockets of their leather jackets Mouse who does not own a gun pats the various knives he has secreted in the small of his back in the hip and front pockets of his jeans and sheathed within both of his boots Okay Beezer says Anybody in there is going to hear us coming no matter what we do and maybe already has heard us so theres no point in being sneaky about this I want a fast aggressive entrance  just what you guys are good at We can use speed to our advantage Depending on what happens we get as close to the house as possible What if nothing happens asks the Kaiser Like if we roll on in there and just keep going until we get to the house I mean I dont see any particular reason to be spooked here Okay something bad happened to Mouse but    you know Doesnt mean its going to happen all over again Then we enjoy the ride Beezer says Dont you want to take a look inside the Kaiser asks He might have kids in there He might be in there Beezer tells him If he is no matter what I said to Sawyer were bringing him out Alive would be better than dead but I wouldnt mind putting him in a serious state of bad health He gets a rumble of approval Mouse does not contribute to this wordless but otherwise universal agreement he lowers his head and tightens his hands on the grips of his bike Because Mouse has been here before he goes in on point Doc and Ill be right behind him with Sonny and the Kaiser covering our asses Beezer glances at them and says Stay about six eight feet back all right Dont put Mouse on point you have to go in first speaks in Sonnys mind but he says All right Beeze Line up Beezer says They move their bikes into the positions Beezer has specified Anyone driving fast along Highway  would have to hit his brakes to avoid running into at least two beefy men on motorcycles but the road stays empty Everyone including Mouse guns his engine and prepares to move Sonny slaps his fist against the Kaisers and looks back at that dark tunnel into the woods A big crow flaps onto a lowhanging branch cocks its head and seems to fix Sonnys eyes with its own The crow must be looking at all of them Sonny knows but he cannot shake the illusion that the crow is staring directly at him and that its black insatiable eyes are dancing with malice The uncomfortable feeling that the crow is amused by the sight of him bent over his bike makes Sonny think of his Magnum Turn you into a mess of bloody feathers baby Without unfolding its wings the crow hops backward and disappears into the oak leaves GO Beezer shouts The moment Mouse charges in Little Nancys rotting hands clamp down on his shoulders Her thin bones press down on the leather hard enough to leave bruises on his skin Although he knows this is impossible  you cannot get rid of what does not exist  the sudden flare of pain causes him to try to shake her off He twitches his shoulders and wiggles the handlebars and the bike wobbles As the bike dips Little Nancy digs in harder When Mouse rights himself she pulls herself forward wraps her bony arms around his chest and flattens her body against his back Her skull grinds against the nape of his neck her teeth bite down on his skin It is too much Mouse had known she would reappear but not that she would put him in a vise And despite his speed he has the feeling that he is traveling through a substance heavier and more viscous than air a kind of syrup that slows him down holds him back Both he and the bike seem unnaturally dense as if gravity exerts a stronger pull on the little road than anywhere else His head pounds and already he can hear that dog growling in the woods off to his right He could take all of that he supposes if it were not for what stopped him the last time he drove up this path a dead woman Then she was Kiz Martin now the dead woman is Little Nancy and she is riding him like a dervish slapping his head punching him in the side battering his ears He feels her teeth leave his neck and sink into the left shoulder of his jacket One of her arms whips in front of him and he enters a deeper level of shock and horror when he realizes that this arm is visible Rags of skin flutter over long bones he glimpses white maggots wriggling into the few remaining knots of flesh A hand that feels both spongelike and bony flaps onto his cheek and crawls up his face Mouse cannot keep it together anymore his mind fills with white panic and he loses control of the bike When he heads into the curve that leads to Black House the wheels are already tilting dangerously and Mouses sideways jerk of revulsion pushes them over beyond the possibility of correction As the bike topples he hears the dog snarling from only a few yards away The Harley smashes down on his left leg then skids ahead and he and his ghastly passenger slide after it When Mouse sees Black House looming from its dark bower amid the trees a rotting hand flattens over his eyes His scream is a bright thin thread of sound against the fury of the dog A few seconds after going in Beezer feels the air thicken and congeal around him Its some trick he tells himself an illusion produced by the Fishermans mindfuck toxins Trusting that the others will not be suckered by this illusion he raises his head and looks over Mouses broad back and cornrowed head to see the road curve to the left about fifty feet ahead The thick air seems to weigh down on his arms and shoulders and he feels the onset of the mother and father of all headaches a dull insistent pain that begins as a sharp twinge behind his eyes and moves thudding deeper into his brain Beezer gives Doc a half second of attention and from what he sees Doc is taking care of business A glance at the speedometer tells him that he is traveling at thirtyfive miles per hour and gathering steam so they should be doing sixty by the time they come into the curve Off to his left a dog growls Beezer hauls his pistol out of his pocket and listens to the growling keep pace with them as they speed toward the curve The band of pain in his head widens and intensifies it seems to push at his eyes from the inside making them bulge in their sockets The big dog  it has to be a dog what else could it be  is getting closer and the fury of its noises makes Beezer see a giant tossing head with blazing red eyes and ropes of slather whipping from a gaping mouth filled with sharks teeth Two separate things destroy his concentration the first is that he sees Mouse slamming himself back and forth on his bike as he goes into the curve as if he is trying to scratch his back on the thickening air the second is that the pressure behind his eyes triples in force and immediately after he sees Mouse going into what is surely a fall the blood vessels in his eyes explode From deep red his vision shifts rapidly to absolute black An ugly voice starts up in his head saying Amy zadt in my lap an huggedt mee I made opp my mindt to eed hurr How she dud dud dud kick an scrutch I chokked hurr do deff  No Beezer shouts and the voice that is pushing at his eyes drops into a rasping chuckle For less than a second he gets a vision of a tall shadowy creature and a single eye a flash of teeth beneath a hat or a hood   and the world abruptly revolves around him and he ends up flat on his back with the bike weighing on his chest Everything he sees is stained a dark seething red Mouse is screaming and when Beezer turns his head in the direction of the screams he sees a red Mouse lying on a red road with a huge red dog barreling toward him Beezer cannot find his pistol it went sailing into the woods Shouts screams and the roar of motorcycles fill his ears He scrambles out from under the bike yelling he knows not what A red Doc flashes by on his red bike and almost knocks him down again He hears a gunshot then another Doc sees Beezer glance at him and tries not to show how sick he feels Dishwater boils in his stomach and his guts are writhing It feels like he is going about five miles an hour the air is so thick and rancid For some reason his head weighs thirty or forty pounds damnedest thing it would almost be interesting if he could stop the disaster happening inside him The air seems to concentrate itself to solidify and then boom his head turns into a superheavyweight bowling ball that wants to drop onto his chest A giant growling sound comes from out of the woods beside him and Doc almost yields to the impulse to puke He is dimly aware that Beezer is pulling out his gun and he supposes he should do the same but part of his problem is that the memory of a child named Daisy Temperly has moved into his mind and the memory of Daisy Temperly paralyzes his will As a resident in surgery at the university hospital in Urbana Doc had performed under supervision nearly a hundred operations of every sort and assisted at as many Until Daisy Temperly was wheeled into the OR all of them had gone well Complicated but not especially difficult or lifethreatening her case involved bone grafts and other repair work Daisy was being put back together again after a serious auto accident and she had already endured two previous surgeries Two hours after the start of the procedure the head of the department Docs supervisor was called away for an emergency operation and Doc was left in charge Partly because he had been sleepdeprived for fortyeight hours partly because in his exhaustion he had pictured himself cruising along the highway with Beezer Mouse and his other new friends he made a mistake  not during the operation but after it While writing a prescription for medication he miscalculated the dosage and two hours later Daisy Temperly was dead There were things he could have done to rescue his career but he did none of them He was allowed to finish his residency and then he left medicine for good Talking to Jack Sawyer he had vastly simplified his motives The uproar in the middle of his body can no longer be contained Doc turns his head and vomits as he races forward It is not the first time he has puked while riding but it is the messiest and the most painful The weight of his bowlingball head means that he cannot extend his neck so vomit spatters against his right shoulder and right arm and what comes leaping out of him feels alive and equipped with teeth and claws He is not surprised to see blood mixed with the vomit erupting from his mouth His stomach doubles in on itself with pain Without meaning to Doc has slowed down and when he accelerates and faces forward again he sees Mouse topple over sideways and skid behind his bike into the curve up ahead His ears report a rushing sound like that of a distant waterfall Dimly Mouse screams equally dimly Beezer shouts No Right after that the Beeze runs headlong into a big rock or some other obstruction because his Electra Glide leaves the ground flips completely over in the compacted air and comes down on top of him It occurs to Doc that this mission is totally FUBAR The whole world has hung a left and now they are in deep shit He does the only sensible thing he yanks his trusty mm out of his pocket and tries to figure out what to shoot first His ears pop and the sounds around him surge into life Mouse is still screeching Doc cannot figure out how he missed hearing the noise of the dog before because even with the roaring of the cycles and Mouses screams that moving growl is the loudest sound in the woods The fucking Hound of the Baskervilles is racing toward them and both Mouse and Beezer are out of commission From the noise it makes the thing must be the size of a bear Doc aims the pistol straight ahead and steers with one hand as he blasts by Beezer who is wriggling out from beneath his bike That enormous sound  Doc imagines a bearsized dog widening its chops around Mouses head and instantly erases the image Things are happening too fast and if he doesnt pay attention those jaws could close on him He has just time enough to think Thats no ordinary dog not even a huge one   when something enormous and black comes charging out of the woods to his right and cuts on a diagonal toward Mouse Doc pulls the trigger and at the sound of the pistol the animal whirls halfway around and snarls at him All Doc can see clearly are two red eyes and an open red mouth with a long tongue and a lot of sharp canine teeth Everything else is smudgy and indistinct with no more definition than if it were covered in a swirling cape A lightning bolt of pure terror that tastes as clean and sharp as cheap vodka pierces Doc from gullet to testicles and his bike slews its rear end around and comes to a halt  he has stopped it out of sheer reflex Suddenly it feels like deep night Of course he cant see it  how could you see a black dog in the middle of the night The creature whirls around again and streaks toward Mouse It doesnt want to charge me because of the gun and because the other two guys are right behind me Doc thinks His head and arms seem to have gained another forty pounds apiece but he fights against the weight of his muscles and straightens his arms and fires again This time he knows he hits that thing but its only reaction is to shudder offcourse for a moment The big smudge of its head swings toward Doc The growling gets even louder and long silvery streamers of dog drool fly from its open mouth Something that suggests a tail switches back and forth When Doc looks into the open red gash his resolve weakens his arms get heavier and he is scarcely capable of holding his head upright He feels as though he is falling down into that red maw his pistol dangles from his limp hand In a moment suspended throughout eternity the same hand scribbles a postop prescription for Daisy Temperly The creature trots toward Mouse Doc can hear Sonnys voice cursing furiously A loud explosion on his right side seals both of his ears and the world falls perfectly silent Here we are Doc says to himself Darkness at noon For Sonny the darkness strikes at the same time as the searing pain in his head and his stomach A single band of agony rips right down through his body a phenomenon so unparalleled and extreme that he assumes it has also erased the daylight He and Kaiser Bill are eight feet behind Beezer and Doc and about fifteen feet up the narrow dirt road The Kaiser lets go of his handlebars and grips the sides of his head Sonny understands exactly how he feels a fourfoot section of redhot iron pipe has been thrust through the top of his head and pushed down into his guts burning everything it touches Hey man he says in his misery noticing that the air has turned sludgy as though individual atoms of oxygen and carbon dioxide are gummy enough to stick to his skin Then Sonny notices that the Kaisers eyes are swimming up toward the back of his head and he realizes that the man is passing out right next to him Sick as he is he has to do something to protect the Kaiser Sonny reaches out for the other mans bike watching as well as he can the disappearance of the Kaisers irises beneath his upper eyelids Blood explodes out of his nostrils and his body slumps backward on the seat and rolls over the side For a couple of seconds he is dragged along by a boot caught in the handlebars but the boot slips off and the cycle drifts to a halt The redhot iron bar seems to rupture his stomach and Sonny has no choice he lets the other bike fall and utters a groan and bends sideways and vomits out what feels like every meal he has ever eaten When nothing is left inside him his stomach feels better but John Henry has decided to drive giant rail spikes through his skull His arms and legs are made of rubber Sonny focuses on his bike It seems to be standing still He does not understand how he can go forward but he watches a bloodspattered hand gun his bike and manages to stay upright when it takes off Is that my blood he wonders and remembers two long red flags unfurling from the Kaisers nose A noise that had been gathering strength in the background turns into the sound of a  coming in for a landing Sonny thinks that the last thing he wants to do today is get a look at the animal capable of making that sound Mouse was right on the money this is a bad bad place right up there with the charming town of Harko Illinois Sonny wishes to encounter no more Harkos okay One was enough So why is he moving forward instead of turning around and running for the sunny peace of Highway  Why is he pulling that massive gun out of his pocket Its simple He is not about to let that jetairplanedog mess up his homeys no matter how much his head hurts John Henry keeps pounding in those fivedollar spikes while Sonny picks up speed and squints at the road ahead trying to figure out what is going on Someone screams he cannot identify who Through the growling he hears the unmistakable sound of a motorcycle hitting the ground after a flip and his heart shivers Beezer should always be point man he thinks otherwise were asking for punishment A gun goes off with a loud explosion Sonny forces himself to press through the gluey atoms in the air and after another five or six seconds he spots Beezer who is painfully pushing himself upward beside his toppled bike A few feet beyond Beezer Docs bulky figure comes into view sitting astride his bike and aiming his  at something in the road ahead of him Doc fires and red flame bursts from the barrel of his pistol Feeling more beatup and useless than ever before in his life Sonny jumps from his moving bike and runs toward Doc trying to look past him The first thing he sees is a flash of light off Mouses bike which comes into view flat on its side about twenty feet down the road at the top of the curve Then he finds Mouse on his ass and scrambling backward from some animal Sonny can barely make out except for its eyes and teeth Unconscious of the stream of obscenities that pour from his mouth Sonny levels his pistol at the creature and fires just as he runs past Doc Doc just stands there Doc is out for the count The weird animal up on the road closes its jaws on Mouses leg It is going to rip away a hamburgersized chunk of muscle but Sonny hits it with a fucking hollowpoint missile from his Magnum a bit showoffy for target practice but under the circumstances no more than prudent thank you very much Contrary to all expectations and the laws of physics Sonnys amazing wonderbullet does not knock a hole the size of a football in the creatures hide The wonderbullet pushes the animal sideways and distracts it from Mouses leg it does not even knock it down Mouse sends up a howl of pain The dog whips around and glares at Sonny with red eyes the size of baseballs Its mouth opens on jagged white teeth and it snaps the air Ropes of slime shoot out of its jaws The creature lowers its shoulders and steps forward Amazingly its snarling grows in volume and ferocity Sonny is being warned if he does not turn and run he is next on the menu Fuck that Sonny says and fires straight at the animals mouth Its whole head should fly apart in bloody rags but for a second after the Magnum goes off nothing changes Oh shit Sonny thinks The dogthings eyes blaze and its feral wedgeshaped head seems to assemble itself out of the darkness in the air and emerge into view As though an inky robe had been partially twitched aside Sonny can see a thick neck descending to meaty shoulders and strong front legs Maybe the tide is turning here maybe this monster will turn out to be vulnerable after all Sonny braces his right wrist with his left hand aims at the dogthings chest and squeezes off another round The explosion seems to stuff his ears with cotton All the railroad spikes in his head heat up like electric coils and bright pain sings between his temples Dark blood gouts from the creatures brisket At the center of Sonny Cantinaros being a pure primitive triumph bursts into life More of the monster melts into visibility the wide back and a suggestion of its rear legs Of no recognizable breed and four and a half feet high the dogthing is approximately the size of a gigantic wolf When it moves toward him Sonny fires again Like an echo the sound of his gun repeats from somewhere close behind a bullet like a supercharged wasp zings past his chest The creature staggers back limping on an injured leg Its enraged eyes bore into Sonnys He risks glancing over his shoulder and sees Beezer braced in the middle of the narrow road Dont look at me shoot Beezer yells His voice seems to awaken Doc who raises his arm and takes aim Then all three of them are pulling their triggers and the little road sounds like the firing range on a busy day The dogthing hell hound Sonny thinks limps back a step and opens wide its terrible mouth to howl in rage and frustration Before the howl ends the creature gathers its rear legs beneath its body springs across the road and vanishes into the woods Sonny fights off the impulse to collapse under a wave of relief and fatigue Doc swivels his body and keeps firing into the darkness behind the trees until Beezer puts a hand on his arm and orders him to stop The air stinks of cordite and some animal odor that is musky and disgustingly sweet Pale gray smoke shimmers almost white as it filters upward through the darker air Beezers haggard face turns to Sonny and the whites of his eyes are crimson You hit that fucking animal didnt you Through the wads of cotton in his ears Beezers voice sounds small and tinny Shit yes At least twice probably three times And Doc and I hit it once apiece What the hell is that thing  What the hell is right Sonny says Weeping with pain Mouse a third time repeats his cry of Help me and the others hear him at last Moving slowly and pressing their hands over whatever parts of their bodies hurt the most they hobble up the road and kneel in front of Mouse The right leg of his jeans is ripped and soaked with blood and his face is contorted Are you assholes deaf  Pretty near Doc says Tell me you didnt take a bullet in your leg No but it must be some kind of miracle He winces and inhales sharply Air hisses between his teeth Way you guys were shooting Too bad you couldnt draw a bead before it bit my leg I did Sonny says Reason you still got a leg Mouse peers at him then shakes his head What happened to the Kaiser He lost about a liter of blood through his nose and passed out Sonny tells him Mouse sighs as if at the frailty of the human species I believe we might try to get out of this crazy shithole Is your leg all right Beezer asks Its not broken if thats what you mean But its not all right either What Doc asks I cant say Mouse tells him I dont answer medical questions from guys all covered in puke Can you ride Fuck yes Beezer  you ever know me when I couldnt ride Beezer and Sonny each take a side and with excruciating effort lift Mouse to his feet When they release his arms Mouse lumbers sideways a few steps This is not right he says Thats brilliant says Beezer Beeze old buddy you know your eyes are like bright red You look like fuckin Dracula To the extent that hurry is possible they are hurrying Doc wants to get a look at Mouses leg Beezer wants to make sure that Kaiser Bill is still alive and all of them want to get out of this place and back into normal air and sunlight Their heads pound and their muscles ache from strain None of them can be sure that the dogthing is not preparing for another charge As they speak Sonny has been picking up Mouses Fat Boy and rolling it toward its owner Mouse takes the handles and pushes his machine forward wincing as he goes Beezer and Doc rescue their bikes and six feet along Sonny pulls his upright out of a snarl of weeds Beezer realizes that when he was at the curve in the road he failed to look for Black House He remembers Mouse saying This shit doesnt want to be seen and he thinks Mouse got it just about right the Fisherman did not want them there and the Fisherman did not want his house to be seen Everything else was spinning around in his head the way his Electra Glide had spun over after that ugly voice spoke up in his mind Beezer is certain of one thing however Jack Sawyer is not going to hold out on him any longer Then a terrible thought strikes him and he asks Did anything funny  anything really strange  happen to you guys before the dog from hell jumped out of the woods Besides the physical stuff I mean He looks at Doc and Doc blushes Hello Beezer thinks Mouse says Go fuck yourself Im not gonna talk about that Im with Mouse Sonny says I guess the answer is yes Beezer says Kaiser Bill is lying by the side of the road with his eyes closed and the front of his body wet with blood from mouth to waist The air is still gray and sticky their bodies seem to weigh a thousand pounds the bikes to roll on leaden wheels Sonny walks his bike up beside the Kaisers supine body and kicks him not all that gently in the ribs The Kaiser opens his eyes and groans Fuck Sonny he says You kicked me His eyelids flutter and he lifts his head off the ground and notices the blood soaking into his clothing What happened Am I shot You conducted yourself like a hero Sonny says How do you feel Lousy Where was I hit How am I supposed to know Sonny says Come on were getting out of here The others file past Kaiser Bill manages to get to his feet and after another epic struggle hauls his bike upright beside him He pushes it down the track after the others marveling at the pain in his head and the quantity of blood on his body When he comes out through the last of the trees and joins his friends on Highway  the sudden brightness stabs his eyes his body feels light enough to float away and he nearly passes out all over again I dont think I did get shot he says No one pays any attention to the Kaiser Doc is asking Mouse if he wants to go to the hospital No hospital man Hospitals kill people At least let me take a look at your leg Fine look Doc kneels at the side of the road and tugs the cuff of Mouses jeans up to the bottom of his knee He probes with surprisingly delicate fingers and Mouse winces Mouse he says Ive never seen a dog bite like this before Never saw a dog like that before either The Kaiser says What dog Theres something funny about this wound Doc says You need antibiotics and you need them right away Dont you have antibiotics Sure I do Then lets go back to Beezers place and you can stick me full of needles Whatever you say says Doc AROUND THE TIME Mouse and Beezer first fail to see the little road and the NO TRESPASSING sign beside it Jack Sawyer answers the annoying signal of his cell phone hoping that his caller will turn out to be Henry Leyden with information about the voice on the  tape Although an identification would be wonderful he does not expect Henry to ID the voice the FishermanCBurnside is Potsies age and Jack does not suppose the old villain has much of a social life here or in the Territories What Henry can do however is to apply his finely tuned ears to the nuances of Burnsides voice and describe what he hears in it If we did not know that Jacks faith in his friends capacity to hear distinctions and patterns inaudible to other people was justified that faith would seem as irrational as the belief in magic Jack trusts that a refreshed invigorated Henry Leyden will pick up at least one or two crucial details of history or character that will narrow the search Anything that Henry picks up will interest Jack If someone else is calling him he intends to get rid of whoever it is fast The voice that answers his greeting revises his plans Fred Marshall wants to talk to him and Fred is so wound up and incoherent that Jack must ask him to slow down and start over Judys flipping out again Fred says Just    babbling and raving and getting crazy like before trying to rip through the walls  oh God they put her in restraints and she hates that she wants to help Ty its all because of that tape Christ its getting to be too much to handle Jack Mr Sawyer I mean it and I know Im running off at the mouth but Im really worried Dont tell me someone sent her the  tape Jack says No not    what  tape Im talking about the one that was delivered to the hospital today Addressed to Judy Can you believe they let her listen to that thing I want to strangle Dr Spiegleman and that nurse Jane Bond Whats the matter with these people The tape comes in they say oh goody heres a nice tape for you to listen to Mrs Marshall hold on Ill be right back with a cassette player On a mental ward They dont even bother to listen to it first Look whatever youre doing Id be eternally grateful if youd let me pick you up so I could drive you over there You could talk to her Youre the only person who can calm her down You dont have to pick me up because Im already on the way What was on the tape I dont get it Fred Marshall has become considerably more lucid Why are you going there without me After a second of thought Jack tells him an outright lie I thought you would probably be there already Its a pity you werent I would have had the sense to screen that tape before letting her hear it Do you know what was on that thing The Fisherman Jack says How did you know Hes a great communicator Jack says How bad was it You tell me and then well both know Im piecing it together from what I gathered from Judy and what Dr Spiegleman told me later Fred Marshalls voice begins to waver The Fisherman was taunting her Can you believe that He said Your little boy is very lonely Then he said something like Hes been begging and begging to call home and say hello to his mommy Except Judy says he had a weird foreign accent or a speech impediment or something so he wasnt easy to understand right away Then he says Say hello to your mommy Tyler and Tyler    Freds voice breaks and Jack can hear him stifling his agony before he begins again Tyler ah Tyler was apparently too distressed to do much but scream for help A long uncertain inhalation comes over the phone And he cried Jack he cried Unable to contain his feelings any longer Fred weeps openly unguardedly His breath rattles in his throat Jack listens to all the wet undignified helpless noises people make when grief and sorrow cancel every other feeling and his heart moves for Fred Marshall The sobbing relents Sorry Sometimes I think theyll have to put me in restraints Was that the end of the tape He got on again Fred breathes noisily for a moment clearing his head Boasting about what he was going to do Dere vill be morrr murderts and morrr afder dat Choodee we are all goink zu haff sotch fun  Spiegleman quoted this junk to me The children of French Landing will be harvested like wheat Havvuzted like wheed Who talks like that What kind of person is this I wish I knew Jack says Maybe he was putting on an accent to sound even scarier Or to disguise his voice Hed never disguise his voice Jack thinks hes too delighted with himself to hide behind an accent Ill have to get the tape from the hospital and listen to it myself And Ill call you as soon as I have some information Theres one more thing Marshall says I probably made a mistake Wendell Green came over about an hour ago Anything involving Wendell Green is automatically a mistake So what happened It was like he knew all about Tyler and just needed me to confirm it I thought he must have heard from Dale or the state troopers But Dale hasnt made us public yet has he Wendell has a network of little weasels that feed him information If he knows anything thats how he heard about it What did you tell him More or less everything Marshall says Including the tape Oh God Im such a dope But I thought itd be all right  I thought it would all get out anyhow Fred did you tell him anything about me Only that Judy trusts you and that were both grateful for your help And I think I said that you would probably be going in to see her this afternoon Did you mention Tys baseball cap Do you think Im nuts As far as Im concerned that stuff is between you and Judy If I dont get it Im not going to talk about it to Wendell Green At least I got him to promise to stay away from Judy He has a great reputation but I got the feeling he isnt everything hes cracked up to be You said a mouthful Jack says Ill be in touch When Fred Marshall hangs up Jack punches in Henrys number I may be a little late Henry Im on my way to French County Lutheran Judy Marshall got a tape from the Fisherman and if theyll let me have it Ill bring it over Theres something strange going on here  on Judys tape I guess he has some kind of foreign accent Henry tells Jack there is no rush He has not listened to the first tape yet and now will wait until Jack comes over with the second one He might hear something useful if he plays them in sequence At least he could tell Jack if they were made by the same man And dont worry about me Jack In a little while Mrs Morton is coming by to take me over to KDCU George Rathbun butters my bread today baby  six or seven radio ads Even a blind man knows you want to treat your honey your sweetheart your loveydovey your wife your best friend through thick and thin to a mmmmm fine dinner tonight and theres no better place to show your appreciation to the old ball and chain than to take her to Cousin Buddys Rib Crib on South Wabash Street in beautiful downtown La Riviere   The old ball and chain You pay for George Rathbun you get George Rathbun warts and all Laughing Jack tells Henry he will see him later that day and pushes the Ram up to seventy What is Dale going to do give him a speeding ticket He parks in front of the hospital instead of driving around to the parking lot and trots across the concrete with his mind filled with the Territories and Judy Marshall Things are hurtling forward picking up pace and Jack has the sense that everything converges on Judy  no on Judy and him The Fisherman has chosen them more purposefully than he did his first three victims Amy St Pierre Johnny Irkenham and Irma Freneau were simply the right age  any three children would have done  but Tyler was Judy Marshalls son and that set him apart Judy has glimpsed the Territories Jack has traveled through them and the Fisherman lives there the way a cancer cell lives in a healthy organism The Fisherman sent Judy a tape Jack a grisly present At Tansy Freneaus he had seen Judy as his key and the door it opened and where did that door lead but into Judys Faraway Faraway God thats pretty Beautiful in fact Aaah    the word evokes Judy Marshalls face and when he sees that face a door in his mind a door that is his and his alone flies open and for a moment Jack Sawyer stops moving altogether and in shock dread and joyous expectation freezes on the concrete six feet from the hospitals entrance Through the door in his mind pours a stream of disconnected images a stalled Ferris wheel Santa Monica cops milling behind a strip of yellow crimescene tape light reflected off a black mans bald head Yes a bald mans black head that which he really and truly in fact most desperately had not wished to see so take a good look kiddo here it is again There had been a guitar but the guitar was elsewhere the guitar belonged to the magnificent demanding comforting comfortless Speedy Parker God bless him God damn his eyes God love him Speedy who touched its strings and sang Travelin Jack ole Travelin Jack Got a far long way to go Longer way to come back Worlds spin around him worlds within worlds and other worlds alongside them separated by a thin membrane composed of a thousand thousand doors if only you know how to find them A thousand thousand red feathers tiny ones feathers from a robin redbreast hundreds of robin redbreasts flew through one of those doors Speedys Robin as in robinsegg blue thank you Speedy and a song that said Wake up wake up you sleepyhead Or Wake up wake up you DUNDERHEAD Crazily Jack hears George Rathbuns nownotso genial roar Eeeven a BLIIIND MAAAN coulda seen THIS one coming you KNOTHEAD Oh yeah Jack says out loud It is a good thing Head Nurse Jane Bond Warden Bond Agent OO Zero cannot hear him Shes tough but on the other hand shes unfair and if she were to appear beside him now she would probably clap him in irons sedate him and drag him back to her domain Well I know something you dont know old buddy Judy Marshall has a Twinner and the Twinner has been whispering through the wall for a considerable old time now Its no surprise she finally started to shout A redhaired teenager in an ARDEN HS BASEBALL Tshirt shoves open the literal door six feet from Jack and gives him a wary disconcerted look Man grownups are weird the look says arent I glad Im a kid Since he is a high school student and not a mentalhealth professional he does not clap our hero in irons and drag him sedated away to the padded room He simply takes care to steer a wide course around the madman and keeps walking albeit with a touch of selfconscious stiffness in his gait It is all about Twinners of course Rebuking his stupidity Jack raps his knuckles against the side of his head He should have seen it before he should have understood immediately If he has any excuse it is that at first he refused to think about the case despite Speedys efforts to wake him up then became so caught up in concentrating on the Fisherman that until this morning while watching his mother on the Sand Bars big TV he had neglected to consider the monsters Twinner In Judy Marshalls childhood her Twinner had spoken to her through that membrane between the two worlds growing more and more alarmed over the past month the Twinner had all but thrust her arms through the membrane and shaken Judy senseless Because Jack is singlenatured and has no Twinner the corresponding task fell to Speedy Now that everything seems to make sense Jack cannot believe it has taken him so long to see the pattern And this is why he has resented everything that kept him from standing before Judy Marshall Judy is the doorway to her Twinner to Tyler and to the destruction of both the Fisherman and his opposite number in the Territories the builder of the satanic fiery structure a crow named Gorg showed Tansy Freneau Whatever happens on Ward D today it is going to be worldaltering Heart thrumming in anticipation Jack passes from intense sunlight into the vast ocher space of the lobby The same bathrobed patients seem to occupy the many chairs in a distant corner the same doctors discuss a troublesome case or who knows that tricky tenth hole at Arden Country Club the same golden lilies raise their luxuriant attentive heads outside the gift shop This repetition reassures Jack it hastens his step for it surrounds and cushions the unforeseeable events awaiting him on the fifth floor The same bored clerk responds to the proffer of the same password with an identical if not the same green card stamped VISITOR The elevator surprisingly similar to one in the Ritz Htel on the Place Vendme obediently trembles upward past floors two three and four in its dowagerlike progress pausing to admit a gaunt young doctor who summons the memory of Roderick Usher then releases Jack on five where the beautiful ocher light seems a shade or two darker than down there in the huge lobby From the elevator Jack retraces the steps he took with his guide Fred Marshall down the corridor through the two sets of double doors and past the way stations of Gerontology and Ambulatory Ophthalmology and Records Annex getting closer and closer to the unforeseen unforeseeable as the corridors grow narrower and darker and emerges as before into the centuryold room with high skinny windows and a lot of walnutcolored wood And there the spell breaks for the attendant seated behind the polished counter the person currently the guardian of this realm is taller younger and considerably more sullen than his counterpart of the day before When Jack asks to see Mrs Marshall the young person glances in disdain at his VISITOR card and inquires if he should happen to be a relative or  another glance at the card  a medical professional Neither Jack admits but if the young person could trouble himself to inform Nurse Bond that Mr Sawyer wishes to speak to Mrs Marshall Nurse Bond is practically guaranteed to swing open the forbidding metal doors and wave him inward since that is more or less what she did yesterday That is all well and good if it happens to be true the young person allows but Nurse Bond is not going to be doing any door opening and waving in today for today Nurse Bond is off duty Could it be that when Mr Sawyer showed up to see Mrs Marshall yesterday he was accompanied by a family member say Mr Marshall Yes And if Mr Marshall were to be consulted say via the telephone he would urge the young fellow presently discussing the matter in a commendably responsible fashion with Mr Sawyer to admit the gentleman promptly That may be the case the young person grants but hospital regulations require that nonmedical personnel in positions such as the young persons obtain authorization for any outside telephone calls And from whom Jack wishes to know would this authorization be obtained From the acting head nurse Nurse Rack Jack who is growing a little hot as they say under the collar suggests in that case that the young person seek out the excellent Nurse Rack and obtain the required authorization so that things might progress in the manner Mr Marshall the patients husband would wish No the young person sees no reason to pursue such a course the reason being that doing so would represent a pitiful waste of time and effort Mr Sawyer is not a member of Mrs Marshalls family therefore the excellent Nurse Rack would under no circumstances grant the authorization Okay Jack says wishing he could strangle this irritating pipsqueak lets move a step up the administrative ladder shall we Is Dr Spiegleman somewhere on the premises Could be the young person says Howm I supposed to know Dr Spiegleman doesnt tell me everything he does Jack points to the telephone at the end of the counter I dont expect you to know I expect you to find out Get on that phone now The young man slouches down the counter to the telephone rolls his eyes punches two numbered keys and leans against the counter with his back to the room Jack hears him muttering about Spiegleman sigh then say All right transfer me whatever Transferred he mutters something that includes Jacks name Whatever he hears in response causes him to jerk himself upright and sneak a wideeyed look over his shoulder at Jack Yes sir Hes here now yes Ill tell him He replaces the receiver Dr Spieglemanll be here right away The boy  he is no more than twenty  steps back and shoves his hands in his pockets Youre that cop huh What cop Jack says still irritated The one from California that came here and arrested Mr Kinderling Yes thats me Im from French Landing and boy that was some shock To the whole town Nobody would have guessed Mr Kinderling Are you kidding Youd never believe that someone like that would    you know kill people Did you know him Well in a town like French Landing everybody sort of knows everybody but I didnt really know Mr Kinderling except to say hi The one I knew was his wife She used to be my Sunday school teacher at Mount Hebron Lutheran Jack cannot help it he laughs at the incongruity of the murderers wife teaching Sunday school classes The memory of Wanda Kinderling radiating hatred at him during her husbands sentencing stops his laughter but it is too late He sees that he has offended the young man What was she like he asks As a teacher Just a teacher the boy says His voice is uninflected resentful She made us memorize all the books of the Bible He turns away and mutters Some people think he didnt do it What did you say The boy halfturns toward Jack but looks at the brown wall in front of him I said Some people think he didnt do it Mr Kinderling They think he got put in jail because he was a smalltown guy who didnt know anybody out there Thats too bad Jack says Do you want to know the real reason Mr Kinderling went to prison The boy turns the rest of the way and looks at Jack Because he was guilty of murder and he confessed Thats it thats all Two witnesses put him at the scene and two other people saw him on a plane to LA when he told everyone he was flying to Denver After that he said Okay I did it I always wanted to know what it was like to kill a girl and one day I couldnt stand it anymore so I went out and killed two whores His lawyer tried to get him off on an insanity plea but the jury at his hearing found him sane and he went to prison The boy lowers his head and mumbles something I couldnt hear that Jack says Lots of ways to make a guy confess The boy repeats the sentence just loud enough to be heard Then footsteps ring in the hallway and a plump whitecoated man with steelrimmed glasses and a goatee comes striding toward Jack with his hand out The boy has turned away The opportunity to convince the attendant that he did not beat a confession out of Thornberg Kinderling has slipped away The smiling man with the white jacket and the goatee seizes Jacks hand introduces himself as Dr Spiegleman and declares it a pleasure to meet such a famous personage Personage persiflage Jack thinks From one step behind the doctor a man unnoticed until this moment steps fully into view and says Hey Doctor do you know what would be perfect If Mr Famous and I interview the lady together Twice the information in half the time  perfect Jacks stomach turns sour Wendell Green has joined the party After greeting the doctor Jack turns to the other man What are you doing here Wendell You promised Fred Marshall youd stay away from his wife Wendell Green holds up his hands and dances back on the balls of his feet Are we calmer today Lieutenant Sawyer Not inclined to use a sucker punch on the hardworking press are we I have to say Im getting a little tired of being assaulted by the police Dr Spiegleman frowns at him What are you saying Mr Green Yesterday before that cop knocked me out with his flashlight Lieutenant Sawyer here punched me in the stomach for no real reason at all Its a good thing Im a reasonable man or Id have filed lawsuits already But Doctor you know what I dont do things that way I believe everything works out better if we cooperate with each other Halfway through this selfserving speech Jack thinks Oh hell and glances at the young attendant The boys eyes burn with loathing A lost cause now Jack will never persuade the boy that he did not mistreat Kinderling By the time Wendell Green finishes congratulating himself Jack has had a bellyful of his specious smarmy affability Mr Green offered to give me a percentage of his take if I let him sell photographs of Irma Freneaus corpse he tells the doctor What he is asking now is equally unthinkable Mr Marshall urged me to come here and see his wife and he made Mr Green promise not to come Technically that may be true Green says As an experienced journalist I know that people often say things they dont mean and will eventually regret Fred Marshall understands that his wifes story is going to come out sooner or later Does he Especially in the light of the Fishermans latest communication Green says This tape proves that Tyler Marshall is his fourth victim and that miraculously he is still alive How long do you think that can be kept from the public And wouldnt you agree that the boys mother should be able to explain the situation in her own words I refuse to be badgered like this The doctor scowls at Green and gives Jack a look of warning Mr Green I am very close to ordering you out of this hospital I wish to discuss several matters with Lieutenant Sawyer in private If you and the lieutenant can work out some agreement between the two of you that is your affair I am certainly not going to permit a joint interview with my patient I am in no way certain that she should talk to Lieutenant Sawyer either She is calmer than she was this morning but she is still fragile The best way to deal with her problem is to let her express herself Green says You will be quiet now Mr Green Dr Spiegleman says The double chins that fold under his goatee turn a warm pink He glares at Jack What specifically is it that you request Lieutenant Do you have an office in this hospital Doctor I do Ideally Id like to spend about half an hour maybe less talking to Mrs Marshall in a safe quiet environment where our conversation would be completely confidential Your office would probably be perfect There are too many people on the ward and you cant talk without being interrupted or having other patients listen in My office Spiegleman says If youre willing Come with me the doctor says Mr Green you will please stand back next to the counter while Lieutenant Sawyer and I step into the hallway Anything you say Green executes a mocking bow and moves lightly with a suggestion of dance steps to the counter In your absence Im sure this handsome young man and I will find something to talk about Smiling Wendell Green props his elbows on the counter and watches Jack and Dr Spiegleman leave the room Their footsteps click against the floor tiles until it sounds as though they have gone more than halfway down the corridor Then there is silence Still smiling Wendell aboutfaces and finds the attendant openly staring at him I read you all the time the boy says You write real good Wendells smile becomes beatific Handsome and intelligent What a stunning combination Tell me your name Ethan Evans Ethan we do not have much time here so lets make this snappy Do you think responsible members of the press should have access to information the public needs You bet And wouldnt you agree that an informed press is one of our best weapons against monsters like the Fisherman A single vertical wrinkle appears between Ethan Evanss eyebrows Weapons Let me put it this way Isnt it true that the more we know about the Fisherman the better chance we have of stopping him The boy nods and the wrinkle disappears Tell me do you think the doctor is going to let Sawyer use his office Probly yeah Evans says But I dont like the way that Sawyer guy works Hes a police brutality Like when they hit people to make them confess Thats brutality I have another question for you Two questions really Is there a closet in Dr Spieglemans office And is there some way you could take me there without going through that corridor Oh Evanss dim eyes momentarily shine with understanding You want to listen Listen and record Wendell Green taps the pocket that contains his cassette recorder For the good of the public at large God bless em one and all Well maybe yeah the boy says But Dr Spiegleman he    A twentydollar bill has magically appeared folded around the second finger of Wendell Greens right hand Act fast and Dr Spiegleman will never know a thing Right Ethan Ethan Evans snatches the bill from Wendells hand and motions him back behind the counter where he opens a door and says Come on hurry Low lights burn at both ends of the dark corridor Dr Spiegleman says I gather that my patients husband told you about the tape she received this morning He did How did it get here do you know Believe me Lieutenant after I saw the effect that tape had on Mrs Marshall and listened to it myself I tried to learn how it reached my patient All of our mail goes through the hospitals mailroom before being delivered all of it whether to patients medical staff or administrative offices From there a couple of volunteers deliver it to the addressees I gather that the package containing the tape was in the hospital mailroom when a volunteer looked in there this morning Because the package was addressed only with my patients name the volunteer went to our general information office One of the girls brought it up Shouldnt someone have consulted you before giving the tape and a cassette player to Judy Of course Nurse Bond would have done so immediately but she is not on duty today Nurse Rack who is on duty assumed that the address referred to a childhood nickname and thought that one of Mrs Marshalls old friends had sent her some music to cheer her up And there is a cassette player in the nurses station so she put the tape in the player and gave it to Mrs Marshall In the gloom of the corridor the doctors eyes take on a sardonic glint Then as you might imagine all hell broke loose Mrs Marshall reverted to the condition in which she was first hospitalized which takes in a range of alarming behaviors Fortunately I happened to be in the hospital and when I heard what had happened I ordered her sedated and placed in a secure room A secure room Lieutenant has padded walls  Mrs Marshall had reopened the wounds to her fingers and I did not want her to do any more damage to herself Once the sedative had taken effect I went in and talked to her I listened to the tape Perhaps I should have called the police immediately but my first responsibility is to my patient and I called Mr Marshall instead From where From the secure room with my cell phone Mr Marshall of course insisted on speaking to his wife and she wanted to speak to him She became very distraught during their conversation and I had to give her another mild sedative When she calmed down I went out of the room and called Mr Marshall again to tell him more specifically about the contents of the tape Do you want to hear it Not now Doctor thanks But I do want to ask you about one aspect of it Then ask Fred Marshall tried to imitate the way you had reproduced the accent of the man who made the tape Did it sound like any recognizable accent to you German maybe Ive been thinking about that It was sort of like a Germanic pronunciation of English but not really If it sounded like anything recognizable it was English spoken by a Frenchman trying to put on a German accent if that makes sense to you But really Ive never heard anything like it From the start of this conversation Dr Spiegleman has been measuring Jack assessing him according to standards Jack cannot even begin to guess His expression remains as neutral and impersonal as that of a traffic cop Mr Marshall informed me that he intended to call you It seems that you and Mrs Marshall have formed a rather extraordinary bond She respects your skill at what you do which is to be expected but she also seems to trust you Mr Marshall asks that you be allowed to interview his wife and his wife tells me that she must talk to you Then you should have no problems with letting me see her in private for half an hour Dr Spieglemans smile is gone as soon as it appears My patient and her husband have demonstrated their trust in you Lieutenant Sawyer but that is not the issue The issue is whether or not I can trust you Trust me to do what A number of things Primarily to act in the best interest of my patient To refrain from unduly distressing her also from giving her false hopes My patient has developed a number of delusions centered on the existence of another world somehow contiguous to ours She thinks her son is being held captive in this other world I must tell you Lieutenant that both my patient and her husband believe you are familiar with this fantasyworld  that is my patient accepts this belief wholly and her husband accepts it only provisionally on the grounds that it comforts his wife I understand that There is only one thing Jack can tell the doctor now and he says it And what you should understand is that in all of my conversations with the Marshalls I have been acting in my unofficial capacity as a consultant to the French Landing Police Department and its chief Dale Gilbertson Your unofficial capacity Chief Gilbertson has been asking me to advise him on his conduct of the Fisherman investigation and two days ago after the disappearance of Tyler Marshall I finally agreed to do what I could I have no official status whatsoever Im just giving the chief and his officers the benefit of my experience Let me get this straight Lieutenant You have been misleading the Marshalls as to your familiarity with Mrs Marshalls delusional fantasyworld Ill answer you this way Doctor We know from the tape that the Fisherman really is holding Tyler Marshall captive We could say that he is no longer in this world but in the Fishermans Dr Spiegleman raises his eyebrows Do you think this monster inhabits the same universe that we do asks Jack I dont and neither do you The Fisherman lives in a world all his own one that operates according to fantastically detailed rules he has made up or invented over the years With all due respect my experience has made me far more familiar with structures like this than the Marshalls the police and unless you have done a great deal of work with psychopathic criminals even you Im sorry if that sounds arrogant because I dont mean it that way Youre talking about profiling Something like that Years ago I was invited into a special VICAP profiling unit run by the FBI and I learned a lot there but what Im talking about now goes beyond profiling And thats the understatement of the year Jack says to himself Now its in your court Doctor Spiegleman nods slowly The distant glow flashes in the lenses of his glasses I think I see yes He ponders He sighs crosses his arms over his chest and ponders some more Then he raises his eyes to Jacks All right Ill let you see her Alone In my office For thirty minutes I wouldnt want to stand in the way of advanced investigative procedure Thank you Jack says This will be extremely helpful I promise you I have been a psychiatrist too long to believe in promises like that Lieutenant Sawyer but I hope you succeed in rescuing Tyler Marshall Let me take you to my office You can wait there while I get my patient and bring her there by another hallway Its a little quicker Dr Spiegleman marches to the end of the dark corridor and turns left then left again pulls a fat ball of keys from his pocket and opens an unmarked door Jack follows him into a room that looks as though it had been created by combining two small offices into one Half of the room is taken up by a long wooden desk a chair a glasstopped coffee table stacked with journals and filing cabinets the other half is dominated by a couch and the leather recliner placed at its head Georgia OKeeffe posters decorate the walls Behind the desk stands a door Jack assumes opens into a small closet the door directly opposite behind the recliner and at the midpoint between the two halves of the office looks as though it leads into an adjoining room As you see Dr Spiegleman says I use this space as both an office and a supplementary consulting room Most of my patients come in through the waiting room and Ill bring Mrs Marshall in that way Give me two or three minutes Jack thanks him and the doctor hurries out through the door to the waiting room In the little closet Wendell Green slides his cassette recorder from the pocket of his jacket and presses both it and his ear to the door His thumb rests on the RECORD button and his heart is racing Once again western Wisconsins most distinguished journalist is doing his duty for the man in the street Too bad its so blasted dark in that closet but being stuffed into a black hole is not the first sacrifice Wendell has made for his sacred calling besides all he really needs to see is the little red light on his tape recorder Then a surprise although Doctor Spiegleman has left the room here is his voice asking for Lieutenant Sawyer How did that Freudian quack get back in without opening or closing a door and what happened to Judy Marshall Lieutenant Sawyer I must speak to you Pick up the receiver You have a call and it sounds urgent Of course  he is on the intercom Who can be calling Jack Sawyer and why the urgency Wendell hopes that Golden Boy will push the telephones SPEAKER button but alas Golden Boy does not and Wendell must be content with hearing only one side of the conversation A call Jack says Whos it from He refused to identify himself the doctor says Someone you told youd be visiting Ward D Beezer with news of Black House How do I take the call Just punch the flashing button the doctor says Line one Ill bring in Mrs Marshall when I see youre off the line Jack hits the button and says Jack Sawyer Thank God says Beezer St Pierres honeyandtobacco voice Hey man you gotta get over to my place the sooner the better Everything got messed up Did you find it Oh yeah we found Black House all right It didnt exactly welcome us That place wants to stay hidden and it lets you know Some of the guys are hurting Most of us will be okay but Mouse I dont know He got something terrible from a dog bite if it was a dog which I doubt Doc did what he could but Hell the guy is out of his mind and he wont let us take him to the hospital Beezer why dont you take him anyway if thats what he needs We dont do things that way Mouse hasnt stepped inside a hospital since his old man croaked in one Hes twice as scared of hospitals as of whats happening to his leg If we took him to La Riviere General hed probably drop dead in the ER And if he didnt hed never forgive you You got it How soon can you be here I still have to see the woman I told you about Maybe an hour  not much longer than that anyhow Didnt you hear me Mouse is dying on us We got a whole lot of things to say to each other I agree Jack says Work with me on this Beez He hangs up turns to the door near the consultingroom chair and waits for his world to change What the hell was that all about Wendell wonders He has squandered two minutes worth of tape on a conversation between Jack Sawyer and the dumb SOB who spoiled the film that should have paid for a nice car and a fancy house on a bluff above the river and all he got was worthless crap Wendell deserves the nice car and the fancy house has earned them thrice over and his sense of deprivation makes him seethe with resentment Golden Boys get everything handed to them on diamondstudded salvers people fall all over themselves to give them stuff they dont even need but a legendary selfless working stiff and gentleman of the press like Wendell Green It costs Wendell Green twenty bucks to hide in a dark crowded little closet just to do his job His ears tingle when he hears the door open The red light burns the faithful recorder passes the ready tape from spool to spool and whatever happens now is going to change everything Wendells gut that infallible organ his best friend warms with the assurance that justice will soon be his Dr Spieglemans voice filters through the closet door and registers on the spooling tape Ill leave you two alone now Golden Boy Thank you Doctor Im very grateful Dr Spiegleman Thirty minutes right That means Ill be back at umm ten past two Golden Boy Fine The soft closing of the door the click of the latch Then long seconds of silence Why arent they talking to each other But of course    the question answers itself Theyre waiting for fatass Spiegleman to move out of hearing range Oh this is just delicious thats what this is The whisper of Golden Boys footsteps moving toward that door all but confirms the sterling reporters intuition O gut of Wendell Green O Instrument Marvelous and Trustworthy once more you come through with the journalistic goods Wendell hears the machine records the inevitable next sound the click of the lock Judy Marshall Dont forget the door behind you Golden Boy How are you Judy Marshall Much much better now that youre here The door Jack Another set of footsteps another unmistakable sliding into place of a metal bolt SoonToBeRuined Boy Ive been thinking about you all day Ive been thinking about this The Harlot the Whore the Slut Is half an hour long enough Him With Foot In Bear Trap If it isnt hell just have to bang on the doors Wendell barely restrains himself from crowing with delight These two people are actually going to have sex together they are going to rip off their clothes and have at it like animals Man talk about your paybacks When Wendell Green is done with him Jack Sawyers reputation will be lower than the Fishermans Judys eyes look tired her hair is limp and her fingertips wear the startling white of fresh gauze but besides registering the depth of her feeling her face glows with the clear hardwon beauty of the imaginative strength she called upon to earn what she has seen To Jack Judy Marshall looks like a queen falsely imprisoned Instead of disguising her innate nobility of spirit the hospital gown and the faded nightdress make it all the more apparent Jack takes his eyes from her long enough to lock the second door then takes a step toward her He sees that he cannot tell her anything she does not already know Judy completes the movement he has begun she moves before him and holds out her hands to be grasped Ive been thinking about you all day he says taking her hands Ive been thinking about this Her response takes in everything she has come to see everything they must do Is half an hour long enough If it isnt hell just have to bang on the doors They smile she increases the pressure on his hands Then let him bang With the smallest slightest tug she pulls him forward and Jacks heart pounds with the expectation of an embrace What she does is far more extraordinary than a mere embrace she lowers her head and with two light dry brushes of her lips kisses his hands Then she presses the back of his right hand against her cheek and steps back Her eyes kindle You know about the tape He nods I went mad when I heard it but sending it to me was a mistake He pushed me too hard Because I fell right back into being that child who listened to another child whispering through a wall I went crazy and I tried to rip the wall apart I heard my son screaming for my help And he was there  on the other side of the wall Where you have to go Where we have to go Where we have to go Yes But I cant get through the wall and you can So you have work to do the most important work there could be You have to find Ty and you have to stop the abbalah I dont know what that is exactly but stopping it is your job Am I saying this right you are a coppiceman Youre saying it right Jack says I am a coppiceman Thats why its my job Then this is right too You have to get rid of Gorg and his master Mr Munshun Thats not what his name really is but its what it sounds like Mr Munshun When I went mad and I tried to rip through the world she told me and she could whisper straight into my ear I was so close What does Wendell Green ear and whirling tape recorder pressed to the door make of this conversation It is hardly what he expected to hear the animal grunts and moans of desire busily being satisfied Wendell Green grinds his teeth he stretches his face into a grimace of frustration I love that youve let yourself see says Jack Youre an amazing human being There isnt a person in a thousand who could even understand what that means much less do it You talk too much Judy says I mean I love you In your way you love me But you know what Just by coming here you made me more than I was Theres this sort of beam that comes out of you and I just locked on to that beam Jack you lived there and all I could do was peek at it for a little while Thats enough though Im satisfied You and Ward D you let me travel What you have inside you lets you travel Okay three cheers for a wellexamined spell of craziness Now its time You have to be a coppiceman I can only come halfway but youll need all your strength I think your strength is going to surprise you Take my hands and do it Jack Go over Shes waiting and I have to give you to her You know her name dont you He opens his mouth but cannot speak A force that seems to come from the center of the earth surges into his body rolling electricity through his bloodstream tightening his scalp sealing his trembling fingers to Judy Marshalls which also tremble A feeling of tremendous lightness and mobility gathers within all the hollow spaces of his body at the same time he has never been so aware of his bodys obduracy its resistance to flight When they leave he thinks itll be like a rocket launch The floor seems to vibrate beneath his feet He manages to look down the length of his arms to Judy Marshall who leans back with her head parallel to the shaking floor eyes closed smiling in a trance of accomplishment A band of shivery white light surrounds her Her beautiful knees her legs shining beneath the hem of the old blue garment her bare feet planted That light shivers around him too All of this comes from her Jack thinks and from  A rushing sound fills the air and the Georgia OKeeffe prints fly off the walls The low couch dances away from the wall papers swirl up from the jittering desk A skinny halogen lamp crashes to the ground All through the hospital on every floor in every room and ward beds vibrate television sets go black instruments rattle in their rattling trays lights flicker Toys drop from the giftshop shelves and the tall lilies skid across the marble in their vases On the fifth floor light bulbs detonate into showers of golden sparks The hurricane noise builds builds and with a great whooshing sound becomes a wide white sheet of light which immediately vanishes into a pinpoint and is gone Gone too is Jack Sawyer and gone from the closet is Wendell Green Sucked into the Territories blown out of one world and sucked into another blasted and dragged man were a hundred levels up from the simple wellknown flip Jack is lying down looking up at a ripped white sheet that flaps like a torn sail A quarter of a second ago he saw another white sheet one made of pure light and not literal like this one The soft fragrant air blesses him At first he is conscious only that his right hand is being held then that an astonishing woman lies beside him Judy Marshall No not Judy Marshall whom he does love in his way but another astonishing woman who once whispered to Judy through a wall of night and has lately drawn a great deal closer He had been about to speak her name when  Into his field of vision moves a lovely face both like and unlike Judys It was turned on the same lathe baked in the same kiln chiseled by the same besotted sculptor but more delicately with a lighter more caressing touch Jack cannot move for wonder He is barely capable of breathing This woman whose face is above him now smiling down with a tender impatience has never borne a child never traveled beyond her native Territories never flown in an airplane driven a car switched on a television scooped ice readymade from the freezer or used a microwave and she is radiant with spirit and inner grace She is he sees lit from within Humor tenderness compassion intelligence strength glow in her eyes and speak from the curves of her mouth from the very molding of her face He knows her name and her name is perfect for her It seems to Jack that he has fallen in love with this woman in an instant that he enlisted in her cause on the spot and at last he finds he can speak her perfect name Sophie SOPHIE Still holding her hand he gets to his feet pulling her up with him His legs are trembling His eyes feel hot and too large for their sockets He is terrified and exalted in equal perfectly equal measure His heart is hammering but oh the beats are sweet The second time he tries he manages to say her name a little louder but theres still not much to his voice and his lips are so numb they might have been rubbed with ice He sounds like a man just coming back from a hard punch in the gut Yes Sophie Yes Sophie Yes Theres something weirdly familiar about this him saying the name over and over and her giving back that simple affirmation Familiar and funny And it comes to him theres a scene almost identical to this in The Terror of Deadwood Gulch after one of the Lazy  Saloons patrons has knocked Bill Towns unconscious with a whiskey bottle Lily in her role as sweet Nancy ONeal tosses a bucket of water in his face and when he sits up they  This is funny Jack says Its a good bit We should be laughing With the slightest of smiles Sophie says Yes Laughing our fool heads off Yes Our tarnal heads off Yes Im not speaking English anymore am I No He sees two things in her blue eyes The first is that she doesnt know the word English The second is that she knows exactly what he means Sophie Yes SophieSophieSophie Trying to get the reality of it Trying to pound it home like a nail A smile lights her face and enriches her mouth Jack thinks of how it would be to kiss that mouth and his knees feel weak All at once he is fourteen again and wondering if he dares give his date a peck goodnight after he walks her home Yesyesyes she says the smile strengthening And then Have you got it yet Do you understand that youre here and how you got here Above and around him billows of gauzy white cloth flap and sigh like living breath Half a dozen conflicting drafts gently touch his face and make him aware that he carried a coat of sweat from the other world and that it stinks He arms it off his brow and cheeks in quick gestures not wanting to lose sight of her for longer than a moment at a time They are in a tent of some kind Its huge  manychambered  and Jack thinks briefly of the pavilion in which the Queen of the Territories his mothers Twinner lay dying That place had been rich with many colors filled with many rooms redolent of incense and sorrow for the Queens death had seemed inevitable sure  only a matter of time This one is ramshackle and ragged The walls and the ceiling are full of holes and where the white material remains whole its so thin that Jack can actually see the slope of land outside and the trees that dress it Rags flutter from the edges of some of the holes when the wind blows Directly over his head he can see a shadowy maroon shape Some sort of cross Jack do you understand how you   Yes I flipped Although that isnt the word that comes out of his mouth The literal meaning of the word that comes out seems to be horizon road And it seems that I sucked a fair number of Spieglemans accessories with me He bends and picks up a flat stone with a flower carved on it I believe that in my world this was a Georgia OKeeffe print And that   He points to a blackened fireless torch leaning against one of the pavilions fragile walls I think that was a   But there are no words for it in this world and what comes out of his mouth sounds as ugly as a curse in German   halogen lamp She frowns Haldojen    limp Lemp He feels his numb lips rise in a little grin Never mind But you are all right He understands that she needs him to be all right and so hell say that he is but hes not He is sick and glad to be sick He is one lovestruck daddy and wouldnt have it any other way If you discount how he felt about his mother  a very different kind of love despite what the Freudians might think  its the first time for him Oh he certainly thought he had been in and out of love but that was before today Before the cool blue of her eyes her smile and even the way the shadows thrown by the decaying tent fleet across her face like schools of fish At this moment he would try to fly off a mountain for her if she asked or walk through a forest fire or bring her polar ice to cool her tea and those things do not constitute being all right But she needs him to be Tyler needs him to be I am a coppiceman he thinks At first the concept seems insubstantial compared to her beauty  to her simple reality  but then it begins to take hold As it always has What else brought him here after all Brought him against his will and all his best intentions Jack Yes Im all right Ive flipped before But never into the presence of such beauty he thinks Thats the problem Youre the problem my lady Yes To come and go is your talent One of your talents So I have been told By whom Shortly she says Shortly Theres a great deal to do and yet I think I need a moment You    rather take my breath away Jack is fiercely glad to know it He sees he is still holding her hand and he kisses it as Judy kissed his hands in the world on the other side of the wall from this one and when he does he sees the fine mesh of bandage on the tips of three of her fingers He wishes he dared to take her in his arms but she daunts him her beauty and her presence She is slightly taller than Judy  a matter of two inches surely no more  and her hair is lighter the golden shade of unrefined honey spilling from a broken comb She is wearing a simple cotton robe white trimmed with a blue that matches her eyes The narrow Vneck frames her throat The hem falls to just below her knees Her legs are bare but shes wearing a silver anklet on one of them so slim its almost invisible She is fullerbreasted than Judy her hips a bit wider Sisters you might think except that they have the same spray of freckles across the nose and the same white line of scar across the back of the left hand Different mishaps caused that scar Jack has no doubt but he also has no doubt that those mishaps occurred at the same hour of the same day Youre her Twinner Judy Marshalls Twinner Only the word that comes out of his mouth isnt Twinner incredibly dopily it seems to be harp Later he will think of how the strings of a harp lie close together only a fingers touch apart and he will decide that word isnt so foolish after all She looks down her mouth drooping then raises her head again and tries to smile Judy On the other side of the wall When we were children Jack we spoke together often Even when we grew up although then we spoke in each others dreams He is alarmed to see tears forming in her eyes and then slipping down her cheeks Have I driven her mad Run her to lunacy Please say I havent Nah Jack says Shes on a tightrope but she hasnt fallen off yet Shes tough that one You have to bring her Tyler back to her Sophie tells him For both of us Ive never had a child I cannot have a child I was    mistreated you see When I was young Mistreated by one you knew well A terrible certainty forms in Jacks mind Around them the ruined pavilion flaps and sighs in the wonderfully fragrant breeze Was it Morgan Morgan of Orris She bows her head and perhaps this is just as well Jacks face is at that moment pulled into an ugly snarl In that moment he wishes he could kill Morgan Sloats Twinner all over again He thinks to ask her how she was mistreated and then realizes he doesnt have to How old were you Twelve she says    as Jack has known she would say It happened that same year the year when Jacky was twelve and came here to save his mother Or did he come here Is this really the Territories Somehow it doesnt feel the same Almost    but not quite It doesnt surprise him that Morgan would rape a child of twelve and do it in a way that would keep her from ever having children Not at all Morgan Sloat sometimes known as Morgan of Orris wanted to rule not just one world or two but the entire universe What are a few raped children to a man with such ambitions She gently slips her thumbs across the skin beneath his eyes Its like being brushed with feathers Shes looking at him with something like wonder Why do you weep Jack The past he says Isnt that always what does it And thinks of his mother sitting by the window smoking a cigarette and listening while the radio plays Crazy Arms Yes its always the past Thats where the hurt is all you cant get over Perhaps so she allows But theres no time to think about the past today Its the future we must think about today Yes but if I could ask just a few questions     All right but only a few Jack opens his mouth tries to speak and makes a comical little gaping expression when nothing comes out Then he laughs You take my breath away too he tells her I have to be honest about that A faint tinge of color rises in Sophies cheeks and she looks down She opens her lips to say something    then presses them together again Jack wishes she had spoken and is glad she hasnt both at the same time He squeezes her hands gently and she looks up at him blue eyes wide Did I know you When you were twelve She shakes her head But I saw you Perhaps In the great pavilion My mother was one of the Good Queens handmaidens I was another    the youngest You could have seen me then I think you did see me Jack takes a moment to digest the wonder of this then goes on Time is short They both know this He can almost feel it fleeting You and Judy are Twinners but neither of you travel  shes never been in your head over here and youve never been in her head over there You    talk through a wall Yes When she wrote things that was you whispering through the wall Yes I knew how hard I was pushing her but I had to Had to Its not just a question of restoring her child to her important as that may be There are larger considerations Such as She shakes her head I am not the one to tell you The one who will is much greater than I He studies the tiny dressings that cover the tips of her fingers and muses on how hard Sophie and Judy have tried to get through that wall to each other Morgan Sloat could apparently become Morgan of Orris at will As a boy of twelve Jack had met others with that same talent Not him he was singlenatured and had always been Jack in both worlds Judy and Sophie however have proved incapable of flipping back and forth in any fashion Somethings been left out of them and they could only whisper through the wall between the worlds There must be sadder things but at this moment he cant think of a single one Jack looks around at the ruined tent which seems to breathe with sunshine and shadow Rags flap In the next room through a hole in the gauzy cloth wall he sees a few overturned cots What is this place he asks She smiles To some a hospital Oh He looks up and once more takes note of the cross Maroon now but undoubtedly once red A red cross stupid he thinks Oh But isnt it a little    well    old Sophies smile widens and Jack realizes its ironic Whatever sort of hospital this is or was hes guessing it bears little or no resemblance to the ones on General Hospital or ER Yes Jack Very old Once there were a dozen or more of these tents in the Territories OnWorld and MidWorld now there are only a few Mayhap just this one Today its here Tomorrow    Sophie raises her hands then lowers them Anywhere Perhaps even on Judys side of the wall Sort of like a traveling medicine show This is supposed to be a joke and hes startled when she first nods then laughs and claps her hands Yes Yes indeed Although you wouldnt want to be treated here What exactly is she trying to say I suppose not he agrees looking at the rotting walls tattered ceiling panels and ancient support posts Doesnt exactly look sterile Seriously but her eyes are sparkling Sophie says Yet if you were a patient you would think it beautiful out of all measure And you would think your nurses the Little Sisters the most beautiful any poor patient ever had Jack looks around Where are they The Little Sisters dont come out when the sun shines And if we wish to continue our lives with the blessing Jack well be gone our separate ways from here long before dark It pains him to hear her talk of separate ways even though he knows its inevitable The pain doesnt dampen his curiosity however once a coppiceman it seems always a coppiceman Why Because the Little Sisters are vampires and their patients never get well Startled uneasy Jack looks around for signs of them Certainly disbelief doesnt cross his mind  a world that can spawn werewolves can spawn anything he supposes She touches his wrist A little tremble of desire goes through him Dont fear Jack  they also serve the Beam All things serve the Beam What beam Never mind The hand on his wrist tightens The one who can answer your questions will be here soon if hes not already She gives him a sideways look that contains a glimmer of a smile And after you hear him youll be more apt to ask questions that matter Jack realizes that he has been neatly rebuked but coming from her it doesnt sting He allows himself to be led through room after room of the great and ancient hospital As they go he gets a sense of how really huge this place is He also realizes that in spite of the fresh breezes he can detect a faint unpleasant undersmell something that might be a mixture of fermented wine and spoiled meat As to what sort of meat Jack is afraid he can guess pretty well After visiting over a hundred homicide crime scenes he should be able to It would have been impolite to break away while Jack was meeting the love of his life not to mention bad narrative business so we didnt Now however let us slip through the thin walls of the hospital tent Outside is a dry but not unpleasant landscape of red rocks broom sage desert flowers that look a bit like sego lilies stunted pines and a few barrel cacti Somewhere not too far distant is the steady cool sigh of a river The hospital pavilion rustles and flaps as dreamily as the sails of a ship riding down the sweet chute of the trade winds As we float along the great ruined tents east side in our effortless and peculiarly pleasant way we notice a strew of litter There are more rocks with drawings etched on them there is a beautifully made copper rose that has been twisted out of shape as if by some great heat there is a small rag rug that looks as if it has been chopped in two by a meat cleaver Theres other stuff as well stuff that has resisted any change in its cyclonic passage from one world to the other We see the blackened husk of a television picture tube lying in a scatter of broken glass several Duracell AA batteries a comb and  perhaps oddest  a pair of white nylon panties with the word Sunday written on one side in demure pink script There has been a collision of worlds here along the east side of the hospital pavilion is an intermingled detritus that attests to how hard that collision was At the end of that littery plume of exhaust  the head of the comet we might say  sits a man we recognize Were not used to seeing him in such an ugly brown robe and he clearly doesnt know how to wear such a garment because if we look at him from the wrong angle we can see much more than we want to or wearing sandals instead of wing tips or with his hair pulled back into a rough horsetail and secured with a hank of rawhide but this is undoubtedly Wendell Green He is muttering to himself Drool drizzles from the corners of his mouth He is looking fixedly at an untidy crumple of foolscap in his right hand He ignores all the more cataclysmic changes that have occurred around him and focuses on just this one If he can figure out how his Panasonic minicorder turned into a little pile of ancient paper perhaps hell move on to the other stuff Not until then Wendell well continue to call him Wendell shall we and not worry about any name he might or might not have in this little corner of existence since he doesnt know it or want to spies the Duracell AA batteries He crawls to them picks them up and begins trying to stick them into the little pile of foolscap It doesnt work of course but that doesnt keep Wendell from trying As George Rathbun might say Give that boy a flyswatter and hed try to catch dinner with it Geh says the Coulee Countrys favorite investigative reporter repeatedly poking the batteries at the foolscap Geh    in Geh    in Gahdamnit geh in th   A sound  the approaching jingle of what can only be God help us spurs  breaks into Wendells concentration and he looks up with wide bulging eyes His sanity may not be gone forever but its certainly taken the wife and kids and gone to Disney World Nor is the current vision before his eyes apt to coax it back anytime soon Once in our world there was a fine black actor named Woody Strode Lily knew him acted with him as a matter of fact in a latesixties American International stinkeroo called Execution Express The man now approaching the place where Wendell Green crouches with his batteries and his handful of foolscap looks remarkably like that actor He is wearing faded jeans a blue chambray shirt a neck scarf and a heavy revolver on a wide leather gun belt in which four dozen or so shells twinkle His head is bald his eyes deepset Slung over one shoulder by a strap of intricate design is a guitar Sitting on the other is what appears to be a parrot The parrot has two heads No no says Wendell in a mildly scolding voice Dont Dont see Dont see That He lowers his head and once more begins trying to cram the batteries into the handful of paper The shadow of the newcomer falls over Wendell who resolutely refuses to look up Howdy stranger says the newcomer Wendell carries on not looking up My names Parkus Im the law round these parts Whats your handle Wendell refuses to respond unless we can call the low grunts issuing from his droolslicked mouth a response I asked your name Wen says our old acquaintance we cant really call him a friend without looking up Wen Dell Gree    Green I    I    I    Take your time Parkus says not without sympathy I can wait till your branding iron gets hot I    news hawk Oh That what you are Parkus hunkers Wendell cringes back against the fragile wall of the pavilion Well dont that just beat the bass drum at the front of the parade Tell you what Ive seen fish hawks and Ive seen red hawks and Ive seen goshawks but youre my first news hawk Wendell looks up blinking rapidly On Parkuss left shoulder one head of the parrot says God is love Go fuck your mother replies the other head All must seek the river of life says the first head Suck my tool says the second We grow toward God responds the first Piss up a rope invites the second Although both heads speak equably  even in tones of reasonable discourse  Wendell cringes backward even farther then looks down and furiously resumes his futile work with the batteries and the handful of paper which is now disappearing into the sweatgrimy tube of his fist Dont mind em Parkus says I sure dont Hardly hear em anymore and thats the truth Shut up boys The parrot falls silent One heads Sacred the others Profane Parkus says I keep em around just to remind me that   He is interrupted by the sound of approaching footsteps and stands up again in a single lithe and easy movement Jack and Sophie are approaching holding hands with the perfect unconsciousness of children on their way to school Speedy Jack cries his face breaking into a grin Why Travelin Jack Parkus says with a grin of his own Wellmet Look at you sir  youre all grown up Jack rushes forward and throws his arms around Parkus who hugs him back and heartily After a moment Jack holds Parkus at arms length and studies him You were older  you looked older to me at least In both worlds Still smiling Parkus nods And when he speaks again it is in Speedy Parkers drawl Reckon I did look older Jack You were just a child remember But   Parkus waves one hand Sometimes I look older sometimes not so old It all depends on   Age is wisdom one head of the parrot says piously to which the other responds You senile old fuck   depends on the place and the circumstances Parkus concludes then says And I told you boys to shut up You keep on Im apt to wring your scrawny neck He turns his attention to Sophie who is looking at him with wide wondering eyes as shy as a doe Sophie he says Its wonderful to see you darling Didnt I say hed come And here he is Took a little longer than I expected is all She drops him a deep curtsey all the way down to one knee her head bowed Thankeesai she says Come in peace gunslinger and go your course along the Beam with my love At this Jack feels an odd deep chill as if many worlds had spoken in a harmonic tone low but resonant Speedy  so Jack still thinks of him  takes her hand and urges her to her feet Stand up girl and look me in the eye Im no gunslinger here not in the borderlands even if I do still carry the old iron from time to time In any case we have a lot to talk about Thiss no time for ceremony Come over the rise with me you two We got to make palaver as the gunslingers say Or used to say before the world moved on I shot a good brace of grouse and think theyll cook up just fine What about   Jack gestures toward the muttering crouched heap that is Wendell Green Why he looks right busy Parkus says Told me hes a news hawk Im afraid hes a little above himself Jack replies Old Wendell heres a news vulture Wendell turns his head a bit He refuses to lift his eyes but his lip curls in a sneer that may be more reflexive than real Heard That He struggles The lip curls again and this time the sneer seems less reflexive It is in fact a snarl Gol Gol Golden boy Holly Wood Hes managed to retain at least some of his charm and his joi de vivre Jack says Will he be okay here Not much with ary brain in its head comes near the Little Sisters tent Parkus says Hell be okay And if he smells somethin tasty on the breeze and comes for a looksee why I guess we can feed him He turns toward Wendell Were going just over yonder If you want to come and visit why you just up and do her Understand me Mr News Hawk Wen Dell Green Wendell Green yessir Parkus looks at the others Come on Lets mosey We mustnt forget him Sophie murmurs with a look back It will be dark in a few hours No Parkus agrees as they top the nearest rise Wouldnt do to leave him beside that tent after dark That wouldnt do at all Theres more foliage in the declivity on the far side of the rise  even a little ribbon of creek presumably on its way to the river Jack can hear in the distance  but it still looks more like northern Nevada than western Wisconsin Yet in a way Jack thinks that makes sense The last one had been no ordinary flip He feels like a stone that has been skipped all the way across a lake and as for poor Wendell  To the right of where they descend the far side of the draw a horse has been tethered in the shade of what Jack thinks is a Joshua tree About twenty yards down the draw to the left is a circle of eroded stones Inside it a fire not yet lit has been carefully laid Jack doesnt like the look of the place much  the stones remind him of ancient teeth Nor is he alone in his dislike Sophie stops her grip on his fingers tightening Parkus do we have to go in there Please say we dont Parkus turns to her with a kindly smile Jack knows well a Speedy Parker smile for sure The Speaking Demons been gone from this circle many the long age darling he says And you know that such as yon are best for stories Yet   Nows no time to give in to the willies Parkus tells her He speaks with a trace of impatience and willies isnt precisely the word he uses but only how Jacks mind translates it You waited for him to come in the Little Sisters hospital tent   Only because she was there on the other side     and now I want you to come along All at once he seems taller to Jack His eyes flash Jack thinks A gunslinger Yes I suppose he could be a gunslinger Like in one of Moms old movies only for real All right she says low If we must Then she looks at Jack I wonder if youd put your arm around me Jack we may be sure is happy to oblige As they step between two of the stones Jack seems to hear an ugly twist of whispered words Among them one voice is momentarily clear seeming to leave a trail of slime behind it as it enters his ear Drudge drudge drudge oho the bledding foodzies soon he cummz my good friend Munshun and such a prize I have for him oho oho  Jack looks at his old friend as Parkus hunkers by a tow sack and loosens the drawstring at the top Hes close isnt he The Fisherman And Black House thats close too Yep Parkus says and from the sack he spills the gutted corpses of a dozen plump dead birds Thoughts of Irma Freneau reenter Jacks head at the sight of the grouse and he thinks he wont be able to eat Watching as Parkus and Sophie skewer the birds on greensticks reinforces this idea But after the fire is lit and the birds begin to brown his stomach weighs in insisting that the grouse smell wonderful and will probably taste even better Over here he remembers everything always does And here we are in the speaking circle Parkus says His smiles have been put away for the nonce He looks at Jack and Sophie who sit side by side and still holding hands with somber gravity His guitar has been propped against a nearby rock Beside it Sacred and Profane sleeps with its two heads tucked into its feathers dreaming its no doubt bifurcated dreams The Demon may be long gone but the legends say such things leave a residue that may lighten the tongue Like kissing the Blarney Stone maybe Jack suggests Parkus shakes his head No blarney today Jack says If only we were dealing with an ordinary scumbag That I could handle Sophie looks at him puzzled He means a dustoff artist Parkus tells her A hardcase He looks at Jack And in one way that is what youre dealing with Carl Bierstone isnt much  an ordinary monster lets say Which is not to say he couldnt do with a spot of killing But as for whats going on in French Landing he has been used Possessed youd say in your world Jack Taken by the spirits wed say in the Territories   Or brought low by pigs Sophie adds Yes Parkus is nodding In the world just beyond this borderland  MidWorld  they would say he has been infested by a demon But a demon far greater than the poor tattered spirit that once lived in this circle of stones Jack hardly hears that His eyes are glowing It sounded something like beer stein George Potter told him last night a thousand years ago Thats not it but its close Carl Bierstone he says He raises a clenched fist then shakes it in triumph That was his name in Chicago Burnside here in French Landing Case closed game over zip up your fly Where is he Speedy Save me some time h   Shut    up Parkus says The tone is low and almost deadly Jack can feel Sophie shrink against him He does a little shrinking himself This sounds nothing like his old friend nothing at all You have to stop thinking of him as Speedy Jack tells himself Thats not who he is or ever was That was just a character he played someone who could both soothe and charm a scared kid on the run with his mother Parkus turns the birds which are now browned nicely on one side and spitting juice into the fire Im sorry to speak harsh to you Jack but you have to realize that your Fisherman is pretty small fry compared to whats really going on Why dont you tell Tansy Freneau hes small fry Why dont you tell Beezer St Pierre Jack thinks these things but doesnt say them out loud Hes more than a little afraid of the light he saw in Parkuss eyes Nor is it about Twinners Parkus says You got to get that idea out of your mind Thats just something that has to do with your world and the world of the Territories  a link You cant kill some hardcase over here and end the career of your cannibal over there And if you kill him over there in Wisconsin the thing inside will just jump to another host The thing   When it was in Albert Fish Fish called it the Monday Man Fellow youre after calls it Mr Munshun Both are only ways of trying to say something that cant be pronounced by any earthly tongue on any earthly world How many worlds are there Speedy Many Parkus says looking into the fire And this business concerns every one of them Why else do you think Ive been after you like I have Sending you feathers sending you robins eggs doing every damned thing I could to make you wake up Jack thinks of Judy scratching on walls until the tips of her fingers were bloody and feels ashamed Speedy has been doing much the same thing it seems Wake up wake up you dunderhead he says Parkus seems caught between reproof and a smile For sure you must have seen me in the case that sent you running out of LA Ah man  why do you think I went You ran like Jonah when God told him to go preach against the wickedness in Nineveh Thought I was gonna have to send a whale to come and swallow you up I feel swallowed Jack tells him In a small voice Sophie says I do too Weve all been swallowed says the man with the gun on his hip Were in the belly of the beast like it or not Its ka which is destiny and fate Your Fisherman Jack is now your ka Our ka This is more than murder Much more And Jack sees something that frankly scares the shit out of him Lester Parker aka Speedy aka Parkus is himself scared almost to death This business concerns the Dark Tower he says Beside Jack Sophie gives a low desperate cry of terror and lowers her head At the same time she raises one hand and forks the sign of the Evil Eye at Parkus over and over That gentleman doesnt seem to take it amiss He simply sets to work turning the birds again on their sticks Listen to me now he says Listen and ask as few questions as you can We still have a chance to get Judy Marshalls son back but time is blowing in our teeth Talk Jack says Parkus talks At some point in his tale he judges the birds done and serves them out on flat stones The meat is tender almost falling off the small bones Jack eats hungrily drinking deep of the sweet water from Parkuss waterskin each time it comes around to him He wastes no more time comparing dead children to dead grouse The furnace needs to be stoked and he stokes it with a will So does Sophie eating with her fingers and licking them clean without the slightest reserve or embarrassment So in the end does Wendell Green although he refuses to enter the circle of old stones When Parkus tosses him a goldenbrown grouse however Wendell catches it with remarkable adroitness and buries his face in the moist meat You asked how many worlds Parkus begins The answer in the High Speech is da fan worlds beyond telling With one of the blackened sticks he draws a figure eight on its side which Jack recognizes as the Greek symbol for infinity There is a Tower that binds them in place Think of it as an axle upon which many wheels spin if you like And there is an entity that would bring this Tower down Ram Abbalah At these words the flames of the fire seem to momentarily darken and turn red Jack wishes he could believe that this is only a trick of his overstrained mind but cannot The Crimson King he says Yes His physical being is pent in a cell at the top of the Tower but he has another manifestation every bit as real and this lives in Cantah Abbalah  the Court of the Crimson King Two places at once Given his journeying between the world of America and the world of the Territories Jack has little trouble swallowing this concept Yes If he  or it  destroys the Tower wont that defeat his purpose Wont he destroy his physical being in the process Just the opposite hell set it free to wander what will then be chaos    dintah    the furnace Some parts of MidWorld have fallen into that furnace already How much of this do I actually need to know Jack asks He is aware that time is fleeting by on his side of the wall as well Hard telling what you need to know and what you dont Parkus says If I leave out the wrong piece of information maybe all the stars go dark Not just here but in a thousand thousand universes Thats the pure hell of it Listen Jack  the King has been trying to destroy the Tower and set himself free for time out of mind Forever mayhap Its slow work because the Tower is bound in place by crisscrossing force beams that act on it like guy wires The Beams have held for millennia and would hold for millennia to come but in the last two hundred years  thats speaking of time as you count it Jack to you Sophie it would be FullEarth almost five hundred times over   So long she says Its almost a sigh So very long In the great sweep of things its as short as the gleam of a single match in a dark room But while good things usually take a long time to develop evil has a way of popping up fullblown and readymade like Jack out of his box Ka is a friend to evil as well as to good It embraces both And speaking of Jack    Parkus turns to him Youve heard of the Iron Age and the Bronze Age of course Jack nods On the upper levels of the Tower there are those who call the last two hundred or so years in your world the Age of Poisoned Thought That means   You dont have to explain it to me Jack says I knew Morgan Sloat remember I knew what he planned for Sophies world Yes indeed The basic plan had been to turn one of the universes sweetest honeycombs into first a vacation spot for the rich then a source of unskilled labor and finally a waste pit probably radioactive If that wasnt an example of poisoned thought Jack doesnt know what is Parkus says Rational beings have always harbored telepaths among their number thats true in all the worlds But theyre ordinarily rare creatures Prodigies you might say But since the Age of Poisoned Thought came on your world Jack  infested it like a demon  such beings have become much more common Not as common as slow mutants in the Blasted Lands but common yes You speak of mind readers Sophie says as if wanting to be sure Yes Parkus agrees but not just mind readers Precognates Teleports  world jumpers like old Travelin Jack here in other words  and telekinetics Mind readers are the most common telekinetics the rarest    and the most valuable To him you mean Jack says To the Crimson King Yes Over the last two hundred years or so the abbalah has spent a good part of his time gathering a crew of telepathic slaves Most of them come from Earth and the Territories All of the telekinetics come from Earth This collection of slaves  this gulag  is his crowning achievement We call them Breakers They    He trails off thinking Then Do you know how a galley travels Sophie nods but Jack at first has no idea what Parkus is talking about He has a brief lunatic vision of a fully equipped kitchen traveling down Route  Many oarsmen Sophie says then makes a rowing motion that throws her breasts into charming relief Parkus is nodding Usually slaves chained together They   From outside the circle Wendell suddenly sticks his own oar in Spart Cus He pauses frowning then tries it again Spartacus Whats he on about Parkus asks frowning Any idea Jack A movie called Spartacus Jack says and youre wrong as usual Wendell I believe youre thinking about BenHur Looking sulky Wendell holds out his greasy hands More Meat Parkus pulls the last grouse from its sizzling stick and tosses it between two of the stones where Wendell sits with his pallid greasy face peering from between his knees Fresh prey for the news hawk he says Now do us a favor and shut up Or What The old defiant gleam is rising in Wendells eyes Parkus draws his shooting iron partway from its holster The grip made of sandalwood is worn but the barrel gleams murderbright He has to say no more holding his second bird in one hand Wendell Green hitches up his robe and hies himself back over the rise Jack is extremely relieved to see him go Spartacus indeed he thinks and snorts So the Crimson King wants to use these Breakers to destroy the Beams Jack says Thats it isnt it Thats his plan You speak as though of the future Parkus says mildly This is happening now Jack Only look at your own world if you want to see the ongoing disintegration Of the six Beams only one still holds true Two others still generate some holding power The other three are dead One of these went out thousands of years ago in the ordinary course of things The others    killed by the Breakers All in two centuries or less Christ Jack says He is beginning to understand how Speedy could call the Fisherman smallfry The job of protecting the Tower and the Beams has always belonged to the ancient war guild of Gilead called gunslingers in this world and many others They also generated a powerful psychic force Jack one fully capable of countering the Crimson Kings Breakers but   The gunslingers are all gone save for one Sophie says looking at the big pistol on Parkuss hip And with timid hope Unless you really are one too Parkus Not I darling he says but theres more than one I thought Roland was the last So the stories say He has made at least three others Parkus tells her Ive no idea how that can be possible but I believe it to be true If Roland were still alone the Breakers would have toppled the Tower long since But with the force of these others added to his   I have no clue what youre talking about Jack says I did sort of but you lost me about two turns back Theres no need for you to understand it all in order to do your job Parkus says Thank God for that As for what you do need to understand leave galleys and oarsmen and think in terms of the Western movies your mother used to make To begin with imagine a fort in the desert This Dark Tower you keep talking about Thats the fort Yes And surrounding the fort instead of wild Indians   The Breakers Led by Big Chief Abbalah Sophie murmurs The King is in his Tower eating bread and honey The Breakers in the basement making all the money Jack feels a light but singularly unpleasant chill shake up his spine he thinks of rat paws scuttering over broken glass What Why do you say that Sophie looks at him flushes shakes her head looks down Its what she says sometimes Judy Its how I hear her sometimes Parkus seizes one of the charred greensticks and draws in the rocky dust beside the figureeight shape Fort here Marauding Indians here led by their merciless evil  and most likely insane  chief But over here   Off to the left he draws a harsh arrow in the dirt It points at the rudimentary shapes indicating the fort and the besieging Indians What always arrives at the last moment in all the best Lily Cavanaugh Westerns The cavalry Jack says Thats us I suppose No Parkus says His tone is patient but Jack suspects it is costing him a great effort to maintain that tone The cavalry is Roland of Gilead and his new gunslingers Or so those of us who want the Tower to stand  or to fall in its own time  dare hope The Crimson King hopes to hold Roland back and to finish the job of destroying the Tower while he and his band are still at a distance That means gathering all the Breakers he can especially the telekinetics Is Tyler Marshall   Stop interrupting This is difficult enough without that You used to be a hell of a lot cheerier Speedy Jack says reproachfully For a moment he thinks his old friend is going to give him another tonguelashing  or perhaps even lose his temper completely and turn him into a frog  but Parkus relaxes a little and utters a laugh Sophie looks up relieved and gives Jacks hand a squeeze Oh well maybe youre right to yank on my cord a little Parkus says Gettin all wound up wont help anything will it He touches the big iron on his hip I wouldnt be surprised if wearin this thing has given me a few delusions of grandeur Its a step or two up from amusementpark janitor Jack allows In both the Bible  your world Jack  and the Book of Good Farming  yours Sophie dear  theres a scripture that goes something like For in my kingdom there are many mansions Well in the Court of the Crimson King there are many monsters Jack hears a short hard laugh bolt out of his mouth His old friend has made a typically tasteless policemans joke it seems They are the Kings courtiers    his knightserrant They have all sorts of tasks I imagine but in these last years their chief job has been to find talented Breakers The more talented the Breaker the greater the reward Theyre headhunters Jack murmurs and doesnt realize the resonance of the term until its out of his mouth He has used it in the business sense but of course there is another more literal meaning Headhunters are cannibals Yes Parkus agrees And they have mortal subcontractors who work for    one doesnt like to say for the joy of it but what else could we call it Jack has a nightmarish vision then a cartoon Albert Fish standing on a New York sidewalk with a sign reading WILL WORK FOR FOOD He tightens his arm around Sophie Her blue eyes turn to him and he looks into them gladly They soothe him How many Breakers did Albert Fish send his pal Mr Monday Jack wants to know Two Four A dozen And do they die off at least so the abbalah has to replace them They dont Parkus replies gravely They are kept in a place  a basement yes or a cavern  where there is essentially no time Purgatory Christ And it doesnt matter Albert Fish is long gone Mr Monday is now Mr Munshun The deal Mr Munshun has with your killer is a simple one this Burnside can kill and eat all the children he wants as long as they are untalented children If he should find any who are talented  any Breakers  they are to be turned over to Mr Munshun at once Who will take them to the abbalah Sophie murmurs Thats right Parkus says Jack feels that hes back on relatively solid ground and is extremely glad to be there Since Tyler hasnt been killed he must be talented  Talented is hardly the word Tyler Marshall is potentially one of the two most powerful Breakers in all the history of all the worlds If I can briefly return to the analogy of the fort surrounded by Indians then we could say that the Breakers are like fire arrows shot over the walls    a new kind of warfare But Tyler Marshall is no simple fire arrow Hes more like a guided missile Or a nuclear weapon Sophie says I dont know what that is You dont want to Jack replies Believe me He looks down at the scribble of drawings in the dirt Is he surprised that Tyler should be so powerful No not really Not after experiencing the aura of strength surrounding the boys mother Not after meeting Judys Twinner whose plain dress and manner cant conceal a character that strikes him as almost regal Shes beautiful but he senses that beauty is one of the least important things about her Jack Parkus asks him You all right Theres no time to be anythin else his tone suggests Give me a minute Jack says We dont have much t   That has been made perfectly clear to me Jack says biting off the words and he feels Sophie shift in surprise at his tone of voice Now give me a minute Let me do my job From beneath a ruffle of green feathers one of the parrots heads mutters God loves the poor laborer The other replies Is that why he made so fucking many of them All right Jack Parkus says and cocks his head up at the sky Okay what have we got here Jack thinks Weve got a valuable little boy and the Fisherman knows hes valuable But this Mr Munshun doesnt have him yet or Speedy wouldnt be here Deduction Sophie looking at him anxiously Parkus still looking up into the blameless blue sky above this borderland between the Territories  what Judy Marshall calls Faraway  and the Whatever Comes Next Jacks mind is ticking faster now picking up speed like an express train leaving the station He is aware that the black man with the bald head is watching the sky for a certain malevolent crow He is aware that the fairskinned woman beside him is looking at him with the sort of fascination that could become love given world enough and time Mostly though hes lost in his own thoughts They are the thoughts of a coppiceman Now Bierstones Burnside and hes old Old and not doing so well in the cognition department these days I think maybe hes gotten caught between what he wants which is to keep Tyler for himself and what hes promised this Munshun guy Somewhere theres a fuddled creaky dangerous mind trying to make itself up If he decides to kill Tyler and stick him in the stewpot like the witch in Hansel and Gretel thats bad for Judy and Fred Not to mention Tyler who may already have seen things that would drive a Marine combat vet insane If the Fisherman turns the boy over to Mr Munshun its bad for everyone in creation No wonder Speedy said time was blowing in our teeth You knew this was coming didnt you he says Both of you You must have Because Judy knew Shes been weird for months long before the murders started Parkus shifts and looks away uncomfortable I knew something was coming yes  there have been great disruptions on this side  but I was on other business And Sophie cant cross She came here with the flying men and will go back the same way when our palavers done Jack turns to her You are who my mother once was Im sure of it He supposes he isnt being entirely clear about this but he cant help it his mind is trying to go in too many directions at once Youre Laura DeLoessians successor The Queen of this world Now Sophie is the one who looks uncomfortable I was nobody in the great scheme of things really I wasnt and that was the way I liked it What I did mostly was write letters of commendation and thank people for coming to see me    only in my official capacity I always said us I enjoyed walking and sketching flowers and cataloging them I enjoyed hunting Then due to bad luck bad times and bad behavior I found myself the last of the royal line Queen of this world as you say Married once to a good and simple man but my Fred Marshall died and left me alone Sophie the Barren Dont Jack says He is surprised at how deeply it hurts him to hear her refer to herself in this bitter joking way Were you not singlenatured Jack your Twinner would be my cousin She turns her slim fingers so that now she is gripping him instead of the other way around When she speaks again her voice is low and passionate Put all the great matters aside All I know is that Tyler Marshall is Judys child that I love her that Id not see her hurt for all the worlds that are Hes the closest thing to a child of my own that Ill ever have These things I know and one other that youre the only one who can save him Why He has sensed this of course  why else in Gods name is he here  but that doesnt lessen his bewilderment Why me Because you touched the Talisman And although some of its power has left you over the years much still remains Jack thinks of the lilies Speedy left for him in Dales bathroom How the smell lingered on his hands even after he had given the bouquet itself to Tansy And he remembers how the Talisman looked in the murmuring darkness of the Queens Pavilion rising brightly changing everything before it finally vanished He thinks Its still changing everything Parkus Is it the first time hes called the other man  the other coppiceman  by that name He doesnt know for sure but he thinks it may be Yes Jack Whats left of the Talisman  is it enough Enough for me to take on this Crimson King Parkus looks shocked in spite of himself Never in your life Jack Never in any life The abbalah would blow you out like a candle But it may be enough for you to take on Mr Munshun  to go into the furnacelands and bring Tyler out There are machines Sophie says She looks caught in some dark and unhappy dream Red machines and black machines all lost in smoke There are great belts and children without number upon them They trudge and trudge turning the belts that turn the machines Down in the foxholes Down in the ratholes where the sun never shines Down in the great caverns where the furnacelands lie Jack is shaken to the bottom of his mind and spirit He finds himself thinking of Dickens  not Bleak House but Oliver Twist And of course he thinks of his conversation with Transy Freneau At least Irmas not there he thinks Not in the furnacelands not she She got dead and a mean old man ate her leg Tyler though    Tyler    They trudge until their feet bleed he mutters And the way there     I think you know it Parkus says When you find Black House youll find your way to the furnacelands    the machines    Mr Munshun    and Tyler The boy is alive Youre sure of that Yes Parkus and Sophie speak together And where is Burnside now That information might speed things up a bit I dont know Parkus says Christ if you know who he was   That was the fingerprints Parkus says The fingerprints on the telephone Your first real idea about the case The Wisconsin State Police got the Bierstone name back from the FBIs VICAP database You have the Burnside name That should be enough Wisconsin State Police FBI VICAP database these terms come out in good old American English and in this place they sound unpleasant and foreign to Jacks ear How do you know all that I have my sources in your world I keep my ear to the ground As you know from personal experience And surely youre cop enough to do the rest on your own Judy thinks you have a friend who can help Sophie says unexpectedly Dale Dale Gilbertson Jack finds this a little hard to believe but he supposes Dale may have uncovered something I dont know the name Judy thinks hes like many here in Faraway A man who sees much because he sees nothing Not Dale after all Its Henry shes talking about Parkus rises to his feet The heads of the parrot come up revealing four bright eyes Sacred and Profane flutters up to his shoulder and settles there I think our palaver is done Parkus says It must be done Are you ready to go back my friend Yes And I suppose I better take Green little as I want to I dont think hed last long here As you say Jack and Sophie still holding hands are halfway up the rise when Jack realizes Parkus is still standing in the speaking circle with his parrot on his shoulder Arent you coming Parkus shakes his head We go different ways now Jack I may see you again If I survive Jack thinks If any of us survive Meantime go your course And be true Sophie drops another deep curtsey Sai Parkus nods to her and gives Jack Sawyer a little salute Jack turns and leads Sophie back to the ruined hospital tent wondering if he will ever see Speedy Parker again Wendell Green  ace reporter fearless investigator explicator of good and evil to the great unwashed  sits in his former place holding the crumpled foolscap in one hand and the batteries in the other He has resumed muttering and barely looks up when Sophie and Jack approach Youll do your best wont you Sophie asks For her And for you Jack says Listen to me now If this were to end with all of us still standing    and if I were to come back here    He finds he can say no more Hes appalled at his temerity This is a queen after all A queen And hes    what Trying to ask her for a date Perhaps she says looking at him with her steady blue eyes Perhaps Is it a perhaps you want he asks softly Yes He bends and brushes his lips over hers Its brief barely a kiss at all It is also the best kiss of his life I feel like fainting she tells him when he straightens up again Dont joke with me Sophie She takes his hand and presses it against the underswell of her left breast He can feel her heart pounding Is this a joke If she were to run faster shed catch her feet and fall She lets him go but he holds his hand where it is a moment longer palm curved against that springing warmth Id come with you if I could she says I know that He looks at her knowing if he doesnt get moving now right away he never will Its wanting not to leave her but thats not all The truth is that hes never been more frightened in his life He searches for something mundane to bring him back to earth  to slow the pounding of his own heart  and finds the perfect object in the muttering creature that is Wendell Green He drops to one knee Are you ready big boy Want to take a trip on the mighty Mississip Dont Touch Me And then in a nearly poetic rush Fucking Hollywood asshole Believe me if I didnt have to I wouldnt And I plan to wash my hands just as soon as I get the chance He looks up at Sophie and sees all the Judy in her All the beauty in her I love you he says Before she can reply he seizes Wendells hand closes his eyes and flips THIS TIME THERES something that isnt quite silence a lovely white rushing he has heard once before In the summer of  Jack went up way north to Vacaville with an LAPD skydiving club called the PF Flyers It was a dare one of those stupid things you got yourself into as a result of too many beers too late at night and then couldnt get yourself out of again Not with any grace Which was to say not without looking like a chickenshit He expected to be frightened instead he was exalted Yet he had never done it again and now he knows why he had come too close to remembering and some frightened part of him must have known it It was the sound before you pulled the ripcord  that lonely white rushing of the wind past your ears Nothing else to hear but the soft rapid beat of your heart and  maybe  the click in your ears as you swallowed saliva that was in free fall just like the rest of you Pull the ripcord Jack he thinks Time to pull the ripcord or the landings going to be awfully damn hard Now theres a new sound low at first but quickly swelling to a toothrattling bray Fire alarm he thinks and then No its a symphony of fire alarms At the same moment Wendell Greens hand is snatched out of his grip He hears a faint squawking cry as his fellow sky diver is swept away and then theres a smell  Honeysuckle  No its her hair   and Jack gasps against a weight on his chest and his diaphragm a feeling that the wind has been knocked out of him There are hands on him one on his shoulder the other at the small of his back Hair tickling his cheek The sound of alarms The sound of people yelling in confusion Running footfalls that clack and echo jack jack jack are you all right Ask a queen for a date get knocked into the middle of next week he mutters Why is it so dark Has he been blinded Is he ready for that intellectually rewarding and financially remunerative job as an ump at Miller Park Jack A palm smacks his cheek Hard No not blind His eyes are just shut He pops them open and Judy is bending over him her face inches from his Without thinking he closes his left hand in the hair at the nape of her neck brings her face down to his and kisses her She exhales into his mouth  a surprised reverse gasp that inflates his lungs with her electricity  and then kisses him back He has never been kissed with such intensity in his entire life His hand goes to the breast beneath her nightdress and he feels the frenzied gallop of her heart  If she were to run faster shed catch her feet and fall Jack thinks  beneath its firm rise At the same moment her hand slips inside his shirt which has somehow come unbuttoned and tweaks his nipple Its as hard and hot as the slap As she does it her tongue darts into his mouth in one quick plunge there and gone like a bee into a flower He tightens his grip on the nape of her neck and God knows what would have happened next but at that moment something falls over in the corridor with a huge crash of glass and someone screams The voice is high and almost sexless with panic but Jack believes its Ethan Evans the sullen young person from the hall Get back here Stop running goldarnit Of course its Ethan only a graduate of Mount Hebron Lutheran Sunday school would use goldarnit even in extremis Jack pulls away from Judy She pulls away from him They are on the floor Judys nightdress is all the way up to her waist exposing plain white nylon underwear Jacks shirt is open and so are his pants His shoes are still on but on the wrong feet from the feel of them Nearby the glasstopped coffee table is overturned and the journals that were on it are scattered Some seem to have been literally blown out of their bindings More screams from the corridor plus a few cackles and mad ululations Ethan Evans continues to yell at stampeding mental patients and now a woman is yelling as well  Head Nurse Rack perhaps The alarms bray on and on All at once a door bursts open and Wendell Green gallops into the room Behind him is a closet with clothes scattered everywhere the spare items of Dr Spieglemans wardrobe all ahoo In one hand Wendells holding his Panasonic minicorder In the other he has several gleaming tubular objects Jack is willing to bet theyre doubleA Duracells Jacks clothes have been unbuttoned or perhaps blown open but Wendell has fared much worse His shirt is in tatters His belly hangs over a pair of white boxer shorts severely peestained in front He is dragging his brown gabardine slacks by one foot They slide across the carpet like a shed snakeskin And although his socks are on the left one appears to have been turned inside out What did you do Wendell blares Oh you Hollywood son of a bitch WHAT DID YOU DO TO M   He stops His mouth drops open His eyes widen Jack notes that the reporters hair appears to be standing out like the quills on a porcupine Wendell meanwhile is noting Jack Sawyer and Judy Marshall embracing on the glass and paperlittered floor with their clothes disarranged They arent quite in flagrante delicious but if Wendell ever saw two people on the verge dese are dem His mind is whirling and filled with impossible memories his balance is shot his stomach is chugging like a washing machine that has been overloaded with clothes and suds he desperately needs something to hold on to He needs news Even better he needs scandal And here lying in front of him on the floor are both RAPE Wendell bellows at the top of his lungs A mad relieved grin twists up the corners of his mouth SAWYER BEAT ME UP AND NOW HES RAPING A MENTAL PATIENT It doesnt look much like rape to Wendell in all truth but who ever yelled CONSENSUAL SEX at the top of his lungs and attracted any attention Shut that idiot up Judy says She yanks down the hem of her nightgown and prepares to stand Watch out Jack says Broken glass everywhere Im okay she snaps Then turning to Wendell with that perfect fearlessness Fred knew so well Shut up I dont know who you are but quit that bellowing Nobodys being   Wendell backs away from Hollywood Sawyer dragging his pants along with him Why doesnt someone come he thinks Why doesnt someone come before he shoots me or something In his frenzy and near hysteria Wendell has either not registered the alarms and general outcry or believes them to be going on inside his head just a little more false information to go with his absurd memories of a black gunslinger a beautiful woman in a robe and Wendell Green himself crouching in the dust and eating a halfcooked bird like a caveman Keep away from me Sawyer he says backing up with his hands held out in front of him I have an extremely hungry lawyer Caveetemporer you asshole lay one finger on me and he and I will strip you of everything you  OW OW Wendell has stepped on a piece of broken glass Jack sees  probably from one of the prints that formerly decorated the walls and are now decorating the floor He takes one more offbalance lurch backward this time steps on his own trailing slacks and goes sprawling into the leather recliner where Dr Spiegleman presumably sits while quizzing his patients on their troubled childhoods La Rivieres premier muckraker stares at the approaching Neanderthal with wide horrified eyes then throws the minicorder at him Jack sees that its covered with scratches He bats it away RAPE Wendell squeals HES RAPING ONE OF THE LOONIES HES   Jack pops him on the point of the chin pulling the punch just a little at the last moment delivering it with almost scientific force Wendell flops back in Dr Spieglemans recliner eyes rolling up feet twitching as if to some tasty beat that only the semiconscious can truly appreciate The Mad Hungarian couldnt have done better Jack murmurs It occurs to him that Wendell ought to treat himself to a complete neurological workup in the not too distant future His head has put in a hard couple of days The door to the hall bursts open Jack steps in front of the recliner to hide Wendell stuffing his shirt into his pants at some point hes zipped his fly thank God A candy striper pokes her fluffy head into Dr Spieglemans office Although shes probably eighteen her panic makes her look about twelve Whos yelling in here she asks Whos hurt Jack has no idea what to say but Judy manages like a pro It was a patient she says Mr Lackley I think He came in yelled that we were all going to be raped and then ran out again You have to leave at once the candy striper tells them Dont listen to that idiot Ethan And dont use the elevator We think it was an earthquake Right away Jack says crisply and although he doesnt move its good enough for the candy striper she heads out Judy crosses quickly to the door It closes but wont latch The frame has been subtly twisted out of true There was a clock on the wall Jack looks toward it but its fallen facedown to the floor He goes to Judy and takes her by the arms How long was I over there Not long she says but what an exit you made Kapow Did you get anything Her eyes plead with him Enough to know I have to go back to French Landing right away he tells her Enough to know that I love you  that Ill always love you in this world or any other Tyler    is he alive She reverses his grip so she is holding him Sophie did exactly the same thing in Faraway Jack remembers Is my son alive Yes And Im going to get him for you His eye happens on Spieglemans desk which has danced its way into the room and stands with all its drawers open He sees something interesting in one of those drawers and hurries across the carpet crunching on broken glass and kicking aside one of the prints In the top drawer to the left of the desks kneehole is a tape recorder considerably bigger than Wendell Greens trusty Panasonic and a torn piece of brown wrapping paper Jack snatches up the paper first Scrawled across the front in draggling letters hes seen at both Eds Eats and on his own front porch is this Deliver to JUDY MARSHALL also known as SOPHIE There are what appear to be stamps in the upper corner of the torn sheet Jack doesnt need to examine them closely to know that they are really cut from sugar packets and that they were affixed by a dangerous old dodderer named Charles Burnside But the Fishermans identity no longer matters much and Speedy knew it Neither does his location because Jack has an idea Chummy Burnside can flip to a new one pretty much at will But he cant take the real doorway with him The doorway to the furnacelands to Mr Munshun to Ty If Beezer and his pals found that  Jack drops the wrapping paper back into the drawer hits the EJECT button on the tape recorder and pops out the cassette tape inside He sticks it in his pocket and heads for the door Jack He looks back at her Beyond them fire alarms honk and blat lunatics scream and laugh staff runs to and fro Their eyes meet In the clear blue light of Judys regard Jack can almost touch that other world with its sweet smells and strange constellations Is it wonderful over there As wonderful as in my dreams Its wonderful he tells her And you are too Hang in there okay Halfway down the hallway Jack comes upon a nasty sight Ethan Evans the young man who once had Wanda Kinderling as his Sunday school teacher has laid hold of a disoriented old woman by her fat upper arms and is shaking her back and forth The old womans frizzy hair flies around her head Shut up young Mr Evans is shouting at her Shut up you crazy old cow Youre not going anywhere except back to your dadblame room Something about his sneer makes it obvious that even now with the world turned upside down young Mr Evans is enjoying both his power to command and his Christian duty to brutalize This is only enough to make Jack angry What infuriates him is the look of terrified incomprehension on the old womans face It makes him think of boys he once lived with long ago in a place called the Sunlight Home It makes him think of Wolf Without pausing or so much as breaking stride they have entered the endgame phase of the festivities now and somehow he knows it Jack drives his fist into young Mr Evanss temple That worthy lets go of his plump and squawking victim strikes the wall then slides down it his eyes wide and dazed Either you didnt listen in Sunday school or Kinderlings wife taught you the wrong lessons Jack says You    hit    me    young Mr Evans whispers He finishes his slow dive splaylegged on the hallway floor halfway between the Records Annex and Ambulatory Ophthalmology Abuse another patient  this one the one I was just talking to any of them  and Ill do a lot more than that Jack promises young Mr Evans Then hes down the stairs taking them two at a time not noticing a handful of johnnyclad patients who stare at him with expressions of puzzled halffearful wonder They look at him as if at a vision who passes them in an envelope of light some wonder as brilliant as it is mysterious Ten minutes later long after Judy Marshall has walked composedly back to her room without professional help of any kind the alarms cut off An amplified voice  perhaps even Dr Spieglemans own mother wouldnt have recognized it as her boys  begins to blare from the overhead speakers At this unexpected roar patients who had pretty much calmed down begin to shriek and cry all over again The old woman whose mistreatment so angered Jack Sawyer is crouched below the admissions counter with her hands over her head muttering something about the Russians and Civil Defense THE EMERGENCY IS OVER Spiegleman assures his cast and crew THERE IS NO FIRE PLEASE REPORT TO THE COMMON ROOMS ON EACH FLOOR THIS IS DR SPIEGLEMAN AND I REPEAT THAT THE EMERGENCY IS OVER Here comes Wendell Green weaving his way slowly toward the stairwell rubbing his chin gently with one hand He sees young Mr Evans and offers him a helping hand For a moment it looks as though Wendell may be pulled over himself but then young Mr Evans gets his buttocks against the wall and manages to gain his feet THE EMERGENCY IS OVER I REPEAT THE EMERGENCY IS OVER NURSES ORDERLIES AND DOCTORS PLEASE ESCORT ALL PATIENTS TO THE COMMON ROOMS ON EACH FLOOR Young Mr Evans eyes the purple bruise rising on Wendells chin Wendell eyes the purple bruise rising on the temple of young Mr Evans Sawyer young Mr Evans asks Sawyer Wendell confirms Bastard sucker punched me young Mr Evans confides Son of a bitch came up behind me Wendell says The Marshall woman He had her down He lowers his voice He was getting ready to rape her Young Mr Evanss whole manner says he is sorrowful but not surprised Something ought to be done Wendell says You got that right People ought to be told Gradually the old fire returns to Wendells eyes People will be told By him Because that is what he does by God He tells people Yeah young Mr Evans says He doesnt care as much as Wendell does  he lacks Wendells burning commitment  but theres one person he will tell One person who deserves to be comforted in her lonely hours who has been left on her own Mount of Olives One person who will drink up the knowledge of Jack Sawyers evil like the very waters of life This kind of behavior cannot just be swept under the rug Wendell says No way young Mr Evans agrees No way Jos Jack has barely cleared the gates of French County Lutheran when his cell phone tweets He thinks of pulling over to take the call hears the sound of approaching fire engines and decides for once to risk driving and talking at the same time He wants to be out of the area before the local fire brigade shows up and slows him down He flips the little Nokia open Sawyer Where the fuck are you Beezer St Pierre bellows Man I been hittin redial so hard I damn near punched it off the phone Ive been    But theres no way he can finish that not and stay within shouting distance of the truth that is Or maybe there is I guess I got into one of those dead zones where the cell phone just doesnt pick up   Never mind the science lesson chum Get your ass over here right now The actual address is  Nailhouse Row  its County Road DoubleO just south of Chase Its the babyshit brown twostory on the corner I can find it Jack says and steps down a little harder on the Rams gas pedal Im on my way now Whats your twenty man Still Arden but Im rolling I can be there in maybe half an hour Fuck There is an alarming crashrattle in Jacks ear as somewhere on Nailhouse Row Beezer slams his fist against something Probably the nearest wall The fucks wrong with you man Mouse is goin down I mean fast Were doin our best  those of us whore still here  but he is goin down Beezer is panting and Jack thinks hes trying not to cry The thought of Armand St Pierre in that particular state is alarming Jack looks at the Rams speedometer sees its touching seventy and eases off a tad He wont help anybody by getting himself greased in a road wreck between Arden and Centralia What do you mean those of us who are still here Never mind just get your butt down here if you want to talk to Mouse And he sure wants to talk to you because he keeps sayin your name Beezer lowers his voice When he aint just ravin his ass off that is Docs doing his best  me and Bear Girl too  but were shovelin shit against the tide here Tell him to hold on Jack says Fuck that man  tell him yourself Theres a rattling sound in Jacks ear the faint murmuring of voices Then another voice one which hardly sounds human speaks in his ear Got to hurry    got to get over here man Thing    bit me I can feel it in there Like acid Hold on Mouse Jack says His fingers are dead white on the telephone He wonders that the case doesnt simply crack in his grip Ill be there fast as I can Better be Others    already forgot Not me Mouse chuckles The sound is ghastly beyond belief a whiff straight out of an open grave I got    the memory serum you know Its eatin me up    eatin me alive    but I got it Theres the rustling sound of the phone changing hands again then a new voice A womans Jack assumes its Bear Girl You got them moving she says You brought it to this Dont let it be for nothing There is a click in his ear Jack tosses the cell phone onto the seat and decides that maybe seventy isnt too fast after all A few minutes later they seem like very long minutes to Jack hes squinting against the glare of the sun on Tamarack Creek From here he can almost see his house and Henrys Henry Jack thumps the side of his thumb lightly against his breast pocket and hears the rattle of the cassette tape he took from the machine in Spieglemans office Theres not much reason to turn it over to Henry now given what Potter told him last night and what Mouse is holding on to tell him today this tape and the  tape have been rendered more or less redundant Besides hes got to hurry to Nailhouse Row Theres a train getting ready to leave the station and Mouse Baumann is very likely going to be on it And yet    Im worried about him Jack says softly Even a blind man could see Im worried about Henry The brilliant summer sun now sliding down the afternoon side of the sky reflects off the creek and sends shimmers of light dancing across his face Each time this light crosses his eyes they seem to burn Henry isnt the only one Jacks worried about either Hes got a bad feeling about all of his new French Landing friends and acquaintances from Dale Gilbertson and Fred Marshall right down to such bit players as old Steamy McKay an elderly gent who makes his living shining shoes outside the public library and Ardis Walker who runs the ramshackle bait shop down by the river In his imagination all these people now seem made of glass If the Fisherman decides to sing high C theyll vibrate and then shatter to powder Only its not really the Fisherman hes worried about anymore This is a case he reminds himself Even with all the Territories weirdness thrown in its still a case and its not the first one youve ever been on where everything suddenly started to seem too big Where all the shadows seemed to be too long True enough but usually that funhouse sense of false perspective fades away once he starts to get a handle on things This time its worse and worse by far He knows why too The Fishermans long shadow is a thing called Mr Munshun an immortal talent scout from some other plane of existence Nor is even that the end because Mr Munshun also casts a shadow A red one Abbalah Jack mutters Abbalahdoon and Mr Munshun and the Crow Gorg just three old pals walking together on nights Plutonian shore For some reason this makes him think of the Walrus and the Carpenter from Alice What was it they took for a walk in the moonlight Clams Mussels Jacks damned if he can remember although one line surfaces and resonates in his mind spoken in his mothers voice The time has come the Walrus said to talk of many things The abbalah is presumably hanging out in his court the part of him that isnt imprisoned in Speedys Dark Tower that is but the Fisherman and Mr Munshun could be anywhere Do they know Jack Sawyer has been meddling Of course they do By today that is common knowledge Might they try to slow him down by doing something nasty to one of his friends A certain blind sportscasterheadbangerbebopper for instance Yes indeed And now perhaps because hes been sensitized to it he can once more feel that nasty pulse coming out of the southwestern landscape the one he sensed when he flipped over for the first time in his adult life When the road curves southeast he almost loses it Then when the Ram points its nose southwest again the poisonous throb regains strength beating into his head like the onset of a migraine headache Thats Black House you feel only its not a house not really Its a wormhole in the apple of existence leading all the way down into the furnacelands Its a door Maybe it was only standing ajar before today before Beezer and his pals turned up there but now its wide open and letting in one hell of a draft Ty needs to be brought back yes    but that door needs to be shut as well Before God knows what awful things come snarling through Jack abruptly swings the Ram onto Tamarack Road The tires scream His seat belt locks and for a moment he thinks the truck may overturn It stays up though and he goes flying toward Norway Valley Road Mouse will just have to hang on a little bit longer hes not going to leave Henry way out here on his own His pal doesnt know it but hes going on a little field trip to Nailhouse Row Until this situation stabilizes it seems to Jack that the buddy system is very much in order Which would have been all well and good if Henry had been at home but hes not Elvena Morton dust mop in hand comes in response to Jacks repeated jabbing at the doorbell Hes been over at KDCU doing commercials Elvena says Dropped him off myself I dont know why he doesnt just do them in his studio here something about the sound effects I think he might have said Im surprised he didnt tell you that The bitch of it is Henry did Cousin Buddys Rib Crib The old ball and chain Beautiful downtown La Riviere All that He even told Jack that Elvena Morton was going to drive him A few things have happened to Jack since that conversation  hes reencountered his old childhood friend hes fallen in love with Judy Marshalls Twinner and just by the way hes been filled in on your basic Secret of All Existence  but none of that keeps him from turning his left hand into a fist and then slamming himself directly between the eyes with it Given how fast things are now moving making this needless detour strikes him as an almost unforgivable lapse Mrs Morton is regarding him with wideeyed alarm Are you going to be picking him up Mrs Morton No hes going for a drink with someone from ESPN Henry said the fellow would bring him back afterward She lowers her voice to the timbre of confidentiality at which secrets are somehow best communicated Henry didnt come right out and say so but I think there may be big things ahead for George Rathbun Verry big things Badger Barrage going national Jack wouldnt be entirely surprised but he has no time to be delighted for Henry now He hands Mrs Morton the cassette tape mostly so he wont feel this was an entirely wasted trip Leave this for him where    He stops Mrs Morton is looking at him with knowing amusement Where hell be sure to see it is what Jack almost said Another mental miscue Bigcity detective indeed Ill leave it by the soundboard in his studio she says Hell find it there Jack maybe its none of my business but you dont look all right Youre very pale and Id swear youve lost ten pounds since last week Also    She looks a bit embarrassed Your shoes are on the wrong feet So they are He makes the necessary change standing first on one foot and then the other Its been a tough fortyeight hours but Im hanging in there Mrs M Its the Fisherman business isnt it He nods And I have to go The fat as they say is in the fire He turns reconsiders turns back Leave him a message on the kitchen tape recorder would you Tell him to call me on my cell Just as soon as he gets in Then one thought leading to another he points to the unmarked cassette tape in her hand Dont play that all right Mrs Morton looks shocked Id never do such a thing It would be like opening someone elses mail Jack nods and gives her a scrap of a smile Good Is it    him on the tape Is it the Fisherman Yes Jack says Its him And there are worse things waiting he thinks but doesnt say Worse things by far He hurries back to his truck not quite running Twenty minutes later Jack parks in front of the babyshit brown twostory at  Nailhouse Row Nailhouse Row and the dirty snarl of streets around it strike him as unnaturally silent under the sun of this hot summer afternoon A mongrel dog it is in fact the old fellow we saw in the doorway of the Nelson Hotel just last night goes limping across the intersection of Ames and County Road Oo but thats about the extent of the traffic Jack has an unpleasant vision of the Walrus and the Carpenter toddling along the east bank of the Mississippi with the hypnotized residents of Nailhouse Row following along behind them Toddling along toward the fire And the cooking pot He takes two or three deep breaths trying to steady himself Not far out of town  close to the road leading to Eds Eats in fact  that nasty buzzing in his head peaked turning into something like a dark scream For a few moments there it was so strong Jack wondered if he was perhaps going to drive right off the road and he slowed the Ram to forty Then blessedly it began to move around toward the back of his head and fade He didnt see the NO TRESPASSING sign that marks the overgrown road leading to Black House didnt even look for it but he knew it was there The question is whether or not hell be able to approach it when the time comes without simply exploding Come on he tells himself No time for this shit He gets out of the truck and starts up the cracked cement walk Theres a fading hopscotch diagram there and Jack swerves to avoid it without even thinking knowing its one of the few remaining artifacts which testify that a little person named Amy St Pierre once briefly trod the boards of existence The porch steps are dry and splintery Hes vilely thirsty and thinks Man Id kill for a glass of water or a nice cold  The door flies open cracking against the side of the house like a pistol shot in the sunny silence and Beezer comes running out Christ almighty I didnt think you were ever gonna get here Looking into Beezers alarmed agonized eyes Jack realizes that he will never tell this guy that he might be able to find Black House without Mouses help that thanks to his time in the Territories he has a kind of range finder in his head No not even if they live the rest of their lives as close friends the kind who usually tell each other everything The Beez has suffered like Job and he doesnt need to find out that his friends agony may have been in vain Is he still alive Beezer By an inch Maybe an inch and a quarter Its just me and Doc and Bear Girl now Sonny and Kaiser Bill got scared ran off like a couple of whipped dogs March your boots in here sunshine Not that Beezer gives Jack any choice he grabs him by the shoulder and hauls him into the little twostory on Nailhouse Row like luggage ONE MORE  says the guy from ESPN It sounds more like an order than a request and although Henry cant see the fellow he knows this particular homeboy never played a sport in his life pro or otherwise He has the lardy slightly oily aroma of someone who has been overweight almost from the jump Sports is perhaps his compensation with the power to still memories of clothes bought in the Husky section at Sears and all those childhood rhymes like Fattyfatty twobyfour had to do it on the floor couldnt get through the bathroom door His name is Penniman Just like Little Richard he told Henry when they shook hands at the radio station Famous rock n roller from back in the fifties Maybe you remember him Vaguely Henry said as if he hadnt at one time owned every single Little Richard had ever put out I believe he was one of the Founding Fathers Penniman laughed uproariously and in that laugh Henry glimpsed a possible future for himself But was it a future he wanted People laughed at Howard Stern too and Howard Stern was a dork One more drink Penniman repeats now They are in the bar of the Oak Tree Inn where Penniman has tipped the bartender five bucks to switch the TV from bowling on ABC to ESPN even though theres nothing on at this hour of the day except golf tips and bass fishing One more drink just to seal the deal But they dont have a deal and Henry isnt sure he wants to make one Going national with George Rathbun as part of the ESPN radio package should be attractive and he doesnt have any serious problem with changing the name of the show from Badger Barrage to ESPN Sports Barrage  it would still focus primarily on the central and northern areas of the country  but    But what Before he can even get to work on the question he smells it again My Sin the perfume his wife used to wear on certain evenings when she wanted to send a certain signal Lark was what he used to call her on those certain evenings when the room was dark and they were both blind to everything but scents and textures and each other Lark You know I think Im going to pass on that drink Henry says Got some work to do at home But Im going to think over your offer And I mean seriously Ahahah Penniman says and Henry can tell from certain minute disturbances in the air that the man is shaking a finger beneath his nose Henry wonders how Penniman would react if Henry suddenly darted his head forward and bit off the offending digit at the second knuckle If Henry showed him a little Coulee Country hospitality Fishermanstyle How loud would Penniman yell As loud as Little Richard before the instrumental break of Tutti Frutti perhaps Or not quite as loud as that Cant go till Im ready to take you Mr Im Fat But It No Longer Matters tells him Im your ride yknow Hes on his fourth gimlet and his words are slightly slurred My friend Henry thinks Id poke a ferret up my ass before Id get into a car with you at the wheel Actually I can Henry says pleasantly Nick Avery the bartender is having a kickass afternoon the fat guy slipped him five to change the TV channel and the blind guy slipped him five to call Skeeters Taxi while the fat guy was in the bathroom making a little room Huh I said Actually I can Bartender Hes outside sir Avery tells him Pulled up two minutes ago There is a hefty creak as Penniman turns on his bar stool Henry cant see the mans frown as he takes in the taxi now idling in the hotel turnaround but he can sense it Listen Henry Penniman says I think you may lack a certain understanding of your current situation There are stars in the firmament of sports radio damned right there are  people like the Fabulous Sports Babe and Tony Kornheiser make six figures a year just in speaking fees six figures easy  but you aint there yet That door is currently closed to you But I my friend am one helluva doorman The upshot is that if I say we ought to have one more drink then   Bartender Henry says quietly then shakes his head I cant just call you bartender it might work for Humphrey Bogart but it doesnt work for me Whats your name Nick Avery sir The last word comes out automatically but Avery never would have used it when speaking to the other one never in a million years Both guys tipped him five but the one in the dark glasses is the gent Its got nothing to do with him being blind its just something he is Nick who else is at the bar Avery looks around In one of the back booths two men are drinking beer In the hall a bellman is on the phone At the bar itself no one at all except for these two guys  one slim cool and blind the other fat sweaty and starting to be pissed off No one sir Theres not a    lady Lark hes almost said Theres not a lark No Listen here Penniman says and Henry thinks hes never heard anyone so unlike Little Richard Penniman in his entire life This guy is whiter than Moby Dick    and probably about the same size Weve got a lot more to discuss here Loh more tdishcush is how it comes out Unless that is  Unlesh  youre trying to let me know youre not interested Never in a million years Pennimans voice says to Henry Leydens educated ears Were talking about putting a money machine in your living room sweetheart your very own private ATM and there aint no way in hell youre going to turn that down Nick you dont smell perfume Something very light and oldfashioned My Sin perhaps A flabby hand falls on Henrys shoulder like a hotwater bottle The sin old buddy would be for you to refuse to have another drink with me Even a blindman could see th   Suggest you get your hand off him Avery says and perhaps Pennimans ears arent entirely deaf to nuance because the hand leaves Henrys shoulder at once Then another hand comes in its place higher up It touches the back of Henrys neck in a cold caress thats there and then gone Henry draws in breath The smell of perfume comes with it Usually scents fade after a period of exposure as the receptors that caught them temporarily deaden Not this time though Not this smell No perfume Henry almost pleads The touch of her hand on his neck he can dismiss as a tactile hallucination But his nose never betrays him Never until now anyway Im sorry Avery says I can smell beer    peanuts    this mans gin and his aftershave    Henry nods The lights above the backbar slide across the dark lenses of his shades as he slips gracefully off his stool I think you want another drink my friend Penniman says in what he no doubt believes to be a tone of polite menace One more drink just to celebrate and then Ill take you home in my Lexus Henry smells his wifes perfume Hes sure of it And he seemed to feel the touch of his wifes hand on the back of his neck Yet suddenly its skinny little Morris Rosen he finds himself thinking about  Morris who wanted him to listen to Where Did Our Love Go as done by Dirtysperm And of course for Henry to play it in his Wisconsin Rat persona Morris Rosen who has more integrity in one of his nailchewed little fingers than this bozo has got in his entire body He puts a hand on Pennimans forearm He smiles into Pennimans unseen face and feels the muscles beneath his palm relax Penniman has decided hes going to get his way Again You take my drink Henry says pleasantly add it to your drink and then stick them both up your fat and bepimpled ass If you need something to hold them in place why you can stick your job up there right after them Henry turns and walks briskly toward the door orienting himself with his usual neat precision and holding one hand out in front of him as an insurance policy Nick Avery has broken into spontaneous applause but Henry barely hears this and Penniman he has already dismissed from his mind What occupies him is the smell of My Sin perfume It fades a little as he steps out into the afternoon heat    but is that not an amorous sigh he hears beside his left ear The sort of sigh his wife sometimes made just before falling asleep after love His Rhoda His Lark Hello the taxi he calls from the curb beneath the awning Right here buddy  whatre you blind As a bat Henry agrees and walks toward the sound of the voice Hell go home hell put his feet up hell have a glass of tea and then hell listen to the damned  tape That as yet unperformed chore may be whats causing his current case of the heebiejeebies and shakyshivers knowing that he must sit in darkness and listen to the voice of a childkilling cannibal Surely that must be it because theres no reason to be afraid of his Lark is there If she were to return  to return and haunt him  she would surely haunt with love Wouldnt she Yes he thinks and lowers himself into the taxis stifling back seat Where to buddy Norway Valley Road Henry says Its a white house with blue trim standing back from the road Youll see it not long after you cross the creek Henry settles back in the seat and turns his troubled face toward the open window French Landing feels strange to him today    fraught Like something that has slipped and slipped until it is now on the verge of simply falling off the table and smashing to pieces on the floor Say that she has come back Say that she has If its love shes come with why does the smell of her perfume make me so uneasy So almost revolted And why was her touch her imagined touch he assures himself so unpleasant Why was her touch so cold After the dazzle of the day the living room of Beezers crib is so dark that at first Jack cant make out anything Then when his eyes adjust a little he sees why blankets  a double thickness from the look  have been hung over both of the livingroom windows and the door to the other downstairs room almost certainly the kitchen has been closed He cant stand the light Beezer says He keeps his voice low so it wont carry across to the far side of the room where the shape of a man lies on a couch Another man is kneeling beside him Maybe the dog that bit him was rabid Jack says He doesnt believe it Beezer shakes his head decisively It isnt a phobic reaction Doc says its physiological Where light falls on him his skin starts to melt You ever hear of anything like that No And Jack has never smelled anything like the stench in this room either Theres the buzz of not one but two table fans and he can feel the crossdraft but that stink is too gluey to move Theres the reek of spoiled meat  of gangrene in torn flesh  but Jack has smelled that before Its the other smell thats getting to him something like blood and funeral flowers and feces all mixed up together He makes a gagging noise cant help it and Beezer looks at him with a certain impatient sympathy Bad yeah I know But its like the monkey house at the zoo man  you get used to it after a while The swing door to the other room opens and a trim little woman with shoulderlength blond hair comes through Shes carrying a bowl When the light strikes the figure lying on the couch Mouse screams Its a horribly thick sound as if the mans lungs have begun to liquefy Something  maybe smoke maybe steam  starts to rise up from the skin of his forehead Hold on Mouse the kneeling man says Its Doc Before the kitchen door swings all the way shut again Jack is able to read whats pasted to his battered black bag Somewhere in America there may be another medical man sporting a STEPPENWOLF RULES bumper sticker on the side of his physicians bag but probably not in Wisconsin The woman kneels beside Doc who takes a cloth from the basin wrings it out and places it on Mouses forehead Mouse gives a shaky groan and begins to shiver all over Water runs down his cheeks and into his beard The beard seems to be coming out in mangy patches Jack steps forward telling himself he will get used to the smell sure he will Maybe its even true In the meantime he wishes for a little of the Vicks VapoRub most LAPD homicide detectives carry in their glove compartments as a matter of course A dab under each nostril would be very welcome right now Theres a sound system scruffy and a pair of speakers in the corners of the room huge but no television Stacked wooden crates filled with books line every wall without a door or a window in it making the space seem even smaller than it is almost cryptlike Jack has a touch of claustrophobia in his makeup and now this circuit warms up increasing his discomfort Most of the books seem to deal with religion and philosophy  he sees Descartes C S Lewis the BhagavadGita Steven Averys Tenets of Existence  but theres also a lot of fiction books on beer making and on top of one giant speaker Albert Goldmans trash tome about Elvis Presley On the other speaker is a photograph of a young girl with a splendid smile freckles and oceans of reddishblond hair Seeing the child who drew the hopscotch grid out front makes Jack Sawyer feel sick with anger and sorrow Otherworldly beings and causes there may be but theres also a sick old fuck prowling around who needs to be stopped Hed do well to remember that Bear Girl makes a space for Jack in front of the couch moving gracefully even though shes on her knees and still holding the bowl Jack sees that in it are two more wet cloths and a heap of melting ice cubes The sight of them makes him thirstier than ever He takes one and pops it into his mouth Then he turns his attention to Mouse A plaid blanket has been pulled up to his neck His forehead and upper cheeks  the places not covered by his decaying beard  are pasty His eyes are closed His lips are drawn back to show teeth of startling whiteness Is he   Jack begins and then Mouses eyes open Whatever Jack meant to ask leaves his head entirely Around the hazel irises Mouses eyes have gone an uneasy shifting scarlet Its as if the man is looking into a terrible radioactive sunset From the inner corners of his eyes some sort of black scum is oozing The Book of Philosophical Transformation addresses most current dialectics Mouse says speaking mellowly and lucidly and Machiavelli also speaks to these questions Jack can almost picture him in a lecture hall Until his teeth begin to chatter that is Mouse its Jack Sawyer No recognition in those weird redandhazel eyes The black gunk at the corners of them seems to twitch however as if it is somehow sentient Listening to him Its Hollywood Beezer murmurs The cop Remember One of Mouses hands lies on the plaid blanket Jack takes it and stifles a cry of surprise when it closes over his with amazing strength Its hot too As hot as a biscuit just out of the oven Mouse lets out a long gasping sigh and the stench is fetid  bad meat decayed flowers Hes rotting Jack thinks Rotting from the inside out Oh Christ help me through this Christ may not but the memory of Sophie might Jack tries to fix her eyes in his memory that lovely level clear blue gaze Listen Mouse says Im listening Mouse seems to gather himself Beneath the blanket his body shivers in a loose uncoordinated way that Jack guesses is next door to a seizure Somewhere a clock is ticking Somewhere a dog is barking A boat hoots on the Mississippi Other than these sounds all is silence Jack can remember only one other such suspension of the worlds business in his entire life and that was when he was in a Beverly Hills hospital waiting for his mother to finish the long business of dying Somewhere Ty Marshall is waiting to be rescued Hoping to be rescued at least Somewhere there are Breakers hard at work trying to destroy the axle upon which all existence spins Here is only this eternal room with its feeble fans and noxious vapors Mouses eyes close then open again They fix upon the newcomer and Jack is suddenly sure some great truth is going to be confided The ice cube is gone from his mouth Jack supposes he crunched it up and swallowed it without even realizing but he doesnt dare take another Go on buddy Doc says You get it out and then Ill load you up with another hypo of dope The good stuff Maybe youll sleep Mouse pays no heed His mutating eyes hold Jacks His hand holds Jacks tightening still more Jack can almost feel the bones of his fingers grinding together Dont    go out and buy topoftheline equipment Mouse says and sighs out another excruciatingly foul breath from his rotting lungs Dont     Most people give up brewing after    a year or two Even dedicated    dedicated hobbyists Making beer is not    is not for pussies Jack looks around at Beezer who looks back impassively Hes in and out Be patient Wait on him Mouses grip tightens yet more then loosens just as Jack is deciding he can take it no longer Get a big pot Mouse advises him His eyes bulge The reddish shadows come and go come and go fleeting across the curved landscape of his corneas and Jack thinks Thats its shadow The shadow of the Crimson King Mouse has already got one foot in its court Five gallons    at least You find the best ones are in    seafood supply stores And for a fermentation vessel    plastic watercooler jugs are good    theyre lighter than glass and    Im burning up Christ Beez Im burning up Fuck this Im going to shoot it to him Doc says and snaps open his bag Beezer grabs his arm Not yet Bloody tears begin to slip out of Mouses eyes The black goo seems to be forming into tiny tendrils These reach greedily downward as if trying to catch the moisture and drink it Fermentation lock and stopper Mouse whispers Thomas Merton is shit never let anyone tell you different No real thought there You have to let the gases escape while keeping dust out Jerry Garcia wasnt God Kurt Cobain wasnt God The perfume he smells is not that of his dead wife Hes caught the eye of the King Gorgtenabbalah eeleelee The opopanax is dead long live the opopanax Jack leans more deeply into Mouses smell Whos smelling perfume Whos caught the eye of the King The mad King the bad King the sad King Ringadingding all hail the King Mouse whos caught the eye of the King Doc says I thought you wanted to know about   Who Jack has no idea why this seems important to him but it does Is it something someone has said to him recently Was it Dale Tansy Was it God save us Wendell Green Racking cane and hose Mouse says confidentially Thats what you need when the fermentations done And you cant put beer in screwtop bottles You   Mouse turns his head away from Jack nestles it cozily in the hollow of his shoulder opens his mouth and vomits Bear Girl screams The vomit is pusyellow and speckled with moving black bits like the crud in the corners of Mouses eyes It is alive Beezer leaves the room in a hurry not quite running and Jack shades Mouse from the brief glare of kitchen sunlight as best he can The hand clamped on Jacks loosens a little more Jack turns to Doc Do you think hes going Doc shakes his head Passed out again Poor old Mousie aint getting off that easy He gives Jack a grim haunted look This better be worth it Mr Policeman Cause if it aint Im gonna replumb your sink Beezer comes back with a huge bundle of rags and hes put on a pair of green kitchen gloves Not speaking he mops up the pool of vomit between Mouses shoulder and the backrest of the couch The black specks have ceased moving and thats good To have not seen them moving in the first place would have been even better The vomit Jack notices with dismay has eaten into the couchs worn fabric like acid Im going to pull the blanket down for a second or two Doc says and Bear Girl gets up at once still holding the bowl with the melting ice She goes to one of the bookshelves and stands there with her back turned trembling Doc is this something I really need to see I think maybe it is I dont think you know what youre dealing with even now Doc takes hold of the blanket and eases it out from beneath Mouses limp hand Jack sees that more of the black stuff has begun to ooze from beneath the dying mans fingernails Remember that this happened only a couple of hours ago Mr Policeman He pulls the blanket down Standing with her back to them Susan Bear Girl Osgood faces the great works of Western philosophy and begins to cry silently Jack tries to hold back his scream and cannot Henry pays off the taxi goes into his house takes a deep and soothing breath of the airconditioned cool There is a faint aroma  sweet  and he tells himself its just freshcut flowers one of Mrs Mortons specialties He knows better but wants no more to do with ghosts just now He is actually feeling better and he supposes he knows why it was telling the ESPN guy to take his job and shove it Nothing more apt to make a fellows day especially when the fellow in question is gainfully employed possessed of two credit cards that are nowhere near the maxout point and has a pitcher of cold iced tea in the fridge Henry heads kitchenward now making his way down the hall with one hand held out before him testing the air for obstacles and displacements Theres no sound but the whisper of the air conditioner the hum of the fridge the clack of his heels on the hardwood       and a sigh An amorous sigh Henry stands where he is for a moment then turns cautiously Is the sweet aroma a little stronger now especially facing back in this direction toward the living room and the front door He thinks yes And its not flowers no sense fooling himself about that As always the nose knows Thats the aroma of My Sin Rhoda he says and then lower Lark No answer Of course not Hes just having the heebiejeebies thats all those worldfamous shakyshivers and why not Because Im the sheik baby Henry says The Sheik the Shake the Shook No smells No sexy sighs And yet hes haunted by the idea of his wife back in the living room standing there in perfumed cerements of the grave watching him silently as he came in and passed blindly before her His Lark come back from Noggin Mound Cemetery for a little visit Maybe to listen to the latest Slobberbone CD Quit it he says softly Quit it you dope He goes into his big wellorganized kitchen On his way through the door he slaps a button on the panel there without even thinking about it Mrs Mortons voice comes from the overhead speaker which is so hightech she might almost be in the room Jack Sawyer was by and he dropped off another tape he wants you to listen to He said it was    you know that man That bad man Bad man right Henry murmurs opening the refrigerator and enjoying the blast of cold air His hand goes unerringly to one of three cans of Kingsland Lager stored inside the door Never mind the iced tea Both of the tapes are in your studio by the soundboard Also Jack wanted you to call him on his cell phone Mrs Mortons voice takes on a faintly lecturing tone If you do speak to him I hope you tell him to be careful And be careful yourself A pause Also dont forget to eat supper Its all ready to go Second shelf of the fridge on your left Nag nag nag Henry says but hes smiling as he opens his beer He goes to the telephone and dials Jacks number On the seat of the Dodge Ram parked in front of  Nailhouse Row Jacks cell phone comes to life This time theres no one in the cab to be annoyed by its tiny but penetrating tweet The cellular customer you are trying to reach is currently not answering Please try your call again later Henry hangs up goes back to the doorway and pushes another button on the panel there The voices that deliver the time and temperature are all versions of his own but hes programmed a random shuffle pattern into the gadget so he never knows which one hes going to get This time its the Wisconsin Rat screaming crazily into the sunny airconditioned silence of his house which has never felt so far from town as it does today Times four twentytwo PM Outside temperatures eightytwo Inside temperatures seventy What the hell do you care What the hell does anyone care Chew it up eat it up wash it down it aaall    comes out the same place Right Henry thumbs the button again silencing the Rats trademark cry How did it get late so fast God wasnt it just noon For that matter wasnt he just young twenty years old and so full of spunk it was practically coming out of his ears What  That sigh comes again derailing his mostly selfmocking train of thought A sigh Really More likely just the air conditioners compressor cutting off He can tell himself that anyway He can tell himself that if he wants to Is anyone here Henry asks There is a tremble in his voice that he hates an old mans palsied quaver Is anyone in the house with me For a terrible second he is almost afraid something will answer Nothing does  of course nothing does  and he swallows half the can of beer in three long gulps He decides hell go back into the living room and read for a little while Maybe Jack will call Maybe hell get himself a little more under control once he has a little fresh alcohol in his system And maybe the world will end in the next five minutes he thinks That way youll never have to deal with the voice on those damned tapes waiting in the studio Those damned tapes lying there on the soundboard like unexploded bombs Henry walks slowly back down the hall to the living room with one hand held out before him telling himself hes not afraid not a bit afraid of touching his wifes dead face Jack Sawyer has seen a lot hes traveled to places where you cant rent from Avis and the water tastes like wine but hes never encountered anything like Mouse Baumanns leg Or rather the pestilential apocalyptic horror show that was Mouse Baumanns leg Jacks first impulse once hes got himself back under something like control is to upbraid Doc for taking off Mouses pants Jack keeps thinking of sausages and how the casing forces them to keep their shape even after the fry pans sizzling on a redhot burner This is an undoubtedly stupid comparison primo stupido but the human mind under pressure puts on some pretty odd jinks and jumps Theres still the shape of a leg there  sort of  but the flesh has spread away from the bone The skin is almost completely gone melted to a runny substance that looks like a mixture of milk and bacon fat The interwoven mat of muscle beneath what remains of the skin is sagging and undergoing the same cataclysmic metamorphosis The infected leg is in a kind of undisciplined motion as the solid becomes liquid and the liquid sizzles relentlessly into the couch upon which Mouse is lying Along with the almost insupportable stench of decay Jack can smell scorching cloth and melting fabric Poking out of this spreading vaguely leglike mess is a foot that looks remarkably undamaged If I wanted to I could pull it right off    just like a squash off a vine The thought gets to him in a way the sight of the grievously wounded leg hasnt quite been able to and for a moment Jack can only bow his head gagging and trying not to vomit down the front of his shirt What perhaps saves him is a hand on his back Its Beezer offering what comfort he can The rowdy color has completely left the Beezs face He looks like a motorcyclist come back from the grave in an urban myth You see Doc is asking and his voice seems to come from a great distance This aint the chicken pox my friend although it looked a little like that while it was still getting cranked up Hes already exhibiting red spots on his left leg    his belly    his balls Thats pretty much what the skin around the bite looked like when we first got him back here just some redness and swelling I thought Shit aint nothin to this I got enough Zithromax to put this on the run before sundown Well you see what good the Zithro did You see what good anything did Its eating through the couch and Im guessing that when it finishes with the couch itll go right to work on the floor This shit is hungry So was it worth it Hollywood I guess only you and Mouse know the answer to that He still knows where the house is Beezer says Me I dont have a clue even though we just came from there You either Do you Doc shakes his head But Mouse he knows Susie honey Doc says to Bear Girl Bring another blanket would you This ones damn near et through Bear Girl goes willingly enough Jack gets to his feet His legs are rubbery but they hold him Shield him he tells Doc Im going out to the kitchen If I dont get a drink Im going to die Jack takes on water directly from the sink swallowing until a spike plants itself in the center of his forehead and he belches like a horse Then he just stands there looking out into Beezer and Bear Girls backyard A neat little swing set has been planted there in the weedy desolation It hurts Jack to look at it but he looks anyway After the lunacy of Mouses leg it seems important to remind himself that hes here for a reason If the reminder hurts so much the better The sun now turning gold as it eases itself down toward the Mississippi glares in his eyes Time hasnt been standing still after all it seems Not outside this little house anyway Outside  Nailhouse Row time actually seems to have sped up Hes haunted by the idea that coming here was as pointless as detouring to Henrys house tormented by the thought that Mr Munshun and his boss the abbalah are running him around like a windup toy with a key in its back while they do their work He can follow that buzz in his head to Black House so why the hell doesnt he just get back in his truck and do it The perfume he smells is not that of his dead wife What does that mean Why does the idea of someone smelling perfume make him so crazy and afraid Beezer knocks on the kitchen door making him jump Jacks eye fixes on a sampler hung over the kitchen table Instead of GOD BLESS OUR HOME it reads HEAVY METAL THUNDER With a carefully stitched HARLEYDAVIDSON beneath Get back in here man the Beez says Hes awake again Henrys on a path in the woods  or maybe its a lane  and something is behind him Each time he turns to see  in this dream he can see but seeing is no blessing  theres a little more of that something back there It appears to be a man in evening dress but the man is frightfully elongated with spike teeth that jut over a smiling red lower lip And he seems  is it possible  to have only one eye The first time Henry looks back the shape is only a milky blur amid the trees The next time he can make out the uneasy dark swim of its coat and a floating red blotch that might be a tie or an ascot Up ahead of him is this things den a stinking hole that only coincidentally looks like a house Its presence buzzes in Henrys head Instead of pine the woods pressing in on either side smell of heavy cloying perfume My Sin Its driving me he thinks with dismay Whatever that thing back there is its driving me like a steer toward the slaughterhouse He thinks of cutting off the lane to his left or right of using the miracle of his new sight to escape through the woods Only there are things there too Dark floating shapes like sooty scarves He can almost see the closest Its some sort of gigantic dog with a long tongue as red as the apparitions tie and bulging eyes Cant let it drive me to the house he thinks I have to get out of this before it can get me there    but how How It comes to him with startling simplicity All he has to do is wake up Because this is a dream This is just a  Its a dream Henry cries out and jerks forward Hes not walking hes sitting sitting in his very own easy chair and pretty soon hes going to have a very wet crotch because he fell asleep with a can of Kingsland Lager balanced there and  But theres no spill because theres no can of beer He feels cautiously to his right and yep there it is on the table with his book a braille edition of Reflections in a Golden Eye He must have put it there before first falling asleep and then falling into that horrible nightmare Except Henrys pretty sure he didnt do any such thing He was holding the book and the beer was between his legs freeing his hands to touch the little upraised dots that tell the story Something very considerately took both the book and the can after he dropped off and put them on the table Something that smells of My Sin perfume The air reeks of it Henry takes a long slow breath with his nostrils flared and mouth tightly sealed shut No he says speaking very clearly I can smell flowers    and rug shampoo    and fried onions from last night Very faint but still there The nose knows All true enough But the smell had been there Its gone now because shes gone but she will be back And suddenly he wants her to come If hes frightened surely its the unknown hes frightened of right Only that and nothing more He doesnt want to be alone here with nothing for company but the memory of that rancid dream And the tapes He has to listen to the tapes He promised Jack Henry gets shakily to his feet and makes his way to the livingroom control panel This time hes greeted by the voice of Henry Shake a mellow fellow if ever there was one Hey there all you hoppin cats and boppin kitties at the tone its sevenfourteen PM Bulova Watch Time Outside the temp is a very cool seventyfive degrees and here in the MakeBelieve Ballroom its a very nifty seventy degrees So why not get off your money grab your honey and make a little magic Sevenfourteen When was the last time he fell asleep for almost three hours in the daytime For that matter when was the last time he had a dream in which he could see The answer to that second question so far as he can remember is never Where was that lane What was the thing behind him What was the place ahead of him for that matter Doesnt matter Henry tells the empty room  if it is empty It was a dream thats all The tapes on the other hand    He doesnt want to listen to them has never wanted to listen to anything any less in his life with the possible exception of Chicago singing Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is but he has to If it might save Ty Marshalls life or the life of even one other child he must Slowly dreading every step Henry Leyden makes his blind way to his studio where two cassettes wait for him on the soundboard In heaven there is no beer Mouse sings in a toneless droning voice His cheeks are now covered with ugly red patches and his nose seems to be sinking sideways into his face like an atoll after an undersea earthquake Thats why we drink it here And when    were gone    from here    our friends will be drinking all the beer Its been like this for hours now philosophical nuggets instructions for the beginning beermaking enthusiast snatches of song The light coming through the blankets over the windows has dimmed appreciably Mouse pauses his eyes closed Then he starts another ditty Hundred bottles of beer on the wall one hundred bottles of beer    if one of those bottles should happen to fall    I have to go Jack says Hes hung in there as well as he can convinced that Mouse is going to give him something but he can wait no longer Somewhere Ty Marshall is waiting for him Hold on Doc says He rummages in his bag and comes out with a hypodermic needle He raises it in the dimness and taps the glass barrel with a fingernail Whats that Doc gives Jack and Beezer a brief grim smile Speed he says and injects it into Mouses arm For a moment theres nothing Then as Jack is opening his mouth again to tell them he has to go Mouses eyes snap wide They are now entirely red  a bright and bleeding red Yet when they turn in his direction Jack knows that Mouse is seeing him Maybe really seeing him for the first time since he got here Bear Girl flees the room trailing a single diminishing phrase behind her No more no more no more no more   Fuck Mouse says in a rusty voice Fuck Im fucked Aint I Beezer touches the top of his friends head briefly but tenderly Yeah man I think you are Can you help us out Bit me once Just once and now    now    His hideous red gaze turns to Doc Can barely see you Fuckin eyes are all weird Youre going down Doc says Aint gonna lie to you man Not yet I aint Mouse says Gimme something to write on To draw a map on Quick Dunno what you shot me with Doc but the stuff from the dogs stronger I aint gonna be compos long Quick Beezer feels around at the foot of the couch and comes up with a tradesized paperback Given the heavy shit on the bookcases Jack could almost laugh  the book is The  Habits of Highly Effective People Beezer tears off the back cover and hands it to Mouse with the blank side up Pencil Mouse croaks Hurry up I got it all man I got it    up here He touches his forehead A patch of skin the size of a quarter sloughs off at his touch Mouse wipes it on the blanket as if it were a booger Beezer pulls a gnawed stub of pencil from an inside pocket of his vest Mouse takes it and makes a pathetic effort to smile The black stuff oozing from the corners of his eyes has continued to build up and now it lies on his cheeks like smears of decayed jelly More of it is springing out of the pores on his forehead in minute black dots that remind Jack of Henrys braille books When Mouse bites his lower lip in concentration the tender flesh splits open at once Blood begins dribbling into his beard Jack supposes the rottedmeat smell is still there but Beezer had been right hes gotten used to it Mouse turns the book cover sideways then draws a series of quick squiggles Lookit he says to Jack This the Mississippi right Right Jack says When he leans in he starts getting the smell again Up close its not even a stench its a miasma trying to crawl down his throat But Jack doesnt move away He knows what an effort Mouse is making The least he can do is play his part Heres downtown  the Nelson Luckys the Agincourt Theater the Taproom    heres where Chase Street turns into Lyall Road then Route     heres Libertyville    the VFW    Goltzs    ah Christ   Mouse begins to thrash on the couch Sores on his face and upper body burst open and begin leaking He screams with pain The hand not holding the pencil goes to his face and paws at it ineffectually Something inside Jack speaks up then  speaks in a shining imperative voice he remembers from his time on the road all those years ago He supposes its the voice of the Talisman or whatever remains of it in his mind and soul It doesnt want him to talk its trying to kill him before he can talk its in the black stuff maybe it is the black stuff youve got to get rid of it  Some things can only be done without the minds prudish interference when the work is nasty instinct is often best So it is without thinking that Jack reaches out grasps the black slime oozing from Mouses eyes between his fingers and pulls At first the stuff only stretches as if made of rubber At the same time Jack can feel it squirming and writhing in his grip perhaps trying to pinch or bite him Then it lets go with a twang sound Jack throws the convulsing black tissue onto the floor with a cry The stuff tries to slither beneath the couch  Jack sees this even as he wipes his hands on his shirt frantic with revulsion Doc slams his bag down on one piece Beezer squashes the other with the heel of a motorcycle boot It makes a squittering sound What the fuck is that shit Doc asks His voice ordinarily husky has gone up into a nearfalsetto range What the fuck   Nothing from here Jack says and never mind Look at him Look at Mouse The red glare in Mouses eyes has retreated for the moment he looks almost normal Certainly hes seeing them and the pain seems gone Thanks he breathes I only wish you could get it all that way but man its already coming back Pay attention Im listening Jack says You better Mouse replies You think you know You think you can find the place again even if these two cant and maybe you can but maybe you dont know quite so much as you    ah fuck From somewhere beneath the blanket there is a ghastly bursting sound as something gives way Sweat runs down Mouses face mixing with the black poison venting from his pores and turning his beard a damp and dirty gray His eyes roll up to Jacks and Jack can see that red glare starting to haze over them again This sucks Mouse pants Never thought Id go out this way Lookit Hollywood    The dying man draws a small rectangle on his makeshift scribble of map This   Eds Eats where we found Irma Jack says I know All right Mouse whispers Good Now look    over on the other side    the Schubert and Gale side    and to the west    Mouse draws a line going north from Highway  He puts little circles on either side of it Jack takes these to be representations of trees And across the front of the line like a gate NO TRESPASSING Yeah Doc breathes Thats where it was all right Black House Mouse takes no notice His dimming gaze is fixed solely on Jack Listen to me cop Are you listening Yes Christ you better be Mouse tells him As it always has the work captures Henry absorbs him takes him away Boredom and sorrow have never been able to stand against this old captivation with sound from the sighted world Apparently fear cant stand against it either The hardest moment isnt listening to the tapes but mustering the courage to stick the first one in the big TEAC audio deck In that moment of hesitation hes sure he can smell his wifes perfume even in the soundproofed and airfiltered environment of the studio In that moment of hesitation he is positive he isnt alone that someone or something is standing just outside the studio door looking in at him through the glass upper half And that is in fact the absolute truth Blessed with sight as we are we can see what Henry cannot We want to tell him whats out there to lock the studio door for the love of God lock it now but we can only watch Henry reaches for the PLAY button on the tape deck Then his finger changes course and hits the intercom toggle instead Hello Is anyone out there The figure standing in Henrys living room looking in at him the way someone might look into an aquarium at a single exotic fish makes no sound The last of the suns on the other side of the house and the living room is becoming quite dark Henry being understandably forgetful when it comes to turning on the lights Elmer Jespersons amusing bee slippers not that they amuse us much under these circumstances are just about the brightest things out there Hello Anyone The figure looking in through the glass half of the studio door is grinning In one hand it is holding the hedge clippers from Henrys garage Last chance Henry says and when theres still no response he becomes the Wisconsin Rat shrieking into the intercom trying to startle whatevers out there into revealing itself Come on now honey come on now you muthafukkah talk to Ratty The figure peering in at Henry recoils  as a snake might recoil when its prey makes a feint  but it utters no sound From between the grinning teeth comes a leathery old tongue wagging and poking in derision This creature has been into the perfume that Mrs Morton has never had the heart to remove from the vanity in the little powder room adjacent to the master bedroom and now Henrys visitor reeks of My Sin Henry decides its all just his imagination playing him up again  oy such a mistake Morris Rosen would have told him had Morris been there  and hits PLAY with the tip of his finger He hears a throatclearing sound and then Arnold Hrabowski identifies himself The Fisherman interrupts him before he can even finish Hello asswipe Henry rewinds listens again Hello asswipe Rewinds and listens yet again Hello asswipe Yes he has heard this voice before Hes sure of it But where The answer will come answers of this sort always do  eventually  and getting there is half the fun Henry listens enrapt His fingers dance back and forth over the tape decks buttons like the fingers of a concert pianist over the keys of a Steinway The feeling of being watched slips from him although the figure outside the studio door  the thing wearing the bee slippers and holding the hedge clippers  never moves Its smile has faded somewhat A sulky expression is growing on its aged face There is confusion in that look and perhaps the first faint trace of fear The old monster doesnt like it that the blind fish in the aquarium should have captured its voice Of course it doesnt matter maybe its even part of the fun but if it is its Mr Munshuns fun not its fun And their fun should be the same    shouldnt it You have an emergency Not me You Not me you Henry says The mimicry is so good its weird A little bit of sauerkraut in your salad mein friend ja Your worst nightmare    worst nightmare Abbalah Im the Fisherman Henry listening intent He lets the tape run awhile then listens to the same phrase four times over Kiss my scrote you monkey    kiss my scrote you monkey    you monkey    monkey    No not monkey The voice is actually saying munggey MUNGghee I dont know where you are now but you grew up in Chicago Henry murmurs South Side And    Warmth on his face Suddenly he remembers warmth on his face Why is that friends and neighbors Why is that O great wise ones Youre no bettern a monkey on a stick Monkey on a stick Monkey  Monkey Henry says Hes rubbing his temples with the tips of his fingers now Monkey on a stick MUNGghee on a stigg Who said that He plays the  Kiss my scrote you monkey He plays his memory Youre no bettern a monkey on a stick Warmth on his face Heat Light Both Henry pops out the  tape and sticks in the one Jack brought today Hello Judy Are you Judy today or are you Sophie The abbalah sends his best and Gorg says Cawcawcaw Husky phlegmy laughter Ty says hello too Your little boy is very lonely    When Tyler Marshalls weeping terrified voice booms through the speakers Henry winces and fastforwards Derr vill be morrr murderts The accent much thicker now a burlesque a joke Katzenjammer Kids Meet the Wolfman but somehow even more revealing because of that Der liddul chulldrun    havvuzted like wheed Like wheed Havvuzted like    Harvested like a monkey on a stick Henry says MUNGghee HAVVusted Who are you you son of a bitch Back to the  tape There are whips in hell and chains in Sheol But its almost vips in hell almost chenz in Shayol Vips Chenz MUNGghee on a stick A stigg Youre no bettern   Henry begins and then all at once another line comes to him Lady Magowans Nightmare That ones good A bad nightmare of what Vips in hell Chenz in Shayol Mungghees on sticks My God Henry says softly Oh    my    God The dance He was at the dance Now it all begins to fall into place How stupid they have been How criminally stupid The boys bike    it had been right there Right there for Christs sake They were all blind men make them all umps But he was so old Henry whispers And senile How were we supposed to guess such a man could be the Fisherman Other questions follow this one If the Fisherman is a resident at Maxton Elder Care for instance where in Gods name could he have stashed Ty Marshall And how is the bastard getting around French Landing Does he have a car somewhere Doesnt matter Henry murmurs Not now anyway Who is he and where is he Those are the things that matter The warmth on his face  his minds first effort to locate the Fishermans voice in time and place  had been the spotlight of course Symphonic Stans spotlight the pink of ripening berries And some woman some nice old woman  Mr Stan yoohoo Mr Stan  had asked him if he took requests Only before Stan could reply a voice as flat and hard as two stones grinding together  I was here first old woman  had interrupted Flat    and hard    and with that faint Germanic harshness that said South Side Chicago probably second or even third generation Not vass here first not old vumman but those telltale vs had been lurking hadnt they Ah yes Mungghee Henry says looking straight ahead Looking straight at Charles Burnside had he only known it Stigg Havvusted Hasta la vista    baby Was that what it came down to in the end A dotty old maniac who sounded a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger Who was the woman If he can remember her name he can call Jack    or Dale if Jacks still not answering his phone    and put an end to French Landings bad dream Lady Magowans Nightmare That ones good Nightmare Henry says then adjusting his voice Nahhtmare Once again the mimicry is good Certainly too good for the old codger standing outside the studio door He is now scowling bitterly and gnashing the hedge clippers in front of the glass How can the blindman in there sound so much like him Its not right its completely improper The old monster longs to cut the vocal cords right out of Henry Leydens throat Soon he promises himself he will do that And eat them Sitting in the swivel chair drumming his fingers nervously on the gleaming oak in front of him Henry recalls the brief encounter at the bandstand Not long into the Strawberry Fest dance this had been Tell me your name and what youd like to hear I am Alice Weathers and   Moonglow please By Benny Goodman Alice Weathers Henry says That was her name and if she doesnt know your name my homicidal friend then Im a monkey on a stick He starts to get up and that is when someone  something  begins to knock very softly on the glass upper half of the door Bear Girl has drawn close almost against her will and now she Jack Doc and the Beez are gathered around the sofa Mouse has sunk halfway into it He looks like a person dying badly in quicksand Well Jack thinks theres no quicksand but hes dying badly all right Guess theres no question about that Listen up Mouse tells them The black goo is forming at the corners of his eyes again Worse its trickling from the corners of his mouth The stench of decay is stronger than ever as Mouses inner workings give up the struggle Jack is frankly amazed that theyve lasted as long as they have You talk Beezer says Well listen Mouse looks at Doc When I finish give me the fireworks The Cadillac dope Understand You want to get out ahead of whatever it is youve got Mouse nods Im down with that Doc agrees Youll go out with a smile on your face Doubt that bro but Ill give it a try Mouse shifts his reddening gaze to Beezer When its done wrap me up in one of the nylon tents thatre in the garage Stick me in the tub Im betting that by midnight youll be able to wash me down the drain like    like so much beer foam Id be careful though Dont    touch whats left Bear Girl bursts into tears Dont cry darlin Mouse says Im gonna get out ahead Doc promised Beez Right here buddy You have a little service for me Okay Read a poem    the one by Auden    the one that always used to frost your balls     Thou shalt not read the Bible for its prose  Beezer says Hes crying You got it Mousie Play some Dead    Ripple maybe    and make sure youre full enough of Kingsland to christen me good and proper into the next life Guess there wont    be any grave for you to piss on but    do the best you can Jack laughs at that He cant help it And this time its his turn to catch the full force of Mouses crimson eyes Promise me youll wait until tomorrow to go out there cop Mouse Im not sure I can do that You gotta Go out there tonight you wont have to worry about the devil dog    the other things in the woods around that house    the other things    The red eyes roll horribly Black stuff trickles into Mouses beard like tar Then he somehow forces himself to go on The other things in those woods will eat you like candy I think thats a chance Ill have to take Jack says frowning Theres a little boy somewhere   Safe Mouse whispers Jack raises his eyebrows unsure if hes heard Mouse right And even if he has can he trust what hes heard Mouse has some powerful evil poison working in him So far hes been able to withstand it to communicate in spite of it but  Safe for a little while Mouse says Not from everything    theres things that might still get him I suppose    but for the time being hes safe from Mr Munching Is that his name Munching Munshun I think How do you know it Mouse favors Jack with a smile of surpassing eeriness It is the smile of a dying sibyl Once more he manages to touch his forehead and Jack notes with horror that the mans fingers are now melting into one another and turning black from the nails down Got it up here man Got it alll up here Told you that And listen its better the kid should get eaten by some giant bug or rock crab over there    where he is    than that you should die trying to rescue him If you do that the abbalah will wind up with the kid for sure Thats what your    your friend says What friend Doc asks suspiciously Never mind Mouse says Hollywood knows Dontcha Hollywood Jack nods reluctantly Its Speedy of course Or Parkus if you prefer Wait until tomorrow Mouse says High noon when the suns strongest in both worlds Promise At first Jack can say nothing Hes torn in something close to agony Itd be almost full dark before you could get back out Highway  anyway Bear Girl says quietly And theres bad shit in those woods all right Doc says Makes the stuff in that Blair Witch Project look fuckin tame I dont think you want to try it in the dark Not unless you got a death wish that is When youre done    Mouse whispers When youre done    if any of you are left    burn the place to the ground That hole That tomb Burn it to the ground do you hear me Close the door Yeah Beezer says Heard and understood buddy Last thing Mouse says Hes speaking directly to Jack now You may be able to find it    but I think I got something else you need Its a word Its powerful to you because of something you    you touched Once a long time ago I dont understand that part but    Its all right Jack tells him I do Whats the word Mouse For a moment he doesnt think Mouse will in the end be able to tell him Something is clearly struggling to keep him from saying the word but in this struggle Mouse comes out on top It is Jack thinks very likely his lifes last W Dyamba Mouse says Now you Hollywood You say it Dyamba Jack says and a row of weighty paperbacks slides from one of the makeshift shelves at the foot of the couch They hang there in the dimming air    hang    hang    and then drop to the floor with a crash Bear Girl voices a little scream Dont forget it Mouse says Youre gonna need it How How am I going to need it Mouse shakes his head wearily Dont    know Beezer reaches over Jacks shoulder and takes the pitiful little scribble of map Youre going to meet us tomorrow morning at the Sand Bar he tells Jack Get there by eleventhirty and we should be turning into that goddamned lane right around noon In the meantime maybe Ill just hold on to this A little insurance policy to make sure you do things Mouses way Okay Jack says He doesnt need the map to find Chummy Burnsides Black House but Mouse is almost certainly right its probably not the sort of place you want to tackle after dark He hates to leave Ty Marshall in the furancelands  it feels wrong in a way thats almost sinful  but he has to remember that theres more at stake here than one little boy lost Beezer are you sure you want to go back there Hell no I dont want to go back Beezer says almost indignantly But something killed my daughter  my daughter  and it got here from there You want to tell me you dont know thats true Jack makes no reply Of course its true And of course he wants Doc and the Beez with him when he turns up the lane to Black House If they can bear to come that is Dyamba he thinks Dyamba Dont forget He turns back to the couch Mouse do you   No Doc says Guess he wont need the Cadillac dope after all Huh Jack peers at the big brewerbiker stupidly He feels stupid Stupid and exhausted Nothin tickin but his watch Doc says and then he begins to sing After a moment Beezer joins in then Bear Girl Jack steps away from the couch with a thought queerly similar to Henrys How did it get late so early Just how in hell did that happen In heaven there is no beer    thats why we drink it here    and when    were gone    from here    Jack tiptoes across the room On the far side theres a lighted Kingsland Premium Golden Pale Ale bar clock Our old friend  who is finally looking every year of his age and not quite so lucky  peers at the time with disbelief not accepting it until he has compared it to his own watch Almost eight He has been here for hours Almost dark and the Fisherman still out there someplace Not to mention his otherworldly playmates Dyamba he thinks again as he opens the door And as he steps out onto the splintery porch and closes the door behind him he speaks aloud with great sincerity into the darkening day Speedy Id like to wring your neck OH FORGET about that We know where Jack Sawyer went when he disappeared from the edge of the cornfield and we know who he is likely to meet when he gets there Enough of that stuff We want fun we want excitement Luckily for us that charming old party Charles Burnside who can always be depended upon to slip a whoopee cushion under the governors seat during a banquet to pour a little hot sauce into the stew to fart at the prayer meeting is at this moment emerging from a toilet bowl and into a stall in the mens room on Daisy wing We note that Ol Burny our BurnBurn hugs Henry Leydens hedge clippers to his sunken chest with both arms actually cradling them as if he were holding a baby On his bony right arm blood slides out of a nasty gash and rolls down toward his elbow When he gets one foot clad in another residents bee slipper on the rim of the bowl he pushes himself up and steps out wobbling a bit His mouth is twisted into a scowl and his eyes look like bullet holes but we do not suppose that he too carries a weight of heavyduty sorrow Blood soaks the bottoms of his trousers and the front of his shirt which has darkened with the flow of blood from a knife wound to his abdomen Wincing Burny opens the door of the stall and walks out into the empty mens room Fluorescent lights on the ceiling reflect from the long mirror above the row of sinks thanks to Butch Yerxa who is working a double shift because the regular night man called in drunk the white tiles of the floor gleam In all this sparkling whiteness the blood on Charles Burnsides clothes and body looks radiantly red He peels off his shirt and tosses it into a sink before plodding down to the far end of the bathroom and a cabinet marked with a piece of tape on which someone has printed BANDAGES Old men have a tendency to fall down in their bathrooms and Chippers father thoughtfully installed the cabinet where he thought it might be needed Drops of blood lay spattered across the white tiles Burny rips a handful of paper towels from a dispenser dampens them with cold water and lays them on the side of the nearest sink Then he opens the bandage cabinet removes a wide roll of tape and a wad of gauze bandages and tears off a sixinch strip of the tape He wipes blood off the skin around the wound in his belly and presses the wet paper towels over the opening He lifts away the towels and presses a pad of gauze to the cut Awkwardly he flattens the strip of tape over the gauze He dresses the stab wound on his arm in the same fashion Now swirls and scoops of blood cover the white tiles He moves up the row of sinks and runs cold water over his shirt The water turns red in the bowl Burny keeps scrubbing the old shirt under cold running water until it has turned a pale rose only a few shades brighter than his skin Satisfied he wrings the shirt in his hands flaps it once or twice and puts it back on That it clings to him bothers Burny not at all His goal is a very basic version of acceptability not elegance insofar as it is possible he wants to pass unnoticed His cuffs are soaked with blood and Elmer Jespersons slippers are dark red and wet but he thinks most people will not bother to look at his feet Within him a coarse voice keeps saying Fazzdur BurnBurn fazzdur Burnys only mistake is that while buttoning up his damp shirt he looks at himself in the mirror What he sees stops him cold with shock Despite his ugliness Charles Burnside has always approved of the image returned to him by mirrors In his opinion he looks like a guy who knows where to find the corners  sly unpredictable and foxy The man staring at him from the other side of the mirror is nothing like the canny old operator Burny remembered The man facing him looks dimwitted wornout and seriously ill Sunken redrimmed eyes cheeks like craters veins crawling across his bald skulllike crown    even his nose looks bonier and more twisted than it once had He is the sort of old man who frightens children You shud fryden cheerun BurnBurn Dime do ged moovuhn He couldnt really look that bad could he If he did he would have noticed long before this Nah that wasnt how Charles Burnside faced the world The bathrooms too damn white thats all A white like that makes you look bleached Makes you look skinned like a rabbit The dying old horror in the mirror takes a step nearer and the spotty discolorations on his skin seem to darken The spectacle of his teeth makes him close his mouth Then his master is like a fishhook in his mind pulling him toward the door and muttering Dime dime Burny knows why its dime Mr Munshun wants to get back to Black House Mr Munshun comes from some place incredibly distant from French Landing and certain parts of Black House which they built together feel like the world of his home  the deepest parts which Charles Burnside seldom visits and which make him feel hypnotized weak with longing and sick to his stomach when he does When he tries to picture the world that gave birth to Mr Munshun he envisions a dark craggy landscape littered with skulls On the bare slopes and peaks stand houses like castles that change size or vanish when you blink From the flickering defiles comes an industrial cacophony mingled with the cries of tortured children Burnside is eager to return to Black House too but for the simpler pleasures of the first set of rooms where he can rest eat canned food and read his scrapbooks He relishes the particular smell that inhabits those rooms an order of rot sweat dried blood must sewage If he could distill that fragrance he would wear it like cologne Also a sweet little morsel named Tyler Marshall sits locked in a chamber located in another layer of Black House  and another world  and Burny cannot wait to torment little Tyler to run his wrinkled hands over the boys beautiful skin Tyler Marshall thrills Burny But there are pleasures yet to be reaped in this world and it is dime to attend to them Burny peeks out through a crack in the bathroom door and sees that Butch Yerxa has succumbed to weariness and the cafeterias meat loaf He occupies his chair like an oversized doll his arms on the desk and his fat chin resting on what would be a neck on a normal person That useful little painted rock stands a few inches away from Butchs right hand but Burny has no need of the rock for he has acquired an instrument far more versatile He wishes he had discovered the potential of hedge clippers long ago Instead of one blade you get two One up one down snicksnick And sharp He had not intended to amputate the blind mans fingers Back then he thought of the clippers as a big primitive variety of knife but when he got stabbed in the arm he jerked the clippers toward the blind man and they more or less bit off his fingers by themselves as neatly and swiftly as the oldtime butchers in Chicago used to slice bacon Chipper Maxton is going to be fun He deserves what he is going to get too Burny figures that Chipper is responsible for the way he has deteriorated The mirror told him that he is about twenty pounds less than he should be maybe even thirty and no wonder  look at the slop they serve in the cafeteria Chipper has been chiseling on the food Burny thinks the same way he chisels on everything else The state the government Medicaid Medicare Chipper steals from all of them A couple of times when he thought Charles Burnside was too out of it to know what was happening Maxton had told him to sign forms that indicated hed had an operation prostate surgery lung surgery The way Burny sees it half of the Medicaid money that paid for the nonexistent operation should have been his It was his name on the form wasnt it Burnside eases into the hallway and pads toward the lobby leaving bloody footprints from the squishing slippers Because he will have to pass the nurses station he shoves the clippers under his waistband and covers them with his shirt The flabby cheeks goldrimmed glasses and lavender hair of a useless old bag named Georgette Porter are visible to Burnside above the counter of the nurses station Things could be worse he thinks Ever since she waltzed into D and caught him trying to masturbate stark naked in the middle of the room Georgette Porter has been terrified of him She glances his way seems to suppress a shudder and looks back down at whatever she is doing with her hands Knitting probably or reading the kind of murder mystery in which a cat solves the crime Burny slops nearer the station and considers using the clippers on Georgettes face but decides it is not worth the waste of energy When he reaches the counter he looks over it and sees that she is holding a paperback book in her hands just as he had imagined She looks up at him with profound suspicion in her eyes We sure look yummy tonight Georgie She glances up the hallway then at the lobby and realizes that she must deal with him by herself You should be in your room Mr Burnside Its late Mind your own business Georgie I got a right to take a walk Mr Maxton doesnt like the residents to go into the other wings so please stay in Daisy Is the big boss here tonight I believe so yes Good He turns away and continues on toward the lobby and she calls after him Wait He looks back She is standing up a sure sign of great concern You arent going to bother Mr Maxton are you Say any more and Ill bother you She places a hand on her throat and finally notices the floor Her chin drops and her eyebrows shoot up Mr Burnside what do you have on your slippers And your pants cuffs Youre tracking it everwhere Cant keep your mouth shut can you Grimly he plods back to the nurses station Georgette Porter backs against the wall and by the time she realizes that she could have tried to escape Burny is already in front of her She removes her hand from her throat and holds it out like a stop sign Dumb bitch Burnside yanks the clippers out of his belt grips the handles and clips off her fingers as easily as if they were twigs Stupid Georgette has entered a stage of shocked disbelief that holds her in paralysis She stares at the blood spilling from the four stumps on her hand Goddamn moron He opens the clippers and rams one of the blades into her throat Georgette makes a choked gargling sound She tries to get her hands on the clippers but he pulls them from her neck and raises them to her head Her hands flutter scattering blood The expression on Burnys face is that of a man who finally admits that he has to clean his cats litter box He levels the wet blade in front of her right eye and shoves it in and Georgette is dead before her body slides down the wall and folds up on the floor Thirty feet up the hallway Butch Yerxa mumbles in his sleep They never listen Burny mutters to himself You try and try but they always ask for it in the end Proves they want it  like those dumb little shits in Chicago He tugs the clippers blade out of Georgettes head and wipes it clean on the shoulder of her blouse The memory of one or two of those little shits in Chicago sends a tingle down the length of his member which begins to stiffen in his baggy old pants Hello Ah    the magic of tender memories Though as we have seen Charles Burnside now and again enjoys erections in his sleep in his waking hours they are so rare as to be nearly nonexistent and he is tempted to pull down his pants and see what he could make it do But what if Yerxa wakes up He would assume that Georgette Porter or at least her corpse aroused Burnys longsmoldering lusts That wouldnt do  not at all Even a monster has his pride Best to carry on to Chipper Maxtons office and hope that his hammer doesnt go limp before it is time to pound the nail Burny tucks the clippers into the back of his waistband and yanks at his wet shirt pulling it away from his body Down the corridor of Daisy wing he shuffles across the empty lobby and up to the burnished door further distinguished by the brass nameplate reading WILLIAM MAXTON DIRECTOR This he reverentially opens summoning to mind the image of a longdead tenyearold boy named Herman Flagler otherwise known as Poochie one of his first conquests Poochie Tender Poochie Those tears those sobs of mingled pain and joy that yielding to utter helplessness the faint crust of dirt over Poochies scabby knees and slender forearms Hot tears a jet of urine from his terrified little rosebud There will be no such bliss from Chipper but we may be sure there will be something Anyhow Tyler Marshall lies bound and waiting in Black House helpless as helpless could be Charles Burnside plods through Rebecca Vilass windowless cubicle Poochie Flaglers pallid deeply dimpled backside blazing in his mind He places a hand on the next doorknob takes a moment to calm himself and noiselessly revolves the knob The door opens just wide enough to reveal Chipper Maxton only monarch of this realm leaning over his desk his head propped on one fist and using a yellow pencil to make notations on two sets of papers The trace of a smile softens the tight purse of his mouth his damp eyes betray the suggestion of a gleam the busy pencil glides back and forth between the two stacks of papers making tiny marks So happily absorbed in his task is Chipper that he fails to notice he is no longer alone until his visitor steps inside and gives the door a backward kick with his foot When the door slams shut Chipper glances up in irritated surprise and peers at the figure before him His attitude almost immediately changes to a sly unpleasant heartiness he takes to be disarming Dont they knock on doors where you come from Mr Burnside Just barge right on in do they Barge right on in says his visitor Never mind The truth is Ive been meaning to talk to you Talk to me Yes Come on in will you Take a seat Im afraid we might have a little problem and I want to explore some possibilities Oh Burny says A problem He plucks his shirt away from his chest and trudges forward leaving behind him progressively fainter footprints Maxton fails to see Take a pew Chipper says waving at the chair in front of his desk Pull up a bollard and rest your bones This expression comes from Franky Shellbarger the First Farmers loan officer who uses it all the time at the local Rotary meetings and although Chipper Maxton has no idea what a bollard may be he thinks it sounds cute as hell Oldtimer you and me have to have a hearttoheart discussion Ah Burny says and sits down his back rigidly straight due to the clippers Hardz zu hardz Yeah thats the idea Hey is that shirt wet It is We cant have that old buddy  you might catch cold and die and neither one of us would like that would we You need a dry shirt Let me see what I can do for you Dont bother you fucking monkey Chipper Maxton is already on his feet and straightening his shirt and the old mans words throw him momentarily off his stride He recovers nicely grins and says Stay right there Chicago Although the mention of his native city sends a prickling sensation down his spine Burnside gives nothing away as Maxton moves around the side of his desk and walks across his office He watches the director leave the room Chicago Where Poochie Flagler and Sammy Hooten and Ferd Brogan and all the others had lived and died God bless em Stalks of grain blades of grass so foul so beautiful so enticing With their smiles and their screams Like all Caucasian slum children pure pale ivory white under the crust of dirt the fishy white of the citys poor the soontobelost The slender bones of their shoulder blades sticking out as if to break through the thin layer of flesh Burnys old organ stirs and stiffens as if it remembers the frolics of yesteryear Tyler Marshall he croons to himself pretty little Ty we will have ourselves some fun before we turn you over to the boss yes we will yes indeedy yes yes The door slams behind him yanking him out of his erotic reverie But his old mule his old hoss it stays awake and on its mettle bold and brash as ever it was in the glory days No one in the lobby Maxton complains That old bag whatshername Porter Georgette Porter down in the kitchen stuffing her face I bet and Butch Yerxa sound asleep in his chair What am I supposed to do ransack the rooms to find a dry shirt He strides past Burnside throws up his hands and drops into his chair Its all an act but Burny has seen much better than this Chipper cannot intimidate Burny not even if he knows a few things about Chicago I dont need a new shirt he says Asswipe Chipper leans back in his chair and clasps his hands behind his head He grins  this patient amuses him hes a real card Now now Theres no need for namecalling here You dont fool me anymore old man I dont buy your Alzheimers act In fact I dont buy any of it He is nice and relaxed and he oozes the confidence of a gambler holding four aces Burny figures he is being set up for some kind of con job or blackmail which makes the moment all the more delicious I gotta hand it to you though Chipper goes on You fooled everybody in sight including me It must take an incredible amount of discipline to fake latestage Alzheimers All that slumping in your chair being fed baby food crapping in your pants Pretending you dont understand what people are saying I wasnt faking you jackass So its no wonder you staged a comeback  when was that about a year ago I would have done the same I mean its one thing to go undercover but its another to do it as a vegetable So we have ourselves a little miracle dont we Our Alzheimers gradually reverses itself it comes and it goes like the common cold Its a good deal all around You get to walk around and make a nuisance of yourself and theres less work for the staff Youre still one of my favorite patients Charlie Or should I call you Carl I dont give a shit what you call me But Carls your real name isnt it Burny does not even shrug He hopes Chipper gets to the point before Butch Yerxa wakes up notices the bloody prints and discovers Georgette Porters body because while he is interested in Maxtons tale he wants to get to Black House without too much interference And Butch Yerxa would probably put up a decent fight Under the illusion that he is playing a catandmouse game in which he is the cat Chipper smiles at the old man in the wet pink shirt and rolls on A state detective called me today Said ID on a local fingerprint had come back from the FBI It belonged to a bad bad man named Carl Bierstone whos been wanted for almost forty years In  he was sentenced to death for killing a couple of kids he molested only he escaped from the car taking him to prison  killed two guards with his bare hands No sign of him since then Hed be eightyfive by now and the detective thought Bierstone just might be one of our residents What do you have to say Charles Nothing evidently Charles Burnside is pretty close to Carl Bierstone isnt it And we have no background information on you at all That makes you a unique resident here For everybody else we damn near have a family tree but you sort of come out of nowhere The only information we have about you is your age When you turned up at La Riviere General in  you claimed to be seventyeight That would make you the same age as that fugitive Burnside gives him a truly unsettling smile I guess I must be the Fisherman too then Youre eightyfive years old I dont think youre capable of dragging a bunch of kids halfway across the county But I do think youre this Carl Bierstone and the cops are still eager to get their hands on you Which brings me to this letter that came a few days ago Ive been meaning to discuss it with you but you know how busy things get around here He opens his desk drawer and pulls out a single sheet torn from a yellow notepad It bears a brief neatly typed message  De Pere Wisconsin it says No date To Whom It May Concern is how it starts I regret to inform you that I am no longer able to continue monthly payments on behalf of my nephew Charles Burnside Thats it Instead of writing her signature she typed her name Althea Burnside  Chipper places the yellow notepaper before him and folds his hands together on top of it Whats the deal here Charles Theres no Althea Burnside living in De Pere I know that much And she cant be your aunt How old would she be At least a hundred More like a hundred and ten I dont believe it But these checks have been coming in regular as clockwork since your first month here at Maxtons Some buddy some old partner of yours has been looking out for you my friend And we want him to continue what hes been doing dont we All the same to me asswipe This is not precisely truthful All Burny knows of the monthly payments is that Mr Munshun organized them long ago and if these payments are to stop well    what comes to an end with them He and Mr Munshun are in this together arent they Come on kiddo Chipper says You can do better than that Im looking for a little cooperation here Im sure you dont want to go through all the mess and trouble of being taken into custody getting fingerprinted plus whatever might happen after that And me speaking personally I wouldnt want to put you through all of that Because the real rat here is your friend It sure looks to me like this guy whoever he is is forgetting that you probably have something on him from the old days right And hes thinking that he doesnt have to make sure that you have all your little comforts anymore Only thats a mistake I bet you could straighten the guy out make him understand the situation Burnys mule his old hoss has softened up and dwindled like a punctured balloon which increases his gloom Since entering this oily crooks office he has lost something vital a feeling of purpose a sense of immunity an edge He wants to get back to Black House Black House will restore him for Black House is magic dark magic The bitterness of his soul went into its making the darkness of his heart soaked through every beam and joist Mr Munshun helped Burny see the possibilities of Black House and he contributed many and many a touch of his own devise There are regions of Black House Charles Burnside has never truly understood and that frighten him badly an underground wing seems to contain his secret career in Chicago and when he drew near that part of the house he could hear the pleading whimpers and pungent screams of a hundred doomed boys as well as his own rasps of command his grunts of ecstasy For some reason the proximity of his earlier triumphs made him feel small and hunted an outcast instead of a lord Mr Munshun had helped him remember the scale of his achievement but Mr Munshun had been of no use with another region of Black House a small one at best a room more accurately a vault which houses the whole of his childhood and which he has never ever visited The merest hint of that room causes Burny to feel like an infant left outside to freeze to death The news of the fictitious Althea Burnsides defection has a lesser version of the same effect This is intolerable and he need not in fact cannot endure it Yeah he says Lets have some straightening out here Lets have some understanding He rises from the chair and a sound from what seems to be the center of French Landing speeds him along It is the wail of police sirens at least two maybe three Burny doesnt know for sure but he supposes that Jack Sawyer has discovered the body of his friend Henry only Henry was less than perfectly dead and managed to say that he had recognized his killers voice So Jack called the cop shop and here we are His next step brings him to the front of the desk He glances at the papers on the desk and instantly grasps their meaning Cooking the books hey You arent just an asswipe youre a sneaky little numbers juggler In an amazingly small number of seconds Chipper Maxtons face registers a tremendous range of feeling states Ire surprise confusion wounded pride anger and disbelief chase across the landscape of his features as Burnside reaches back and produces the hedge clippers In the office they seem larger and more aggressive than they did in Henry Leydens living room To Chipper the blades look as long as scythes And when Chipper tears his eyes away from them and raises them to the old man standing before him he sees a face more demonic than human Burnsides eyes gleam red and his lips curl away from appalling glistening teeth like shards of broken mirrors Back off buddy Chipper squeaks The police are practically in the lobby I aint deaf Burny rams one blade into Chippers mouth and closes the clippers on his sweaty cheek Blood shoots across the desk and Chippers eyes expand Burny yanks on the clippers and several teeth and a portion of Chippers tongue fly from the yawning wound He pushes himself upright and leans forward to grab the blades Burnside steps back and lops off half of Chippers right hand Damn thats sharp he says Then Maxton comes reeling around the side of the desk spraying blood in all directions and bellowing like a moose Burny dodges away dodges back and punches the blades into the bulge of the blue buttondown shirt over Chippers belly When he tugs them out Chipper sags groans drops to his knees Blood pours out of him as if from an overturned jug He falls forward on his elbows There is no fun left in Chipper Maxton he shakes his head and mutters something that is a plea to be left alone A bloodshot oxlike eye revolves toward Charles Burnside and silently expresses an oddly impersonal desire for mercy Mother of Mercy Burny says is this the end of Rico What a laugh  he hasnt thought of that movie in years Chuckling at his own wit he leans over positions the blades on either side of Chippers neck and nearly succeeds in cutting off his head The sirens turn blaring on to Queen Street Soon policemen will be running up the walk soon they will burst into the lobby Burnside drops the clippers onto Chippers broad back and regrets that he does not have the time to piss on his body or take a dump on his head but Mr Munshun is grumbling about dime dime dime I aint stupid you dont have to tell me Burny says He pads out of the office and through Miss Vilass cubicle When he moves out into the lobby he can see the flashing light bars on the tops of two police cars rolling down the far side of the hedge They come to a halt not far from where he first put his hand around Tyler Marshalls slender boyneck Burny scoots along a little faster When he reaches the beginning of the Daisy corridor two babyfaced policemen burst through the opening in the hedge Down the hallway Butch Yerxa is standing up and rubbing his face He stares at Burnside and says What happened Get out there Burny says Take em to the office Maxtons hurt Hurt Incapable of movement Butch is gaping at Burnsides bloody clothes and dripping hands Go Butch stumbles forward and the two young policemen charge in through the big glass door from which Rebecca Vilass poster has been removed The office Butch yells pointing to his right The boss is hurt While Yerxa indicates the office door by jabbing his hand at the wall Charles Burnside scuttles past him A moment later he has entered the Daisy wing mens room and is hotfooting it toward one of the stalls And what of Jack Sawyer We already know That is we know he fell asleep in a receptive place between the edge of a cornfield and a hill on the western side of Norway Valley We know that his body grew lighter less substantial cloudy That it grew vague and translucent We can suppose that before his body attained transparency Jack entered a certain nourishing dream And in that dream we may suppose a sky of robins egg blue suggests an infinity of space to the inhabitants of a handsome residential property on Roxbury Drive Beverly Hills wherein Jacky is six six six or twelve twelve twelve or both at the same time and Daddy played cool changes on his horn horn horn Darn That Dream Henry Shake could tell you is the last song on Daddy Plays the Horn by Dexter Gordon  a daddyo if there ever was In that dream everyone went on a journey and no one went anywhere else and a traveling boy captured a most marvelous prize and Lily Cavanaugh Sawyer captured a bumblebee in a glass Smiling she carried it to the swinging doors and launched it into the upper air So the bumblebee traveled far and away to Faraway and as it journeyed worlds upon worlds on their mysterious courses trembled and swayed and Jack too journeyed on his own mysterious course into the infinite robinsegg blue and in the bees accurate wake returned to the Territories where he lay sleeping in a silent field So in that same darned dream Jack Sawyer a person younger than twelve and older than thirty stunned by both grief and love is visited in his sleep by a certain woman of tender regard And she lies down beside him on his bed of sweet grass and takes him in her arms and his grateful body knows the bliss of her touch her kiss her deep blessing What they do alone in the faraway Territories is none of our business but we compound Sophies blessing with our own and leave them to what is after all with the gentlest possible urgency their business which blesses this boy and this girl this man and this woman this dear couple as nothing else can certainly not us Return comes as it should with the clean rich smells of topsoil and corn and a roosters alarmclock crowing from the Gilbertson cousins farm A spiderweb shining with dew stitches the loafer on Jacks left foot to a mossy rock An ant trundling across Jacks right wrist carries a blade of grass bearing in the V of its central fold a bright and trembling drop of newly made water Feeling as wondrously refreshed as if he too were newly created Jack eases the hardworking ant off his wrist separates his shoe from the spiderweb and gets to his feet Dew sparkles in his hair and his eyebrows Half a mile back across the field Henrys meadow curves around Henrys house Tiger lilies shiver in the cool morning breeze Tiger lilies shiver    When he sees the hood of his pickup nosing out from behind the house everything comes back to him Mouse and the word given him by Mouse Henrys house Henrys studio his dying message By this time all the police and investigators will have gone and the house will be empty echoing with bloodstains Dale Gilbertson  and probably Troopers Brown and Black  will be looking for him Jack has no interest in the troopers but he does want to talk to Dale It is time to let Dale in on some startling facts What Jack has to say to Dale is going to peel his eyelids back but we should remember what the Duke told Dean Martin about the whisking of eggs and the making of omelettes In the words of Lily Cavanaugh when the Duke spoke up everdangbody lissened up and so must Dale Gilbertson for Jack wants his faithful and resolute company on the journey through Black House Walking past the side of Henrys house Jack puts the tips of his fingers to his lips and brushes them against the wood transferring the kiss Henry For all the worlds for Tyler Marshall for Judy for Sophie and for you Henry Leyden The cell phone in the cab of the Ram claims to have three saved messages all from Dale which he deletes unheard At home the answering machines red light blinks  repeating itself with the ruthless insistence of a hungry infant Jack pushes PLAYBACK Four times an increasingly unhappy Dale Gilbertson begs to know the whereabouts of his friend Jack Sawyer and communicates his great desire to converse with the same gentleman largely in reference to the murder of his uncle and their friend Henry but it wouldnt hurt to talk about the goddamn slaughter at Maxtons would it And does the name Charles Burnside ring any bells Jack looks at his watch and thinking that it cannot be correct glances up at the clock in his kitchen His watch was right after all It is  AM and the rooster is still crowing behind Randy and Kent Gilbertsons barn Tiredness suddenly washes through him heavier than gravity Someone is undoubtedly manning the telephone on Sumner Street but Dale is just as certainly asleep in his bed and Jack wishes to speak only to Dale He yawns hugely like a cat The newspaper hasnt even been delivered yet He removes his jacket and tosses it onto a chair then yawns again even more widely than before Maybe that cornfield was not so comfortable after all Jacks neck feels pinched and his back aches He pulls himself up the staircase shucks his clothes onto a love seat in his bedroom and flops into bed On the wall above the love seat hangs his sunny little Fairfield Porter painting and Jack remembers how Dale responded to it the night they uncrated and put up all the paintings He had loved that picture the moment he saw it  it had probably been news to Dale that he could find such satisfaction in a painting All right Jack thinks if we manage to get out of Black House alive Ill give it to him And Ill make him take it Ill threaten to chop it up and burn it in the woodstove if he doesnt Ill tell him Ill give it to Wendell Green His eyes are already closing he sinks into the bedclothes and disappears although this time not literally from our world He dreams He walks down a tricky descending forest path toward a burning building Beasts and monsters writhe and bellow on both sides mostly unseen but now and then flicking out a gnarled hand a spiky tail a black skeletal wing These he severs with a heavy sword His arm aches and his entire body feels weary and sore Somewhere he is bleeding but he cannot see or feel the wound merely the slow movement of blood running down the backs of his legs The people who were with him at the start of his journey are all dead and he is  he may be  dying He wishes he were not so alone for he is terrified The burning building grows taller and taller as he approaches Screams and cries come from it and around it lies a grotesque perimeter of dead blackened trees and smoking ashes This perimeter widens with every second as if the building is devouring all of nature one foot at a time Everything is lost and the burning building and the soulless creature who is both its master and its prisoner will triumph blasted world without end amen Dintah the great furnace eating all in its path The trees on his right side bend and contort their complaining branches and a great stirring takes place in the dark sharply pointed leaves Groaning the huge trunks bow and the branches twine like snakes about one another bringing into being a solid wall of gray pointed leaves From that wall emerges with terrible slowness the impression of a gaunt bony face Five feet tall from crown to chin the face bulges out against the layer of leaves weaving from side to side in search of Jack It is everything that has ever terrified him injured him wished him ill either in this world or the Territories The huge face vaguely resembles a human monster named Elroy who once tried to rape Jack in a wretched bar called the Oatley Tap then it suggests Morgan of Orris then Sunlight Gardener then Charles Burnside but as it continues its blind seeking from side to side it suggests all of these malign faces layered on top of one another and melting into one Utter fear turns Jack to stone The face bulging out of the massed leaves searches the downward path then swings back and ceases its constant flickering movement from side to side It is pointed directly at him The blind eyes see him the nose without nostrils smells him A quiver of pleasure runs through the leaves and the face looms forward getting larger and larger Unable to move Jack looks back over his shoulder to see a putrefying man prop himself up in a narrow bed The man opens his mouth and shouts DYAMBA Heart thrashing in his chest a shout dying before it leaves his throat Jack vaults from his bed and lands on his feet before he quite realizes that he has awakened from a dream His entire body seems to be trembling Sweat runs down his forehead and dampens his chest Gradually the trembling ceases as he takes in what is really around him not a giant face looming from an ugly wall of leaves but the familiar confines of his bedroom Hanging on the wall opposite is a painting he intends to give to Dale Gilbertson He wipes his face he calms down He needs a shower His watch tells him that it is now  AM He has slept four hours and it is time to get organized Fortyfive minutes later cleaned up dressed and fed Jack calls the police station and asks to speak to Chief Gilbertson At  he and a dubious newly educated Dale  a Dale who badly wants to see some evidence of his friends crazy tale  leave the chiefs car parked beneath the single tree in the Sand Bars lot and walk across the hot asphalt past two leaning Harleys and toward the rear entrance WE HAVE HAD our little conversation about slippage and its too late in the game to belabor the point more than a little but wouldnt you say that most houses are an attempt to hold slippage back To impose at least the illusion of normality and sanity on the world Think of Libertyville with its corny but endearing street names  Camelot and Avalon and Maid Marian Way And think of that sweet little honey of a home in Libertyville where Fred Judy and Tyler Marshall once lived together What else would you call  Robin Hood Lane but an ode to the everyday a paean to the prosaic We could say the same thing about Dale Gilbertsons home or Jacks or Henrys couldnt we Most of the homes in the vicinity of French Landing really The destructive hurricane that has blown through the town doesnt change the fact that the homes stand as brave bulwarks against slippage as noble as they are humble They are places of sanity Black House  like Shirley Jacksons Hill House like the turnofthecentury monstrosity in Seattle known as Rose Red  is not sane It is not entirely of this world Its hard to look at from the outside  the eyes play continual tricks  but if one can hold it steady for a few seconds one sees a threestory dwelling of perfectly ordinary size The color is unusual yes  that dead black exterior even the windows swabbed black  and it has a crouching leaning aspect that would raise uneasy thoughts about its structural integrity but if one could appraise it with the glammer of those other worlds stripped away it would look almost as ordinary as Fred and Judys place    if not so well maintained Inside however it is different Inside Black House is large Black House is in fact almost infinite Certainly it is no place to get lost although from time to time people have  hoboes and the occasional unfortunate runaway child as well as Charles BurnsideCarl Bierstones victims  and relics here and there mark their passing bits of clothing pitiful scratchings on the walls of gigantic rooms with strange dimensions the occasional heap of bones Here and there the visitor may see a skull such as the ones that washed up on the banks of the Hanover River during Fritz Haarmans reign of terror in the early s This is not a place where you want to get lost Let us pass through rooms and nooks and corridors and crannies safe in the knowledge that we can return to the outside world the sane antislippage world anytime we want and yet we are still uneasy as we pass down flights of stairs that seem all but endless and along corridors that dwindle to a point in the distance We hear an eternal low humming and the faint clash of weird machinery We hear the idiot whistle of a constant wind either outside or on the floors above and below us Sometimes we hear a faint houndly barking that is undoubtedly the abbalahs devil dog the one that did for poor old Mouse Sometimes we hear the sardonic caw of a crow and understand that Gorg is here too  somewhere We pass through rooms of ruin and rooms that are still furnished with a pale and rotten grandeur Many of these are surely bigger than the whole house in which they hide And eventually we come to a humble sitting room furnished with an elderly horsehair sofa and chairs of fading red velvet There is a smell of noisome cooking in the air Somewhere close by is a kitchen we must never visit    not that is if we ever wish to sleep without nightmares again The electrical fixtures in here are at least seventy years old How can that be we ask if Black House was built in the s The answer is simple much of Black House  most of Black House  has been here much longer The draperies in this room are heavy and faded Except for the yellowed news clippings that have been taped to the ugly green wallpaper it is a room that would not be out of place on the ground floor of the Nelson Hotel Its a place that is simultaneously sinister and oddly banal a fitting mirror for the imagination of the old monster who has gone to earth here who lies sleeping on the horsehair sofa with the front of his shirt turning a sinister red Black House is not his although in his pathological grandiosity he believes differently and Mr Munshun has not disabused him of this belief  This one room however is The clippings around him tell us all we need to know of Charles Chummy Burnsides lethal fascinations YES I ATE HER FISH DECLARES

lips move like those of a secondrate ventriloquist Burny groans His head turns to the left No    need to sleep Everything    hurts The head turns to the right in a gesture of negation and Mr Munshun speaks again Waygup dey vill be gummink You must move der buuuoy The head switches back the other way Sleeping Burny thinks Mr Munshun is still safe inside his head He has forgotten things are different here in Black House Foolish Burny now nearing the end of his usefulness But not quite there yet Cant    lea me lone    stomach hurts    the blind man    fucking blind man hurt my stomach    But the head turns back the other way and the voice speaks again from the air beside Burnys right ear Burny fights it not wanting to wake and face the full ferocious impact of the pain The blind man has hurt him much worse than he thought at the time in the heat of the moment Burny insists to the nagging voice that the boy is safe where he is that theyll never find him even if they can gain access to Black House that they will become lost in its unknown depth of rooms and hallways and wander until they first go mad and then die Mr Munshun however knows that one of them is different from any of the others who have happened on this place Jack Sawyer is acquainted with the infinite and that makes him a problem The boy must be taken out the back way and into EndWorld into the very shadow of Dintah the great furnace Mr Munshun tells Burny that he may still be able to have some of the boy before turning him over to the abbalah but not here Too dangerous Sorry Burny continues to protest but this is a battle he will not win and we know it Already the stale cookedmeat air of the room has begun to shift and swirl as the owner of the voice arrives We see first a whirlpool of black then a splotch of red  an ascot  and then the beginnings of an impossibly long white face which is dominated by a single black sharks eye This is the real Mr Munshun the creature who can only live in Burnys head outside of Black House and its enchanted environs Soon he will be entirely here he will pull Burny into wakefulness torture him into wakefulness if necessary and he will put Burny to use while there is still use to be gotten from him For Mr Munshun cannot move Ty from his cell in the Black House Once he is in EndWorld  Burnys Sheol  things will be different At last Burnys eyes open His gnarled hands which have spilled so much blood now reach down to feel the dampness of his own blood seeping through his shirt He looks sees what has bloomed there and lets out a scream of horror and cowardice It does not strike him as just that after murdering so many children he should have been mortally wounded by a blind man it strikes him as hideous unfair For the first time he is visited by an extremely unpleasant idea What if theres more to pay for the things he has done over the course of his long career He has seen EndWorld he has seen Conger Road which winds through it to Dintah The blasted burning landscape surrounding Conger Road is like hell and surely Antak the Big Combination is hell itself What if such a place waits for him What if  Theres a horrible paralyzing pain in his guts Mr Munshun now almost fully materialized has reached out and twisted one smoky notquitetransparent hand in the wound Henry inflicted with his switchblade knife Burny squeals Tears run down the old childmurderers cheeks Dont hurt me Zen do ass I zay I cant Burny snivels Im dying Look at all the blood Do you think I can get past something like this Im eightyfive fucking years old Duff brayyg BurnBurn    but dere are zose on zosser zide who could hill you off your wunds Mr Munshun like Black House itself is hard to look at He shivers in and out of focus Sometimes that hideously long face it obscures most of his body like the bloated head of a caricature on some newspapers oped page has two eyes sometimes just one Sometimes there seem to be tufted snarls of orange hair leaping up from his distended skull and sometimes Mr Munshun appears to be as bald as Yul Brynner Only the red lips and the fangy pointed teeth that lurk inside them remain fairly constant Burny eyes his accomplice with a degree of hope His hands meanwhile continue to explore his stomach which is now hard and bloated with lumps He suspects the lumps are clots Oh that someone should have hurt him so badly That wasnt supposed to happen That was never supposed to happen He was supposed to be protected He was supposed to  It iss not even peeyond ze realm of bossibility Mr Munshun says zat ze yearz could be rawled avey vrum you jusst as ze stunn vas rawled avey from ze mouse of Cheezus Chrizzes doom To be young again Burny says and exhales a low harsh sigh His breath stinks of blood and spoilage Yes Id like that Of gorse And soch zings are bossible Mr Munshun says nodding his grotesquely unstable face Soch gifts are ze abbalahs to giff But zey are not bromised Charles my liddle munching munchkin But I can make you one bromise The creature in the black evening suit and red ascot leaps forward with dreadful agility His longfingered hand darts again into Chummy Burnsides shirt this time clenches into a fist and produces a pain beyond any the old monster has ever dreamed of in his own life    although he has inflicted this and more on the innocent Mr Munshuns reeking countenance pushes up to Burnys The single eye glares Do you feel dat Burny Do you you mizzerable old bag of dirt and zorrow Hoho haha of gorse you do It iss your indestines I haff in my hand Und if you do not mooff now

huge forehead and taps it above the eyes for the moment Burny sees two of them and then the second is once more gone Understand Yes Yes His guts are on fire And still the hand in his shirt twists and twists The terrible highway of Mr Munshuns face hangs before him Ze station  where you brought the other sbecial ones YES Mr Munshun lets go He steps back Mercifully for Burny he is beginning to grow insubstantial again to discorporate Yellowed clippings swim into view not behind him but through him Yet the single eye hangs in the air above the paling blotch of the ascot Mayg zure he vears za cab Ziss one ezbeshully must wear za cab Burnside nods eagerly He still smells faintly of My Sin perfume The cap yes I have the cap Be gareful Burny You are old und hurt Ze bouy is young und desberate Flitt of foot If you let him get avey   In spite of the pain Burny smiles One of the children getting away from him Even one of the special ones What an idea Dont worry he says Just    if you speak to him    to Abbalahdoon    tell him Im not past it yet If he makes me better he wont regret it And if he makes me young again Ill bring him a thousand young A thousand Breakers Fading and fading Now Mr Munshun is again just a glow a milky disturbance on the air of Burnys sitting room deep in the house he abandoned only when he realized he really did need someone to take care of him in his sunset years Bring him just dis vun BurnBurn Bring him just dis vun und you vill be revarded Mr Munshun is gone Burny stands and bends over the horsehair sofa Doing it squeezes his belly and the resulting pain makes him scream but he doesnt stop He reaches into the darkness and pulls out a battered black leather sack He grasps its top and leaves the room limping and clutching at his bleeding distended belly And what of Tyler Marshall who has existed through most of these many pages as little more than a rumor How badly has he been hurt How frightened is he Has he managed to retain his sanity As to his physical condition hes got a concussion but thats already healing The Fisherman has otherwise done no more than stroke his arm and his buttocks a creepy touch that made Tyler think of the witch in Hansel and Gretel Mentally    would you be shocked to hear that while Mr Munshun is goading Burny onward Fred and Judys boy is happy He is He is happy And why not Hes at Miller Park The Milwaukee Brewers have confounded all the pundits this year all the doomsayers who proclaimed theyd be in the cellar by July Fourth Well its still relatively early but the Fourth has come and gone and the Brew Crew has returned to Miller tied for first place with Cincinnati They are in the hunt in large part due to the bat of Richie Sexson who came over to Milwaukee from the Cleveland Indians and who has been really pickin taters in the pungent terminology of George Rathbun They are in the hunt and Ty is at the game EXCELLENT Not only is he there hes got a frontrow seat Next to him  big sweating redfaced a Kingsland beer in one hand and another tucked away beneath his seat for emergencies  is the Gorgeous George himself bellowing at the top of his leather lungs Jeromy Burnitz of the Crew has just been called out at first on a bangbang play and while there can be no doubt that the Cincinnati shortstop handled the ball well and got rid of it fast there can also be no doubt at least not in George Rathbuns mind that Burnitz was safe He rises in the twilight his sweaty bald pate glowing beneath a sweetly lavender sky a foamy rill of beer rolling up one cocked forearm his blue eyes twinkling you can tell he sees a lot with those eyes just about everything and Ty waits for it they all wait for it and here it is that avatar of summer in the Coulee Country that wonderful bray that means everything is okay terror has been denied and slippage has been canceled COME ON UMP GIVE US A BREAK GIVE US A FREEEEAKIN BRAYYYYK EVEN A BLIND MAN COULD SEE HE WAS SAFE The crowd on the firstbase side goes wild at the sound of that cry none wilder than the fourteen or so people sitting behind the banner reading MILLER PARK WELCOMES GEORGE RATHBUN AND THE WINNERS OF THIS YEARS KDCU BREWER BASH Ty is jumping up and down laughing waving his Brew Crew hat What makes this doubly boss is that he thought he forgot to enter the contest this year He guesses his father or perhaps his mother entered it for him    and he won Not the grand prize which was getting to be the Brew Crews batboy for the entire Cincinnati series but what he got besides this excellent seat with the other winners that is is in his opinion even better Of course Richie Sexson isnt Mark McGwire  nobody can hit the tar out of the ball like Big Mac  but Sexson has been awesome for the Brewers this year just awesome and Tyler Marshall has won  Someone is shaking his foot Ty attempts to pull away not wanting to lose this dream this most excellent refuge from the horror that has befallen him but the hand is relentless It shakes It shakes and shakes Waygup a voice snarls and the dream begins to darken George Rathbun turns to Ty and the boy sees an amazing thing the eyes that were such a shrewd sharp blue only a few seconds ago have gone dull and milky Cripe hes blind Ty thinks George Rathbun really is a  Waygup the growling voice says Its closer now In a moment the dream will wink out entirely Before it does George speaks to him The voice is quiet totally unlike the sportscasters usual brash bellow Helps on the way he says So be cool you little cat Be   WayGUP you shit The grip on his ankle is crushing paralyzing With a cry of protest Ty opens his eyes This is how he rejoins the world and our tale He remembers where he is immediately Its a cell with reddishgray iron bars halfway along a stone corridor lit with cobwebby electric bulbs Theres a dish of some sort of stew in one corner In the other is a bucket in which he is supposed to pee or take a dump if he has to  so far he hasnt thank goodness The only other thing in the room is a raggedy old futon from which Burny has just dragged him All right Burny says Awake at last Thats good Now get up On your feet asswipe I dont have time to fuck with you Tyler gets up A wave of dizziness rolls through him and he puts his hand to the top of his head There is a spongy crusted place there Touching it sends a bolt of pain all the way down to his jaws which clench But it also drives the dizziness away He looks at his hand There are flakes of scab and dried blood on his palm Thats where he hit me with his damned rock Any harder and I would have been playing a harp But the old man has been hurt somehow too His shirt is covered with blood his wrinkled ogres face is waxy and pallid Behind him the cell door is open Ty measures the distance to the hallway hoping hes not being too obvious about it But Burny has been in this game a long time He has had more than one liddle one dry to esscabe on hiz bledding foodzies oh ho He reaches into his bag and brings out a black gadget with a pistol grip and a stainless steel nozzle at the tip Know what this is Tyler Burny asks Taser Ty says Isnt it Burny grins revealing the stumps of his teeth Smart boy A TVwatching boy Ill be bound Its a Taser yes But a special type  itll drop a cow at thirty yards Understand You try to run boy Ill bring you down like a ton of bricks Come out here Ty steps out of the cell He has no idea where this horrible old man means to take him but theres a certain relief just in being free of the cell The futon was the worst He knows somehow that he hasnt been the only kid to cry himself to sleep on it with an aching heart and an aching lumpy head nor the tenth Nor probably the fiftieth Turn to your left Ty does Now the old man is behind him A moment later he feels the bony fingers grip the right cheek of his bottom Its not the first time the old man has done this each time it happens hes reminded again of the witch in Hansel and Gretel asking the lost children to stick their arms out of their cage but this time his touch is different Weaker Die soon Ty thinks and the thought  its cold collectedness  is very very Judy Die soon old man so I dont have to This one is mine the old man says    but he sounds out of breath no longer quite sure of himself Ill bake half fry the rest With bacon I dont think youll be able to eat much Ty says surprised at the calmness of his own voice Looks like somebody ventilated your stomach pretty g   There is a crackling accompanied by a hideous jittery burning sensation in his left shoulder Ty screams and staggers against the wall across the corridor from his cell trying to clutch the wounded place trying not to cry trying to hold on to just a little of his beautiful dream about being at the game with George Rathbun and the other KDCU Brewer Bash winners He knows he actually did forget to enter this year but in dreams such things dont matter Thats whats so beautiful about them Oh but it hurts so bad And despite all his efforts  all the Judy Marshall in him  the tears begin to flow You want another un the old man gasps He sounds both sick and hysterical and even a kid Tys age knows thats a dangerous combination You want another un just for good luck No Ty gasps Dont zap me again please dont Then start walkin And no more smart goddamn remarks Ty starts to walk Somewhere he can hear water dripping Somewhere very faint he can hear the laughing caw of a crow  probably the same one that tricked him and how hed like to have Ebbies  and blow its evil shiny black feathers off The outside world seems lightyears away But George Rathbun told him help was on the way and sometimes the things you heard in dreams came true His very own mother told him that once and long before she started to go all wonky in the head too They come to a stairway that seems to circle down forever Up from the depths comes a smell of sulfur and a roast of heat Faintly he can hear what might be screams and moans The clank of machinery is louder There are ominous creaking sounds that might be belts and chains Ty pauses thinking the old guy wont zap him again unless he absolutely has to Because Ty might fall down this long circular staircase Might hit the place on his head the old guy already clipped with the rock or break his neck or tumble right off the side And the old guy wants him alive at least for now Ty doesnt know why but he knows this intuition is true Where are we going mister Youll find out Burny says in his tight outofbreath voice And if you think I dont dare zap you while were on the stairs my little friend youre very mistaken Now get walking Tyler Marshall starts down the stairs descending past vast galleries and balconies around and down around and down Sometimes the air smells of putrid cabbage Sometimes it smells of burned candles Sometimes of wet rot He counts a hundred and fifty steps then stops counting His thighs are burning Behind him the old man is gasping and twice he stumbles cursing and holding the ancient banister Fall old man Ty chants inside his head Fall and die fall and die But at last they are at the bottom They arrive in a circular room with a dirty glass ceiling Above them gray sky hangs down like a filthy bag There are plants oozing out of broken pots sending greedy feelers across a floor of broken orange bricks Ahead of them two doors  French doors Ty thinks they are called  stand open Beyond them is a crumbling patio surrounded by ancient trees Some are palms Some  the ones with the hanging ropy vines  might be banyans Others he doesnt know One thing hes sure of they are no longer in Wisconsin Standing on the patio is an object he knows very well Something from his own world Tyler Marshalls eyes well up again at the sight of it which is almost like the sight of a face from home in a hopelessly foreign place Stop monkeyboy The old man sounds out of breath Turn around When Tyler does hes pleased to see that the blotch on the old mans shirt has spread even farther Fingers of blood now stretch all the way to his shoulders and the waistband of his baggy old blue jeans has gone a muddy black But the hand holding the Taser is rocksteady God damn you Tyler thinks God damn you to hell The old man has put his bag on a little table He simply stands where he is for a moment getting his breath Then he rummages in the bag something in there utters a faint metallic clink and brings out a soft brown cap Its the kind guys like Sean Connery sometimes wear in the movies The old man holds it out Put it on And if you try to grab my hand Ill zap you Tyler takes the cap His fingers expecting the texture of suede are surprised by something metallic almost like tinfoil He feels an unpleasant buzzing in his hand like a mild version of the Tasers jolt He looks at the old man pleadingly Do I have to Burny raises the Taser and bares his teeth in a silent grin Reluctantly Ty puts the cap on This time the buzzing fills his head For a moment he cant think    and then the feeling passes leaving him with an odd sense of weakness in his muscles and a throbbing at his temples Special boys need special toys Burny says and it comes out sbecial boyz sbecial toyz As always Mr Munshuns ridiculous accent has rubbed off a little thickening that touch of South Chicago Henry detected on the  tape Now we can go out Because with the cap on Im safe Ty thinks but the idea breaks up and drifts away almost as soon as it comes He tries to think of his middle name and realizes he cant He tries to think of the bad crows name and cant get that either  was it something like Corgi No thats a kind of dog The cap is messing him up he realizes and thats what its supposed to do Now they pass through the open doors and onto the patio The air is redolent with the smell of the trees and bushes that surround the back side of Black House a smell that is heavy and cloying Fleshy somehow The gray sky seems almost low enough to touch Ty can smell sulfur and something bitter and electric and juicy The sound of machinery is much louder out here The thing Ty recognized sitting on the broken bricks is an EZGo golf cart The Tiger Woods model My dad sells these Ty says At Goltzs where he works Where do you think it came from asswipe Get in Behind the wheel Ty looks at him amazed His blue eyes perhaps thanks to the effects of the cap have grown bloodshot and rather confused Im not old enough to drive Oh youll be fine A baby could drive this baby Behind the wheel Ty does as he is told In truth he has driven one of these in the lot at Goltzs with his father sitting watchfully beside him in the passenger seat Now the hideous old man is easing himself into that same place groaning and holding his perforated midsection The Taser is in the other hand however and the steel tip remains pointed at Ty The key is in the ignition Ty turns it Theres a click from the battery beneath them The dashboard light reading CHARGE glows bright green Now all he has to do is push the accelerator pedal And steer of course Good so far the old man says He takes his right hand off his middle and points with a bloodstained finger Ty sees a path of discolored gravel  once before the trees and underbrush encroached it was probably a driveway  leading away from the house Now go And go slow Speed and Ill zap you Try to crash us and Ill break your wrist for you Then you can drive onehanded Ty pushes down on the accelerator The golf cart jerks forward The old man lurches curses and waves the Taser threateningly It would be easier if I could take off the cap Ty says Please Im pretty sure that if youd just let me   No Cap stays Drive Ty pushes down gently on the accelerator The EZGo rolls across the patio its brandnew rubber tires crunching on broken shards of brick Theres a bump as they leave the pavement and go rolling up the driveway Heavy fronds  they feel damp sweaty  brush Tylers arms He cringes The golf cart swerves Burny jabs the Taser at the boy snarling Next time you get the juice Its a promise A snake goes writhing across the overgrown gravel up ahead and Ty utters a little scream through his clenched teeth He doesnt like snakes didnt even want to touch the harmless little corn snake Mrs Locher brought to school and this thing is the size of a python with ruby eyes and fangs that prop its mouth open in a perpetual snarl Go Drive The Taser waving in his face The cap buzzing faintly in his ears Behind his ears The drive curves to the left Some sort of tree burdened with what look like tentacles leans over them The tips of the tentacles tickle across Tys shoulders and the gooseprickled haironend nape of his neck Ourr boyy    He hears this in his head in spite of the cap Its faint its distant but its there Ourrrrr boyyyyy    yesssss    ourrrrs    Burny is grinning Hear em dontcha They like you So do I Were all friends here dont you see The grin becomes a grimace He clutches his bloody middle again Goddamned blind old fool he gasps Then suddenly the trees are gone The golf cart rolls out onto a sullen crumbling plain The bushes dwindle and Ty sees that farther along they give way entirely to a crumbled rocky scree hills rise and fall beneath that sullen gray sky A few birds of enormous size wheel lazily A shaggy slumpshouldered creature staggers down a narrow defile and is gone from sight before Ty can see exactly what it is    not that he wanted to The thud and pound of machinery is stronger shaking the earth The crump of pile drivers the clash of ancient gears the squall of cogs Tyler can feel the golf carts steering wheel thrumming in his hands Ahead of them the driveway ends in a wide road of beaten earth Along the far side of it is a wall of round white stones That thing you hear thats the Crimson Kings power plant Burny says He speaks with pride but there is more than a tinge of fear beneath it The Big Combination A million children have died on its belts and a zillion more to come for all I know But thats not for you Tyler You might have a future after all First though Ill have my piece of you Yes indeed His bloodstreaked hand reaches out and caresses the top of Tys buttock A good agents entitled to ten percent Even an old buzzard like me knows that The hand draws back Good thing Ty has been on the verge of screaming holding the sound back only by thinking of sitting at Miller Park with good old George Rathbun If Id really entered the Brewer Bash he thinks none of this would have happened But he thinks that may not actually be true Some things are meant to be thats all Meant He just hopes that what this horrible old creature wants is not one of them Turn left Burny grunts settling back Three miles Give or take And as Tyler makes the turn he realizes the ribbons of mist rising from the ground arent mist at all Theyre ribbons of smoke Sheol Burny says as if reading his mind And this is the only way through it  Conger Road Get off it and there are things out there thatd pull you to pieces just to hear you scream My friend told me where to take you but there might be just a leedle change of plan His painwracked face takes on a sulky cast Ty thinks it makes him look extraordinarily stupid He hurt me Pulled my guts I dont trust him And in a horrible childs singsong Carl Bierstone dont trust Mr Munshun Not no more Not no more Ty says nothing He concentrates on keeping the golf cart in the middle of Conger Road He risks one look back but the house in its ephemeral wallow of tropical greenery is gone blocked from view by the first of the eroded hills Hell have whats his but Ill have whats mine Do you hear me boy When Ty says nothing Burny brandishes the Taser Do you hear me you asswipe monkey Yeah Ty says Yeah sure Why dont you die God if Youre there why dont You just reach down and put Your finger on his rotten heart and stop it from beating When Burny speaks again his voice is sly You looked at the wall on tother side but I dont think you looked close enough Better take another gander Tyler looks past the slumped old man For a moment he doesnt understand    and then he does The big white stones stretching endlessly away along the far side of Conger Road arent stones at all Theyre skulls What is this place Oh God how he wants his mother How he wants to go home Beginning to cry again his brain numbed and buzzing beneath the cap that looks like cloth but isnt Ty pilots the golf cart deeper and deeper into the furnacelands Into Sheol Rescue  help of any kind  has never seemed so far away WHEN JACK AND Dale step into the airconditioned cool the Sand Bar is empty except for three people Beezer and Doc are at the bar with soft drinks in front of them  an End Times sign if there ever was one Jack thinks Far back in the shadows any further and hed be in the dives primitive kitchen Stinky Cheese is lurking There is a vibe coming off the two bikers a bad one and Stinky wants no part of it For one thing hes never seen Beezer and Doc without Mouse Sonny and Kaiser Bill For another    oh God its the California detective and the freakin chief of police The jukebox is dark and dead but the TV is on and Jacks not exactly surprised to see that todays Matinee Movie on AMC features his mother and Woody Strode He fumbles for the name of the film and after a moment it comes to him Execution Express You dont want to be in on this Bea Woody says  in this film Lily plays a Boston heiress named Beatrice Lodge who comes west and turns outlaw mostly to spite her straitlaced father This is looking like the gangs last ride Good Lily says Her voice is stony her eyes stonier The picture is crap but as always she is dead on character Jack has to smile a little What Dale asks him The whole worlds gone crazy so whats to smile about On TV Woody Strode says What do you mean good The whole damn worlds gone crazy Jack Sawyer says very softly Were going to gun down as many as we can Let them know we were here On the screen Lily says the same thing to Woody The two of them are about to step aboard the Execution Express and heads will roll  the good the bad and the ugly Dale looks at his friend dazed I know most of her lines Jack says almost apologetically She was my mother you see Before Dale can answer supposing any answer came to mind Jack joins Beezer and Doc at the bar He looks up at the Kingsland Ale clock next to the television  It should be high noon  in situations like this its always supposed to be high noon isnt it Jack Beezer says and gives him a nod How ya doin buddy Not too bad You boys carrying Doc lifts his vest disclosing the butt of a pistol Its a Colt  Beez has got one of the same Good iron all registered and proper He glances at Dale You along for the ride are you Its my town Dale says and the Fisherman just murdered my uncle I dont understand very much of what Jacks been telling me but I know that much And if he says theres a chance we can get Judy Marshalls boy back I think wed better try it He glances at Jack I brought you a service revolver One of the Ruger automatics Its out in the car Jack nods absently He doesnt care much about the guns because once theyre on the other side theyll almost certainly change into something else Spears possibly javelins Maybe even slingshots Its going to be the Execution Express all right  the Sawyer Gangs last ride  but he doubts if itll be much like the one in this old movie from the sixties Although hell take the Ruger There might be work for it on this side One never knows does one Ready to saddle up Beezer asks Jack His eyes are deepsocketed haunted Jack guesses the Beez didnt get much sleep last night He glances up at the clock again and decides  for no other reason than pure superstition  that he doesnt want to start for the Black House just yet after all Theyll leave the Sand Bar when the hands on the Kingsland clock stand at straightup noon no sooner The Gary Cooper witching hour Almost he says Have you got the map Beez I got it but I also got an idea you dont really need it do you Maybe not Jack allows but Ill take all the insurance I can get Beezer nods Im down with that I sent my old lady back to her mas in Idaho After what happened with poor old Mousie I didnt have to argue too hard Never sent her back before man Not even the time we had our bad rumble with the Pagans But I got a terrible feeling about this He hesitates then comes right out with it Feel like none of us are coming back Jack puts a hand on Beezers meaty forearm Not too late to back out I wont think any less of you Beezer mulls it over then shakes his head Amy comes to me in my dreams sometimes We talk How am I gonna talk to her if I dont stand up for her No man Im in Jack looks at Doc Im with Beez Doc says Sometimes you just gotta stand up Besides after what happened to Mouse    He shrugs God knows what we might have caught from him Or fucking around out there at that house Future might be short after that no matter what Howd it turn out with Mouse Jack inquires Doc gives a short laugh Just like he said Around three oclock this morning we just washed old Mousie down the tub drain Nothing left but foam and hair He grimaces as if his stomach is trying to revolt then quickly downs his glass of Coke If were going to do something Dale blurts lets just do it Jack glances up at the clock Its  now Soon Im not afraid of dying Beezer says abruptly Im not even afraid of that devil dog It can be hurt if you pour enough bullets into it we found that out Its how that fucking place makes you feel The air gets thick Your head aches and your muscles get weak And then with a surprisingly good British accent Hangovers aint in it old boy My gut was the worst Doc says That and    But he falls silent He doesnt ever talk about Daisy Temperly the girl he killed with an errant scratch of ink on a prescription pad but he can see her now as clearly as the makebelieve cowboys on the Sand Bars TV Blond she was With brown eyes Sometimes hed made her smile even in her pain by singing that song to her the Van Morrison song about the browneyed girl Im going for Mouse Doc says I have to But that place    its a sick place You dont know man You may think you understand but you dont I understand more than you think Jack says Now its his turn to stop to consider Do Beezer and Doc remember the word Mouse spoke before he died Do they remember dyamba They should they were right there they saw the books slide off their shelf and hang in the air when Jack spoke that word    but Jack is almost sure that if he asked them right now theyd give him looks that are puzzled or maybe just blank Partly because dyamba is hard to remember like the precise location of the lane that leads from sane antislippage Highway  to Black House Mostly however because the word was for him for Jack Sawyer the son of Phil and Lily He is the leader of the Sawyer Gang because he is different He has traveled and travel is broadening How much of this should he tell them None of it probably But they must believe and for that to happen he must use Mouses word He knows in his heart that he must be careful about using it  dyamba is like a gun you can only fire it so many times before it clicks empty  and he hates to use it here so far from Black House but he will Because they must believe If they dont their brave quest to rescue Ty is apt to end with them all kneeling in Black Houses front yard noses bleeding eyes bleeding vomiting and spitting teeth into the poison air Jack can tell them that most of the poison comes from their own minds but talk is cheap They must believe Besides its still only  Lester he says The bartender has been lurking forgotten by the swing door into the kitchen Not eavesdropping  hes too far away for that  but not wanting to move and attract attention Now it seems that hes attracted some anyway Have you got honey Jack asks Hhoney Bees make it Lester Mokes make money and bees make honey Something like comprehension dawns in Lesters eyes Yeah sure I keep it to make Kentucky Getaways Also   Set it on the bar Jack tells him Dale stirs restively If times as short as you think Jack   This is important He watches Lester Moon put a small plastic squeeze bottle of honey on the bar and finds himself thinking of Henry How Henry would have enjoyed the pocket miracle Jack is about to perform But of course he wouldnt have needed to perform such a trick for Henry Wouldnt have needed to waste part of the precious words power Because Henry would have believed at once just as he had believed he could drive from Trempealeau to French Landing  hell to the fucking moon  if someone just dared to give him the chance and the car keys Ill bring it to you Lester says bravely I aint afraid Just set it down on the far end of the bar Jack tells him Thatll be fine He does as asked The squeeze bottle is shaped like a bear It sits there in a beam of sixminutestonoon sun On the television the gunplay has started Jack ignores it He ignores everything focusing his mind as brightly as a point of light through a magnifying glass For a moment he allows that tight focus to remain empty and then he fills it with a single word DYAMBA At once he hears a low buzzing It swells to a drone Beezer Doc and Dale look around For a moment nothing happens and then the sunshiny doorway darkens Its almost as if a very small rain cloud has floated into the Sand Bar  Stinky Cheese lets out a strangled squawk and goes flailing backward Wasps he shouts Them are wasps Get clear But they are not wasps Doc and Lester Moon might not recognize that but both Beezer and Dale Gilbertson are country boys They know bees when they see one Jack meanwhile only looks at the swarm Sweat has popped out on his forehead Hes concentrating with all his might on what he wants the bees to do They cloud around the squeeze bottle of honey so thickly it almost disappears Then their humming deepens and the bottle begins to rise wobbling from side to side like a tiny missile with a really shitty guidance system Then slowly it wavers its way toward the Sawyer Gang The squeeze bottle is riding a cushion of bees six inches above the bar Jack holds his hand out and open The squeeze bottle glides into it Jack closes his fingers Docking complete For a moment the bees rise around his head their drone competing with Lily who is shouting Save the tall bastard for me Hes the one who raped Stella Then they stream out the door and are gone The Kingsland Ale clock stands at  Holy Mary mothera God Beezer whispers His eyes are huge almost popping out of their sockets Youve been hiding your light under a bushel looks like to me Dale says His voice is unsteady From the end of the bar there comes a soft thud Lester Stinky Cheese Moon has for the first time in his life fainted Were going to go now Jack says Beez you and Doc lead Well be right behind you in Dales car When you get to the lane and the NO TRESPASSING sign dont go in Just park your scoots Well go the rest of the way in the car but first were going to put a little of this under our noses Jack holds up the squeeze bottle Its a plastic version of WinniethePooh grimy around the middle where Lester seizes it and squeezes it We might even dab some in our nostrils A little sticky but better than projectile vomiting Confirmation and approval are dawning in Dales eyes Like putting Vicks under your nose at a murder scene he says Its nothing like that at all but Jack nods Because this is about believing Will it work Doc asks doubtfully Yes Jack replies Youll still feel some discomfort I dont doubt that a bit but itll be mild Then were going to cross over to    well to someplace else After that all bets are off I thought the kid was in the house Beez says I think hes probably been moved And the house    its a kind of wormhole It opens on another    World is the first word to come into Jacks mind but somehow he doesnt think it is a world not in the Territories sense On another place On the TV Lily has just taken the first of about six bullets She dies in this one and as a kid Jack always hated that but at least she goes down shooting She takes quite a few of the bastards with her including the tall one who raped her friend and that is good Jack hopes he can do the same More than anything however he hopes he can bring Tyler Marshall back to his mother and father Beside the television the clock flicks from  to  Come on boys Jack Sawyer says Lets saddle up and ride Beezer and Doc mount their iron horses Jack and Dale stroll toward the chief of polices car then stop as a Ford Explorer bolts into the Sand Bars lot skidding on the gravel and hurrying toward them pulling a rooster tail of dust into the summer air Oh Christ Dale murmurs Jack can tell from the too small baseball cap sitting ludicrously on the drivers head that its Fred Marshall But if Tys father thinks hes going to join the rescue mission hed better think again Thank God I caught you Fred shouts as he all but tumbles from his truck Thank God Who next Dale asks softly Wendell Green Tom Cruise George W Bush arm in arm with Miss Fucking Universe Jack barely hears him Fred is wrestling a long package from the bed of his truck and all at once Jack is interested The thing in that package could be a rifle but somehow he doesnt think thats what it is Jack suddenly feels like a squeeze bottle being levitated by bees not so much acting as acted upon He starts forward Hey bro lets roll Beezer yells Beneath him his Harley explodes into life Lets   Then Beezer cries out So does Doc who jerks so hard he almost dumps the bike idling between his thighs Jack feels something like a bolt of lightning go through his head and he reels forward into Fred who is also shouting incoherently For a moment the two of them appear to be either dancing with the long wrapped object Fred has brought them or wrestling over it Only Dale Gilbertson  who hasnt been to the Territories hasnt been close to Black House and who is not Ty Marshalls father  is unaffected Yet even he feels something rise in his head something like an interior shout The world trembles All at once there seems to be more color in it more dimension What was that he shouts Good or bad Good or bad What the hell is going on here For a moment none of them answer They are too dazed to answer While a swarm of bees is floating a squeeze bottle of honey along the top of a bar in another world Burny is telling Ty Marshall to face the wall goddamnit just face the wall They are in a foul little shack The sounds of clashing machinery are much closer Ty can also hear screams and sobs and harsh yells and what can only be the whistling crack of whips They are very near the Big Combination now Ty has seen it a great crisscrossing confusion of metal rising into the clouds from a smoking pit about half a mile east It looks like a madmans conception of a skyscraper a Rube Goldberg collection of chutes and cables and belts and platforms everything run by the marching staggering children who roll the belts and pull the great levers Redtinged smoke rises from it in stinking fumes Twice as the golf cart rolled slowly along Ty at the wheel and Burny leaning askew in the passenger seat with the Taser pointed squads of freakish green men passed them Their features were scrambled their skin plated and reptilian They wore halfcured leather tunics from which tufts of fur still started in places Most carried spears several had whips Overseers Burny said They keep the wheels of progress turning He began to laugh but the laugh turned into a groan and the groan into a harsh and breathless shriek of pain Good Ty thought coldly And then for the first time employing a favorite word of Ebbie Wexlers Die soon you motherfucker About two miles from the back of Black House they came to a huge wooden platform on their left A gantrylike thing jutted up from it A long post projected out from the top almost to the road A number of frayed rope ends dangled from it twitching in the hot and sulfurous breeze Under the platform on dead ground that never felt the sun were litters of bones and ancient piles of white dust To one side was a great mound of shoes Why theyd take the clothes and leave the shoes was a question Ty probably couldnt have answered even had he not been wearing the cap sbecial toyz for sbecial boyz but a disjointed phrase popped into his head custom of the country He had an idea that was something his father sometimes said but he couldnt be sure He couldnt even remember his fathers face not clearly The gibbet was surrounded by crows They jostled one another and turned to follow the humming progress of the EZGo None was the special crow the one with the name Ty could no longer remember but he knew why they were here They were waiting for fresh flesh to pluck thats what they were doing Waiting for newly dead eyes to gobble Not to mention the bare toesies of the shoedeprived dead Beyond the pile of discarded rotting footwear a broken track led off to the north over a fuming hill Station House Road Burny said He seemed to be talking more to himself than to Ty at that point was perhaps edging into delirium Yet still the Taser pointed at Tys neck never wavering Thats where Im supposed to be taking the special boy Taging the sbecial bouy Thats where the special ones go Mr Munshuns gone to get the mono The EndWorld mono Once there were two others Patricia    and Blaine Theyre gone Went crazy Committed suicide Ty drove the cart and remained silent but he had to believe old BurnBurn was the one who had gone crazy crazier he reminded himself  He knew about monorails had even ridden one at Disney World in Orlando but monorails named Blaine and Patricia That was stupid Station House Road fell behind them Ahead the rusty red and iron gray of the Big Combination drew closer Ty could see moving ants on cruelly inclined belts Children Some from other worlds perhaps  worlds adjacent to this one  but many from his own Kids whose faces appeared for a while on milk cartons and then disappeared forever Kept a little longer in the hearts of their parents of course but eventually growing dusty even there turning from vivid memories into old photographs Kids presumed dead buried somewhere in shallow graves by perverts who had used them and then discarded them Instead they were here Some of them anyway Many of them Struggling to yank the levers and turn the wheels and move the belts while the yelloweyed greenskinned overseers cracked their whips As Ty watched one of the ant specks fell down the side of the convoluted steamwreathed building He thought he could hear a faint scream Or perhaps it was a cry of relief  Beautiful day Burny said faintly Ill enjoy it more when I get something to eat Having something to eat always    always perks me up His ancient eyes studied Ty tightening a little at the corners with sudden warmth Baby butts the best eatin but yours wont be bad Nope wont be bad at all He said to take you to the station but I aint sure hed give me my share My    commission Maybe hes honest    maybe hes still my friend    but I think Ill just take my share first and make sure Most agents take their ten percent off the top He reached out and poked Ty just below the beltline Even through his jeans the boy could feel the tough blunt edge of the old mans nail I think Ill take mine off the bottom A wheezy painful laugh and Ty was not exactly displeased to see a bright bubble of blood appear between the old mans cracked lips Off the bottom get it The nail poked the side of Tys buttock again I get it Ty said Youll be able to break just as well Burny said Its just that when you fart youll have to do the old onecheek sneak every time More wheezing laughter Yes he sounded delirious all right  delirious or on the verge of it  yet still the tip of the Taser remained rocksteady Keep on going boy Nother half a mile up the Conger Road Youll see a little shack with a tin roof down in a draw Its on the right Its a special place Special to me Turn in there Ty with no other choice obeyed And now  Do what I tell you Face the fucking wall Put your hands up and through those loops Ty couldnt define the word euphemism on a bet but he knows calling those metal circlets loops is bullshit Whats hanging from the rear wall are shackles Panic flutters in his brain like a flock of small birds threatening to obscure his thoughts Ty fights to hold on  fights with grim intensity If he gives in to panic starts to holler and scream hes going to be finished Either the old man will kill him in the act of carving him up or the old mans friend will take him away to some awful place Burny calls Dintah In either case Ty will never see his mother and father again Or French Landing But if he can keep his head    wait for his chance    Ah but its hard The cap hes wearing actually helps a little in this respect  it has a dulling effect that helps hold the panic at bay  but its still hard Because hes not the first kid the old man has brought here no more than he was the first to spend long slow hours in that cell back at the old mans house Theres a blackened greasecaked barbecue set up in the left corner of the shed underneath a tinplated smoke hole The grill is hooked up to a couple of gas bottles with LA RIVIERE PROPANE stenciled on the sides Hung on the wall are oven mitts spatulas tongs basting brushes and meat forks There are scissors and tenderizing hammers and at least four keenbladed carving knives One of the knives looks almost as long as a ceremonial sword Hanging beside that one is a filthy apron with YOU MAY KISS THE COOK printed on it The smell in the air reminds Ty of the VFW picnic his mom and dad took him to the previous Labor Day Maui Wowie it had been called because the people who went were supposed to feel like they were spending the day in Hawaii There had been a great big barbecue pit in the center of La Follette Park down by the river tended by women in grass skirts and men wearing loud shirts covered with birds and tropical foliage Whole pigs had been roasting over a glaring hole in the ground and the odor had been like the one in this shed Except the smell in here is stale    and old    and    And not quite pork Ty thinks Its  I should stand here and jaw at you all day you louse The Taser gives off a crackling sizzle Tingling debilitating pain sinks into the side of Tys neck His bladder lets go and he wets his pants He cant help it Is hardly aware of it in truth Somewhere in a galaxy far far away a hand that is trembling but still terribly strong thrusts Ty toward the back wall and the shackles that have been welded to steel plates about five and a half feet off the ground There Burny cries and gives a tired hysterical laugh Knew youd get one for good luck eventually Smart boy aintcha Little wisenheimer Now put your hands through them loops and lets have no more foolishness about it Ty has put out his hands in order to keep himself from crashing facefirst into the sheds rear wall His eyes are less than a foot from the wood and he is getting a very good look at the old layers of blood that coat it That plate it The blood has an ancient metallic reek Beneath his feet the ground feels spongy Jellylike Nasty This may be an illusion in the physical sense but Ty knows that what hes feeling is nonetheless quite real This is corpse ground The old man may not prepare his terrible meals here every time  may not have that luxury  but this is the place he likes As he said its special to him If I let him lock both of my hands into those shackles Ty thinks Ive had it Hell cut me up And once he starts cutting he may not be able to stop himself  not for this Mr Munching not for anyone So get ready That last is not like one of his own thoughts at all Its like hearing his mothers voice in his head His mother or someone like her Ty steadies The flock of panic birds is suddenly gone and he is as clearheaded as the cap will allow He knows what he must do Or try to do He feels the nozzle of the Taser slip between his legs and thinks of the snake wriggling across the overgrown driveway carrying its mouthful of fangs Put your hands through those loops right now or Im going to fry your balls like oysters Ersters it sounds like Okay Ty says He speaks in a high whiny voice He hopes he sounds scared out of his mind God knows it shouldnt be hard to sound that way Okay okay just dont hurt me Im doing it now see See He puts his hands through the loops They are big and loose Higher The growling voice is still in his ear but the Taser is gone from between his legs at least Shove em in as far as you can Ty does as he is told The shackles slide to a point just above his wrists His hands are like starfish in the gloom Behind him he hears that soft clinking noise again as Burny rummages in his bag Ty understands The cap may be scrambling his thoughts a little but this is too obvious to miss The old bastards got handcuffs in there Handcuffs that have been used many many times Hell cuff Tys wrists above the shackles and here Ty will stand  or dangle if he passes out  while the old monster carves him up Now listen Burny says He sounds out of breath but he also sounds lively again The prospect of a meal has refreshed him brought back a certain amount of his vitality Im pointin this shocker at you with one hand Im gonna slip a cuff around your left wrist with the other hand If you move    if you so much as twitch boy    you get the juice Understand Ty nods at the bloodstained wall I wont move he gibbers Honest I wont First one hand then the other Thats how I do it There is a revolting complacency in his voice The Taser presses between Tys shoulder blades hard enough to hurt Grunting with effort the old man leans over Tys left shoulder Ty can smell sweat and blood and age It is like Hansel and Gretel he thinks only he has no oven to push his tormentor into You know what to do Judy tells him coldly He may not give you a chance and if he doesnt he doesnt But if he does    A handcuff slips around his left wrist Burny is grunting softly repulsively in Tys ear The old man reaches    the Taser shifts    but not quite far enough Ty holds still as Burny snaps the handcuff shut and tightens it down Now Tys left hand is secured to the shed wall Dangling down from his left wrist by its steel chain is the cuff Burny intends to put on his right wrist The old man still panting effortfully moves to the right He reaches around Tys front groping for the dangling cuff The Taser is once more digging into Tys back If the old man gets hold of the cuff Tys goose is probably cooked in more ways than one And he almost does But the cuff slips out of his grip and instead of waiting for it to pendulum back to where he can grab it Burny leans farther forward The bony side of his face is planted against Tys right shoulder And when he leans to get the dangling handcuff Ty feels the touch of the Taser first lighten then disappear Now Judy screams inside Tys head Or perhaps it is Sophie Or maybe its both of them together Now Ty Its your chance there wont be another Ty pistons his right arm downward pulling free of the shackle It would do him no good to try to shove Burny away from him  the old monster outweighs him by sixty pounds or more  and Ty doesnt try He pulls away to his left instead putting excruciating pressure on his shoulder and on his left wrist which has been locked into the shackle holding it What   Burny begins and then Tys groping right hand has what it wants the loose dangling sac of the old mans balls He squeezes with all the force in his body He feels the monsters testicles squash toward each other feels one of them rupture and deflate Ty shouts a sound of dismay and horror and savage triumph all mingled together Burny caught entirely by surprise howls He tries to pull backward but Ty has him in a harpys grip His hand  so small so incapable or so you would think of any serious defense  has turned into a claw If ever there was a time to use the Taser this is it    but in his surprise Burnys hand has sprung open The Taser lies on the ancient bloodimpacted earth of the shed floor Let go of me That HURTS That hurr   Before he can finish Ty yanks forward on the spongy and deflating bag inside the old cotton pants he yanks with all the force of panic and something in there rips Burnys words dissolve in a liquid howl of agony This is more pain than he has ever imagined    certainly never in connection with himself But it is not enough Judys voice says its not and Ty might know it anyway He has hurt the old man  has given him what Ebbie Wexler would undoubtedly call a fuckin rupture  but its not enough He lets go and turns to his left pivoting on his shackled hand He sees the old man swaying before him in the shadows Beyond him the golf cart stands in the open door outlined against a sky filled with clouds and burning smoke The old monsters eyes are huge and disbelieving bulging with tears He gapes at the little boy who has done this Soon comprehension will return When it does Burny is apt to seize one of the knives from the wall  or perhaps one of the meat forks  and stab his chained prisoner to death screaming curses and oaths at him as he does so calling him a monkey a bastard a fucking asswipe Any thought of Tys great talent will be gone Any fear of what may happen to Burny himself if Mr Munshun  and the abbalah  is robbed of his prize will also be gone In truth Burny is nothing but a psychotic animal and in another moment his essential nature will break loose and vent itself on this tethered child Tyler Marshall son of Fred and the formidable Judy does not give Burny this chance During the last part of the drive he has thought repeatedly of what the old man said about Mr Munshun  he hurt me he pulled my guts  and hoped he might get his own opportunity to do some pulling Now its come Hanging from the shackle with his left arm pulled cruelly up he shoots his right hand forward Through the hole in Burnys shirt Through the hole Henry has made with his switchblade knife Suddenly Ty has hold of something ropy and wet He seizes it and pulls a roll of Charles Burnsides intestines out through the rip in his shirt Burnys head turns up toward the sheds ceiling His jaw snaps convulsively the cords on his wrinkled old neck stand out and he voices a great agonized bray He tries to pull away which may be the worst thing a man can do when someone has him by the liver and lights A bluegray fold of gut as plump as a sausage and perhaps still trying to digest Burnys last Maxton cafeteria meal comes out with the audible pop of a champagne cork leaving the neck of its bottle Charles Chummy Burnsides last words LET GO YOU LITTLE PIIIIG Tyler does not let go Instead he shakes the loop of intestine furiously from side to side like a terrier with a rat in its jaws Blood and yellowish fluid spray out of the hole in Burnys midsection Die Tyler hears himself screaming Die you old fuck GO ON AND DIE Burny staggers back another step His mouth drops open and part of an upper plate tumbles out and onto the dirt He is staring down at two loops of his own innards stretching like gristle from the gaping redblack front of his shirt to the awful childs right hand And he sees an even more terrible thing a kind of white glow has surrounded the boy It is feeding him more strength than he otherwise would have had Feeding him the strength to pull Burnys living guts right out of his body and how it hurt how it hurt how it dud dud dud hurrrrr  Die the boy screams in a shrill and breaking voice Oh please WONT YOU EVER DIE And at last  at long long last  Burny collapses to his knees His dimming gaze fixes on the Taser and he reaches one trembling hand toward it Before it can get far the light of consciousness leaves Burnys eyes He hasnt endured enough pain to equal even the hundredth part of the suffering he has inflicted but its all his ancient body can take He makes a harsh cawing sound deep in his throat then tumbles over backward more intestines pulling out of his lower abdomen as he does so He is unaware of this or of anything else Carl Bierstone also known as Charles Burnside also known as Chummy Burnside is dead For over thirty seconds nothing moves Tyler Marshall is alive but at first only hangs from the axis of his shackled left arm still clutching a loop of Burnys intestine in his right hand Clutching it in a death grip At last some sense of awareness informs his features He gets his feet under him and scrambles upright easing the all but intolerable pressure on the socket of his left shoulder He suddenly becomes aware that his right arm is splashed with gore all the way to the biceps and that hes got a handful of dead mans insides He lets go of them and bolts for the door not remembering that hes still chained to the wall until he is yanked back the socket of his shoulder once more bellowing with pain Youve done well the voice of JudySophie whispers But you have to get out of here and quick Tears start to roll down his dirty pallid face again and Ty begins to scream at the top of his voice Help me Somebody help me Im in the shed IM IN THE SHED Out in front of the Sand Bar Doc stays where he is with his scoot rumbling between his legs but Beezer turns his off levers the stand into place with one booted heel and walks over to Jack Dale and Fred Jack has taken charge of the wrapped object Tys father has brought them Fred meanwhile has gotten hold of Jacks shirt Dale tries to restrain the man but as far as Fred Marshalls concerned there are now only two people in the world him and Hollywood Jack Sawyer It was him wasnt it It was Ty That was my boy I heard him Yes Jack says It certainly was and you certainly did Hes gone rather pale Beezer sees but is otherwise calm Its absolutely not bothering him that the missing boys father has yanked his shirt out of his pants No all Jacks attention is on the wrapped package What in Gods name is going on here Dale asks plaintively He looks at Beezer Do you know The kids in a shed somewhere Beezer says Am I right about that Yes Jack says Fred abruptly lets go of Jacks shirt and staggers backward sobbing Jack pays no attention to him and makes no effort to tuck in the tail of his crumpled shirt Hes still looking at the package He halfexpects sugarpacket stamps but no this is just a case of plain old metered mail Whatever it is its been mailed Priority to Mr Tyler Marshall  Robin Hood Lane French Landing The return address has been stamped in red Mr George Rathbun KDCU  Peninsula Drive French Landing Below this stamped in large black letters EVEN A BLIND MAN CAN SEE THAT COULEE COUNTRY LOVES THE BREWER BASH Henry you never quit do you Jack murmurs Tears sting his eyes The idea of life without his old friend hits him all over again leaves him feeling helpless and lost and stupid and hurt What about Uncle Henry Dale asks Jack Uncle Henrys dead Jacks no longer so sure of that somehow Lets go Beezer says We got to get that kid Hes alive but he aint safe I got that clear as a bell Lets go for it We can figure the rest out later But Jack  who has not just heard Tylers shout but has for a moment seen through Tylers eyes  doesnt have much to figure out In fact figuring out now comes down to only one thing Ignoring both Beezer and Dale he steps toward Tys weeping father Fred Fred goes on sobbing Fred if you ever want to see your boy again you get hold of yourself right now and listen to me Fred looks up red eyes streaming The ridiculously small baseball cap still perches on his head Whats in this Fred It must be a prize in that contest George Rathbun runs every summer  the Brewer Bash But I dont know how Ty could have won something in the first place A couple of weeks ago he was pissing and moaning about how he forgot to enter He even asked if maybe Id entered the contest for him and I kind of    well I snapped at him Fresh tears begin running down Freds stubbly cheeks at the memory That was around the time Judy was getting    strange    I was worried about her and I just kind of    snapped at him You know Freds chest heaves He makes a watery hitching sound and his Adams apple bobs up and down He wipes an arm across his eyes And Ty    all he said was Thats all right Dad He didnt get mad at me didnt sulk or anything Because thats just the kind of boy he was That he is How did you know to bring it to me Your friend called Fred says He told me the postman had brought something and I had to bring it to you here right away Before you left He called you   He called me Travelin Jack Fred Marshall looks at him wonderingly Thats right All right Jack speaks gently almost absently Were going to get your boy now Ill come Ive got my deer rifle in the truck   And thats where its going to stay Go home Make a place for him Make a place for your wife And let us do what we have to do Jack looks first at Dale then at Beezer Come on he says Lets roll Five minutes later the FLPD chiefs car is speeding west on Highway  Directly ahead like an honor guard Beezer and Doc are riding side by side the sun gleaming on the chrome of their bikes Trees in full summer leaf crowd close to the road on either side Jack can feel the buzzing that is Black Houses signature starting to ramp up in his head He has discovered he can wall that noise off if he has to keep it from spreading and blanketing his entire thought process with static but its still damned unpleasant Dale has given him one of the Ruger s that are the police departments service weapons its now stuck in the waistband of his blue jeans He was surprised at how good the weight of it felt in his hand almost like a homecoming Guns may not be of much use in the world behind Black House but they have to get there first dont they And according to Beezer and Doc the approach is not exactly undefended Dale do you have a pocketknife Glove compartment Dale says He glances at the long package on Jacks lap I presume you want to open that You presume right Can you explain a few things while you do it Like whether or not once we get inside Black House we can expect Charles Burnside to jump out of a secret door with an axe and start   Chummy Burnsides days of jumping out at folks are all over Jack says Hes dead Ty Marshall killed him Thats what hit us outside the Sand Bar The chiefs car swerves so extravagantly  all the way across to the left side of the road  that Beezer looks back for a moment startled at what hes just seen in his rearview Jack gives him a hard quick wave  Go on dont worry about us  and Beez faces forward again What Dale gasps The old bastard was hurt but I have an idea that Ty still did one hell of a brave thing Brave and crafty both Jack is thinking that Henry softened Burnside up and Ty finished him up What George Rathbun would undoubtedly have called a honey of a double play How   Disemboweled him With his bare hands Hand Im pretty sure the other ones chained up somehow Dale is silent for a moment watching the motorcyclists ahead of him as they lean into a curve with their hair streaming out from beneath their token gestures at obeying Wisconsins helmet law Jack meanwhile is slitting open brown wrapping paper and revealing a long white carton beneath Something rolls back and forth inside Youre telling me that a tenyearold boy disemboweled a serial killer A serial cannibal You somehow know this Yes I find that extremely difficult to believe Based on the father I guess I can understand that Freds    A wimp is what comes to mind but that is both unfair and untrue Freds tenderhearted Jack says Judy though    Backbone Dale says She does have that Im told Jack gives his friend a humorless grin Hes got the buzzing confined to a small portion of his brain but in that one small portion its shrieking like a fire alarm Theyre almost there She certainly does he tells Dale And so does the boy Hes    brave What Jack has almost said is Hes a prince And hes alive Yes Chained in a shed somewhere Right Behind Burnsides house Uhhuh If Ive got the geography right that places him somewhere in the woods near Schubert and Gale Jack smiles and says nothing All right Dale says heavily What have I got wrong It doesnt matter Which is good because its impossible to explain Jack just hopes Dales mind is screwed down tightly because its apt to take one hell of a pounding in the next hour or so His fingernail slits the tape holding the box closed He opens it Theres bubble wrap beneath Jack pulls it out tosses it into the footwell and looks at Ty Marshalls Brewer Bash prize  a prize he won even though he apparently never entered the contest Jack lets out a little sigh of awe Theres enough kid left in him to react to the object that he sees even though he never played the game once he was too old for Little League Because theres something about a bat isnt there Something that speaks to our primitive beliefs about the purity of struggle and the strength of our team The home team Of the right and the white Surely Bernard Malamud knew it Jack has read The Natural a score of times always hoping for a different ending and when the movie offered him one he hated it always loving the fact that Roy Hobbs named his cudgel Wonderboy And never mind the critics with all their stuffy talk about the Arthurian legend and phallic symbols sometimes a cigar is just a smoke and sometimes a bat is just a bat A big stick Something to hit home runs with Holy wow Dale says glancing over And he looks younger Boyish Eyes wide So Jack isnt the only one it seems Whose bat Jack lifts it carefully from the box Written up the barrel in black Magic Marker is this message To Tyler Marshall Keep Slugging Your pal Richie Sexson Richie Sexson Jack says Whos Richie Sexson Big slugger for the Brewers Dale says Is he as good as Roy Hobbs Roy   Then Dale grins Oh in that movie Robert Redford right No I dont think   Hey what are you doing Still holding the bat in fact he almost bashes Dale in the right cheekbone with the end of it Jack reaches over and honks the horn Pull over he says This is it Those dopes were out here only yesterday and theyre going right past it Dale pulls over on the shoulder brings the cruiser to a jerky stop and puts it in park When he looks over at Jack his face has gone remarkably pale Oh man Jack  I dont feel so good Maybe it was breakfast Christ I hope Im not going to start puking That buzzing you hear in your head is that from breakfast Jack inquires Dales eyes go wide How do you   Because I hear it too And feel it in my stomach Its not your breakfast Its Black House Jack holds out the squeeze bottle Go on Dab some more around your nostrils Get some right up in Youll feel better Projecting absolute confidence Because its not about secret weapons or secret formulas its certainly not about honey Its about belief They have left the realm of the rational and have entered the realm of slippage Jack knows it for certain as soon as he opens the car door Ahead of him the bikes swerve and come back Beezer an impatient look on his face is shaking his head No no not here Dale joins Jack at the front of the car His face is still pale but the skin around and below his nose is shiny with honey and he looks steady enough on his feet Thanks Jack This is so much better I dont know how putting honey around my nose could affect my ears but the buzzings better too Its nothing but a low drone Wrong place Beezer bawls as he pulls his Harley up to the front of the cruiser Nope Jack says calmly looking at the unbroken woods Sunlight on green leaves contrasting with crazy black zigzags of shadow Everything trembling and unsteady making mock of perspective This is it The hideout of Mr Munshun and the Black House Gang as the Duke never said Now Docs bike adds to the din as he pulls up next to Beezer Beez is right We were just out here yesterday ydamn fool Dont you think you know what were talking about This is just scrap woods on both sides Dale chimes in He points across the road where fifty yards or so southeast of their position yellow police tape flutters from a pair of trees Thats the lane to Eds Eats there The place we want is probably beyond it   Even though you know its here Jack thinks Marvels really Why else have you gone and smeared yourself with honey like Poohbear on a lucky day He shifts his gaze to Beezer and Doc who are also looking remarkably unwell Jack opens his mouth to speak to them    and something flutters at the upper edge of his vision He restrains his natural impulse to look up and define the source of that movement Something  probably the old Travelin Jack part of him  thinks it would be a very bad idea to do that Something is watching them already Better if it doesnt know its been spotted He puts the Richie Sexson bat down leaning it against the side of the idling cruiser He takes the honey from Dale and holds it out to the Beez Here you go he says lather up Theres no point in it you goddamn fool Beezer cries in exasperation This    aint    the place Your nose is bleeding Jack says mildly Just a little Yours too Doc Doc wipes a finger under his nose and looks at the red smear startled He starts But I know this isnt   That flutter again at the top of Jacks vision He ignores it and points straight ahead Beezer Doc and Dale all look and Dales the first one to see it Ill be damned he says softly A NO TRESPASSING sign Was it there before Yep Jack says Been there for thirty years or more Id guess Fuck Beez says and begins rubbing honey around his nose He pokes generous wads of the stuff up his nostrils resinous drops gleam in his redbrown Vikings beard We woulda gone right on Doctor All the way to town Hell maybe all the way to Rapid City South Dakota He hands the honey to Doc and grimaces at Jack Im sorry man We should have known No excuses Wheres the driveway Dales asking and then Oh There it is I could have sworn   That there was nothing there I know Jack says Hes smiling Looking at his friends At the Sawyer Gang He is certainly not looking at the black rags fluttering restively at the upper periphery of his vision nor down at his waist where his hand is slowly drawing the Ruger  from his waistband He was always one of the best out there Hed only won badges a couple of times when it was shooting from a stand but when it came to the drawandfire competition he did quite well Top five usually Jack has no idea if this is a skill hes retained but he thinks hes going to find out right now Smiling at them watching Doc swab his schnozz with honey Jack says in a conversational voice Somethings watching us Dont look up Im going to try and shoot it What is it Dale asks smiling back He doesnt look up only straight ahead Now he can quite clearly see the shadowy lane that must lead to Burnsides house It wasnt there he could have sworn it wasnt but now it is Its a pain in the ass Jack says and suddenly swings the Ruger up locking both hands around the stock Hes firing almost before he sees with his eyes and he catches the great dark crow crouched on the overhanging branch of an oak tree entirely by surprise It gives one loud shocked cry  AWWWWK  and then it is torn apart on its roost Blood flies against the faded blue summer sky Feathers flutter down in clumps as dark as midnight shadows And a body It hits the shoulder in front of the lane with a heavy thud One dark glazing eye peers at Jack Sawyer with an expression of surprise Did you fire five or six Beezer asks in a tone of deep awe It was so fast I couldnt tell All of them Jack says He guesses hes still not too bad at drawandfire after all Thats one big fucking crow Doc says Its not just any crow Jack tells him Its Gorg He advances to the blasted body lying on the dirt How you doin fella How do you feel He spits on Gorg a luscious thick lunger Thats for luring the kids he says Then suddenly he boots the crows corpse into the underbrush It flies in a limp arc the wings wrapping around the body like a shroud And thats for fucking with Irmas mother They are looking at him all three of them with identical expressions of stunned awe Almost of fear Its a look that makes Jack tired although he supposes he must accept it He can remember his old friend Richard Sloat looking at him the same way once Richard realized that what he called Seabrook Island stuff  wasnt confined to Seabrook Island Come on Jack says Everybody in the car Lets get it done Yes and they must move quickly because a certain oneeyed gent will shortly be looking for Ty too Mr Munshun Eye of the King Jack thinks Eye of the abbalah Thats what Judy meant  Mr Munshun Whoever or whatever he really is Dont like leaving the bikes out here by the side of the road man Beezer says Anybody could come along and   Nobody will see them Jack tells him Three or four cars have gone by since we parked and no ones so much as looked over at us And you know why Weve already started to cross over havent we Doc asks This is the edge of it The border Opopanax Jack says The word simply pops out Huh Jack picks up Tys Richie Sexson bat and gets in on the passenger side of the cruiser It means lets go he says Lets get it done And so the Sawyer Gang takes its last ride  up the wooded poisonous lane that leads to Black House The strong afternoon light quickly fades to the sullen glow of an overcast November evening In the closepressing trees on either side dark shapes twine and crawl and sometimes fly They dont matter much Jack reckons they are only phantoms You gonna reload that Roogalator Beezer asks from the back seat Nope Jack says looking at the Ruger without much interest Think its done its job What should we be ready for Dale asks in a thin voice Anything Jack replies He favors Dale Gilbertson with a humorless grin Ahead of them is a house that wont keep its shape but whirls and wavers in the most distressing way Sometimes it seems no bigger than a humble ranch house a blink and it seems to be a ragged monolith that blots out the entire sky another blink and it appears to be a low uneven construction stretching back under the forest canopy for what could be miles It gives off a low hum that sounds like voices Be ready for anything at all BUT AT FIRST there is nothing The four of them get out and stand in front of Dales cruiser looking for all the world like men posing for the kind of group photo that will eventually show up on someones den wall Only the photographer would be on Black Houses porch  thats the way theyre facing  and the porch is empty except for the second NO TRESPASSING sign which leans against a peeling newel post Someone has drawn a skull on it with a Magic Marker or grease pencil Burny Some intrepid teenager who came all the way up to the house on a dare Dale did some crazy things when he was seventeen risked his life with a spraypaint can more than once but he still finds that hard to believe The air is sullen and silent as if before a thunderstorm It stinks too but the honey seems to filter the worst of that out In the woods something makes a thick sound Dale has never heard before Groooooo Whats that he asks Jack I dont know Jack replies Doc says Ive heard bull gators Thats what they sound like when theyre feeling horny This isnt the Everglades Dale says Doc gives him a thin smile It aint Wisconsin anymore either Toto Or maybe you didnt notice Dale has noticed plenty Theres the way the house wont hold its shape for one thing  the way it sometimes seems enormous as if it is many houses somehow all overlaid A city perhaps the size of London folded under a single weird roof And then there are the trees There are old oaks and pines there are birches like skinny ghosts there are red maples  all of them indigenous to the area  but he also sees twisted rooty growths that look like mutated banyan trees And are these moving Christ Dale hopes not But whether they are or not theyre whispering Hes almost sure of that He can hear their words slithering through the buzzing in his head and theyre not encouraging words not by a longshot Killyew    eatchew    hatechew    Wheres the dog Beezer asks Hes holding his mm in one hand Here doggy Got something yummy for you Hurry and get it Instead that guttural growl drifts out of the woods again this time closer GROOOOOOO And the trees whisper Dale looks up at the house watches it suddenly stack floors into a sky that has gone white and cold and vertigo rolls through his head like a wave of warm grease He has a faint sensation of Jack grabbing his elbow to steady him A little help there but not enough French Landings chief of police twists to the left and vomits Good Jack says Get it out Get rid of it What about you Doc Beez The Thunder Two tell him theyre okay For now its true but Beezer doesnt know how long equilibrium is going to last His stomach is churning low and slow Well so what if I blow my groceries in there he thinks According to Jack Burnsides dead he wont mind Jack leads them up the porch steps pausing to boot the rusted NO TRESPASSING sign with its deathshead graffiti over the side and into a clutch of weeds that close over it at once like a greedy hand Dale is reminded of how Jack spit on the crow His friend seems different now younger and stronger But we are going to trespass Jack says Were going to trespass our asses off At first however it seems they will not The front door of Black House isnt just locked Theres no crack at all between the door and the jamb In fact once theyre close up the door looks painted on a trompe loeil Behind them in the woods something screams Dale jumps The scream rises to an excruciating high note breaks into a peal of maniacal laughter and is suddenly gone Natives are fuckin restless Doc comments Want to try a window Beezer asks Jack Nope Were going in the front way Jack has been raising the Richie Sexson bat as he speaks Now he lowers it looking puzzled There is a droning sound from behind them quickly growing louder And the daylight thin already in this strange forest dell seems to be weakening even further What now Beezer asks turning back toward the drive and the parked cruiser Hes holding the mm up by his right ear What the   And then he falls silent The gun sags outward and downward His mouth drops open Holy shit Doc says quietly Dale even more quietly Is this your doing Jack If it is you really have been hiding your light under a bushel The light has dimmed because the clearing in front of Black House has now acquired a canopy of bees More are streaming in from the lane a brownishgold comet tail They give off a sleepy benevolent droning sound that drowns out the harsh firealarm buzz of the house entirely The hoarse gator thing in the woods falls silent and the flickering shapes in the trees disappear Jacks mind is suddenly filled with thoughts and images of his mother Lily dancing Lily pacing around behind one of the cameras before a big scene with a cigarette clamped between her teeth Lily sitting at the livingroom window and looking out as Patsy Cline sings Crazy Arms In another world of course shed been another kind of queen and what is a queen without a loyal retinue Jack Sawyer looks at the vast cloud of bees  millions of them perhaps billions every hive in the Midwest must be empty this afternoon  and he smiles This changes the shape of his eyes and the tears that have been growing there spill down his cheeks Hello he thinks Hello there boys The low pleasant hum of the bees seems to change slightly as if in answer Perhaps its only his imagination What are they for Jack Beezer asks His voice is resonant with awe I dont exactly know Jack says He turns back to the door raises the bat and knocks it once hard against the wood Open he cries I demand it in the name of Queen Laura DeLoessian And in the name of my mother There is a highpitched crack so loud and piercing that Dale and Beez both draw back wincing Beezer actually covers his ears A gap appears at the top of the door and races along it left to right At the doors upper right corner the gap pivots and plunges straight down creating a crack through which a musty draft blows Jack catches a whiff of something both sour and familiar the deathsmell they first encountered at Eds Eats Jack reaches for the knob and tries it It turns freely in his hand He opens the way to Black House But before he can invite them in Doc Amberson begins to scream Someone  maybe its Ebbie maybe TJ maybe goofy old Ronnie Metzger  is yanking Tys arm It hurts like a son of a gun but thats not the worst The arm yanker is also making this weird humming noise that seems to vibrate deep inside his head Theres a clanking noise as well the Big Combination thats the Big Combination but that humming     Man that humming hurts Quit it Ty mumbles Quit it Ebbie or Ill   Faint screams seep through that electric buzzing sound and Ty Marshall opens his eyes Theres no merciful period of grace when hes unsure about where he is or whats happened to him It all comes back with the force of some terrible picture  a car accident with dead people lying around say  that is shoved into your face before you can look away Hed held on until the old man was dead had obeyed the voice of his mother and kept his head But once he started shouting for help panic had come back and swallowed him Or maybe it was shock Or both In any case hed passed out while still screaming for help How long has he hung here by his shackled left arm unconscious Its impossible to tell from the light spilling through the shed door that seems unchanged So do the various clankings and groanings of the huge machine and Ty understands that it goes on forever along with the screams of the children and the crack of the whips as the unspeakable guards press the work ever onward The Big Combination never shuts down It runs on blood and terror and never takes a day off But that buzzing  that juicy electric buzzing like the worlds biggest Norelco razor  what the hell is that Mr Munshuns gone to get the mono Burnys voice in his head A vile whisper The EndWorld mono A terrible dismay steals into Tys heart He has no doubt at all that what he hears is that very monorail even now pulling under the canopy at the end of Station House Road Mr Munshun will look for his boy his sbecial bouy and when he doesnt see him nor BurnBurn either will he come searching Course he will Ty croaks Oh boy Suck an elf He looks up at his left hand It would be so easy to yank it back through the oversized shackle if not for the handcuff He yanks downward several times anyway but the cuff only clashes against the shackle The other cuff the one Burny was reaching for when Ty grabbed his balls dangles and twitches making the boy think of the gibbet at this end of Station House Road That eyewatering toothrattling buzz suddenly cuts out Hes shut it down Now hes looking for me in the station making sure Im not there And when he is sure what then Does he know about this place Sure he does Tys dismay is turning into an icy chill of horror Burny would deny it Burny would say that the shack down here in this dry wash was his secret a place special to him In his lunatic arrogance it would never have occurred to him how well that mistaken idea might serve his supposed friends purpose His mother speaks in Tys head again and this time hes reasonably sure it really is his mother You cant depend on anyone else They might come in time but they might not You have to assume they wont You have to get out of this yourself But how Ty looks at the twisted body of the old man lying on the bloody dirt with his head almost out the door The thought of Mr Munshun tries to intrude Burnys friend hurrying down Station House Road even now or maybe driving in his own EZGo golf cart wanting to scoop him up and take him to the abbalah Tyler pushes the image away It will lead him back to panic and he cant afford any more of that Hes all out of time I cant reach him Ty says If the keys in his pocket Im finished Case closed game over zip up your f   His eye happens on something lying on the floor Its the sack the old man was carrying The one with the cap in it And the handcuffs If the handcuffs were in it maybe the keys in there too Ty reaches forward with his left foot stretching as far as he can Its no good He cant quite reach the bag Hes at least four inches short Four inches short and Mr Munshun is coming coming Ty can almost smell him Doc shrieks and shrieks distantly aware that the others are shouting at him to stop its all right theres nothing to be afraid of distantly aware that he is hurting his throat probably making it bleed Those things dont matter What matters is that when Hollywood swung open the front door of Black House he exposed the official greeter The official greeter is Daisy Temperly Docs browneyed girl Shes wearing a pretty pink dress Her skin is pale as paper except on the right side of her forehead where a flap of skin falls down exposing the red skull beneath Come in Doc Daisy says We can talk about how you killed me And you can sing You can sing to me She smiles The smile becomes a grin The grin exposes a mouthful of bulging vampire teeth You can sing to me forever Doc takes a blunderstep backward turns to flee and that is when Jack grabs him and shakes him Doc Amberson is a hefty fellow  twosixty out of the shower more like twoeighty when dressed in full Road Warrior regalia as he is now  but Jack shakes him easily snapping the big mans head back and forth Docs long hair flops and flies Theyre all illusions Jack says Pictureshows designed to keep out unwanted guests like us I dont know what you saw Doc but its not there Doc looks cautiously past Jacks shoulder For a moment he sees a pink diminishing whirl  its like the coming of the devil dog only backward  and then its gone He looks up at Jack Tears are rolling slowly down his sunburned face I didnt mean to kill her he says I loved her But I was tired that night Very tired Do you know about being tired Hollywood Yes Jack says And if we get out of this I intend to sleep for a week But for now    He looks from Doc to Beezer From Beezer to Dale Were going to see more stuff The house will use your worst memories against you the things you did wrong the people you hurt But on the whole Im encouraged I think a lot of the poison went out of this place when Burny died All we have to do is find our way through to the other side Jack Dale says He is standing in the doorway in the very spot where Daisy greeted her old physician His eyes are very large What Finding our way through    that might be easier said than done They gather around him Beyond the door is a gigantic circular foyer a place so big it makes Jack think fleetingly of St Peters Basilica On the floor is an acre of poisongreen carpet entwined with scenes of torture and blasphemy Doors open off this room everywhere In addition Jack counts four sets of crisscrossing stairways He blinks and there are six Blinks again and there are a dozen as bewildering to the eye as an Escher drawing He can hear the deep idiot drone that is the voice of Black House He can hear something else as well laughter Come in Black House is telling them Come in and wander these rooms forever Jack blinks and sees a thousand stairways some moving bulging in and out Doors stand open on galleries of paintings galleries of sculpture on whirling vortexes on emptiness What do we do now Dale asks bleakly What the hell do we do now Ty has never seen Burnys friend but as he hangs from the shackle he finds he can imagine him quite easily In this world Mr Munshun is a real creature    but not a human being Ty sees a shuffling busy figure in a black suit and a flowing red tie bustling down Station House Road This creature has a vast white face dominated by a red mouth and a single blurry eye The abbalahs emissary and chief deputy looks in the gaze of Tys imagination like HumptyDumpty gone bad It wears a vest buttoned with bones Got to get out of here Got to get that bag    but how He looks at Burny again At the hideous tangle of Burnys spilled guts And suddenly the answer comes He stretches his foot out again but this time not toward the bag He hooks the toe of his sneaker under a dirtsmeared loop of Burnys intestines instead He lifts it pivots and then kicks softly The loop of gut leaves the toe of his sneaker And loops over the leather bag So far so good Now if he can only drag it close enough to get his foot on it Trying not to think of the stocky hurrying figure with the grotesquely long face Ty gropes out with his foot again He gets it under the dirty snarl of intestine and begins to pull slowly and with infinite care Its impossible Beezer says flatly Nothing can be this big You know that dont you Jack takes a deep breath lets it out takes another and speaks a single word in a low firm voice Deeyamber Beez asks suspiciously What the hells deeyamber Jack doesnt bother answering From the vast dark cloud of droning bees hanging over the clearing Dales cruiser is now nothing but a furry blackgold lump in front of the porch a single bee emerges It  she for this is undoubtedly a queen bee  flies between Dale and Doc pauses for a moment in front of Beezer as if considering him or considering the honey with which he has generously lathered himself  and then hovers in front of Jack She is plump and aerodynamically unsound and ludicrous and somehow absolutely wonderful Jack lifts a finger like a professor about to make a point or a bandleader about to deliver the downbeat The bee lights on the end of it Are you from her He asks this question in a low voice  too low for the others to hear even Beezer who is standing right next to him Jack isnt quite sure who he means His mother Laura DeLoessian Judy Sophie Or is there some other She a counterbalancing force to the Crimson King This somehow feels right but he supposes hell never know for sure In any case the bee only looks at him with her wide black eyes wings blurring And Jack realizes that these are questions to which he needs no answer He has been a sleepyhead but now hes up hes out of bed This house is huge and deep a place stacked with vileness and layered with secrets but what of that He has Tys prize bat he has friends he has dyamba and here is the Queen of the Bees Those things are enough Hes good to go Better  perhaps best of all  hes glad to go Jack raises the tip of his finger to his mouth and blows the bee gently into Black Houses foyer She circles aimlessly for a moment and then zips off to the left and through a door with an oddly bloated obese shape Come on Jack says Were in business The other three exchange uneasy glances then follow him into what has clearly been their destiny all along It is impossible to say how long the Sawyer Gang spends in Black House that hole which spewed the slippery stuff into French Landing and the surrounding towns It is likewise impossible to say with any clarity what they see there In a very real sense touring Black House is like touring the brain of a deranged madman and in such a mental framework we can expect to find no plan for the future or memory of the past In the brain of a madman only the fuming present exists with its endless shouting urges paranoid speculations and grandiose assumptions So it is not surprising that the things they see in Black House should fade from their minds almost as soon as they are gone from their eyes leaving behind only vague whispers of unease that might be the distant cry of the opopanax This amnesia is merciful The queen bee leads them and the other bees follow in a swarm that discolors the air with its vastness and shivers through rooms that have been silent for centuries for surely we understand  intuitively if not logically  that Black House existed long before Burny built its most recent node in French Landing At one point the quartet descends a staircase of green glass In the abyss below the steps they see circling birds like vultures with the white screaming faces of lost babies In a long narrow room like a Pullman car living cartoons  two rabbits a fox and a stonedlooking frog wearing white gloves  sit around a table catching and eating what appear to be fleas They are cartoons sera blackandwhite cartoons and it hurts Jacks eyes to look at them because they are also real The rabbit tips him a knowing wink as the Sawyer Gang goes by and in the eye that doesnt close Jack sees flat murder There is an empty salon filled with voices shouting in some foreign language that sounds like French but isnt There is a room filled with vomitous green jungle and lit by a sizzling tropical sun Hanging from one of the trees is a vast cocoon that appears to hold a baby dragon still wrapped in its own wings That cant be a dragon Doc Amberson says in a weirdly reasonable voice They either come from eggs or the teeth of other dragons Maybe both They walk down a long corridor that slowly rounds itself off becomes a tunnel and then drops them down a long and greasy slide as crazy percussion beats from unseen speakers To Jack it sounds like Cozy Cole or maybe Gene Krupa The sides fall away and for a moment they are sliding over a chasm that literally seems to have no bottom Steer with your hands and feet Beezer shouts If you dont want to go over the side STEER They are finally spilled off in what Dale calls the Dirt Room They struggle over vast piles of filthsmelling earth under a rusty tin ceiling festooned with bare light bulbs Platoons of tiny greenishwhite spiders school back and forth like fish By the time they reach the far side theyre all panting and out of breath their shoes muddy their clothes filthy There are three doors here Their leader is buzzing and doing Immelmann turns in front of the one in the middle No way Dale says I want to trade for whats behind the curtain Jack tells him hes got a future in standup comedy no doubt about it and then opens the door the bee has chosen for them Behind it is a huge automated laundry which Beezer immediately dubs the Hall of Cleanliness Bunched together they follow the bee down a humid corridor lined with sudsing washers and humming shuddering dryers The air smells like baked bread The washers  each with a single glaring portholed eye  are stacked up to a height of fifty feet or more Above them in an ocean of dusty air pigeons flock in restless currents Every now and then they pass piles of bones or some other sign that human beings came or were brought this way In a hallway they find a scooter overgrown with cobwebs Farther on a pair of girls inline skates thick with dust In a vast library room the word LAUGH has been formed with human bones on a mahogany table In a richly appointed if obviously neglected parlor through which the bee leads them in a nononsense straight line Dale and Doc observe that the art on one wall appears to consist of human faces that have been cut off cured and then stretched on squares of wood Huge bewildered eyes have been painted into the empty sockets Dale thinks he recognizes at least one of the faces Milton Wanderly a schoolteacher who dropped out of sight three or four years back Everyone had assumed that Don Wanderlys kid brother had simply left town Well Dale thinks he left all right Halfway down a stonethroated corridor lined with cells the bee darts into a squalid little chamber and circles above a ragged futon At first none of them speak They dont need to Ty was here and not that long ago They can almost smell him  his fear Then Beezer turns to Jack The blue eyes above the lush redbrown beard are narrowed in fury The old bastard burned him with something Or zapped him Jack nods He can smell that too although whether he does so with his nose or his mind he neither knows nor cares Burnside wont be zapping anyone else he says The queen bee zips between them and whirls impatiently in the corridor To the left back the way they came the corridor is black with bees They turn to the right instead and soon the bee is leading them down another seemingly endless stairway At one point they walk through a brief drippy drizzle  somewhere above this part of the stairs a pipe in Black Houses unimaginable guts has perhaps let go Half a dozen of the risers are wet and they all see tracks there Theyre too blurry to do a forensics team much good both Jack and Dale have the same thought but the Sawyer Gang is encouraged theres a big set and a little set and both sets are relatively fresh Now they are getting somewhere by God They begin to move faster and behind them the bees descend in a vast humming cloud like some plague out of the Old Testament Time may have ceased to exist for the Sawyer Gang but for Ty Marshall it has become an agonizing presence He cant be sure if his sense of Mr Munshuns approach is imagination or precognition but hes terribly afraid its the latter He has to get out of this shed has to but the damned bag keeps eluding him He managed to pull it close to him with the loop of intestines ironically that was the easy part The hard part is actually getting hold of the damned thing He cant reach it no matter how he stretches or how cruelly he tests his left shoulder and shackled left wrist he comes up at least two feet short Tears of pain roll down his cheeks Any moisture lost that way is quickly replaced by the sweat that runs stinging into his eyes from his greasy forehead Foot it he says Just like soccer He looks at the disfigured sprawl in the doorway  his erstwhile tormentor Just like soccer right BurnBurn He gets the side of his foot against the bag pushes it to the wall and then begins to slide it up the bloodstained wood At the same time he reaches down    now fourteen inches    now only a foot    reaching       and the leather bag tumbles off the toe of his sneaker and onto the dirt Plop Youre watching out for him arent you Burny Ty pants You have to you know my backs turned Youre the lookout right Youre  Fuck This time the bag has tumbled off his foot before he can even begin to raise it Ty slams his free hand against the wall Why do you do that a voice inquires coolly This is the one who sounds like his mother but isnt his mother not quite Will that help you No Ty says resentfully but it makes me feel better Getting free will make you feel better Now try again Ty once more rolls the leather bag against the wall He presses his foot against it feeling for anything else that might be inside  a key for instance  but he cant tell Not through his sneaker He begins to slide the bag up the wall again Carefully    not too fast    like footing the ball toward the goal    Dont let him in Burny he pants to the dead man behind him You owe me that I dont want to go on the mono I dont want to go to EndWorld And I dont want to be a Breaker Whatever it is I dont want to be it I want to be an explorer    maybe underwater like Jacques Cousteau    or a flier in the Air Force    or maybe    FUCK This time its not irritation when the bag falls off his foot but rage and near panic Mr Munshun hustling and bustling Getting closer Meaning to take him away Dintah Abbalahdoon For ever and ever Damn old keys probably not in there anyway His voice wavering close to a sob Is it Burny Chummy Burnside offers no opinion I bet theres nothing in there at all Except maybe    I dont know    a roll of Tums or something Eating peoples got to give you indigestion Nonetheless Ty captures the bag with his foot again and again begins the laborious job of sliding it up the wall far enough so that perhaps his stretching fingers can grasp it Dale Gilbertson has lived in the Coulee Country his entire life and hes used to greenery To him trees and lawns and fields that roll all the way to the horizon are the norm Perhaps this is why he looks at the charred and smoking lands that surround Conger Road with such distaste and growing dismay What is this place he asks Jack The words come out in little puffs The Sawyer Gang has no golf cart and must hoof it In fact Jack has set a pace quite a bit faster than Ty drove the EZGo I dont exactly know Jack says I saw a place like it a long time ago It was called the Blasted Lands It   A greenish man with plated skin suddenly leaps at them from behind a tumble of huge boulders In one hand he holds a stumpy whip  what Jack believes is actually called a quirt Bahhrrr this apparition cries sounding weirdly like Richard Sloat when Richard laughs Jack raises Tys bat and looks at the apparition questioningly  Did you want some of this Apparently the apparition does not It stands where it is for a moment then turns and flees As it disappears back into the maze of boulders Jack sees that twisted thorns grow in a ragged line down both of its Achilles tendons They dont like Wonderboy Beezer says looking appreciatively at the bat It is still a bat just as the mms and  Rugers are still pistols and they are still they Jack Dale Beezer Doc And Jack decides he isnt much surprised by that Parkus told him that this wasnt about Twinners told him that during their palaver near the hospital tent This place may be adjacent to the Territories but its not the Territories Jack had forgotten that Well yes  but Ive had a few other things on my mind I dont know if you boys have taken a close look at the wall on the far side of this charming country lane Doc says but those large white stones actually appear to be skulls Beezer gives the wall of skulls a cursory glance then looks ahead again What worries me is that thing he says Over the broken teeth of the horizon rises a great complication of steel glass and machinery It disappears into the clouds They can see the tiny figures who surge and struggle there can hear the crack of the whips From this distance they sound like the pop of  rifles Whats that Jack Jacks first thought is that hes looking at the Crimson Kings Breakers but no  there are too many of them Yonder building is some sort of factory or power plant powered by slaves By children not talented enough to qualify as Breakers A vast outrage rises in his heart As if sensing it the drone of the bees grows louder behind him Speedys voice whispering in his head Save your anger Jack  your first job is that little boy And time has grown very very short Oh Christ Dale says and points Is that what I think it is The gibbet hangs like a skeleton over the slanting road Doc says If youre thinking gallows I believe you win the stainless steel flatware and get to go on to the next round Look at all the shoes Dale says Why would they pile the shoes up like that God knows Beezer says Just the custom of the country I guess How close are we Jack Do you have any idea at all Jack looks at the road ahead of them then at the road leading away to the left the one with the ancient gallows on its corner Close he says I think were   Then from ahead of them the shrieks begin They are the cries of a child who has been pushed to the edge of madness Or perhaps over it Ty Marshall can hear the approaching drone of the bees but believes it is only in his head that it is no more than the sound of his own growing anxiety He doesnt know how many times hes tried to slide Burnys leather bag up the side of the shed hes lost count It does not occur to him that removing the odd cap  the one that looks like cloth and feels like metal  might improve his coordination for hes forgotten all about the cap All he knows is that hes tired and sweating and trembling probably in shock and if he doesnt manage to snag the bag this time hell probably just give up Id probably go with Mr Munshun if he just promised me a glass of water Ty thinks But he does have Judys toughness bred in his bones and some of Sophies regal insistence as well And ignoring the ache in his thigh he again begins sliding the bag up the wall at the same time stretching down with his right hand Ten inches    eight    the closest hes gotten so far    The bag slips to the left Its going to fall off his foot Again No Ty says softly Not this time He presses his sneaker harder against the wood then begins to raise it again Six inches    four inches    three and the bag starts to tilt farther and farther to the left its going to fall off  No Ty yells and bends forward in a strenuous bow His back creaks So does his tortured left shoulder But his fingers graze across the bag    and then snag it He brings it toward him and then damned near drops it after all No way Burny he pants first juggling the leather sack and then clutching it against his chest You dont fool me with that old trick no way in hell do you fool me with that one He bites the corner of the bag with his teeth The stink of it is awful rotten  eau de Burnside He ignores it and pulls the bag open At first he thinks its empty and lets out a low sobbing cry Then he sees a single silver gleam Crying through his clenched teeth Ty reaches into the dangling bag with his right hand and brings the key out Cant drop it he thinks If I drop it Ill lose my mind I really will He doesnt drop it He raises it above his head sticks it in the little hole on the side of the cuff holding his left wrist and turns it The cuff springs open Slowly slowly Ty draws his hand through the shackle The handcuffs fall to the sheds dirt floor As he stands there a queerly persuasive idea occurs to Ty hes really still back in Black House asleep on the ragged futon with the slop bucket in one corner of his cell and the dish of reheated Dinty Moore beef stew in the other This is just his exhausted mind giving him a little hope A last vacation before he goes into the stewpot himself From outside comes the clank of the Big Combination and the screams of the children who march march march on their bleeding footsies running it Somewhere is Mr Munshun who wants to take him someplace even worse than this Its no dream Ty doesnt know where hell go from here or how hell ever get back to his own world but the first step is getting out of this shed and this general vicinity Moving on trembling legs like an accident victim getting out of bed for the first time after a long stay Ty Marshall steps over Burnys sprawled corpse and out of the shed The day is overcast the landscape sterile and even here that rickety skyscraper of pain and toil dominates the view but still Ty feels an immense gladness just to be in the light again To be free It is not until he stands with the shed behind him that he truly realizes how completely he expected to die there For a moment Ty closes his eyes and turns his face up to the gray sky Thus he never sees the figure that has been standing to one side of the shed prudently waiting to make sure Ty is still wearing the cap when he comes out Once hes sure he is Lord Malshun  this is as close to his real name as we can come  steps forward His grotesque face is like the bowl of a huge serving spoon upholstered in skin The one eye bulges freakishly The red lips grin When he drops his arms around the boy Ty begins to shriek  not just in fear and surprise but in outrage He has worked so hard to be free so dreadfully hard Hush Lord Malshun whispers and when Ty continues to loose his wild screams on the upper levels of the Big Combination some of the children turn toward those cries until the brutish ogres who serve as foremen whip them back to business the abbalahs lord speaks again a single word in the Dark Speech Pnung Ty goes limp Had Lord Malshun not been hugging him from behind he would have fallen Guttural moans of protest continue to issue from the childs drooling slack mouth but the screams have ceased Lord Malshun cocks his long spoonshaped face toward the Big Combination and grins Life is good Then he peers into the shed  briefly but with great interest Did for him Lord Malshun says And with the cap on too Amazing boy The King wants to meet you in person before you go to Dintah you know He may give you cake and coffee Imagine young Tyler Cake and coffee with the abbalah Cake and coffee with the King    dont want go    want to go home    my maaaa    These words spill out loose and low like blood from a mortal wound Lord Malshun draws a finger across Tys lips and they press together behind his touch Hush says the abbalahs talent scout again Few things in life are more annoying than a noisy traveling companion And we have a long trip ahead of us Far from your home and friends and family    ah but dont cry For Malshun has observed the tears that have begun to leak from the corners of the limp boys eyes and roll down the planes of his cheeks Dont cry little Ty Youll make new friends The Chief Breaker for instance All the boys like the Chief Breaker His name is Mr Brautigan Perhaps hell tell you tales of his many escapes How funny they are Perfectly killing And now we must go Cake and coffee with the King Hold that thought Lord Malshun is stout and rather bowlegged his legs are in fact a good deal shorter than his grotesquely long face but he is strong He tucks Ty under his arm as if the boy weighed no more than two or three sheets bundled together He looks back at Burny one last time without much regret  theres a young fellow in upstate New York who shows great promise and Burny was pretty well played out anyway Lord Malshun cocks his head sideways and utters his almost soundless chuffing laugh Then he sets out not neglecting to give the boys cap a good hard yank The boy is not just a Breaker hes perhaps the most powerful one to ever live Luckily he doesnt realize his own powers yet Probably nothing would happen if the cap did fall off yet its best not to take chances Bustling  even humming a bit under his breath  Lord Malshun reaches the end of the draw turns left onto Conger Road for the halfmile stroll back to Station House Road and stops dead in his tracks Standing in his way are four men from what Lord Malshun thinks of as Tertah This is a slang term and not a flattering one In the Book of Good Farming Ter is that period of FullEarth in which breeding stock is serviced Lord Malshun sees the world beyond the front door of Black House as a kind of vast caldo largo a living soup into which he may dip his ladle  always on the abbalahs behalf of course  whenever he likes Four men from the Ter Malshuns lip twists in contempt causing upheavals all along the length of his face What are they doing here Whatever can they hope to accomplish here The smile begins to falter when he sees the stick one of them carries Its glowing with a shifting light that is many colors but somehow always white at its core A blinding light Lord Malshun knows only one thing that has ever glowed with such light and that is the Globe of Forever known by at least one small wandering boy as the Talisman That boy once touched it and as Laura DeLoessian could have told him  as Jack himself now knows  the touch of the Talisman never completely fades The smile drops away entirely when Lord Malshun realizes that the man with the club was that boy He has come again to annoy them but if he thinks he will take back the prize of prizes hes quite mistaken Its only a stick after all not the Globe itself perhaps a little of the Globes residual power still lives within the man but surely not much Surely there can be no more than dust after all the intervening years And dust is what my life would be worth if I let them take this boy from me Lord Malshun thinks I must  His single eye is drawn to the black thunderhead hanging behind the men from the Ter It gives off a vast sleepy drone Bees Bees with stingers Bees with stingers between him and Station House Road Well he will deal with them In time First is the business of these annoying men Good day gentlemen Lord Malshun says in his most pleasant voice The bogus German accent is gone now he sounds like a bogus English aristocrat in a West End stage comedy from the s Or perhaps the World War II Nazi propagandist Lord HawHaw Its wonderful that you should come so far to visit perfectly wonderful and on such a rotten day too Yet Im afraid most days are rotten here the Dins of EndWorld were simply made for the pathetic fallacy you know and  dash it all  I cant stay Im afraid these are timedelivery goods here Lord Malshun raises Ty and shakes him Although Tys eyes are open and hes obviously aware his arms and legs flop as bonelessly as those of a rag doll Put him down Munshun says the one with the club and Lord Malshun realizes with growing dismay that he could have trouble with this one He really could Yet his smile widens exposing the full ghoulish range of his teeth They are pointed and tip inward Anything bitten by them would tear itself to shreds trying to pull free of that bony trap Munshun Munshun No one here by that name Or Mr Monday either for that matter All gone cheerio tata toodleoo As for putting down the lad couldnt do that dear boy simply couldnt Ive made commitments you know And really you fellows should count yourselves fortunate Your local reign of terror is over Huzzah The Fisherman is dead  dispatched by this boy right here in fact this perfectly admirable boy He gives Ty another shake always being careful to keep the head raised Wouldnt want that cap falling off oh no The bees trouble him Who has sent the bees The boys mother is in an insane asylum says the man with the stick That stick is glowing more fiercely than ever Lord Malshun realizes with deepening fear He now feels very afraid and with fear comes anger Is it possible they could take him Really take the boy Shes in an asylum and she wants her son back If so its a corpse theyll have for their trouble Afraid or not Lord Malshuns grin widens even further Dale Gilbertson has a sudden nightmarish vision William F Buckley Jr with one eye and a face five feet long He lifts Tys limp body close to his mouth and bites a series of needly little nips in the air less than an inch from the exposed neck Have her husband stick his prick in her and make another un old son  Im sure he can do it They live in Tertah after all Women get pregnant in Tertah just walking down the street One of the bearded men says Shes partial to this one But so am I dear boy So am I Lord Malshun actually nips Tys skin this time and blood flows as if from a shaving cut Behind them the Big Combination grinds on and on but the screams have ceased Its as if the children driving the machine realize that something has changed or might change that the world has come to a balancing point The man with the glowing stick takes a step forward Lord Malshun cringes back in spite of himself Its a mistake to show weakness and fear he knows this but cant help it For this is no ordinary tah This is someone like one of the old gunslingers those warriors of the High Take another step and Ill tear his throat open dear boy Id hate doing that would hate it awfully but never doubt that Ill do it Youd be dead yourself two seconds later the man with the stick says He seems completely unafraid either for himself or for Ty Is that what you want Actually given the choice between dying and going back to the Crimson King emptyhanded death is what Lord Malshun would choose yes But it may not come to that The quieting word worked on the boy and it will work on at least three of these  the ordinary three With them lying openeyed and insensible on the road Lord Malshun can deal with the fourth Its Sawyer of course Thats his name As for the bees surely he has enough protective words to get him up Station House Road to the mono And if hes stung a few times what of that Is it what you want Sawyer asks Lord Malshun smiles Pnung he cries and behind Jack Sawyer Dale Beezer and Doc fall still Lord Malshuns smile widens into a grin Now what are you going to do my meddling friend What are you going to do with no friends to back you u   Armand Beezer St Pierre steps forward The first step is an effort but after that its easy His own cold little smile exposes the teeth inside his beard Youre responsible for the death of my daughter he says Maybe you didnt do it yourself but you egged Burnside on to it Didnt you Im her father asshole You think you can stop me with a single word Doc lurches to his friends side You fucked up my town Dale Gilbertson growls He also moves forward Lord Malshun stares at them in disbelief The Dark Speech hasnt stopped them Not any of them They are blocking the road They dare to block his proposed route of progress Ill kill him he growls at Jack Ill kill him So what do you say sunshine Whats it going to be And so here it is at long last the showdown We cannot watch it from above alas as the crow with whom we have hitched so many rides all unknown by Gorg we assure you is dead but even standing off to one side we recognize this archetypal scene from ten thousand movies  at least a dozen of them starring Lily Cavanaugh Jack levels the bat the one even Beezer has recognized as Wonderboy He holds it with the knob pressing into the underside of his forearm and the barrel pointing directly at Lord Malshuns head Put him down he says Last chance my friend Lord Malshun lifts the boy higher Go on he shouts Shoot a bolt of energy out of that thing I know you can do it But youll hit the boy too Youll hit the boy t   A line of pure white fire jumps from the head of the Richie Sexson bat it is as thin as the lead of a pencil It strikes Lord Malshuns single eye and cooks it in its socket The thing utters a shriek  it never thought Jack would call its bluff not a creature from the ter no matter how temporarily elevated  and it jerks forward opening its jaws to bite even in death Before it can another bolt of white light this one from the beaten silver commitment ring on Beezer St Pierres left hand shoots out and strikes the abbalahs emissary square in the mouth The red plush of Lord Malshuns red lips bursts into flame    and still he staggers upright in the road the Big Combination a skeletal skyscraper behind him trying to bite trying to end the life of Judy Marshalls gifted son Dale leaps forward grabs the boy around the waist and the shoulders and yanks him away reeling toward the side of the road His honest face is pale and grim and set Finish him Jack Dale bawls Finish the sonofabitch Jack steps forward to where the blinded howling charred thing reels back and forth in the Conger Road his bony vest smoking his long white hands groping Jack cocks the bat back on his right shoulder and sets his grip all the way down to the knob No choking up this afternoon this afternoon hes wielding a bat that blazes with glowing white fire and hed be a fool not to swing for the fences Batter up sweetheart he says and uncoils a swing that would have done credit to Richie Sexson himself Or Big Mac There is a punky fleshy sound as the bat still accelerating connects with the side of Lord Malshuns huge head It caves in like the rind of a rotted watermelon and a spray of bright crimson flies out A moment later the head simply explodes spattering them all with its gore Looks like the Kings gonna have to find a new boy Beezer says softly He wipes his face looks at a handful of blood and shriveling tissue then wipes it casually on his faded jeans Home run Jack Even a blind man could see that Dale cradling Tyler says Game over case closed zip up your fly French Landings police chief sets Ty carefully on his feet The boy looks up at him then at Jack A bleary sort of light is dawning in his eyes It might be relief it might be actual comprehension Bat he says His voice is husky and hoarse almost impossible for them to understand He clears his throat and tries again Bat Dreamed about it Did you Jack kneels in front of the boy and holds the bat out Ty shows no inclination to actually take possession of the Richie Sexson wonder bat but he touches it with one hand Strokes the bats gorespattered barrel His eyes look only at Jack Its as if hes trying to get the sense of him The truth of him To understand that he has after all been rescued George the boy says George Rathbun Really is blind Yes Jack says But sometimes blind isnt blind Do you know that Tyler The boy nods Jack has never in his life seen anyone who looks so fundamentally exhausted so shocked and lost so completely worn out Want the boy says He licks his lips and clears his throat again Want    drink Water Want mother See my mother Sounds like a plan to me Doc says He is looking uneasily at the splattered remains of the creature they still think of as Mr Munshun Lets get this young fellow back to Wisconsin before some of Old One Eyes friends show up Right Beezer says Burning Black House to the ground is also on my personal agenda Ill throw the first match Or maybe I can shoot fire out of my ring again Id like that First thing though is to make tracks I couldnt agree more Dale says I dont think Tys going to be able to walk either very far or very fast but we can take turns giving him piggyb   No Jack says They look at him with varying degrees of surprise and consternation Jack Beezer says He speaks with an odd gentleness Theres such a thing as overstaying your welcome man We arent finished Jack tells him Then he shakes his head and corrects himself Tys not finished Jack Sawyer kneels in Conger Road thinking I wasnt much older than this kid when I took off across America  and the Territories  to save my mothers life He knows this is true and at the same time absolutely cant believe it Cant remember what it was to be twelve and never anything else to be small and terrified mostly below the worlds notice and running just ahead of all the worlds shadows It should be over Ty has been through nine kinds of hell and he deserves to go home Unfortunately its not over Theres one more thing to do Ty Want Home If there was light in the boys eyes it has gone out now He wears the dull shockface of refugees at border checkpoints and the gates of deathcamps His is the emptied visage of someone who has spent too long in the slippery opopanax landscape of slippage And he is a child damnit only a child He deserves better than what Jack Sawyer is about to serve out But then Jack Sawyer once deserved better than what he got and lived to tell the tale That justifies nothing of course but it does give him the courage to be a bastard Ty He grasps the boys shoulder Water Mother Home No Jack says Not yet He pivots the boy The spatters of Lord Malshuns blood on his face are very bright Jack can sense the men he came with  men who have risked their lives and sanity for him  beginning to frown Never mind He has a job to do He is a coppiceman and theres still a crime in progress here Ty Nothing The boy stands slumped Hes trying to turn himself into meat that does nothing but breathe Jack points at the ugly complication of struts and belts and girders and smoking chimneys He points at the straining ants The Big Combination disappears up into the clouds and down into the dead ground How far in each direction A mile Two Are there children above the clouds shivering in oxygen masks as they trudge the treadmills and yank the levers and turn the cranks Children below who bake in the heat of underground fires Down there in the foxholes and the ratholes where the sun never shines What is it Jack asks him What do you call it What did Burny call it Nothing from Ty Jack gives the boy a shake Not a gentle one either What do you call it Hey man Doc says His voice is heavy with disapproval Theres no need of that Shut up Jack says without looking at him Hes looking at Ty Trying to see anything in those blue eyes but shocked vacancy He needs for Ty to see the gigantic groaning machine that stands yonder To really see it For until he does how can he abominate it What is it After a long pause Ty says Big The Big The Big Combination The words come out slowly and dreamily as if hes talking in his sleep The Big Combination yes Jack says Now stop it Beezer gasps Dale says Jack have you gone   and then falls silent I Cant Ty gives him a wounded look as if to say Jack should know that You can Jack says You can and you will What do you think Ty That were going to just turn our backs on them and take you back to your mother and shell make you Ovaltine and put you to bed and everyone will live happily ever after His voice is rising and he makes no attempt to stop it even when he sees that Tyler is crying He shakes the boy again Tyler cringes but makes no actual attempt to get away Do you think theres going to be any happily ever after for you while those children go on and on until they drop and get replaced with new ones Youll see their faces in your dreams Tyler Youll see their faces and their dirty little hands and their bleeding feet in your fucking dreams Stop it Beezer says sharply Stop it right now or Ill kick your ass Jack turns and Beezer steps back from the ferocious blaze in his eyes Looking at Jack Sawyer in this state is like looking into dintah itself Tyler Tylers mouth trembles Tears roll down his dirty bloody cheeks Stop it I want to go home Once you make the Big Combination quit Then you go home Not before I cant Yes Tyler You can Tyler looks at the Big Combination and Jack can feel the boy making some puny faltering effort Nothing happens The belts continue to run the whips continue to pop the occasional screaming dot tumbles or jumps from the rustragged south side of the building Tyler looks back at him and Jack hates the vacant stupidity in the kids eyes loathes it I caannt Tyler whines and Jack wonders how such a puler ever managed to survive over here in the first place Did he use up all his ability in one mad willful effort to escape Is that it He wont accept it Anger blazes up in him and he slaps Tyler Hard Dale gasps Tys head rocks to the side his eyes widening in surprise And the cap flies off his head Jack has been kneeling in front of the boy Now he is knocked back sprawling on his ass in the middle of Conger Road The kid has    what Pushed me Pushed me with his mind Yes And Jack is suddenly aware of a new bright force in this dull place a blazing bundle of light to rival the one that illuminated the Richie Sexson bat Whoa shit what happened Doc cries The bees feel it too perhaps more than the men Their sleepy drone rises to a strident cry and the cloud darkens as they pull together Now it looks like a gigantic dark fist below the pendulous swagbellied clouds Why did you hit me Ty shouts at Jack and Jack is suddenly aware that the boy could kill him at a stroke if he wanted to In Wisconsin this power has been hidden except from eyes trained to see it Here though    here    To wake you up Jack shouts back He pushes himself up Was it that he points at the cap Ty looks at it then nods Yes The cap But you didnt know couldnt know how much the cap was stealing from you until you took it off Or someone knocked it off your forgetful head He returns his gaze to Jack His eyes are wide and level There is no shock in them now no dullness He doesnt glow exactly but he blazes with an inner light they all feel  with a power that dwarfs Lord Malshuns What do you want me to do he asks Tyler Marshall the lionesss cub Once more Jack points at the Big Combination Youre what all this has been about Ty Youre a Breaker He takes a deep breath and then whispers into the pink cup of the boys ear Break it Tyler Marshall turns his head and gazes deep into Jacks eyes He says Break it Jack nods his head and Ty looks back at the Big Combination Okay he says speaking not to Jack but to himself He blinks settles his feet clasps his hands in front of his waist A tiny wrinkle appears between his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth lift in the suggestion of a smile Okay Ty whispers For a second nothing happens Then a rumble emerges from the bowels of the Big Combination Its upper portion wavers like a heat mirage The guards hesitate and the screams of tortured metal rip through the air Visibly confused the toiling children look up look in all directions The mechanical screaming intensifies then divides into a hundred different versions of torture Gears reverse Cogs jam smoking to a halt cogs accelerate and strip their teeth The whole of the Big Combination shivers and quakes Deep in the earth boilers detonate and columns of fire and steam shoot upward halting sometimes shredding belts that have run for thousands of years powered by billions of bleeding footsies It is as if an enormous metal jug has sprung a hundred leaks at once Jack watches children leap from the lower levels and climb down the exterior of the structure in long continuous lines Children pour from the trembling building in dozens of unbroken streams Before the greenskinned whipslingers can make an organized attempt to stop their slaves from escaping the bees assemble massively around the great foundry When the guards begin to turn on the children the bees descend in a furious tide of buzzing wings and needling stings Some of Tys power has passed into them and their stings are fatal Guards topple and fall from the unmoving belts and trembling girders Others turn maddened on their own whipping and being whipped until they tumble through the dark air The Sawyer Gang does not linger to see the end of the slaughter The queen bee sails toward them out of the swarming chaos floats above their upturned heads and leads them back toward Black House In world upon world  in worlds strung side by side in multiple dimensions throughout infinity  evils shrivel and disperse despots choke to death on chicken bones tyrants fall before assassins bullets before the poisoned sweetmeats arrayed by their treacherous mistresses hooded torturers collapse dying on bloody stone floors Tys deed reverberates through the great numberless string of universes revenging evil as it spreads Three worlds over from ours and in the great city there known as Londinorium Turner Topham for two decades a respected member of Parliament and for three a sadistic pedophile bursts abruptly into flame as he strides along the crowded avenue known as PickaDerry Two worlds down a nicelooking young welder named Freddy Garver from the Isle of Irse another less seasoned member of Tophams clan turns his torch upon his own left hand and incinerates every particle of flesh off his bones Up up in his high faraway confinement the Crimson King feels a deep pain in his gut and drops into a chair grimacing Something he knows something fundamental has changed in his dreary fiefdom In the wake of the queen bee Tyler Marshall his eyes alight and his face without fear sits astride Jacks shoulders like a boy king Behind Jack and his friends hundreds upon hundreds of children who are fleeing from the disintegrating structure of the Big Combination come streaming on to Conger Road and the desolate fields beside it Some of these children are from our world many are not Children move across the dark empty plains in ragged armies advancing toward the entrances to their own universes Limping battalions of children stagger off like columns of drunken ants The children following the Sawyer Gang are no less ragged than the rest Half of them are naked or as good as naked These children have faces we have seen on milk cartons and flyers headed MISSING and on childfind Web sites faces from the dreams of heartbroken mothers and desolate fathers Some of them are laughing some are weeping some are doing both The stronger ones help the weaker ones along They do not know where they are going and they do not care That they are going is enough for them All they know is that they are free The great machine that had stolen their strength and their joy and their hope is behind them and a silken protective canopy of bees is above them and they are free At exactly  PM the Sawyer Gang steps out through the front door of Black House Tyler is now riding on Beezers burly shoulders They descend the steps and stand in front of Dale Gilbertsons cruiser theres a litter of dead bees on the hood and in the well where the windshield wipers hide Look at the house Hollywood Doc murmurs Jack does Its only a house now  a threestory job that might once have been a respectable ranch but has fallen into disrepair over the years To make matters worse someone has slopped it with black paint from top to bottom and stem to stern  even the windows have been blurred with swipes of that paint The overall effect is sad and eccentric but by no means sinister The houses slippery shifting shape has solidified and with the abbalahs glammer departed what remains is only the abandoned home of an old fellow who was pretty crazy and extremely dangerous An old fellow to put beside such human monsters as Dahmer Haarman and Albert Fish The leering rampant evil that once inhabited this building has been dissipated blown away and what remains is as mundane as an old man mumbling in a cell on Death Row There is something Jack must do to this wretched place  something the dying Mouse made him promise to do Doc Beezer says Look yonder A large dog  large but not monstrous  staggers slowly down the lane that leads back to Highway  It looks like a cross between a boxer and a Great Dane The side of its head and one of its rear paws have been blown away Its your devil dog the Beez says Doc gapes What that That Beezer confirms He draws his mm meaning to put the thing out of its misery but before he can it collapses on its side takes a single deep shuddering breath and then lies still Beezer turns to Jack and Dale Its all a lot smaller with the machine turned off isnt it I want to see my mother Ty says quietly Please may I Yes Jack says Do you mind swinging by your house and picking up your father I think he might like to go too Tyler breaks into a tired grin Yes he says Lets do that You got it Jack tells him Dale swings the car carefully around the yard and has reached the beginning of the lane when Ty calls out Look Look you guys Here they come Dale stops peers in the rearview mirror and whispers Oh Jack Holy Mother of God He puts the cruiser in park and gets out They all get out looking back at Black House Its shape remains ordinary but it has not quite given up all of its magic after all it seems Somewhere a door  perhaps in the cellar or a bedroom or a dirty and neglected but otherwise perfectly ordinary kitchen  remains open On this side is the Coulee Country on the other is Conger Road the smoking newly stopped hulk of the Big Combination and the Dintah Bees are coming out onto the porch of Black House Bees and the children the bees are leading They come in droves laughing and crying and holding hands Jack Sawyer has a brief brilliant image of animals leaving Noahs Ark after the flood Holy Mary Mother of God Dale whispers again The yard is filling with laughing crying murmuring children Jack walks up to Beezer who turns to him with a brilliant smile After all the children come through we have to close the door Jack says For good I know we do says Beezer You happen to have any brilliant ideas Well Beezer says let me put it this way If you promise me and I mean promise me not to ask any awkward questions or say anything about it later before midnight tonight I might find it possible to lay my hands on a substantial quantity of something pretty damn effective What Dynamite Please Beezer says Didnt I say effective You mean     Beezer smiles and his eyes become slits Im glad youre on my side Jack says See you back on the road before midnight Well have to sneak in but I dont think well have any trouble Sure wont have any on the way out Beezer says Doc claps Dale on the shoulder I hope youve got some ontheball childwelfare organizations in this part of the world Chiefy I think youre going to need them Holy    Dale turns stricken eyes to Jack What am I going to do Jack grins I think you better make a call to    what does Sarah call them The Color Posse A gleam of hope dawns in Dale Gilbertsons eyes Or maybe its incipient triumph John P Redding of the FBI officers Perry Brown and Jeffrey Black of the Wisconsin State Police He imagines this trio of bungholes faced with the appearance of a medieval childrens crusade in western Wisconsin Imagines the Dickensian piles of paperwork such an unheardof event must certainly generate It will keep them occupied for months or years It may generate nervous breakdowns Certainly it will give them something to think about other than Chief Dale Gilbertson of French Landing Jack he says What exactly do you suggest In broad strokes Jack says I suggest that they should get stuck with all the work and you should hog all the credit How does that sound to you Dale thinks about it Very fair he says What do you say we get this kiddo to his dad then both of them up to Arden to see his mom Good Jack says I only wish Henry was here too That makes us a pair Dale says and slides back behind the wheel A moment later they are rolling up the lane What about all those kids Ty asks looking out through the back window Are you just going to leave them Ill call WSP as soon as were back on the highway Dale says I think they should get on this right away dont you guys And the Feebs of course Right Beezer says Fuckin A Doc says An excellent administrative call Jack says and sits Tyler down on his lap In the meantime theyll be fine he says in the boys ear Theyve seen a lot worse than Wisconsin Let us slip now from the drivers window like the breeze we are and watch them go  four brave men and one brave child who will never be so young or so innocent again Behind them the now harmless and unmagicked yard of Black House is alive with children their faces dirty their eyes wide with wonder English is a minority tongue here and some of the languages being spoken will puzzle the worlds best linguists in the years ahead This is the beginning of a worldwide sensation Times cover story the following week will be The Miracle Children from Nowhere and as Dale has already surmised a bureaucratic nightmare Still they are safe And our guys are safe too All of them came back in one piece from the other side and surely we did not expect that most quests of this type usually demand at least one sacrifice a relatively minor character like Doc for instance Alls well that ends well And this can be the end if you want it to be neither of the scribbling fellows who have brought you this far would deny you that If you do choose to go on never say you werent warned youre not going to like what happens next XXXXX DRUDGE REPORT XXXXX FRENCH LANDING PD CHIEF REFUSES TO CANCEL PRESS CONFERENCE CITES SUPPORT OF TOWN OFFICIALS SOURCES CONFIRM CELEB LA COP WILL ATTEND FBI WISC SP EXPRESS STRONG DISAPPROVAL   Exclusive   One of them Tyler Marshall is from French Landing itself Another Josella Rakine is from Bating a small village in the south of England A third is from Baghdad All told  of the socalled Miracle Children have been identified in the week since they were discovered walking along a rural highway Rte  in western Wisconsin Yet these  are only the tip of the iceberg Sources close to the joint FBIWSP and now CIA investigation tell the Drudge Report that there are at least  children far more than have been reported in the mainstream press Who are they Who took them and to where How did they get to the town of French Landing which has been plagued by a serial killer now reported deceased in recent weeks What part was played by Jack Sawyer the Los Angeles detective who rose to stardom only to retire at age  And who was responsible for the massive explosion that destroyed a mysterious dwelling in the woods reputedly central to the Fisherman case Some of these questions may be answered tomorrow in French Landings La Follette Park when PD Chief Dale Gilbertson holds a press conference His longtime friend Jack Sawyer  reputed to have broken the Fisherman case singlehandedly  will be standing next to him when he takes the podium Also expected to be present are two deputies Armand St Pierre and Reginald Amberson who participated in last weeks rescue mission The press conference will take place over the strong  almost strident  objections of an FBIWSP task force headed by FBI agent John P Redding and Wisconsin State Police Detective Jeffrey Black They task force leaders believe this is nothing but a lastditch effort on the part of Gilbertson to save his job a source said He botched everything but luckily has a friend who knows a lot about public relations French Landing town officials sing a different tune This summer has been a nightmare for the people of French Landing says town treasurer Beth Warren Chief Gilbertson wants to assure the people that the nightmare is over If he can give us some answers about the children in the process of doing that so much the better Interest focuses on Jack Hollywood Sawyer who got to know Chief Gilbertson and the town of French Landing during the case of Thornberg Kinderling the socalled Prostitute Killer Sawyer was urged by Gilbertson to take an active role in the Fisherman case and apparently played a large part in the events that followed What events exactly were they That is what the world is waiting to find out The first answers may come tomorrow in La Follette Park on the banks of the mighty Mississippi Developing    YOU GUYS READY Dale asks Aw man I dont know Doc says This isnt the fifth time hes said it maybe not even the fifteenth Hes pale almost hyperventilating The four of them are in a Winnebago  kind of a rolling green room  that has been set up on the edge of La Follette Park Nearby is the podium on which theyll stand always assuming Doc can keep his legs under him and deliver their carefully crafted answers On the slope running down to the broad river are gathered nearly four hundred newspeople plus camera crews from six American networks and God knows how many foreign stations The gentlemen of the press arent in the worlds best mood because the prime space in front of the podium has been reserved for a representative sampling drawn by lottery of French Landings residents This was Dales one ironclad demand for the press conference The idea for the press conference itself came from Jack Sawyer Mellow out Doc Beezer says He looks bigger than ever in his gray linen slacks and opencollared white shirt  almost like a bear in a tuxedo He has even made an effort to comb his acres of hair And if you really think youre going to do one of the Three Ps  piss puke or pass out  stay here Nah Doc says miserably In for a penny in for a fuckin pound If were gonna give it a try lets give it a try Dale resplendent in his dress uniform looks at Jack The latter is if anything more resplendent in his gray summerweight suit and dark blue silk tie A matching blue handkerchief pokes from the breast pocket of his coat You sure this is the right thing Jack is completely sure Its not a matter of refusing to allow Sarah Gilbertsons Color Posse to steal the limelight its a matter of making certain that his old friend is in an unassailable position He can do this by telling a very simple story which the three other men will back up Ty will do the same Jack is confident The story is this Jacks other old friend the late Henry Leyden figured out the Fishermans identity from the  tape This tape was supplied by Dale his nephew The Fisherman killed Henry but not before the heroic Mr Leyden had mortally wounded him and passed his name to the police  Jacks other interest in this press conference understood perfectly and supported completely by Dale is to make sure Henry gets the credit he deserves An examination of French Landing property records and plats uncovered the fact that Charles Burnside owned a house on Highway  not far out of town Dale deputized Jack and two widebodies who just happened to be in the vicinity that would be Messrs Amberson and St Pierre and they went on out there From that point on Jack told his friends repeatedly in the days leading up to the press conference its vital that you remember the three little words that lead to most acquittals in criminal trials And what are those words  I cant remember  Dale said Jack nodded Right If you dont have a story to remember the bastards can never trip you up There was something in the air inside that place   No lie Beezer rumbled and grimaced   and it messed us up What we do remember is thisTy Marshall was in the backyard handcuffed to the clothesline whirligig Before Beezer St Pierre and Jack Sawyer slipped through the police barricades and vaporized Black House with plastic explosive one reporter got out there and took numerous pictures We know which reporter it was of course Wendell Green has finally realized his dreams of fame and fortune And Burnside was dead at his feet Beezer said Right With the key to the handcuffs in his pocket Dale you found that and released the boy There were a few other kids in the backyard but as to how many   We dont remember Doc said As to their sexes   A few boys a few girls Dale said We dont remember exactly how many of each And as for Ty how he was taken what happened to him   He said he didnt remember Dale said smiling We left We think we called to the other kids   But dont exactly remember   the Beez chips in Right and in any case they seemed safe enough where they were for the time being It was when we were putting Ty into the cruiser that we saw them all streaming out And called the Wisconsin State Police for backup Dale said I do remember that Of course you do Jack said benevolently But we have no idea how that darn place got blasted all to hell and we dont know who did it Some people Jack said are all too eager to take justice into their own hands Lucky they didnt blow their heads clean off said Dale All right Jack tells them now Theyre standing at the door Doc has produced half a joint and four quick deep tokes have calmed him visibly Just remember why were doing this The message is that we were there first we found Ty we saw only a few other children we deemed their situation secure due to the death of Charles Burnside also known as Carl Bierstone the South Side Monster and the Fisherman The message is that Dale behaved properly  that we all did  and he then handed the investigation off to the FBI and WSP who are now holding the baby Babies I guess in this case The message is that French Landing is okay again Last but far from least the message is that Henry Leydens the real star The heroic blind man who IDd Charles Burnside and broke the Fisherman case mortally wounding the monster and losing his own life in the process Amen Dale says Sweet old Uncle Henry Beyond the door of the Winnebago he can hear the surflike rumble of hundreds of people Maybe even a thousand He thinks This is what rock acts hear before they hit the stage A lump suddenly rises in his throat and he does his best to gulp it back down He reckons that if he keeps thinking of Uncle Henry he will be okay Anything else Jack says questions that get too specific   We cant remember Beezer says Because the air was bad Doc agrees Smelled like ether or chloro or something like that Jack surveys them nods smiles This will be a happy occasion on the whole he thinks A love feast Certainly the idea that he might be dying in a few minutes has not occurred to him Okay he says lets go out there and do it Were politicians this afternoon politicians at a press conference and its the politicians who stay on message who get elected He opens the RVs door The rumble of the crowd deepens in anticipation They cross to the juryrigged platform this way Beezer Dale Jack and the good Doctor They move in a warm white nova glare of exploding flashbulbs and k TV lights Jack has no idea why they need such things  the day is bright and warm a Coulee Country charmer  but it seems they do That they always do Voices cry Over here repeatedly There are also thrown questions which they ignore When it comes time to answer questions they will  as best they can  but for now they are simply stunned by the crowd The noise begins with the two hundred or so French Landing residents sitting on folding chairs in a ropedoff area directly in front of the podium They rise to their feet some clapping others waving clenched fists in the air like winning boxers The press picks it up from them and as our four friends mount the steps to the podium the roar becomes a thunder We are with them up on the platform with them and God we see so many faces we know looking up at us Theres Morris Rosen who slipped Henry the Dirtysperm CD on our first day in town Behind him is a contingent from the now defunct Maxton Elder Care the lovely Alice Weathers is surrounded by Elmer Jesperson Ada Meyerhoff in a wheelchair Flora Flostad and the Boettcher brothers Hermie and Tom Tom Tansy Freneau looking a bit spaced out but no longer outright insane is standing next to Lester Moon who has his arm around her Arnold Flashlight Hrabowski Tom Lund Bobby Dulac and the other members of Dales department are up on their feet dancing around and cheering crazily Look over there  thats Enid Purvis the neighbor who called Fred at work on the day Judy finally highsided it Theres Rebecca Vilas looking almost nunnish in a highcollared dress but cry no tears for her Argentina Becky has stashed away quite a nice bundle thank you very much Butch Yerxa is with her At the back of the crowd lurking shamefully but unable to stay away from the triumph of their friends are William Strassner and Hubert Cantinaro better known to us as Kaiser Bill and Sonny Look there Herb Roeper who cuts Jacks hair standing beside Buck Evitz who delivers his mail So many others we know and to whom we must say goodbye under less than happy circumstances In the front row Wendell Green is hopping around like a hen on a hot griddle God knows how he got into the ropedoff area being from La Riviere instead of French Landing but hes there taking pictures Twice he bumps into Elvena Morton Henrys housekeeper The third time he does it she bats him a damned good one on top of the head Wendell hardly seems to notice His head has taken worse shots during the course of the Fisherman investigation And off to one side we see someone else we may or may not recognize An elderly darkskinned gentleman wearing shades He looks a little bit like an old blues singer He also looks a little bit like a movie actor named Woody Strode The applause thunders and thunders Folks cheer Hats are thrown in the air and sail on the summer breeze Their welcome becomes a kind of miracle in itself an affirmation perhaps even an acceptance of the children who are widely supposed to have been held in some bizarre sexual bondage linked to the Internet Isnt all that weird stuff somehow linked to the Internet And of course they applaud because the nightmare is over The boogeyman died in his own backyard died at the foot of a prosaic now vaporized aluminum clothes whirligig and they are safe again Oh how the cheers ring in these few last moments of Jack Sawyers life on planet Earth Birds are startled up from the bank of the river and go squawking and veering into the sky seeking quieter environs On the river itself a freighter responds to the cheers  or perhaps joins in  by blasting its air horn over and over Other boats get the idea and add to the cacophony Without thinking about what hes doing Jack takes Docs right hand in his left Dales left hand in his right Dale takes Beezers hand and the Sawyer Gang raises their arms together facing the crowd Which of course goes nuts If not for what is going to happen next it would be the picture of the decade perhaps of the century They stand there in triumph living symbols of victory with their linked hands in the sky the crowd cheering the videocams rolling the Nikons flashing and that is when the woman in the third row begins to make her move This is someone else we know but it takes us a second or two to recognize her because she has had nothing at all to do with the case we have been following Shes just been    sort of lurking around The two hundred seats up front have been awarded by random drawing from the French Landing voter rolls the lucky lottery winners notified by Debbi Anderson Pam Stevens and Dit Jesperson This woman was No  Several people shrink from her as she passes them although in their happy frenzy they are hardly aware of doing it this pale woman with clumps of strawcolored hair sticking to her cheeks smells of sweat and sleeplessness and vodka Shes got a little purse The little purse is open Shes reaching into it And we who have lived through the second half of the twentieth century and have through the miracle of TV witnessed a dozen assassinations and near assassinations know exactly what she is reaching for We want to scream a warning to the four men standing with their linked hands raised to the sky but all we can do is watch Only the black man with the sunglasses sees whats happening He turns and starts to move aware that she has probably beaten him that he is probably going to be too late No Speedy Parker thinks It cant end like this it cant Jack get down he shouts but no one hears him over the clapping the cheering the wild hurrahs The crowd seems to block him on purpose surging back and forth in front of him no matter which way he moves For a moment Wendell Green still bobbing around like a man in the throes of an epileptic seizure is in the assassins path Then she heaves him aside with the strength of a madwoman Why not She is a madwoman Folks   Dales got his mouth practically on the microphone and the PA horns mounted to the nearby trees whine with feedback Hes still holding up Jacks hand on his left and Beezers on his right Theres a small dazed smile on his face Thank you folks we sure do appreciate the support but if you could just quiet down    Thats when Jack sees her Its been a long time years but he recognizes her at once He should she spat in his face one day as he left the Los Angeles courthouse Spat at him and called him a railroading bastard Shes lost fifty pounds since then Jack thinks Maybe more Then he sees the hand in the purse and even before it comes back out he knows whats happening here The worst is that he can do nothing about it Doc and Dale have his hands in a death grip He drags in a deep breath and shouts as he has been taught to do in just such a situation as this  Gun  and Dale Gilbertson nods as if to say Yes it is it is fun Behind her pushing through the clapping cheering crowd he sees Speedy Parker but unless Speedys got a particularly good magic trick up his sleeve  He doesnt Speedy Parker known in the Territories as Parkus is just fighting his way into the aisle when the woman standing below the platform brings out her gun Its an ugly little thing a bulldog  with its handle wrapped in black kitchen tape and Jack has just half a second to think that maybe it will blow up in her hand Gun Jack shouts again and its Doc Amberson who hears him and sees the snarling woman crouched just below them Ohfuck Doc says Wanda no Jack cries Doc has let go of his left hand Dale has still got his right one hoisted high in the summer air and Jack holds it out to her like a traffic cop Wanda Kinderlings first bullet goes right through the palm mushrooms slightly begins to tumble and punches into the hollow of Jacks left shoulder Wanda speaks to him Theres too much noise for Jack to hear her but he knows what shes saying just the same Here you go you railroading son of a bitch  Thorny says hello She empties the remaining five bullets into Jack Sawyers chest and throat No one hears the insignificant popping sounds made by Wandas bulldog  not over all that clapping and cheering but Wendell Green has got his camera tilted up and when the detective jerks backward our favorite reporters finger punches the Nikons shutterrelease button in simple reflex It snaps off eight shots The third is the picture the one that will eventually become as well known as the photo of the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima and that of Lee Harvey Oswald clutching his belly in the parking garage of the Dallas police station In Wendells photo Jack Sawyer looks calmly down toward the shooter who is just a blur at the very bottom of the frame The expression on his face might be one of forgiveness Daylight is clearly visible through the hole in the palm of his outstretched hand Droplets of blood as red as rubies hang frozen in the air beside his throat which has been torn open The cheering and the applause stop as if amputated There is a moment of awful uncomprehending silence Jack Sawyer shot twice in the lungs and once in the heart as well as in the hand and the throat stands where he is gazing at the hole below his spread fingers and above his wrist Wanda Kinderling peers up at him with her dingy teeth bared Speedy Parker is looking at Jack with an expression of naked horror that his wraparound sunglasses cannot conceal To his left up on one of four media towers surrounding the platform a young cameraman faints and falls to the ground Then suddenly the freezeframe that Wendell has captured without even knowing it bursts open and everything is in motion Wanda Kinderling screams See you in hell Hollywood  several people will later verify this  and then puts the muzzle of her  to her temple Her look of vicious satisfaction gives way to a more typical one of dazed incomprehension when the twitch of her finger produces nothing but a dry click The bulldog  is empty A moment later she is pretty much obliterated  broken neck broken left shoulder four broken ribs  as Doc stagedives onto her and drives her to the ground His left shoe strikes the side of Wendell Greens head but this time Wendell sustains no more than a bloody ear Well he was due to catch a break wasnt he On the platform Jack Sawyer looks unbelievingly at Dale tries to speak and cannot He staggers remains upright a moment longer then collapses Dales face has gone from bemused delight to utter shock and dismay in a heartbeat He seizes the microphone and screams HES SHOT WE NEED A DOCTOR The PA horns shriek with more feedback No doctor comes forward Many in the crowd panic and begin to run The panic spreads Beezer is down on one knee turning Jack over Jack looks up at him still trying to speak Blood pours from the corners of his mouth Ah fuck its bad Dale its really bad Beezer cries and then he is knocked sprawling One wouldnt expect that the scrawny old black man whos vaulted up onto the stage could knock around a bruiser like Beezer but this is no ordinary old man As we well know There is a thin but perfectly visible envelope of white light surrounding him Beezer sees it His eyes widen The crowd meanwhile flees to the four points of the compass Panic infects some of the ladies and gentlemen of the press as well Not Wendell Green he holds his ground like a hero snapping pictures until his Nikon is as empty as Wanda Kinderlings gun He snaps the black man as he stands with Jack Sawyer in his arms snaps Dale Gilbertson putting a hand on the black mans shoulder snaps the black man turning and speaking to Dale When Wendell later asks French Landings chief of police what the old fellow said Dale tells him he doesnt remember  besides in all that pandemonium he could hardly make it out anyway All bullshit of course but we may be sure that if Jack Sawyer had heard Dales response he would have been proud When in doubt tell em you cant remember Wendells last picture shows Dale and Beezer watching with identical dazed expressions as the old fellow mounts the steps to the Winnebago with Jack Sawyer still in his arms Wendell has no idea how such an old party can carry such a big man  Sawyer is sixtwo and must go a hundred and ninety at least  but he supposes its the same sort of deal that allows a distraught mother to lift up the car or truck beneath which her kid is pinned And it doesnt matter Its small beans compared to what happens next Because when a group of men led by Dale Beez and Doc burst into the Winnebago Wendell is at the rear of this group they find nothing but a single overturned chair and several splashes of Jack Sawyers blood in the kitchenette where Jack gave his little gang their final instructions The trail of blood leads toward the rear where theres a foldout bed and a toilet cubicle And there the drops and splashes simply stop Jack and the old man who carried him in here have vanished Doc and Beezer are babbling almost in hysterics They bounce between questions of where Jack might have gone to distraught recollections of the final few moments on the platform before the shooting started They cant seem to let that go and Dale has an idea it will be quite a while before he can let go of it himself He realizes now that Jack saw the woman coming that he was trying to get his hand free of Dales so he could respond Dale thinks it may be time to quite the chiefs job after all find some other line of work Not right now though Right now he wants to get Beezer and Doc away from the Color Posse get them calmed down He has something to tell them that may help with that Tom Lund and Bobby Dulac join him and the three of them escort Beez and Doc away from the Winnebago where Special Agent Redding and WSP Detective Black are already establishing a CIP crime investigation perimeter Once theyre behind the platform Dale looks into the stunned faces of the two burly bikers Listen to me Dale says I should have stepped in front of him Doc says I saw her coming why didnt I step in front   Shut up and listen Doc shuts up Tom and Bobby are also listening their eyes wide That black man said something to me What Beezer asks He said Let me take him  there may still be a chance  Doc who has treated his share of gunshot wounds gives a forlorn little chuckle And you believed him Not then not exactly Dale says But when we went in there and the place was empty   No back door either Beezer adds Docs skepticism has faded a little You really think     I do Dale Gilbertson says and wipes his eyes I have to hope And you guys have to help me All right Beezer says Then we will And we think that here we must leave them for good standing under a blue summer sky close to the Father of Waters standing beside a platform with blood on the boards Soon life will catch them up again and pull them back into its furious current but for a few moments they are together joined in hope for our mutual friend Let us leave them so shall we Let us leave them hoping ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE TERRITORIES    ONCE UPON A TIME as all the best old stories used to begin when we all lived in the forest and nobody lived anywhere else a scarred Captain of the Outer Guards named Farren led a frightened little boy named Jack Sawyer through the Queens Pavilion That small boy did not see the Queens court however no he was taken through a maze of corridors behind the scenes secret and seldomvisited places where spiders spun in the high corners and the warm drafts were heavy with the smells of cooking from the kitchen Finally Farren placed his hands in the boys armpits and lifted him up Theres a panel in front of you now he whispered  do you remember I think you were there I think we both were although we were younger then werent we Slide it to the left Jack did as he was bidden and found himself peeking into the Queens chamber the room in which almost everyone expected her to die    just as Jack expected his mother to die in her room at the Alhambra Inn and Gardens in New Hampshire It was a bright airy room filled with bustling nurses who had assumed a busy and purposeful manner because they had no real idea of how to help their patient The boy looked through the peephole into this room at a woman he at first thought was his own mother somehow magically transported to this place and we looked with him none of us guessing that years later grown to a man Jack Sawyer would be lying in the same bed where he first saw his mothers Twinner Parkus who has brought him from French Landing to the Inner Baronies now stands at the panel through which Jack hoisted by Captain Farren once looked Beside him is Sophie of Canna now known in the Territories as both the Young Queen and Sophie the Good There are no nurses in the sleeping chamber today Jack lies silent beneath a slowly turning fan Where he is not wrapped in bandages his skin is pale His closed eyelids are hazed with a delicate purple bruiseblush The rise and fall of the fine linen sheet drawn up to his chin can hardly be seen    but its there He breathes For now at least he lives Speaking quietly Sophie says If hed never touched the Talisman   If hed never touched the Talisman actually held it in his arms he would have been dead there on that platform before I could even get close to him Parkus says But of course if not for the Talisman he never would have been there in the first place What chance has he She looks at him Somewhere in another world Judy Marshall has already begun to subside back into her ordinary suburban life There will be no such life for her Twinner however  hard times have come again in this part of the universe  and her eyes gleam with an imperious regal light Tell me the truth sir I would not have a lie Nor would I give you one my lady he tells her I believe that thanks to the residual protection of the Talisman he will recover Youll be sitting next to him one morning or evening and his eyes will open Not today and probably not this week but soon And as for returning to his world The world of his friends Parkus has brought her to this place because the spirit of the boy Jack was still lingers ghostly and childsweet He was here before the road of trials opened ahead of him and in some ways hardened him He was here with his innocence still intact What has surprised him about Jack as a grown man  and touched him in a way Parkus never expected to be touched again  is how much of that innocence still remained in the man the boy has become That too is the Talismans doing of course Parkus Your mind wanders Not far my lady not far You ask if he may return to his world after being mortally wounded three perhaps even four times  after being heartpierced in fact I brought him here because all the magic that has touched and changed his life is stronger here for good or ill the Territories have been Jack Sawyers wellspring since he was a child And it worked He lives But he will wake different Hell be like    Parkus pauses thinking hard Sophie waits quietly beside him Distantly from the kitchen comes the bellow of a cook lacing into one of the prentices There are animals that live in the sea breathing with gills Parkus says at last And over times long course some of them develop lungs Such creatures can live both under the water and on the land Yes So I was taught as a girl Sophie agrees patiently But some of these latter creatures lose their gills and can live only on the land Jack Sawyer is that sort of creature now I think You or I could dive into the water and swim beneath the surface for a little while and he may be able to go back and visit his own world for short periods    in time of course But if either you or I were to try living beneath the water   Wed drown Indeed we would And if Jack were to try living in his own world again returning to his little house in Norway Valley for instance his wounds would return in a space of days or weeks Perhaps in different forms  his death certificate might specify heart failure for instance  but it would be Wanda Kinderlings bullet that killed him all the same Wanda Kinderlings heart shot Parkus bares his teeth Hateful woman I believe the abbalah was aware of her no more than I was but look at the damage shes caused Sophie ignores this She is looking at the silent sleeping man in the other room Condemned to live in such a pleasant land as this    She turns to him It is a pleasant land isnt it sirrah Still a pleasant land in spite of all Parkus smiles and bows Around his neck a sharks tooth swings at the end of a fine gold necklace Indeed it is She nods briskly So living here might not be so terrible He says nothing After a moment or two her assumed briskness departs and her shoulders sag Id hate it she says in a small voice To be barred from my own world except for occasional brief visits    paroles    to have to leave at the first cough or twinge in my chest    Id hate it Parkus shrugs Hell have to accept what is Like it or not his gills are gone Hes a creature of the Territories now And God the Carpenter knows theres work for him over here The business of the Tower is moving toward its climax I believe Jack Sawyer may have a part to play in that although I cant say for sure In any case when he heals he wont want for work Hes a coppiceman and theres always work for such She looks through the slit in the wall her lovely face troubled You must help him dear Parkus says I love him she says speaking very low And he loves you But whats coming will be difficult Why must that be Parkus Why must life always demand so much and give so little He draws her into his arms and she goes willingly her face pressed against his chest In the dark behind the chamber in which Jack Sawyer sleeps Parkus answers her question with a single word Ka Epilogue SHE SITS BY his bed on the first night of FullEarth Moon ten days after her conversation with Parkus in the secret passageway Outside the pavilion she can hear children singing The Green Corn ADayo On her lap is a scrap of embroidery It is summer still summer and the air is sweet with summers mystery And in this billowing room where his mothers Twinner once lay Jack Sawyer opens his eyes Sophie lays aside her embroidery leans forward and puts her lips soft against the shell of his ear Welcome back she says My heart my life and my love welcome back April
