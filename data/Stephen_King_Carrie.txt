News item from the Westover Me weekly Enterprise August  RAIN OF STONES REPORTED It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August th The stones fell principally on the home of Mrs Margaret White damaging the roof extensively and ruining two gutters and a downspout valued at approximately  Mrs White a widow lives with her threeyearold daughter Carietta Mrs White could not be reached for comment Nobody was really surprised when it happened not really not at the subconscious level where savage things grow On the surface all the girls in the shower room were shocked thrilled ashamed or simply glad that the White bitch had taken it in the mouth again Some of them might also have claimed surprise but of course their claim was untrue Carrie had been going to school with some of them since the first grade and this had been building since that time building slowly and immutably in accordance with all the laws that govern human nature building with all the steadiness of a chain reaction approaching critical mass What none of them knew of course was that Carrie White was telekinetic Graffiti scratched on a desk of the Barker Street Grammar school in Chamberlain Carrie White eats shit The locker room was filled with shouts echoes and the subterranean sound of showers splashing on tile The girls had been playing volleyball in Period One and their morning sweat was light and eager Girls stretched and writhed under the hot water squalling flicking water squirting white bars of soap from hand to hand Carrie stood among them stolidly a frog among swans She was a chunky girl with pimples on her neck and back and buttocks her wet hair completely without colour It rested against her face with dispirited sogginess and she simply stood head slightly bent letting the water splat against her flesh and roll off She looked the part of the sacrificial goat the constant butt believer in lefthanded monkey wrenches perpetual foulup and she was She wished forlornly and constantly that Ewen High had individualand thus privateshowers like the high schools at Andover or Boxford They stared They always stared Showers turning off one by one girls stepping out removing pastel bathing caps towelling spraying deodorant checking the clock over the door Bras were hooked underpants stepped into Steam hung in the air the place might have been an Egyptian bathhouse except for the constant rumble of the Jacuzzi whirlpool bath in the corner Calls and catcalls rebounded with all the snap and flicker of billiard balls after a hard break so Tommy said he hated it on me and I Im going with my sister and her husband He picks his nose but so does she so theyre very shower after school and too cheap to spend a goddam penny so Cindi and I Miss Desjardin their slim nonbreasted gym teacher stepped in craned herneck around briefly and slapped her hands together once smartly What are you waiting for Carrie Doom Bell in five minutes Her shorts were blinding white her legs not too curved but striking in their unobtrusive muscularity A silver whistle won in college archery competition hung around her neck The girls giggled and Carrie looked up her eyes slow and dazed from the heat and the steady pounding roar of the water Ohuh It was a strangely froggy sound grotesquely apt and the girls giggled again Sue Snell had whipped a towel from her hair with the speed of a magician embarking on a wondrous feat and began to comb rapidly Miss Desjardin made an irritated cranking gesture at Carrie and stepped out Carrie turned off the shower It died in a drip and a gurgle It wasnt until she stepped out that they all saw the blood running down her leg From The Shadow Exploded Documented Facts and Specific Conclusions Derived from the Case of Carietta White by David R Congress Tulane University Press  p  It can hardly be disputed that failure to note specific instances of telekinesis during the White girls earlier years must be attributed to the conclusions offered by White and Steams in their paper Telekinesis A Wild Talent Revisitedthat the ability to move objects by effort of the will alone comes to the fore only in moments of extreme personal stress The talent is well hidden indeed how else could it have remained submerged for centuries with only the tip of the iceberg showing above a sea of quackery We have only skimpy hearsay evidence upon which to lay our foundation in this case but even this is enough to indicate that a TK potential of immense magnitude existed within Carrie White The great tragedy is that we are now all Mondaymorning quarterbacks  Period The catcall came first from Chris Hargensen It struck the tiled walls rebounded and struck again Sue Snell gasped laughter from her nose and felt an odd vexing mixture of hate revulsion exasperation and pity She just looked so dumb standing there not knowing what was going on God youd think she never PERiod It was becoming a chant an incantation Someone in the background perhaps Hargensen again Sue couldnt tell in the jungle of echoes was yelling Plug it up with hoarse uninhibited abandon PERiod PERiod PERiod Carrie stood dumbly in the centre of a forming circle water rolling from her skin in beads She stood like a patient ox aware that the joke was on her as always dumbly embarrassed but unsurprised Sue felt welling disgust as the first dark drops of menstrual blood struck the tile in dimesized drops For Gods sake Carrie you got your period Sue cried Clean yourself up Ohuh She looked around bovinely Her hair stuck to her cheeks in a curving helmet shape There was a cluster of acne on one shoulder At sixteen the elusive stamp of hurt was already marked clearly in her eyes She thinks theyre for lipstick Ruth Grogan suddenly shouted with cryptic glee and then burst into a shriek of laughter Sue remembered the comment later and fitted it Into a general picture but now it was only another senseless sound in the confusion Sixteen She was thinking She must know whats happening she More droplets of blood Carrie still blinked around at her classmates in slow bewilderment Helen Shyres turned around and made mock throwingup gestures Youre bleeding Sue yelled suddenly furiously Youre bleeding you big dumb pudding Carrie looked down at herself She shrieked The sound was very loud in the humid locker room A tampon suddenly struck her in the chest and fell with a plop at her feet A red flower stained the absorbent cotton and spread Then the laughter disgusted contemptuous horrified seemed to rise and bloom into something jagged and ugly and the girls were bombarding her with tampons and sanitary napkins some from purses some from the broken dispenser on the wall They flew like snow and the chant became Plug it up Plug it up Plug it Sue was throwing them too throwing and chanting with the rest not really sure what she was doing  a charm had occurred to her mind and it glowed there like neon Theres no harm in it really no harm in it really no harmIt was still flashing and glowing reassuringly when Carrie suddenly began to howl and back away flailing her arms and grunting and gobbling The girls stopped realizing that fission and explosion had finally been reached It was at this point when looking back that some of them would claim surprise Yet there had been all these years all these years of lets shortsheet Carries bed at Christian Youth Camp and I found this love letter from Carrie to Flash Bobby Pickett lets copy it and pass it around and hide her underpants somewhere and put this snake in her shoe and duck her again duck her again Carrie tagging along stubbornly on biking trips known one year as puddn and the next year as truckface always smelling sweaty not able to catch up catching poison ivy from urinating in the bushes and everyone finding out hey scratchass your bum itch Billy Preston putting peanut butter in her hair that time she fell asleep in study hall the pinches the legs outstretched in school aisles to trip her up the books knocked from her desk the obscene postcard tucked into her purse Carrie on the church picnic and kneeling down clumsily to pray and the seam of her old madras skirt splitting along the zipper like the sound of a huge windbreakage Carrie always missing the ball even in kickball failing on her face in Modern Dancing during their sophomore year and chipping a tooth running into the net during volleyball wearing stockings that were always run running or about to run always showing sweat stains under the arms of her blouses even the time Chris Hargensen called up after school from the Kelly Fruit Company downtown and asked her if she knew that pig poop was spelled CARRIE Suddenly all this and the critical mass was reached The ultimate shiton grossout putdown long searched for was found Fission She backed away howling in the new silence fat forearms crossing her face a tampon stuck in the middle of her pubic hair The girls watched her their eyes shining solemnly Carrie backed into the side of one of the four large shower compartments and slowly collapsed into a sitting position Slow helpless groans jerked out of her Her eyes rolled with wet whiteness like the eyes of a hog in the slaughtering pen Sue said slowly hesitantly I think this must be the first time she ever That was when the door pumped open with a flat and hurried bang and Miss Desjardin burst in to see what the matter was From The Shadow Exploded p  Both medical and psychological writers on the subject are in agreement that Carrie Whites exceptionally late and traumatic commencement of the menstrual cycle might well have provided the trigger for her latent talent It seems incredible that as late as  Carrie knew nothing of the mature womans monthly cycle It is nearly as incredible to believe that the girls mother would permit her daughter to reach the age of nearly seventeen without consulting a gynaecologist concerning the daughters failure to menstruate Yet the facts are incontrovertible When Carrie White realized she was bleeding from the vaginal opening she had no idea of what was taking place She was innocent of the entire concept of menstruation One of her surviving classmates Ruth Grogan tells of entering the girls locker room at Ewen High School the year before the events we are concerned with and seeing Carrie using a tampon to blot her lipstick with At that time Miss Grogan said What the hell are you up to Miss White replied Isnt this right Miss Grogan then replied Sure Sure it is Ruth Grogan let a number of her girl friends in on this she later told this interviewer she thought it was sorta cute and if anyone tried in the future to inform Carrie of the true purpose of what she was using to make up with she apparently dismissed the explanation as an attempt to pull her leg This was a facet of her life that she had become exceedingly wary of When the girls were gone to their Period Two classes and the bell had been silenced several of them had slipped quietly out the back door before Miss Desjardin could begin to take names Miss Desjardin employed the standard tactic for hysterics She slapped Carrie smartly across the face She hardly would have admitted the pleasure the act gave her and she certainly would have denied that she regarded Carrie as a fat whiny bag of lard A firstyear teacher she still believed that she thought all children were good Carrie looked up at her dumbly face still contorted and working MMMiss DDDesD Get up Miss Desjardin said dispassionately Get up and tend to yourself Im bleeding to death Carrie screamed and one blind searching hand came up and clutched Miss Desjardins white shorts It left a bloody handprint I  you    The gym teachers face contorted into a pucker of disgust and she suddenly hurled Came stumbling to her feet Get over there Carrie stood swaying between the showers and the wall with its dime sanitarynapkin dispenser slumped over breasts pointing at the floor her arms dangling limply She looked like an ape Her eyes were shiny and blank Now Miss Desjardin said with hissing deadly emphasis you take one of those napkins out  no never mind the coin slot its broken anyway take one and damn it will you do it You act as if you never had a period before Period Carrie said Her expression of complete unbelief was too genuine too full of dumb and hopeless horror to be ignored or denied A terrible and black foreknowledge grew in Rita Desjardins mind It was incredible could not be She herself had begun menstruation shortly after her eleventh birthday and had gone to the head of the stairs to yell down excitedly Hey Mum Im on the rag Carrie she said now She advanced toward the girl Carrie Carrie flinched away At the same instant a rack of softball bats in the corner fell over with a large echoing bang They rolled every which way making Desjardin jump Carrie is this your first period But now that the thought had been admitted she hardly had to ask The blood was dark and flowing with terrible heaviness Both of Carries legs were smeared and splattered with it as though she had waded through a river of blood It hurts Carrie groaned My stomach  That passes Miss Desjardin said Pity and selfshame met in her and mixed uneasily You have to  uh stop the flow of blood You There was a bright flash overhead followed by a flashgunlike pop as a lightbulb sizzled and went out Miss Desjardin cried out with surprise and it occurred to her the whole damn place is falling in that this kind of thing always seemed to happen around Carrie when she was upset as if bad luck dogged her every step The thought was gone almost as quickly as it had come She took one of the sanitary napkins from the broken dispenser and unwrapped it Look she said Like this From The Shadow Exploded p  Carrie Whites mother Margaret White gave birth to her daughter on September   under circumstances which can only be termed bizarre In fact an overview of the Came White case leaves the careful student with one feeling ascendant over all others that Carrie was the only issue of a family as odd as any that has ever been brought to popular attention As noted earlier Ralph White died in February of  when a steel girder fell out of a carrying sling on a housingproject job in Portland Mrs White continued to live alone in their suburban Chamberlain bungalow Due to the Whites nearfanatical fundamentalist religious beliefs Mrs White had no friends to see her through her period of bereavement And when her labour began seven months later she was alone At approximately  PM on September  the neighbours on Carlin Street began to hear screams from the White bungalow The police however were not summoned to the scene until after  PM We are left with two unappetizing alternatives to explain this time lag Either Mrs Whites neighbours on the street did not wish to become involved in a police investigation or dislike for her had become so strong that they deliberately adopted a waitandsee attitude Mrs Georgia McLaughlin the only one of the three remaining residents who were on the street at that time and who would talk to me said that she did not call the police because she thought the screams had something to do with holy rollin When the police did arrive at  PM the screams had become irregular Mrs White was found in her bed upstairs and the investigating officer Thomas G Mearton at first thought she had been the victim of an assault The bed was drenched with blood and a butcher knife lay on the floor It was only then that he saw the baby still partially wrapped in the placental membrane at Mrs Whites breast She had apparently cut the umbilical cord herself with the knife It staggers both imagination and belief to advance the hypothesis that Mrs Margaret White did not know she was pregnant or even understand what the word entails and recent scholars such as J W Bankson and George Felding have made a more reasonable case for the hypothesis that the concept linked irrevocably in her mind with the sin of intercourse had been blocked entirely from her mind She may simply have refused to believe that such a thing could happen to her We have records of at least three letters to a friend in Kenosha Wisconsin that seem to prove conclusively that Mrs White believed from her fifth month on that she had a cancer of the womanly parts and would soon join her husband in heaven  When Miss Desjardin led Carrie up to the office fifteen minutes later the halls were mercifully empty Classes droned onwards behind closed doors Carries shrieks had finally ended but she had continued to weep with steady regularity Desjardin had finally placed the napkin herself cleaned the girl up with wet paper towels and gotten her back into her plain cotton underpants She tried twice to explain the commonplace reality of menstruation but Carrie clapped her hands over her ears and continued to cry Mr Morton the assistant principal was out of his office in a flash when they entered Billy deLois and Henry Trennant two boys waiting for the lecture due them for cutting French I goggled around from their chairs Come in Mr Morton said briskly Come right in He glared over Desjardins shoulder at the boys who were staring at the bloody handprint on her shorts What are YOU looking at Blood Henry said and smiled with a kind of vacuous surprise Two detention periods Morton snapped He glanced down at the bloody handprint and blinked He closed the door behind them and began pawing through the top drawer of his filing cabinet for a school accident form Are you all right uh Carrie Desjardin supplied Carrie White Mr Morton had finally located an accident form There was a large coffee stain on it You wont need that Mr Morton I suppose it was the trampoline We just  I wont No But I think Carrie should be allowed to go home for the rest of the day Shes had a rather frightening experience Her eyes flashed a signal which he caught but could not interpret Yes okay if you say so Good Fine Morton crumpled the form back into the filing cabinet slammed it shut with his thumb in the drawer and grunted He whirled gracefully to the door yanked it open glared at Billy and Henry and called Miss Fish could we have a dismissal slip here please Carrie Wright White said Miss Desjardin White Morton agreed Billy deLois sniggered Weeks detention Morton barked A blood blister was forming under his thumbnail Hurt like hell Carries steady monotonous weeping went on and on Miss Fish brought the yellow dismissal slip and Morton scrawled his initials on it with his silver pocket pencil wincing at the pressure on his wounded thumb Do you need a ride Cassie he asked We can call a cab if you need one She shook her head He noticed with distaste that a large bubble of green mucus had formed at one nostril Morton looked over her head and at Miss Desjardin Im sure shell be all right she said Carrie only has to go over to Carlin Street The fresh air will do her good Morton gave the girl the yellow slip You can go now Cassie he said magnanimously Thats not my name she screamed suddenly Morton recoiled and Miss Desjardin jumped as if struck from behind The heavy ceramic ashtray on Mortons desk it was Rodins Thinker with his head turned into a receptacle for cigarette butts suddenly toppled to the rug as if to take cover from the force of her scream Butts and flakes of Mortons pipe tobacco scattered on the palegreen nylon rug Now listen Morton said trying to muster sternness I know youre upset but that doesnt mean Ill stand for Please Miss Desjardin said quietly Morton blinked at her and then nodded curtly He tried to project the image of a lovable John Wayne figure while performing the disciplinary functions that were his main job as Assistant Principal but did not succeed very well The administration usually represented at Jay Cee suppers PTA functions and American Legion award ceremonies by Principal Henry Grayle usually termed him lovable Mort The student body was more apt to term him that crazy assjabber from the office But as few students such as Billy deLois and Henry Trennant spoke at PTA functions or town meetings the administrations view tended to carry the day Now lovable Mort still secretly nursing his jammed thumb smiled at Carrie and said Go along then if you like Miss Wright Or would you like to sit a spell and just collect yourself Ill go she muttered and swiped at her hair She got up then looked around at Miss Desjardin Her eyes were wide open and dark with knowledge They laughed at me Threw things Theyve always laughed Desjardin could only look at her helplessly Carrie left For a moment there was silence Morton and Desjardin watched her go Then with an awkward throatclearing sound Mr Morton hunkered down carefully and began to sweep together the debris from the fallen ashtray What was that all about She sighed and looked at the drying maroon handprint on her shorts with distaste She got her period Her first period In the shower Morton cleared his throat again and his cheeks went pink The sheet of paper he was sweeping with moved even faster Isnt she a bit uh Old for her first Yes Thats what made it so traumatic for her Although I cant understand why her mother The thought trailed off forgotten for the moment I dont think I handled it very well Morty but I didnt understand what was going on She thought she was bleeding to death He stared up sharply I dont believe she knew there was such a thing as menstruation until half an hour ago Hand me that little brush there Miss Desjardin Yes thats it She handed him a little brush with the legend Chamberlain Hardware and Lumber Company NEVER Brushes You Off written up the handle He began to brush his pile of ashes on to the paper Theres still going to be some for the vacuum cleaner I guess This deep pile is miserable I thought I set that ashtray back on the desk further Funny how things fall over He bumped his head on the desk and sat up abruptly Its hard for me to believe that a girl in this or any other high school could get through three years and still be alien to the fact of menstruation Miss Desjardin Its even more difficult for me she said But its all I can think of to explain her reaction And shes always been a group scapegoat Urn He funnelled the ashes and butts into the wastebasket and dusted his hands Ive placed her I think White Margaret Whites daughter Must be That makes it a little easier to believe He sat down behind his desk and smiled apologetically Theres so many of them After five years or so they all start to merge into one group face You call boys by their brothers names that type of thing Its hard Of course it is Wait til youve been in the game twenty years like me he said morosely looking down at his blood blister You get kids that look familiar and find out you had their daddy the year you started teaching Margaret White was before my time for which I am profoundly grateful She told Mrs Bicente God rest her that the Lord was reserving a special burning seat in hell for her because she gave the kids an outline of Mr Darwins beliefs on evolution She was suspended twice while she was here once for beating a classmate with her purse Legend has it that Margaret saw the classmate smoking a cigarette Peculiar religious views Very peculiar His John Wayne expression suddenly snapped down The other girls Did they really laugh at her Worse They were yelling and throwing sanitary napkins at her when I walked in Throwing them like like peanuts Oh Oh dear John Wayne disappeared Mr Morton went scarlet You have names Yes Not all of them although some of them may rat on the rest Christine Hargensen appeared to be the ringleader  as usual Chris and her Mortimer Snurds Morton murmured Yes Tina Blake Rachel Spies Helen Shyres Donna Thibodeau and her sister Fern Lila Grace Jessica Upshaw And Sue Snell She frowned You wouldnt expect a trick like that from Sue Shes never seemed the type for this kind of a  stunt Did you talk to the girls involved Miss Desjardin chuckled unhappily I got them the hell out of there I was too flustered And Carrie was having hysterics Um He steepled his fingers Do you plan to talk to them Yes But she sounded reluctant Do I detect a note of You probably do she said glumly Im living in a glass house see I understand how those girls felt The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her Maybetheres some kind of instinct about menstruation that makes women want to snarl I dont know I keep seeing Sue Snell and the way she looked Um Mr Morton repeated wisely He did not understand women and had no urge at all to discuss menstruation Ill talk to them tomorrow she promised rising Rip them down one side and up the other Good Make the punishment suit the crime And if you feel you have to send any of them to ah to me feel free I will she said kindly By the way a light blew out while I was trying to calm her down It added the final touch Ill send a janitor right down he promised And thanks for doing your best Miss Desjardin Will you have Miss Fish send in Billy and Henry Certainly She left He leaned back and let the whole business slide out of his mind When Billy deLois and Henry Trennant classcutters extraordinaire slunk in he glared at them happily and prepared to talk tough As he often told Hank Grayle he ate classcutters for lunch Graffiti scratched on a desk in Chamberlain Junior High School Roses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet but Carrie While eats shit She walked down Ewin Avenue and crosssed over to Carlin at the stoplight on the corner Her head was down and she was trying to think of nothing Cramps came and went in great gripping waves making her slow down and speed up like a car with carburettor trouble She stared at the sidewalk Quartz glittering in the cement Hopscotch grids scratched in ghostly rainfaded chalk Wads of gum stamped flat Pieces of tinfoil and pennycandy wrappers They all hate and they never stop They never get tired of it A penny lodged in a crack She kicked it Imagine Chris Hargensen all bloody and screaming for mercy With rats crawling all over her face Good Good That would be good A dog turd with a foottrack in the middle of it A roll of blackened caps that some kid had banged with a stone Cigarette butts Crash in her head with a rock with a boulder Crash in all their hearts Good Good saviour Jesus meek and mild That was good for Momma all right for her She didnt have to go among the wolves every day of every year out into a carnival of laughers joketellers pointers snickerers And didnt Momma say there would be a Day of Judgment the name of that star shall be wormwood and they shall be scourged with scorpions and an angel with a sword If only it would be today and Jesus coming not with a lamb and a shepherds crook but with a boulder on each hand to crush the laughters and the snickerers to root out the evil and destroy it screaming  a terrible Jesus of blood and righteousness And if only she could be His sword and His arm She had tried to fit She had defied Momma in a hundred little ways had tried to erase the redplague circle that had been drawn around her from the first day she had left the controlled environment of the small house on Carlin Street and had walked up to the Baker Street Grammar School with her Bible under her arm She could still remember that day the stares and the sudden awful silence when she had gotten down on her knees before lunch in the school cafeteriathe laughter had begun on that day and had echoed up through the years The redplague circle was like blood itselfyou could scrub and scrub and scrub and still it would be there not erased not clean She had never gotten on her knees in a public place again although she had not told Momma that Still the original memory remained with her and with them She had fought Momma tooth and nail over the Christian Church Camp and had earned the money to go herself by taking in sewing Momma told her darkly that it was Sin that it was Methodists and Baptists and Congregationalists and that it was Sin and Backsliding She forbade Carrie to swim at the camp Yet although she had swum and had laughed when they ducked her until she couldnt get her breath any more and they kept doing it and she got panicky and began to scream and had tried to take part in the camps activities a thousand practical jokes had been played on ol prayin Carrie and she had come home on the bus a week early her eyes red and socketed from weeping to be picked up by Momma at the station and Momma had told her grimly that she should treasure the memory of her scourging as proof that Momma knew that Momma was right that the only hope of safety and salvation was inside the red circle For straight is the gate Momma said grimly in the taxi and at home she had sent Carrie to the closet for six hours Momma had of course forbade her to shower with the other girls Carrie had hidden her shower things in her school locker and had showered anyway taking part in a naked ritual that was shameful and embarrassing to her in hopes that the circle around her might fade a little just a little but today o today Tommy Erbter age five was biking up the other side of the street He was a small intenselooking boy on a twentyinch Schwinn with brightred training wheels He was humming Scoobie Doo where are you under his breath He saw Carrie brightened and stuck out his tongue Hey ol fartface Ol prayin Carrie Carrie glared at him with sudden smoking rage The bike wobbled on its training wheels and suddenly fell over Tommy screamed The bike was on top of him Carrie smiled and walked on The sound of Tommys wails was sweet jangling music in her ears If only she could make something like that happen whenever she liked just did She stopped dead seven houses up from her own staring blankly at nothing Behind her Tommy was climbing tearfully back on to his bike nursing a scraped knee He yelled something at her but she ignored it She had been yelled at by experts She had been thinking fall off that bike kid push you off that bike and split your rotten head And something had happened Her mind had  had  she groped for a word Had flexed That was not just right but it was very close There had been a curious mental bending almost like an elbow curling a dumbbell That wasnt exactly right either but it was all she could think of An elbow with no strength A weak baby muscle Flex She suddenly stared fiercely at Mrs Yorratys big picture window She thought stupid frumpty old bitch break that window Nothing Mrs Yorratys picture window glittered serenely in the fresh nine oclock glow of morning Another cramp gripped Carries belly and she walked on But  The light And the ashtray dont forget the ashtray She looked back old bitch hates my momma over her shoulder Again it seemed that something flexed  but very weakly The flow of her thoughts shuddered as if there had been a sudden bubbling from a wellspring deeper inside The picture window seemed to ripple Nothing more It could have been her eyes Could have been Her head began to feel tired and fuzzy and it throbbed with the beginning of a headache Her eyes were hot as if she had just sat down and read the Book of Revelations straight through She continued to walk down the street toward the small white house with the blue shutters The familiar hatelovedread feeling was churning inside her Ivy had crawled up the west side of the bungalow they always called it the bungalow because the White house sounded like a political joke and Momma said all politicians were crooks and sinners and would eventually give the country over to the Godless Reds who would put all the believers of Jesus  even the Catholics  up against the wall and the ivy was picturesque she knew it was but sometimes she hated it Sometimes like now the ivy looked like a grotesque giant hand ridged with great veins which had sprung up out of the ground to grip the building She approached it with dragging feet Of course there had been the stones She stopped again blinking vapidly at the day The stones Momma never talked about that Carrie didnt even know if her momma still remembered the day of the stones It was surprising that she herself still remembered it She had been a very little girl then How old Three Four There had been the girl in the white bathing suit and then the stones came And things had flown in the house Here the memory was suddenly bright and clear As if it had been here all along just below the surface waiting for a kind of mental puberty Waiting maybe for today From Carrie The Black Dawn of TK Esquire Magazine September   by Jack Gaver Estelle Horan had lived in the neat San Diego suburb of Parrish for twelve years and outwardly she is typical Mrs California She wears bright print shifts and smoked amber sunglasses her hair is blackstreaked blonde she drives a neat maroon Volkswagen Formula Vee with a smile decal on the petrol cap and a greenflag ecology sticker on the back window Her husband is an executive at the Parrish branch of the Bank of America her son and daughter are certified members of the Southern California Sun n Fun Crowd burnishedbrown beach creatures There is a hibachi in the small beautifully kept back yard and the door chimes play a tinkly phrase from the refrain of Hey Jude But Mrs Horan still carries the thin difficult soil of New England somewhere inside her and when she talks of Carrie White her face takes on an odd pinched look that is more like Lovecraft out of Arkham than Kerouac out of Southern Cat Of course she was strange Estelle Horan tells me lighting a second Virginia Slim a moment after stubbing out her first The whole family was strange Ralph was a construction worker and people on the street said he carried a Bible and a  revolver to work with him every day The Bible was for his coffee break and lunch The  was in case he met Antichrist on the job I can remember the Bible myself The revolver  who knows He was a big oliveskinned man with his hair always shaved into a flattop crewcut He always looked mean And you didnt meet his eyes not ever They were so intense they actually seemed to glow When you saw him coming you crossed the street and you never stuck out your tongue at his back not ever Thats how spooky he was She pauses puffing clouds of cigarette smoke toward the pseudoredwood beams that cross the ceiling Stella Horan lived on Carlin Street until she was twenty commuting to day classes at Lewin Business College in Motton But she remembers the incidents of the stones very clearly There are times she says when I wonder if I might have caused it Their back yard was next to ours and Mrs White had put in a hedge but it hadnt grown out yet Shed called my mother dozens of times about the show I was putting on in my back yard Well my bathing suit was perfectly decent  prudish by todays standards  nothing but a plain old onepiece Jantzen Mrs White used to go on and on about what a scandal it was for her baby My mother well she tries to be polite but her temper is so quick I dont know what Margaret White did to finally push her over the edge  called me the Whore of Babylon I suppose  but my mother told her our yard was our yard and Id go out and dance the hootchiekootchie buck naked if that was her pleasure and mine She also told her that she was a dirty old woman with a can of worms for a mind There was a lot more shouting but that was the upshot of it I wanted to stop sunbathing right then I hate trouble It upsets my stomach But Momwhen she gets a case shes a terror She came home from Jordan Marsh with a little white bikini Told me I might as well get all the sun I could After all she said the privacy of our own back yard and all Stella Horan smiles a little at the memory and crushes out her cigarette I tried to argue with her tell her I didnt want any more trouble didnt want to be a pawn in their backfence war Didnt do a bit of good Trying to stop my mum when she gets a bee in her hat is like trying to stop a Mack truck going downhill with no brakes Actually there was more to it I was scared of the Whites Real religious nuts are nothing to fool with Sure Ralph White was dead but what if Margaret still had that  around But there I was on Saturday afternoon spread out  on a blanket in the back yard covered with suntan lotion and listening to Top Forty on the radio Mom hated that stuff and usually shed yell out at least twice for me to turn it down before she went nuts But that day she turned it up twice herself I started to feel like the Whore of Babylon myself But nobody came out of the Whites place Not even the old lady to hang her wash Thats something else  she never hung any undies on the back line Not even Carries and she was only three back then Always in the house I started to relax I guess I was thinking Margaret must have taken Carrie to the park to worship God in the raw or something Anyway after a little while I rolled on my back put one arm over my eyes and dozed off When I woke up Carrie was standing next to me and looking down at my body She breaks off frowning into space Outside the cars are whizzzing by endlessly I can hear the steady little whine my tape recorder makes But it all seems a little too brittle too glossy just a cheap patina over a darker world  a real world where nightmares happen She was such a pretty girl Stella Horan resumes fighting another cigarette Ive seen some high school pictures of her and that horrible fuzzy blackandwhite photo on the cover of Newsweek I look at them and all I can think is Dear God where did she go What did that woman do to her Then I feel sick and sorry She was so pretty with pink cheeks and bright brown eyes and her hair the shade of blonde you know will darken and get mousy Sweet is the only word that fits Sweet and bright and innocent Her mothers sickness hadnt touched her very deeply not then I kind of started up awake and tried to smile It was hard to think what to do I was logy from the sun and my mind felt sticky and slow I said Hi She was wearing a little yellow dress sort of cute but awfully long for a little girl in the summer It came down to her shins She didnt smile back She just pointed and said What are those I looked down and saw that my top had slipped while I was asleep So I fixed it and said Those are my breasts Carrie Then she saidvery solemnly I wish I had some I said You have to wait Carrie You wont start to get them for another  oh eight or nine years No I wont she said Momma says good girls dont She looked strange for a little girl half sad and half selfrighteous I could hardly believe it and the first thing that popped into my mind also popped right out of my mouth I said Well Im a good girl And doesnt your mother have breasts She lowered her head and said something so softly I couldnt hear it When I asked her to repeat it she looked at me defiantly and said that her momma had been bad when she made her and that was why she had them She called them dirtypillows as if it was all one word I couldnt believe it I was just dumbfounded There was nothing at all I could think to say We just stared at each other and what I wanted to do was grab that sad little scrap of a girl and run away with her And that was when Margaret White came out of her back door and saw us For a minute she just goggled as if she couldnt believe it Then she opened her mouth and whooped Thats the ugliest sound Ive ever beard in my life It was like the noise of a bull alligator would make in a swamp She just whooped Rage Complete insane rage Her face went just as red as the side of a fire truck and she curled her hands into fists and whooped at the sky She was shaking all over I thought she was having a stroke Her face was all scrunched up and it was a gargoyles face I thought Carrie was going to faint or die on the spot She sucked in all her breath and that little face went a cottagecheesy colour Her mother yelled CAAAARRIEEEEEE I jumped up and yelled back Dont you yell at her that way You ought to be ashamed Something stupid like that I dont remember Carrie started to go back and then she stopped and then she started again and just before she crossed over from our lawn to theirs she looked back at me and there was a look  oh dreadful I cant say it Wanting and hating and fearing  and misery As if life itself had fallen on her like stones all at the age of three My mother came out on the back stoop and her face just crumpled when she saw the child And Margaret  oh she was screaming things about sluts and strumpets and the sins of the fathers being visited even into the seventh generation My tongue felt like a little driedup plant For just a second Carrie stood swaying back and forth between the two yards and then Margaret White looked upward and I swear sweet Jesus that woman bayed at the sky And then she started to  to hurt herself scourge herself She was clawing at her neck and cheeks making red marks and scratches She tore her dress Carrie screamed out Momma and ran to her Mrs White kind of  squatted like a frog and her arms swooped wide open I thought she was going to crush her and I screamed The woman was grinning Grinning and drooling right down her chin Oh I was sick Jesus I was so sick She gathered her up and they went in I turned off my radio and I could hear her Some of the words but not all You didnt have to hear all the words to know what was going on Praying and sobbing and screeching Crazy sounds And Margaret telling the little girl to get herself into her closet and pray The little girl crying and screaming that she was sorry she forgot Then nothing And my mother and I just looked at each other I never saw Mom look so bad not even when Dad died She said The child and that was all We went inside She gets up and goes to the window a pretty woman in a yellow noback sundress Its almost like living it all over again you know she says not turning around Im all riled up inside again She laughs a little and cradles her elbows in her palms Oh she was so pretty Youd never know from those pictures Cars go by outside back and forth and I sit and wait for her to go on She reminds me of a polevaulter eyeing the bar and wondering if its set too high My mother brewed us scotch tea strong with milk the way she used to when I was tomboying around and someone would push me in the nettle patch or Id fall off my bicycle It was awful but we drank it anyway sitting across from each other in the kitchen nook She was in some old housedress with the hem falling down in back and I was in my Whore of Babylon twopiece swimsuit I wanted to cry but it was too real to cry about not like the movies Once when I was in New York I saw an old drunk leading a little girl in a blue dress by the hand The girl had cried herself into a bloody nose The drunk had goitre and his neck looked like an inner tube There was a red bump in the middle of his forehead and a long white string on the blue serge jacket he was wearing Everyone kept going and coming because if you did then pretty soon you wouldnt see them any more That was real too I wanted to tell my mother that and I was just opening my mouth to say it when the other thing happened  the thing you want to hear about I guess There was a big thump outside that made the glasses rattle in the china cabinet It was a feeling as well as a sound thick and solid as if someone had just pushed an iron safe off the roof She lights a new cigarette and begins to puff rapidly I went to the window and looked out but I couldnt see anything Then when I was getting ready to turn around something else fell The sun glittered on it I thought it was a big glass globe for a second Then it hit the edge of the Whites roof and shattered and it wasnt glass at all It was a big chunk of ice I was going to turn around and tell Mom and thats when they started to fall all at once in a shower They were falling on the Whites roof on the back and front lawn on the outside door to their cellar That was a sheettin bulkhead and when the first one hit it made a huge bong noise like a church bell My mother and I both screamed We were clutching each other like a couple of girls in a thunderstorm Then it stopped There was no sound at all from their house You could see the water from the melting ice trickling down their slate shingles in the sunshine A great big hunk of ice was stuck in the angle of the roof and their little chimney The light on it was so bright that my eyes hurt to look at it My mother started to ask me if it was over and then Margaret screamed The sound came to us very clearly In a way it was worse than before because there was terror in this one Then there were clanging banging sounds as if she were throwing every pot and pan in the house at the girl The back door slammed open and slammed closed No one came out More screams Mom said for me to call the police but I couldnt move I was stuck to the spot Mr Kirk and his wife Virginia came out on their lawn to look The Smiths too Pretty soon everyone on the street that was home had come out even old Mrs Warwick from up the block and she was deaf in one ear Things started to crash and tinkle and break Bottles glasses I dont know what all And then the side window broke open and the kitchen table fell halfway through With God as my witness It was a big mahogany thing and it took the screen with it and it must have weighed three hundred pounds How could a woman  even a big woman  throw that I ask her if she is implying something Im only telling you she insists suddenly distraught Im not asking you to believe She seems to catch her breath and then goes on flatly There was nothing for maybe five minutes Water was dripping out of the gutters over there And there was ice all over the Whites lawn It was melting fast She gives a short chopping laugh and butts her cigarette Why not It was August She wanders aimlessly back towards the sofa then veers away Then the stones Right out of the blue sky Whistling and screaming like bombs My mother cried out What in the name of  and put her hands over her head But I couldnt move I watched it all and I couldnt move It didnt matter anyway They only fell on the Whites property One of them hit a downspout and knocked it on to the lawn Others punched holes right through the roof and into the attic The roof made a big cracking sound each time one hit and puffs of dust would squirt up The ones that hit the ground made everything vibrate You could feel them hitting in your feet Our china was tinkling and the fancy Welsh dresser was shaking and Moms teacup fell on the floor and broke They made big pits in the Whites back lawn when they struck Craters Mrs White hired a junkman from across town to cart them away and Jerry Smith from up the street paid him a buck to let him chip a piece of one He took it to BU and they looked at it and said it was ordinary granite One of the last ones hit a little table they had in their back yard and smashed it to pieces But nothing nothing that wasnt on their property was hit She stops and turns from the window to look at me and her face is haggard from remembering all that One hand plays forgetfully with her casually stylish shag haircut Not much of it got into the local paper By the time Billy Harris came around  he reported the Chamberlain news  she had already gotten the roof fixed and when people told him the stones had gone right through it I think he thought we were pulling his leg Nobody wants to believe it not even now You and all the people wholl read what you write will wish they could laugh it of and call me just another nut whos been out here in the sun too long But it happened There were lots of people on the block who saw it happen and it was just as real as that drunk leading the little girl with the bloody nose And now theres this other thing No one can laugh that of either Too many people are dead And its not just on the Whites property any more She smiles but theres not a drop of humour in it She says Ralph White was insured and Margaret got a lot of money when he died  double indemnity He left the house insured too but she never got a penny of that The damage was caused by an act of God Poetic justice huh She laughs a little but theres no humour in that either  Found written repeatedly on one page of a Ewen Consolidated High School notebook owned by Carrie White Everybodys guessedthat baby cant be blessedtil she finally sees that shes like all the rest  Carrie went into the house and closed the door behind her Bright daylight disappeared and was replaced by brown shadows coolness and the oppressive smell of talcum powder The only sound was the ticking of the Black Forest cuckoo clock in the living room Momma had gotten the cuckoo clock with Green Stamps Once in the sixth grade Carrie had set out to ask Momma if Green Stamps werent sinful but her nerve had failed her She walked up the hall and put her coat in the closet A luminous picture above the coathooks limned a ghostly Jesus hovering grimly over a family seated at the kitchen table Beneath was the caption also luminous The Unseen Guest She went into the living room and stood in the middle of the faded startingtobethreadbare rug She closed her eyes and watched the little dots flash by in the darkness Her headache thumped queasily behind her temples Alone Momma worked on the speed ironer and folder down at the Blue Ribbon Laundry in Chamberlain Centre She had worked there since Carrie was five when the compensation and insurance that had resulted from her fathers accident had begun to run out Her hours were from seventhirty in the morning until four in the afternoon The laundry was Godless Momma had told her so many times The foreman Mr Elton Mott was especially Godless Momma said that Satan had reserved a special blue corner of Hell for Elt as he was called at the Blue Ribbon Alone She opened her eyes The living room contained two chairs with straight backs There was a sewing table with a light where Carrie sometimes made dresses in the evening while Momma tatted doilies and talked about The Coming The Black Forest cuckoo clock was on the far wall There were many religious pictures but the one Carrie liked best was on the wall above her chair It was Jesus leading lambs on a hill that was as green and smooth as the Riverside golf course The others were not as tranquil Jesus turning the moneychangers from the temple Moses throwing the Tablets down upon the worshippers of the golden calf Thomas the Doubter putting his hand on Christs wounded side oh the horrified fascination of that one and the nightmares it had given her as a girl Noahs ark floating above the agonized drowning sinners Lot and his family fleeing the great burning of Sodom and Gomorrah On a small deal table there were a lamp and a stack of tracts The top pamphlet showed a sinner his spiritual status was obvious from the agonized expression on his face trying to crawl beneath a large boulder The title blared Neither shall the rock hide him ON THAT DAY But the room was actually dominated by a huge plaster crucifix on the far wall fully four feet high Momma had mailordered it special from St Louis The Jesus impaled upon it was frozen in a grotesque musclestraining rictus of pain mouth drawn down in a groaning curve His crown of thorns bled scarlet streams down temples and forehead The eyes were turned up in a medieval expression of slanted agony Both hands were also drenched with blood and the feet were nailed to a small plaster platform This corpus had also given Carrie endless nightmares in which the mutilated Christ chased her through dream corridors holding a mallet and nails begging her to take up her cross and follow Him Just lately these dreams had evolved into something less understandable but more sinister The object did not seem to be murder but something even more awful Alone The pain in her legs and belly and privates had drained away a little She no longer thought she was bleeding to death The word was menstruation and all at once it seemed logical and inevitable It was her Time of the Month She giggled a strange affrighted giggle in the solemn stillness of the flying room It sounded like a quiz show You too can win an allexpensespaid trip to Bermuda on Time of the Month Like the memory of the stones the knowledge of menstruation seemed always to have been there blocked but waiting She turned and walked heavily upstairs The bathroom had a wooden floor that had been scrubbed nearly white Cleanliness is next to Godliness and a tub on claw feet Rust stains dripped down the porcelain below the chrome spout and there was no shower attachment Momma said showers were sinful Carrie went in opened the towel cabinet and began to hunt purposefully but carefully not leaving anything out of place Mommas eyes were sharp The blue box was in the very back behind the old towels they didnt use any more There was a fuzzily silhouetted woman in a long filmy gown on the side She took one of the napkins out and looked at it curiously She had blotted the lipstick she stuck into her purse quite openly with these  once on a street corner Now she remembered or imagined she did quizzical shocked looks Her face flamed They had told her The flush faded to a milky anger She went into her tiny bedroom There were many more religious pictures here but there were more lambs and fewer scenes of righteous wrath A Ewen pennant was tacked over the dresser On the dresser itself was a Bible and a plastic Jesus that glowed in the dark She undressed  first her blouse then her hateful kneelength skirt her slip her girdle her pettipants her garter belt her stockings She looked at the pile of heavy clothes their buttons and rubber with an expression of fierce wretchedness In the school library there was a stack of back issues of Seventeen and often she leafed through them pasting an expression of idiotic casualness on her face The models looked so easy and smooth in their short kicky skirts pantyhose and frilly underwear with patterns on them Of course easy was one of Mommas pet words she knew what Momma would say to a question to describe them And it would make her dreadfully selfconscious she knew that Naked evil blackened with the sin of exhibitionism the breeze blowing lewdly up the backs of her legs inciting lust And she knew that they would know how she felt They always did They would embarrass her somehow push her savagely back into clowndom It was their way She could she knew she could be what in another place She was thick through the waist only because sometimes she felt so miserable empty bored that the only way to fill that gaping whistling hole was to eat and eat and eatbut she was not that thick through the middle Her body chemistry would not allow her to go beyond a certain point And she thought her legs were actually pretty almost as pretty as Sue Snells or Vicky Hanscoms She could be what o what o what could stop the chocolates and her pimples would go down They always did She could fix her hair Buy pantyhose and blue and green tights Make little skirts and dresses from Butterick and Simplicity patterns The price of a bus ticket a train ticket She could be could be could be Alive She unsnapped her heavy cotton bra and let it fall Her breasts were milkwhite upright and smooth The nipples were a light coffee colour She ran her hands over them and a little shiver went through her Evil bad oh it was Momma had told her there was Something The Something was dangerous ancient unutterably evil It could make you Feeble Watch Momma said It comes at night It will make you think of the evil that goes on in parking lots and roadhouses But though this was only ninetwenty in the morning Carrie thought that the Something had come to her She ran her hands over her breasts dirtypillows again and the skin was cool but the nipples were hot and hard and when she tweaked one it made her feel weak and dissolving Yes this was the Something Her underpants were spotted with blood Suddenly she felt that she must burst into tears scream or rip the Something out of her body whole and beating crush it kill it The napkin Miss Desjardin had fixed was already wilting and she changed it carefully knowing how bad she was how bad they were how she hated them and herself Only Momma was good Momma had battled the Black Man and had vanquished him Carrie had seen it happen in a dream Momma had driven him out of the front door with a broom and the Black Man had fled up Carlin Street into the night his cloven feet striking red sparks from the cement Her momma had torn the Something out of herself and was pure Carrie hated her She caught a glimpse of her own face in the tiny mirror she had hung on the back of the door a mirror with a cheap green plastic rim good only for combing hair by She hated her face her dull stupid bovine face the vapid eyes the red shiny pimples the nests of black heads She hated her face most of all The reflection was suddenly split by a jagged silvery crack The mirror fell on the floor and shattered at her feet leaving only the plastic ring to stare at her like a blinded eye From Ogilvies Dictionary of Physic Phenomena Telekinesis is the ability to move objects or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind The phenomenon has most reliably been reported in times of crisis or in stress situations when automobiles have been levitated from pinned bodies or debris from collapsed buildings etc The phenomenon is often confused with the work of poltergeists which are playful spirits It should be noted that poltergeists are astral beings of questionable reality while telekinesis is thought to be an empiric function of the mind possibly electrochemical in nature  When they had finished making love as she slowly put her clothes in order in the back seat of Tommy Rosss  Ford Sue Snell found her thoughts turning back to Carrie White It was Friday night and Tommy who was still looking pensively out the back window with his pants still down around his ankles the effect was comic but oddly endearing had taken her bowling That of course was a mutually accepted excuse Fornication had been on their minds from the word go She had been going out more or less steadily with Tommy ever since October it was now May and they had been lovers for only two weeks Seven times she amended Tonight had been the seventh There had been no fireworks yet no bands playing Stars and Stripes Forever but it had gotten a little better The first time had hurt like hell Her girl friends Helen Shyres and Jeanne Gault had both done It and they both assured her that it only hurt for a minute  like getting a shot of penicillin  and then it was roses But for Sue the first time had been like being reamed out with a hoe handle Tommy had confessed to her since with a grin that he had gotten the rubber on wrong too Tonight was only the second time she had begun to feel something like pleasure and then it was over Tommy had held out for as long as he could but then it was just over It seemed like an awful lot of rubbing for a little warmth In the aftermath she felt low and melancholy and her thoughts turned to Carrie in this light A wave of remorse caught her with all emotional guards down and when Tommy turned back from the view of Brickyard Rill she was crying Hey he said alarmed Oh hey He held her clumsily Its all right she said still weeping Its not you I did a notsogood thing today I was just thinking of it What He patted the back of her neck gently So she found herself launching into the story of that mornings incident hardly believing it was herself she was listening to Facing the thing frankly she realized the main reason she had allowed Tommy to have her was because she was in love infatuation didnt matter results were the same with him and now to put herself in this positioncohort in a nasty showerroom jokewas hardly the approved method to hook a fellow And Tommy was of course Popular As someone who had been Popular herself all her life it had almost seemed written that she would meet and fall in love with someone as Popular as she They were almost certain to be voted King and Queen of the highschool Spring Ball and the senior class had already voted them class couple for the yearbook They had become a fixed star in the shifting firmament of the high schools relationships the acknowledged Romeo and Juliet And she knew with sudden hatefulness that there was one couple like them in every white suburban high school in America And having something she had always longed for  a sense of place of security of status  she found that it carried uneasiness with it like a darker sister It was not the way she had conceived it There were dark things lumbering around their warm circle of light The idea that she had let him fuck her do you have to say it that way yes this time I do simply because he was Popular for instance The fact that they fit together walking or that she could look at their reflection in a store window and think There goes a handsome couple She was quite sure or only hopeful that she wasnt that weak not that liable to fall docilely into the complacent expectations of parents friends and even herself But now there was this shower thing where she had gone along and pitched in with high savage glee The word she was avoiding was expressed To Conform in the infinitive and it conjured up miserable images of hair in rollers long afternoons in front of the ironing board in front of the soap operas while hubby was off busting heavies in an anonymous Office of joining the PTA and then the country club when their income moved into five figures of pills in circular yellow cases without number to insure against having to move out of the misses size before it became absolutely necessary and against the intrusion of repulsive little strangers who shat in their pants and screamed for help at two in the morning of fighting with desperate decorum to keep the niggers out of Kleen Korners standing shoulder to shoulder with Terri Smith Miss Potato Blossom of and Vicki Jones Vice President of The Womens League armed with signs and petitions and sweet slightly desperate smiles Carrie it was the goddamned Carrie this was her fault Perhaps before today she had heard distant circling footfalls around their lighted place but tonight hearing her own sordid crummy story she saw the actual silhouettes of all these things and yellow eyes that glowed like flashlights in the dark She had already bought her prom gown It was blue It was beautiful Youre right he said when she was done Bad news Doesnt sound a bit like you His face was grave and she felt a cool slice of terror Then he smiledhe had a very jolly smileand the darknesss retreated a bit I kicked a kid in the slats once when he was knocked out Did I ever tell you about that She shook her head Yeah He rubbed his nose reminiscently and his cheek gave a small tic the way it had when he made his confession about getting the rubber wrong the first time The kids name was Danny Patrick He beat the living shit out of me once when we were in the sixth grade I hated him but I was scared too I was laying for him You know how that is She didnt but nodded anyway Anyway he finally picked on the wrong kid a year or so later Pete Taber He was just a little guy but he had lots of muscles Danny got on him about something I dont know marbles or something and finally Peter just rose up righteous and beat the shit out of him That was on the playground of the old Kennedy Junior High Danny fell down and hit his head and went out cold Everybody ran We thought he might be dead I ran away too but first I gave him a good kick in the ribs Felt really bad about it afterwards You going to apologize to her It caught Sue flatfooted and all she could was clinch weakly Did you Huh Hell no I had better things to do than spend my time in traction But theres a big difference Susie There is Its not seventh grade any more And I had some kind of reason even if it was a pisspoor reason What did that sad silly bitch ever do to you She didnt answer because she couldnt She had never passed more than a hundred words with Carrie in her whole life and three dozen or so had come today Phys Ed was the only class theyd had in common since they had graduated from Chamberlain Junior High Carrie was taking the commercialbusiness course Sue of course was in the college division She thought herself suddenly loathsome She found she could not bear that and so she twisted it at him When did you start making all these big moral decisions After you started fucking me She saw the good humour fade from his face and was sorry Guess I should have kept quiet he said and pulled up his pants Its not you its me She put a hand on his arm Im ashamed see I know he said But I shouldnt be giving advice Im not very good at it Tommy do you ever hate being so  well popular Me The question wrote surprise on his face Do you mean like football and class president and that stuff Yes No Ifs not very important High school isnt a very important place When youre going you think its a big deal but when its over nobody really think it was great unless theyre beered up Thats how my brother and his buddies are anyway It did not soothe her it made her fears worse Little Susie mix n match from Ewen High School Head Cupcake of the entire Cupcake Brigade Prom gown kept forever in the closet wrapped in protective plastic The night pressed dark against the slightly steamed car windows Ill probably end up working at my dads car lot he said Ill spend my Friday and Saturday nights down at Uncle Billys or out at The Cavalier drinking beer and talking about the Saturday afternoon I got that fat pitch from Saunders and we upset Dorchester Get married to some nagging broad and always own last years model vote Democrat Dont she said her mouth suddenly full of a dark sweet horror She pulled him to her Love me My head is so bad tonight Love me Love me So he loved her and this time it was different this time there finally seemed to be room and there was no rubbing but a delicious friction that went up and up Twice he had to stop panting and held himself back and then he went he was a virgin before me and admitted it I would have believed a lie and went hard and her breath came in short digging gasps and then she began to yell and hold at his back helpless to stop sweating the bad taste washed away every cell seeming to have its own climax body filled with sunlight musical notes in her mind butterflies behind her skull in the cage of her mind Later on the way home he asked her formally if she would go to the Spring Ball with him She said she would He asked her if she had decided what to do about Carrie She said she hadnt He said that it made no difference but she thought that it did It had begun to seem that it meant all the difference From Telekinesis Analysis and Aftermath Science Yearbook  by Dean K L McGuffin There are of course still these scientists today  regretfully the Duke University people are in their forefront  who reject the terrific underlying implications of the Carrie White affair Like the Flatlands Society the Rosicrucians or the Corlies of Arizona who are positive that the atomic bomb does not work these unfortunates are flying in the face of logic with their heads in the sand and beg your pardon for the mixed metaphor Of course one is able to understand the consternation the raised voices the angry letters and arguments at scientific convocations The idea of telekinesis itself has been a bitter pill for the scientific community to swallow with its horrormovie trappings of ouija boards and mediums and table rappings and floating coronets but understanding will still not excuse scientific irresponsibility The outcome of the White affair raises grave and difficult questions An earthquake has struck our order notions of the way the natural world is supposed to act and react Can you blame even such a renowned physicist as Gerald Luponet for claiming the whole thing is a hoax and a fraud even in the face of such overwhelming evidence as the White Commission presented For if Carrie White is the truth then what of Newton  They sat in the living room Carrie and Momma listening to Tennessee Ernie Ford singing Let the Lower Lights Be Burning on a Webcor phonograph which Momma called the victrola or if in a particularly good mood the vic Carrie sat at the sewing machine pumping with her feet as she sewed the sleeves on a new dress Momma sat beneath the plaster crucifix tatting doilies and bumping her feet in time to the song which was one of her favourites Mr P P Bliss who had written this hymn and others seemingly without number was one of Mommas shining examples of God at work upon the face of the earth He had been a sailor and a sinner two terms that were synonymous in Mommas lexicon a great blasphemer a laugher in the face of the Almighty Then a great storm had come up at sea the boat had threatened to capsize and Mr P P Bliss had gotten down on his sinsickly knees with a vision of Hell yawning beneath the ocean floor to receive him and he had prayed to God Mr P P Bliss promised God that if He saved him he would dedicate the rest of his life to Him The storm of course had cleared immediately Brightly beams our Fathers mercy From his lighthouse evermore But to us he gives the keeping Of the lights along the shore  All of Mr P P Blisss hymns had a seagoing flavour to them The dress she was sewing was actually quite pretty a dark wine colourthe closest Momma would allow her to redand the sleeves were puffed She tried to keep her mind strictly on her sewing but of course it wandered The overhead fight was strong and harsh and yellow the small dusty plush sofa was of course deserted Carrie had never had a boy in To Sit and on the far wall was a twin shadow the crucified Jesus and beneath Him Momma The school had called Momma at the laundry and she had come home at noon Carrie had watched her come up the walk and her belly trembled Momma was a very big woman and she always wore a hat Lately her legs had begun to swell and her feet always seemed on the point of overflowing her shoes She wore a black cloth coat with a black fur collar Her eyes were blue and magnified behind rimless bifocals She always carried a large black satchel purse and in it was her change purse her billfold both black a large King James Bible also black with her name stamped on the front in gold and a stack of tracts secured with a rubber band The Tracts were usually orange and smearily printed Carrie knew vaguely that Momma and Daddy Ralph had been Baptists once but had left the church when they became convinced that the Baptists were doing the work of the Antichrist Since that time all worship had taken place at home Momma held worship on Sundays Tuesdays and Fridays These were called Holy Days Momma was the minister Carrie the congregation Services lasted from two to three hours Momma had opened the door and walked stolidly in She and Carrie had stared at each other down the short length of the front hall for a moment like gunfighters before a shootout It was one of those brief moments that seem fear could it really have been fear in mommas eyes much longer in retrospect Momma closed the door behind her Youre a woman she said softly Carrie felt her face twisting and crumpling and could not help it Why didnt you tell me she cried Oh Momma I was so scared And the girls all made fun and threw things and Momma had been walking towards her a now her hand flashed with sudden limber speed a hard hand laundrycalloused and muscled It struck her backhand across the jaw and Carrie fell down in the doorway between the hall and the living room weeping loudly And God made Eve from the rib Of Adam Momma said Her eyes were very large in the rimless glasses they looked like poached eggs She thumped Carrie with the side of her foot and Carrie screamed Get up woman Lets get in and pray Lets pray to Jesus for our womanweak wicked sinning souls Momma The sobs were too strong to allow more The latent hysterics had come out grinning and gibbering She could not stand up She could only crawl into the living room with her hair hanging in her face braying huge hoarse sobs Every now and again Momma would swing her foot So they progressed across the living room toward the place of the altar which had once been a small bedroom And Eve was weak and  say it woman Say it No Momma please help me The foot swung Carrie screamed And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world Momma continued and the raven was called Sin and the first Sin was Intercourse And the Lord visited Eve with a Curse and the Curse was the Curse of Blood And Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden and into the World and Eve found that her belly had grown big with child The foot swung and connected with Carries rump Her nose scraped the wood floor They were entering the place of the altar There was a cross on a table covered with an embroidered silk cloth On either side of the cross there were white candles Behind this were several paintbythenumbers of Jesus and His apostles And to the right was the worst place of all the home of terror the cave where all hope all resistance to Gods will  and Mommas  was extinguished The closet door leered open Inside below a hideous blue bulb that was always lit was Derraults conception of Jonathan Edwards famous sermon Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God And there was a second Curse and this was the Curse of Childbearing and Eve brought forth Cain in sweat and blood Now Momma dragged her halfstanding and halfcrawling down to the altar where they both fell on their knees Momma gripped Carries wrist tightly And following Cain Eve gave birth to Abel having not yet repented of the Sin of Intercourse And so the Lord visited Eve with a third Curse and this was the Curse of Murder Cain rose up and slew Abel with a rock And still Eve did not repent nor all the daughters of Eve and upon Eve did the Crafty Serpent found a kingdom of whoredom and pestilences Momma she shrieked Momma please listen It wasnt my fault Bow your head Momma said Lets us pray You should have told me Momma brought her hand down on the back of Carries neck and behind it was all the heavy muscle developed by eleven years of slinging heavy laundry bags and trucking piles of wet sheets Carries eyebulging face jerked forward and her forehead smacked the altar leaving a mark and making the candles tremble Lets us pray Momma said softly implacably Weeping and snuffling Carrie bowed her head A runner of snot hung pendulously from her nose and she wiped it away if i had a nickel for every time she made me cry here with the back of her hand Lord Momma declaimed hugely her head thrown back help this sinning woman beside me here see the sin of her days and ways Show her that if she had remained sinless the Curse of Blood never would have come on her She may have committed the Sin of Lustful Thoughts She may have been listening to rock n roll music on the radio She may have been tempted by the Antichrist Show her that this is Your kind vengeful hand at work and No Let me go She tried to struggle to her feet and Mommas hand as strong and pitiless as an iron manacle forced her back to her knees and Your sign that she must walk the straight and narrow from here on out if she is to avoid the flaming agonies of the Eternal Pit Amen She turned her glittering magnified eyes upon her daughter Go to your closet now No She felt her breath go thick with terror Go to your closet Pray in secret Ask forgiveness for your sins I didnt sin Momma You sinned You didnt tell me and they laughed Again she seemed to see a flash of fear in Mommas eyes gone as quickly and soundlessly as summer lightning Momma began to force Carrie toward the blue glare of the closet Pray to God and your sins may be washed away Momma you let me go Pray woman Ill make the stones come again Momma Momma halted Even her breath seemed to stop in her throat for a moment And then the hand tightened on her neck tightened until Carrie saw red lurid dots in front of her eyes and felt her brain go fuzzy and faroff Mommas magnified eyes swam in front of her You spawn of the devil she whispered Why was I so cursed Carries whirling mind strove to find something huge enough to express her agony shame terror hate fear It seemed her whole life had narrowed to this miserable beaten point of rebellion Her eyes bulged crazily her mouth filled with spit opened wide YOU SUCK she screamed Momma hissed like a burned cat Sin she cried O Sin She began to beat Carries back her neck her head Carrie was driven reeling into the close blue glare of the closet YOU FUCK Carrie screamed there there o there its out how else do you think she got you o god o good She was whirled into the closet headfirst and she struck the far wall and fell on the floor in a semidaze The door slammed and the key turned She was alone with Mommas angry God The blue light glared on a picture of a huge and bearded Yahweh who was casting screaming multitudes of humans down through cloudy depths into an abyss of fire Below them black horrid figures struggled through the flames of perdition while The Black Man sat on a huge flamecoloured throne with a trident in one hand His body was that of a man but he had a spiked tail and the head of a jackal She would not break this time But of course she did break It took six hours but she broke weeping and calling Momma to open the door and let her out The need to urinate was terrible The Black Man grinned at her with his jackal mouth and his scarlet eyes knew all the secrets of womanblood An hour after Carrie began to call Momma let her out Carrie scrabbled madly for the bathroom It was only now three hours after that sitting here with her head bowed over the sewing machine like a penitent that she remembered the fear in Mommas eyes and she thought she knew the reason why There had been other times when Momma had kept her in the closet for as long as a day at a stretchwhen she stole that fortyninecent finger ring from Shubers Five and Ten the time she had found that picture of Flash Bobby Pickett under Carries pillow and Carrie had once fainted from the lack of food and the smell of her own waste And she had never never spoken back as she had done today Today she had even said the Eff Word Yet Momma had let her out almost as soon as she broke There The dress was done She removed her feet from the treadle and held it up to look at it It was long And ugly She hated it She knew why Momma had let her out Momma may I go to bed Yes Momma did not look up from her doily She folded the dress over her arm She looked down at the sewing machine All at once the treadle depressed itself The needle began to dip up and down catching the light in steely flashes The bobbin whirred and jerked The sidewheel spun Mommas head jerked up her eyes wide The looped matrix at the edge of her doily wonderfully intricate yet at the same time as precise and even suddenly fell in disarray Only clearing the thread Carrie said softly Go to bed Momma said curtly and the fear was back in her eyes Yes she was afraid id knock the closet door right off its hinges Momma and i think i could i think i could yes i think i could From The Shadow Exploded p  Margaret White was born and raised in Motton a small town which borders Chamberlain and sends its tuition students to Chamberlains junior and senior high schools Her parents were fairly welltodo they owned a prosperous night spot just outside the Motton town limits called The Jolly Roadhouse Margarets father John Brigham was killed in a barroom shooting incident in the summer of  Margaret Brigham who was then almost thirty began attending fundamentalist prayer meetings Her mother had become involved with a new man Harold Alison whom she later married and they both wanted Margaret out of the houseshe believed her mother Judith and Harold Alison were living in sin and made her views known frequently Judith Brigham expected her daughter to remain a spinster the rest of her life In the more pungent phraseology of her soontobe stepfather Margaret had a face like the ass end of a gasoline truck and a body to match He also referred to her as a little prayin Jesus Margaret refused to leave until  when she met Ralph White at a revival meeting In September of that year she left the Brigham residence in Motton and moved to a small flat in Chamberlain Centre The courtship of Margaret Brigham and Ralph White terminated in marriage on March   On April   Margaret White was admitted briefly to Westover Doctors Hospital Nope she wouldnt tell us what was wrong Harold Alison said The one time we went to see her she told us we were living in adultery even though we were hitched and we were going to hell She said God had put an invisible mark on our foreheads but she could see it Acted crazy as a bat in a henhouse she did Her mom tried to be nice tried to find out what the matter with her was She got hysterical and started to rave about an angel with a sword who would walk through the parking lots of roadhouses and cut down the wicked We left Judith Alison however had at least an idea of what might have been wrong with her daughter she thought that Margaret had gone through a miscarriage If so the baby was conceived out of wedlock Confirmation of this would shed an interesting light on the character of Carries mother In a long and rather hysterical letter to her mother dated August   Margaret said that she and Ralph were living sinlessly without the Curse of Intercourse She urged Harold and Judith Alison to close their abode of wickedness and do likewise It is Margaret declares near the end of her letter the only sic way you  That Man can avoid the Rain of Blood yet to come Ralph  I like Mary  Joseph will neither know or polute sic each others flesh If there is issue let it be Divine Of course the calendar tells us that Carrie was conceived later that same year  The girls dressed quietly for their Monday morning Period One gym class with no horseplay or little screaming catcalls and none of them were very surprised when Miss Desjardin slammed open the lockerroom and walked in Her silver whistle dangling between her small breasts and if her shorts were the ones she had been wearing on Friday no trace of Carries bloody handprint remained The girls continued to dress sullenly not looking at her Arent you the bunch to send out for graduation Miss Desjardin said softly When is it A month And the spring Ball even less than that Most of you have your dates and gowns already I bet Sue youll be going with Tommy Ross Helen Roy Evarts Chris I imagine you can take your pick Whos the lucky guy Billy Nolan Chris Hargensen said sullenly Well isnt he the lucky one Desjardin remarked What are you going to give him for a party favour Chris a bloody Kotex Or how about some used toilet paper I understand these things seem to be your sack these days Chris went red Im leaving I dont have to listen to that Desjardin had not been able to get the image of Carrie out of her mind all weekend Carrie screaming blubbering a wet napkin plastered squarely in the middle of her pubic hairand her own sick angry reaction And now as Chris tried to storm out past her she reached out and slammed her against a row of dented olivecoloured lockers beside the inner door Chriss eyes widened with shocked disbelief Then a kind of insane rage filled her face You cant hit us she screamed Youll get canned for this See if you dont you bitch The other girls winced and sucked breath and stared at the floor It was getting out of hand Sue noticed out of the corner of her eye that Fern and Donna Thibodeau were holding hands I dont really care Hargensen Desjardin said If you or any of your girls  think Im wearing my teacher hat right now youre making a bad mistake I just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing on Friday A really shitty thing Chris Hargensen was sneering at the floor The rest of the girls were looking miserably at anything but their gym instructor Sue found herself looking into the shower stall  the scene of the crime  and jerked her glance elsewhere None of them had ever heard a teacher call anything shitty before Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings Do any of you ever stop to think Sue Fern Helen Jessica Any of you You think shes ugly Well youre all ugly I saw it on Friday morning Chris Hargensen was mumbling about her father being a lawyer Shutup Desjardin yelled in her face Chris recoiled so suddenly that her head struck the lockers behind her She began to whine and rub her head One more remark out of you Desjardin said softly and Ill throw you across the room Want to find out if Im telling the truth Chris who had apparently decided she was dealing with a madwoman said nothing Desjardin put her hands on her hips The office has decided on punishment for you girls Not my punishment Im sorry to say My idea was three days suspension and refusal of your prom tickets Several girls looked at each other and muttered unhappily That would have hit you where you live Desjardin continued Unfortunately Ewen is staffed completely by men in its administration wing I dont believe they have any real conception of how utterly nasty what you did was So One weeks detention Spontaneous sighs of relief But Its to be my detention In the gym And Im going to run you ragged I wont come Chris said Her lips had thinned across her teeth Thats up to you Chris Thats up to all of you But punishment for skipping detention is going to be three days suspension and refusal of your prom tickets Get the picture No one said anything Right Change up And think about what I said She left Utter silence for a long and stricken moment Then Chris Hargensen said with loud hysterical stridency She cant get away with it She opened a door at random pulled out a pair of sneakers and hurled them across the room Im going to get her Goddammit Goddammit See if I dont If we all stick together we Shut up Chris Sue said and was shocked to hear a dead adult lifelessness in her voice Just shut up This isnt over Chris Hargensen said unzipping her skirt with a rough jab and reaching for her fashionably frayed green gym shorts This isnt over by a long way And she was right From The Shadow Exploded pp   In the opinion of this researcher a great many of the people who have researched the Carrie White matter  either for the scientific journals or for the popular press  have placed a mistaken emphasis on a relatively fruitless search for incidents of telekinesis in the girls childhood To strike a rough analogy this is like spending years researching the early incidents of masturbation in a rapists childhood The spectacular incident of the stones serves as a kind of red herring in this respect Many researchers have adopted the erroneous belief that where there has been one incident there must be others To offer another analogy this is like dispatching a crew of meteor watchers to Crater National Park because a huge asteroid struck there two million years ago To the best of my knowledge there are no other recorded instances of TK in Carries childhood If Carrie had not been an only child we might have at least hearsay reports of dozens of other minor occurrences In the case of Andrea Kolintz see Appendix II for a fuller history we are told that following a spanking for crawling out on the roof The medicine cabinet flew open bottles fell to the floor or seemed to hurl themselves across the bathroom doors flew open and slammed shut and at the climax of the manifestation a pound stereo cabinet tipped over and records flew all over the living room divebombing the occupants and shattering against the walls Significantly this report is from one of Andreas brothers as quoted in the September   issue of Life magazine Life is hardly the most scholarly or unimpeachable source but there is a great deal of other documentation and I think that the point of familiar witnesship is served In the case of Carrie White the only witness to any possible prologue to the final climactic events was Margaret White and she of course is dead Henry Grayle principal of Ewen High School had been expecting him all week but Chris Hargensens father didnt show up until Fridaythe day after Chris had skipped her detention period with the formidable Miss Desjardin Yes Miss Fish He spoke formally into the intercom although he could see the man in the outer office through his window and certainly knew his face from pictures in the local paper John Hargensen to see you Mr Grayle Send him in please Goddammit Fish do you have to sound so impressed Grayle was an irrepressible paperclipbender napkinripper cornerfolder For John Hargensen the towns leading legal light he was bringing up the heavy ammunition  a whole box of heavyduty clips in the middle of his desk blotter Hargensen was a tall impressive man with a selfconfident way of moving and the kind of sure mobile features that said this was a man superior at the game of onestepahead social interaction He was wearing a brown Savile Row suit with subtle glints of green and gold running through the weave that put Grayles local offtherack job to shame His briefcase was thin real leather and bound with glittering stainless steel The smile was faultless and full of many capped teeth  a smile to make the hearts of lady jurors melt like butter in a warm skillet His grip was major league all the wayfirm warm long Mr Grayle Ive wanted to meet you for some time now Im always glad to see interested parents Grayle said with a dry smile Thats why we have Parents Open House every October Of course Hargensen smiled I imagine youre a busy man and I have to be in court in fortyfive minutes from now Shall we get down to specifics Surely Grayle dipped into his box of clips and began to mangle the first one I suspect you are here concerning the disciplinary action taken against your daughter Christine You should be informed that school policy on the matter has been set As a man concerned with the workings of justice yourself you should realize that bending the rules is hardly possible or Hargensen waved his hand impatiently Apparently youre labouring under a misconception Mr Grayle I am here because my daughter was manhandled by your gym teacher Miss Rhoda Desjardin And verbally abused Im afraid I believe the term your Miss Desjardin used in connection with my daughter was shitty Grayle sighed inwardly Miss Desjardin has been reprimanded John Hargensens smile cooled thirty degrees Im afraid a reprimand will not be sufficient I believe this has been the young ah ladys first year in a teaching capacity Yes We have found her to be eminently satisfactory Apparently your definition of eminently satisfactory includes throwing students up against lockers and the ability to curse like a sailor Grayle fenced As a lawyer you must be aware that this state acknowledges the schools title to in loco parentis  along with full responsibility we succeed to full parental rights during school hours If youre not familiar Id advise you to check Monondock Consolidated School District vs Cranepool or Im familiar with the concept Hargensen mid Im also aware that neither the Cranepool case that you administrators are so fond of quoting or the Frick case cover anything remotely concerned with physical or verbal abuse There is however the case of School District No  vs David Are you familiar with it Grayle was George Kramer the assistant principal of the consolidated high school in SD  was a poker buddy George wasnt playing much poker any more He was working for an insurance company after taking it upon himself to cut a students hair The school district had ultimately paid seven thousand dollars in damages or about a thousand bucks a snip Grayle started on another paper clip Lets not quote cases at each other Mr Grayle were busy men I dont want a lot of unpleasantness I dont want a mess My daughter is at home and she will stay there Monday and Tuesday That will complete her threeday suspension Thats all right Another dismissive wave of the hand catch fido good boy heres a nice bone Heres what I want Hargensen continued One prom tickets for my daughter A girls senior prom is important to her and Chris is very distressed Two no contract renewal of the Desjardin woman Thats for me I believe that if I cared to take the School Department to court I could walk out with both her dismissal and a hefty damage settlement in my pocket But I dont want to be vindictive So court is the alternative if I dont agree to your demands I understand that a School Committee hearing would precede that but only as a formality But yes court would be the final result Nasty for you Another paper clip For physical and verbal abuse is that correct Essentially Mr Hargensen are you aware that your daughter and about ten of her peers threw sanitary napkins at a girl who was having her first menstrual period A girl who was under the impression that she was bleeding to death A faint frown creased Hargensens features as if someone had spoken in a distant room I hardly think such an allegation is at issue I am speaking of actions following Never mind Grayle said Never mind what you were speaking of This girl Carietta White was called a dumb pudding and was told to plug it up and was subjected to various obscene gestures She has not been in school this week at all Does that sound like physical and verbal abuse to you It does to me I dont intend Hargensen said to sit here and listen to a tissue of halftruths or your standard schoolmaster lecture Mr Grayle I know my daughter well enough to Here Grayle reached into the wire IN basket beside the blotter and tossed a sheaf of pink cards across the desk I doubt very much if you know the daughter represented in these cards half so well as you think you do If you did you might realize that it was about time for a trip to the woodshed Its time you snubbed her close before she does someone a major damage You arent Ewen four years Grayle overrode him Graduation slated June seventynine next month Tested IQ of a hundred and forty Eightythree average Nonetheless I see shes been accepted at Oberlin Id guess someone probably you Mr Hargensen  has been yanking some pretty long strings Seventyfour assigned detentions Twenty of those have been for harassment of misfit pupils I might add Fifth wheels I understand that Chriss clique calls them Mortimer Snurds They find it all quite hilarious She skipped out on fiftyone of those assigned detentions At Chamberlain Junior High one suspension for putting a firecracker in a girls shoe  the note on the card says that little prank almost cost a little girl named Irma Swope two toes The Swope girl has a harelip I understand Im talking about your daughter Mr Hargensen Does that tell you anything Yes Hargensen said rising A thin flush had suffused his features It tells me Ill see you in court And when Im done with you youll be lucky to get a job selling encyclopedias door to door Grayle also rose angrily and the two men faced each other across the desk Let it be court then Grayle said He noted a faint flick of surprise on Hargensens face crossed his fingers and went in for what he hoped would be a knockout  or at least a TKO that would save Desjardins job and take this silkass son of a bitch down a notch You apparently havent realized all the implications of in loco parentis in this matter Mr Hargensen The same umbrella that covers your daughter also covers Carrie White And the minute you file for damages on the grounds of physical and verbal abuse we will crossfile against your daughter on those same grounds for Carrie White Hargensens mouth dropped open then closed You cant get away with a cheap gimmick like that you Shyster lawyer Is that the phrase you were looking for Grayle smiled grimly I believe you know your way out Mr Hargensen The sanctions against your daughter stand If you care to take the matter further that is your right Hargensen crossed the room stiffly paused as if to add something then left barely restraining himself from the satisfaction of a hard doorslam Grayle blew out breath It wasnt hard to see where Chris Hargensen came by her selfwilled stubbornness A P Morton entered a minute later How did it go Timell tell Morty Grayle said Grimacing he looked at the twisted pile of paper clips He was good for seven clips anyway Thats some kind of record Is he going to make it a civil matter Dont know It rocked him when I said wed counter sue I bet it did Morton glanced at the phone on Grayles desk Its time we let the superintendent in on this bag of garbage isnt it Yes Grayle said picking up the phone Thank God my unemployment insurance is paid up Me too Morton said loyally From The Shadow Exploded appendix Ill Carrie White passed in the following short verse as a poetry assignment in the seventh grade Mr Edwin King who had Carrie for grade seven English says I dont know why I saved it She certainly doesnt stick out in my mind as a superior pupil and this isnt a superior verse She was very quiet and I cant remember her ever raising her hand even once in class But something in this seemed to cry out Jesus watches from the wall But his face is cold as stone And if he loves me  As she tells me Why do I feel so all alone The border of the paper on which this little verse is written is decorated with a great many cruciform figures which almost seem to dance  Tommy was at baseball practice Monday afternoon and Sue went down to the Kelly Fruit Company in The Centre to wait for him Kellys was the closest thing to a high school hangout the loosely sprawled community of Chamberlain could boast since Sheriff Doyle had closed the rec centre following a large drug bust It was run by a morose fat man named Hubert Kelly who dyed his hair black and complained constantly that his electronic pacemaker was on the verge of electrocuting him The place was a combination grocery soda fountain and gas stationthere Was a rusted Jenny pump out front that Hubie had never bothered to change when the company merged He also sold beer cheap wine dirty books and a wide selection of obscure cigarettes such as Mirads King Sano and Marvel Straights The soda fountain was a slab of real marble and there were four or five booths for kids unlucky enough or friendless enough to have no place to go and get drunk or stoned An ancient pinball machine that always tilted on the third ball stuttered lights on and off in the back beside the rack of dirty books When Sue walked in she saw Chris Hargensen immediately She was sitting in one of the back booths Her current amour Billy Nolan was looking through the latest issue of Popular Mechanix at the magazine rack Sue didnt know what a rich Popular girl like Chris saw in Nolan who was like some strange time traveller from the s with his greased hair zipperbejewelled leather jacket and manifoldbubbling Chevrolet road machine Sue Chris hailed come on over Sue nodded and raised a hand although dislike rose in her throat like a paper snake Looking at Chris was like looking through a slanted doorway to a place where Carrie White crouched with hands over her head Predictably she found her own hypocrisy inherent in the wave and the nod incomprehensible and sickening Why couldnt she just cut her dead A dime root beer she told Hubie Hubie had genuine draft root beer and he served it in huge frosted s mugs She had been looking forward to tipping a long one while she read a paper novel and waited for Tommy  in spite of the havoc the root beers raised with her complexion she was hooked But she wasnt surprised to find shed lost her taste for this one Hows your heart Hubie she asked You kids Hubie said scraping the head off Sues beer with a table knife and filling the mug the rest of the way You dont understand nothing I plugged in my electric razor this morning and got a hundred a ten volts right through this pacemaker You kids dont know what thats like am I right I guess not No Christ Jesus forbid you should ever have to find out How long can my old ticket take it You kidsll all find out when I buy the farm and those urban renewal poops turn this place into a parking lot Thats a dime She pushed her dime across the marble Fifty million volts right up the old tubes Hubie said darkly and stared down at the small bulge in his breast pocket Sue went over and slid carefully into the vacant side of Chriss booth She was looking exceptionally pretty her black hair held by a shamrockgreen band and a tight basque blouse that accentuated her firm upthrust breasts How are you Chris Bitchin good Chris said a little too blithely You heard the latest Im out of the prom I bet that cocksucker Grayle loses his job though Sue had heard the latest Along with everyone at Ewen Daddys suing them Chris went on Over her shoulder Billeee Come over here and say hi to Sue He dropped his magazine and sauntered over thumbs booked into his sidehitched garrison belt fingers dangling limply toward the stuffed crotch of his pegged levis Sue felt a wave of unreality surge over her and fought an urge to put her hands to her face and giggle madly Hi Suze Billy said He slid in beside Chris and immediately began to massage her shoulder His face was utterly blank He might have been testing a cut of beef I think were going to crash the prom anyway Chris said As a protest or something Is that right Sue was frankly startled No Chris replied dismissing it I dont know Her face suddenly twisted into in expression of fury as abrupt and surprising as a tornado funnel That goddamned Carrie White I wish shed taken her goddam holy joe routine and stuff it straight up her ass Youll get over it Sue said If only the rest of you had walked out with me  Jesus Sue why didnt you We could have had them by the balls I never figured you for an establishment pawn Sue felt her face grow hot I dont know about anyone else but I wasnt being anybodys pawn I took the punishment because I thought I earned it We did a suckoff thing End of statement Bullshit That fucking Carrie runs around saying everyone but her and her giltedged momma are going to bell and you can stick up for her We should have taken those rags and stuffed them down her throat Sure Yeah See you around Chris She pushed out of the booth This time it was Chris who coloured the blood slammed to her face in a sudden rush as if a red cloud had passed over some inner sun Arent you getting to be the Joan of Arc around here I seem to remember you were in there pitching with the rest of us Yes Sue said trembling But I stopped Oh arent you just it Chris marvelled Oh my yes Take your root beer with you Im afraid I might touch it and turn to gold She didnt take her root beer She turned and halfwalked halfstumbled out The upset inside her was very great too great yet for either tears or anger She was a getalong girl and it was the first fight she had been in physical or verbal since gradeschool pigtail pulling And it was the first time in her life that she had actively espoused a Principle And of course Chris had hit her in just the right place had hit her exactly where she was most vulnerable She way being a hypocrite there seemed no way to avoid that and deeply sheathed within her and hateful was the knowledge that one of the reasons she had gone to Miss Desjardins hour of calisthenics and sweating runs around the gym Floor had nothing to do with nobility She wasnt going to miss her last Spring Ball for anything Not for anything Tommy was nowhere in sight She began to walk back toward the school her stomach churning unhappily Little Miss Sorority Suzy Creemcheese The Nice Girl who only does It with the boy she plans to marry  with the proper Sunday supplement coverage of course Two kids Beat the living shit out of them if they show any signs of honesty screwing fighting or refusing to grin each time some mythic honcho yelled frog Spring Ball Blue gown Corsage kept all the afternoon in the fridge Tommy in a white dinner jacket cummerbund black pants black shoes Parents taking photos posed by the livingroom sofa with Kodak Starflashes and Polaroid BigShots Crepe masking the stark gymnasium girders Two bands one rock one mellow No fifth wheels need apply Mortimer Snurd please keep out Aspiring country club members and future residents of Kleen Korners only The tears finally came and she began to run From The Shadow Exploded p  The following excerpt is from a letter to Donna Kellogg from Christine Hargensen The Kellogg girl moved from Chamberlain to Providence Rhode Island in the fall of  She was apparently one of Chris Hargensens few close friends and a confidante The letter is postmarked May  So Im out of the Prom and my yellowguts father says he wont give them what they deserve But theyre not going to get away with it I dont know what exactly Im going to do yet but I guarantee you everyone is going to get a big fucking surprise    It was the seventeenth May seventeenth She crossed the day off the calendar in her room as soon as she slipped into her long white nightgown She crossed off each day as it passed with a heavy black felt pen and she supposed it expressed a very bad attitude toward life She didnt really care The only thing she really cared about was knowing that Momma was going to make her go back to school tomorrow and she would have to face all of Them She sat down in the small Boston rocker bought and paid for with her own money beside the window closed her eyes and swept Them and all the clutter of her conscious thoughts from her mind It was like sweeping a floor Lift the rug of your subconscious mind and sweep all the dirt under Goodbye She opened her eyes She looked at the hairbrush on her bureau Flex She was lifting the hairbrush It was heavy It was like lifting a barbell with very weak arms Oh Grunt The hairbrush slid to the edge of the bureau slid out past the point where gravity should have toppled it and then dangled as if on an invisible string Carries eyes had closed to slits Veins pulsed in her temples A doctor might have been interested in what her body was doing at that instant it made no rational sence Respiration had fallen to sixteen breaths per minute Blood pressure up to  Heartbeat up to   higher than astronauts under the heavy gload of liftoff Temperature down to  Her body was burning energy that seemed to be coming from nowhere and seemed to be going nowhere An electroencephalogram would have shown alpha waves that were no longer waves at all but great jagged spikes She let the hairbrush down carefully Good Last night she had dropped it Lose all your points go to jail She closed her eyes again and rocked Physical functions began to revert to the norm her respiration speeded until she was nearly panting The rocker had a slight squeak Wasnt annoying though Was soothing Rock rock Clear your mind Carrie Her mothers voice slightly disturbed floated up shes getting interference like the radio when you turn on the blender good good Have you said your prayers Carrie Im saying them she called back Yes She was saying them all right She looked at her small studio bed Flex Tremendous weight Huge Unbearable The bed trembled and then the end came up perhaps three inches It dropped with a crash She waited a small smile playing about her lips for Momma to call upstairs angrily She didnt So Carrie got up went to her bed and slid between the cool sheets Her head ached and she felt giddy as she always did after these exercise sessions Her heart was pounding in a fierce scary way She reached over turned off the light and lay back No pillow Momma didnt allow her a pillow She thought of imps and families and witches am i a witch momma the devils whore riding through the night souring milk overturning butter chums blighting crops while They huddled inside their houses with hex signs scrawled on Their doors She closed her eyes slept and dreamed of huge living stones crashing through the night seeking out Momma seeking out Them They were trying to run trying to hide But the rock would not hide them the dead tree gave no shelter From My Name is Susan Snell by Susan Snell New York Simon  Schuster  pp iiv Theres one thing no one has understood about what happened in Chamberlain on Prom Night The press hasnt understood it the scientists at Duke University havent understood it David Congress hasnt understood it  although his The Shadow Exploded is probably the only halfdecent book written on the subject  and certainly The White Commission which used me as a handy scapegoat did not understand it This one thing is the most fundamental fact We were kids Carrie was seventeen Chris Hargensen was seventeen I was seventeen Tommy Ross was eighteen Billy Nolan who spent a year repeating the ninth grade presumably before he learned how to shoot his cuffs during examinations was nineteen  Older kids react in more socially acceptable ways than younger kids but they still have a way of making bad decisions of overreacting or underestimating In the first section which follows this introduction I must show these tendencies in myself as well as I am able Yet the matter which I am going to discuss is at the root of my involvement in Prom Night and if I am to clear my name I must begin by recalling scenes which I find particularly painful  I have told this story before most notoriously before The White Commission which received it with incredulity In the wake of two hundred deaths and the destruction of an entire town it is so easy to forget one thing We were kids We were kids We were kids trying to do our best  You must be crazy He blinked at her not willing to believe that he had actually heard it They were at his house and the television was on but forgotten His mother had gone over to visit Mrs Klein across the street His father was in the cellar workroom making a birdhouse Sue looked uncomfortable but determined Ifs the way I want it Tommy Well its not the way I want it I think ifs the craziest goddam thing I ever heard Like something you might do on a bet Her face tightened Oh I thought you were the one doing the big speeches the other night But when it comes to putting your money where your big fat mouth Wait whoa He was unoffended grinning I didnt say no did I Not yet anyway YOU C Wait Just wait Let me talk You want me to ask Carrie White to the Spring Ball Okay I got that But theres a couple of things I dont understand Name them She leaned forward First what good would it do And second what makes YOU think shed say yes if I asked her Not say yes Why  She floundered Youre  everybody likes you and We both know Carries got no reason to care much for people that everybody likes Shed go with you Why Pressed she looked defiant and proud at the same time Ive seen the way she looks at you Shes got a crush Like half the girls at Ewen He rolled his eyes Well Im just telling you Sue said defensively She wont be able to say no Suppose I believe you he said What about the other thing You mean what good will it do Why itll bring her out of her shell of course Make her She trailed off A part of things Come on Suze You dont believe that bullshit All right she said Maybe I dont But maybe I still think Ive got something to make up for The shower room A lot more than that Maybe if that was all I could let it go but the mean tricks have been going on ever since grammar school I wasnt in on many of them but I was on some If Id been in Chriss group I bet I would have been in on even more It seemed like  oh a big laugh Girls can be catmean about that sort of thing and boys dont really understand The boys would tease Carrie for a little while and then forget but the girls  it went on and on and on and I cant even remember where it started any more If I were Carrie I couldnt even face showing myself to the world Id just find a big rock and hide under it You were kids he said Kids dont know what theyre doing Kids dont even know their reactions really actually hurt other people They have no uh empathy Dig She found herself struggling to express the thought this called up in her for it suddenly seemed basic bulking over the showerroom incident the way sky bulks over mountains But hardly anybody ever finds out that their actions really actually hurt other people People dont get better they just get smarter When you get smarter you dont stop pulling the wings off flies you just think of better reasons for doing it Lots of kids say they feel sorry for Carrie Whitemostly girls and thats a laughbut I bet none of them understand what its like to be Carrie White every second of every day And they dont really care Do you I dont know she cried But someone ought to try and be sorry in a way that counts  in a way that means something All right Ill ask her You will The statement came out in a flat surprised way She had not thought he actually would Yea But I think shell say no Youve overestimated my boxoffice appeal That popularity stuff is bullshit Youve got a bee in your bonnet about that Thank you she said and it sounded odd as if she had thanked an Inquisitor for torture I love you he said She looked at him startled It was the first time he had said it From My Name is Susan Snell p  There are lots of peoplemostly menwho arent surprised that I asked Tommy to take Carrie to the Spring Ball They are surprised that he did it though which shows you that the male mind expects very little in the way of altruism from its fellows Tommy took her because he loved me and because it was what I wanted How asks the sceptic from the balcony did you know he loved you Because he told me so mister And if youd known him that would have been good enough for you too  He asked her on Thursday after lunch and found himself as nervous as a kid going to his first icecream party She sat four rows over from him in Period Five study hall and when it was over he cut across to her through the mass of rushing bodies At the teachers desk Mr Stephens a tall man just beginning to run to fat was folding papers abstractedly back into his ratty brown briefcase Carrie Ohuh She looked up from her books with a startled wince as if expecting a blow The day was overcast and the bank of fluorescents embedded in the ceiling was not particularly kind to her pale complexion But he saw for the first time because it was the first time he had really looked that she was far from repulsive Her face was round rather than oval and the eyes were so dark that they seemed to cast shadows beneath them like bruises Her hair was darkish blonde slightly wiry pulled back in a bun that was not becoming to her The lips were full almost lush the teeth naturally white Her body for the most part was indeterminate A baggy sweater concealed her breasts except for token nubs The skirt was colourful but awful all the same It fell to a  midshin hem in an odd and clumsy Aline The calves were strong and rounded the attempt to conceal these with heathery kneesocks was bizarre but unsuccessful and handsome She was looking up with an expression that was slightly fearful slightly something else He was quite sure he knew what the something else was Sue had been right and being right he had just time to wonder if this was doing a kindness or making things even worse If you dont have a date for the Ball would you want to go with me Now she blinked and as she did so a strange thing happened The time it took to happen could have been no more than the doorway to a second but afterwards he had no trouble recalling it as one does with dreams or the sensation of deja vu He felt a dizziness as if his mind was no longer controlling his body  the miserable outofcontrol feeling he associated with drinking too much and then coming to the vomiting point Then it was gone What What She wasnt angry at least He had expected a brief gust of rage and then a sweeping retreat But she wasnt angry she seemed unable to cope with what he had said at all They were alone in the study hall now perfectly between the ebb of old students and the flow of new ones The Spring Ball he said a little shaken Its next Friday and I know this is late notice but I dont like to be tricked she said softly and lowered her head She hesitated for just a second and then passed him by She stopped and turned and he suddenly saw dignity in her something so natural that he doubted if she was even aware of it Do You People think you can just go on tricking me forever I know who you go around with I dont go around with anyone I dont want to Tommy said patiently Im asking you because I want to ask you Ultimately he knew this to be the truth If Sue was making a gesture of atonement she was doing it only at secondhand The Period Six students were coming in now and some of them were looking over curiously Dale Ullman said something to a boy Tommy didnt know and both of them snickered Come on Tommy said They walked out into the hall They were halfway to Wing Four  his class was the other way  walking together but perhaps only by accident when she said almost too quietly to hear Id love to Love to He was perceptive enough to know it was not an acceptance and again doubt assailed him Still it was started Do it then It will be all right For both of us Well see to it No she said and in her sudden pensiveness she could have been mistaken for beautiful It will be a nightmare I dont have tickets he said as if he hadnt heard This is the last day they sell them Hey Tommy youre going the wrong way Brent Gillian yelled She stopped Youre going to be late Will you Your class she said distraught Your class The bell is going to ring Will you Yes she said with angry helplessness You knew I would She swiped at her eyes with the back of her hand No he said But now I do Ill pick you up at seventhirty Fine she whispered Thank you She looked as if she might swoon And then more uncertain than ever he touched her hand From The Shadow Exploded pp  Probably no other aspect of the Carrie White affair had been so misunderstood secondguessed and shrouded in mystery as the part played by Thomas Everett Ross Carries illstarred escort to the Ewen High School Spring Ball Morton Cratzchbarken in an admittedly sensationalized address to The National Colloquium on Psychic Phenomena last year said that the two most stunning events of the twentieth century have been the assassination of John F Kennedy in  and the destruction that came to Chamberlain Maine in May of  Cratzchbarken points out that both events were driven home to the citizenry by mass media and both events have almost shouted the frightening fact that while something had ended something else had been irrevocably set in motion for good or ill If the comparison can be made then Thomas Ross played the part of Lee Harvey Oswald  trigger man in a catastrophe The question that still remains is Did he do so wittingly or unwittingly Susan Snell by her own admission was to have been escorted by Ross to the annual event She claims that she suggested Ross take Carrie to make up for her part in the showerroom incident Those who oppose this story most lately led by George Jerome of Harvard claim that this is either a highly romantic distortion or an outright lie Jerome argues with great force and eloquence that it is hardly typical of highschoolage adolescents to feel that they have to atone for anything  particularly for an offence against a peer who has been ostracized from existing cliques It would be uplifting if we could believe that adolescent human nature is capable of salvaging the pride and self image of the low bird in the pecking order with such a gesture Jerome has said in a recent issue of The Atlantic Monthly but we know better The low bird is not picked tenderly out of the dust by its fellows rather it is despatched quickly and without mercy Jerome of course is absolutely rightabout birds at any rate  and his eloquence is undoubtedly responsible in large part for the advancement of the practical joker theory which The White Commission approached but did not actually state This theory hypothesizes that Ross and Christine Hargensen see pp  were at the centre of a loose conspiracy to get Carrie White to the Spring Ball and once there complete her humiliation Some theorists mostly crime writers also claim that Sue Snell was an active part of this conspiracy This casts the mysterious Mr Ross in the worst possible light that of a practical joker deliberately manoeuvring an unstable girl into an situation of extreme stress The author doesnt believe that likely in fight of Mr Rosss character This is a facet which has remained largely unexplored by his detractors who have painted him as a rather dull cliquecentred athlete the phrase dumb jock expresses this view of Tommy Ross perfectly It is true that Ross was an athlete of aboveaverage ability His best sport was baseball and he was a member of the Ewen varsity squad from his Sophomore year Dick OConnell general manager of the Boston Red Sox has indicated that Ross would have been offered a fairly large bonus for signing a contract had he lived But Ross was also a straightA student hardly fitting the dumbjock image and his parents have both said that he had decided pro baseball would have to wait until he had finished college where he planned to study for an English degree His interests including writing poetry and a poem written six months prior to his death was published in an established little magazine called Everleaf This is available in Appendix V His surviving classmates also give him high marks and this is significant There were only twelve survivors of what has become known in the popular press as Prom Night Those who were not in attendance were largely the unpopular members of the Junior and Senior classes If these outs remember Ross as a friendly goodnatured fellow many referred to him as a hell of a good shit does not Professor Jeromes thesis suffer accordingly Rosss school records  which cannot according to state law be photostated here  when taken with class mates recollections and the comments of relatives neighbours and teachers form a picture of an extraordinary young man This is a fact that jells very badly with Professor Jeromes picture of a peerworshipping sly young tough He apparently had a high enough tolerance to verbal abuse and enough independence from his peer group to ask Carrie in the first place In fact Thomas Ross appears to have been something of a rarity  a socially conscious young man No case will be made here for his sainthood There is none to be made But intensive research has satisfied me that neither was he a human chicken in a publicschool barnyard joining mindlessly in the ruin of a weaker hen  She lay i am not afraid not afraid of her on her bed with an arm thrown over her eyes It was Saturday night If she was to make the dress she had in mind she would have to start tomorrow at the im not afraid momma latest She had already bought the material at Johns in Westover The heavy crumpled velvet richness of it frightened her The price had also frightened her and she had been intimidated by the size of the place the chic ladies wandering here and here in their light spring dresses examining bolts of cloth There was an echoing strangeness in the atmosphere and it was worlds from the Chamberlain Woolworths where she usually bought her material She was intimidated but not stopped Bemuse if she wanted to she could send them all screaming into the streets Mannequins toppling over light fixtures failing bolts of cloth shooting through the air in unwinding shelters Like Samson in the temple she could rain destruction on their heads if she so desired i am not afraid The package was now hidden on a dry shelf in the cellar and she was going to bring it up Tonight She opened her eyes Flex The bureau rose into the air trembled for a moment and then rose until it nearly touched the ceiling She lowered it Lifted it Lowered it Now the bed complete with her weight Up Down Up Down Just like an elevator She was hardly tired at all Well a little Not much The ability almost lost two weeks ago was in full flower It had progressed at a speed that was Well almost terrifying And now seemingly unbidden  like the knowledge of menstruation  a score of memories had come as if some mental dam had been knocked down so that strange waters could gush forth They were cloudy distorted littlegirl memories but very real for all that Making the pictures dance on the walls turning on the water faucets from across the room Momma asking her carrie shut the windows its going to rain to do something and windows suddenly banging down all over the house giving Miss Macaferty four flat tyres all at once by unscrewing the valves in the tyres of her Volkswagen the stones  no no no no no  but now there was no denying the memory no more than there could be a denying of the monthly flow and that memory was not cloudy no not that one it was harsh and brilliant like jagged strokes of lightning the little girl momma stop momma cant i cant breathe o my throat o momma im sorry i looked momma o my tongue blood in my mouth the poor little girl screaming little slut o i know how it is with you i see what has to be done the poor little girl lying half in the closet and half out of it swing black stars dancing in front of everything a sweet faraway buzzing swollen tongue lolling between her lips throat circled with a bracelet of puffed abraded flesh where Momma had throttled her and then Momma coming back coming for her Momma holding Daddy Ralphs long butcher knife cut it out i have to cut out the evil the nastiness sins of the flesh o i know about that the eyes cut out your eyes in her right hand Mommas face twisted and working drool on her thin holding Daddy Ralphs Bible in her other hand youll never look at that naked wickedness again and something flexed not flex but FLEX something huge and unformed and titanic a wellspring of power that was not hers now and never would be again and then something fell on the roof and Momma screamed and dropped Daddy Ralphs Bible and that was good and then more bumps and thumps and then the house began to throw its furnishings around and Momma dropped the knife and got on her knees and began to pray holding up her hands and swaying on her knees while chairs whistled down the hall and the beds upstairs fell over and the dining room table tried to jam itself through a window and then mommas eyes growing huge and crazed bulging her finger pointing at the little girl its you its you devilspawn witch imp of the devil its you doing it and then the stones and Momma had fainted as their roof cracked and thumped as if with the footfalls of God and then Then she had fainted herself And after that there were no more memories Momma did not speak of it The butcher knife was back in its drawer Momma dressed the huge black and blue bruises on her neck and Carrie thought she could remember asking Momma how she had gotten them and Momma tightening her lips and saying nothing Little by little it was forgotten The eye of memory opened only in dreams The pictures no longer danced on the walls The windows did not shut themselves Carrie did not remember a time when things had been different Not until now She lay on her bed looking at the ceiling sweating Carrie Supper Thank you i am not afraid Momma She got up and fixed her hair with a darkblue headband Then she went downstairs From The Shadow Exploded p How apparent was Carries wild talent and what did Margaret White with her extreme Christian ethic think of it We shall probably never know But one is tempted to believe that Mrs Whites reaction must have been extreme  You havent touched your pie Carrie Momma looked up from the tract she had been perusing while she drank her Constant Comment Its homemade It makes me have pimples Momma Your pimples are the Lords way of chastising you Now eat your pie Momma Yes Carrie plunged Ive been invited to the Spring Ball next Friday by Tommy Ross The tract was forgotten Momma was staring at her with wide my earsaredeceivingme eyes Her nostrils flared like those of a horse that has heard the dry rattle of a snake Carrie tried to swallow an obstruction and only i am not afraid o yes i am got rid of part of it and hes a very nice boy Hes promised to stop in and meet you before and No to have me in by eleven Ive No no no accepted Momma please see that I have to start to to try and get along with the world Im not like you Im funny  I mean the kids think Im funny I dont want to be I want to try and be a whole person before its too late to Mrs White threw her tea in Carries face It was only lukewarm but it could not have shut of Carries words more suddenly if it had been scalding She sat numbly the amber fluid dripping from her chin and cheeks on to her white blouse spreading It was sticky and smelled like cinnamon Mrs White sat trembling her face frozen except for her nostrils which continued to flare Abruptly she threw back her head and screamed at the ceiling God God God Her jaw snapped brutally over each syllable Carrie sat without moving Mrs White got up and came around the table Her hands were hooked into shaking claws Her face bore a halfmad expression of compassion mixed with hate The closet she said Go to your closet and pray No Momma Boys Yes boys come next After the blood the boys come Like sniffing dogs grinning and slobbering trying to find out where that smell is That  smell She swung her whole arm into the blow and the sound of her palm against Carries face o god i am so afraid now was like that flat sound of a leather belt being snapped in air Carrie remained seated although her upper body swayed The mark on her cheek was first white then blood red The mark Mrs White said Her eyes were large but blank she was breathing in rapid snatching gulps of air She seemed to be talking to herself as the claw hand descended on to Carries shoulder and pulled her out of her chair Ive seen it all right Oh yes But I Never Did But for him He Took Me    She paused her eyes wandering vaguely toward the ceiling Carrie was terrified Momma seemed in the throes of some great revelation which might destroy her Momma In cars Oh I know where they take you in their arms City limits Roadhouses Whiskey Smelling  oh they smell it on you Her voice rose to a scream Tendons stood out on her neck and her head twisted in a questing upward rotation Momma you better stop This seemed to snap her back to some kind of hazy reality Her lips twitched in a kind of elementary surprise and she halted as if groping for old bearings in a new world The closet she muttered Go to your closet and pray No Momma raised her hand to strike No The hand stopped in the dead air Momma stared up at it as if to confirm that it was still there and whole The pie pan suddenly rose from the trivet on the table and hurled itself across the room to impact beside the livingroom door in a splash of blueberry drool Im going Momma Mommas overturned teacup rose and flew past her head to shatter above the stove Momma shrieked and dropped to her knees with her hands over her head Devils child she moaned Devils child Satan spawn Momma stand up Lust and licentiousness the cravings of the flesh Stand up Mommas voice faded her but she did stand up with her hands still on her head like a prisoner of war Her lips moved To Carrie she seemed to be reciting the Lords Prayer I dont want to fight with you Momma Carrie said and her voice almost broke from her and dissolved She struggled to control it I only want to be let to live my own life I I dont like yours She stopped horrified in spite of herself The ultimate blasphemy had been spoken and it was a thousand times worse than the Eff Word Witch Momma whispered It says in the Lords Book Thou shalt not suffer a witch to bye Your father did the Lords work I dont want to talk about that Carrie said It always disturbed her to hear Momma talk about her father I just want you to understand that things are going to change around here Momma Her eyes gleamed They better understand it too But Momma was whispering to herself again Unsatisfied with a feeling of anticlimax in her throat and the dismal rolling of emotional upset in her belly she went to the cellar to get her dress material It was better than the closet There was that Anything was better than the closet with its blue light and the overpowering stench of sweat and her own sin Anything Everything She stood with the wrapped package hugged against her breast and closed her eyes shutting out the weak glow of the cellars bare cobwebfestooned bulb Tommy Ross didnt love her she knew that This was some strange kind of atonement and she could understand that and respond to it She had lain cheek and jowl with the concept of penance since she had been old enough to reason He had said it would be goodthat they would see to it Well she would see to it They better not start anything They just better not She did not know if her gift had come from the lord of light or of darkness and now finally finding that she did not care which she was overcome with an almost indescribable relief as if a huge weight long carried had slipped from her shoulders Upstairs Momma continued to whisper It was not the Lords Prayer It was the Prayer of Exorcism from Deuteronomy From My Name Is Susan Snell p  They finally even made a movie about it I saw it last April When I came out I was sick Whenever anything important happens in America they have to goldplate it like baby shoes That way you can forget it And forgetting Carrie White may be a bigger mistake than anyone realizes  Monday morning Principal Grayle and his understudy Pete Morton were having coffee in Grayles office No word from Hargensen yet Morty asked His lips curled into a John Wayne leer that was a little frightened around the edges Not a peep And Christine has stopped lipping off about how her father is going to send us down the road Grayle blew on his coffee with a long face You dont exactly seem to be turning cartwheels Im not Did you know Carrie White is going to the prom Morty blinked With who The Beak The Beak was Freddy Holt another of Ewens misfits He weighed perhaps one hundred pounds soaking wet and the casual observer might be tempted to believe that sixty of it was nose No Grayle said With Tommy Ross Morty swallowed his coffee the wrong way and went into a coughing fit Thats the way I felt Grayle said What about his girl friend The little Snell girl I think she put him up to it Grayle said She certainly seemed guilty enough about what happened to Carrie when I talked to her Now shes on the Decoration Committee happy as a clam just as if not going to her Senior prom was nothing at all Oh Morty said wisely And Hargensen  I think he must have talked to some people and discovered we really could sue him on behalf of Carrie White if we wanted to I think hes cut his losses Its the daughter thats worrying me Do you think theres going to be an incident Friday night I dont know I do know Chris has got a lot of friends who are going to be there And shes going around with that Billy Nolan mess hes got a zooful of friends too The kind that make a career out of scaring pregnant ladies Chris Hargensen has him tied around her finger from what Ive heard Are you afraid of anything specific Grayle made a restless gesture Specific No But Ive been in the game long enough to know its a bad situation Do you remember the Stadler game in seventysix Morty nodded It would take more than the passage of three years to obscure the memory of the EwenStadler game Bruce Trevor had been a marginal student but a fantastic basketball player Coach Gaines didnt like him but Trevor was going to put Ewen in the area tournament for the first time in ten years He was cut from the team a week before Ewens but mustwin game against the Stadler Bobcats A regular announced locker inspection had uncovered a kilo of marijuana behind Trevors civic book Ewen lost the game  and their shot at the tourney   But no one remembered that what they remembered was the riot that had interrupted the game in the fourth period Led by Bruce Trevor who righteously claimed he had been bum rapped it resulted in four hospital admissions One of them had been the Stadler coach who had been hit over the head with a firstaid kit Ive got that kind of feeling Grayle said A hunch Someones going to come with rotten apples or something Maybe youre psychic Morty said From The Shadow Exploded pp  It is now generally agreed that the TK phenomenon is a geneticrecessive occurrence  but the opposite of a disease like haemophilia which becomes overt only in males In that disease once called Kings Evil the gene is recessive in the female and is carried harmlessly Male offspring however are bleeders This disease is generated only if an afflicted male marries a woman carrying the recessive gene If the offspring of such union is male the result will be a haemophiliac son If the offspring is female the result will be a daughter who is a carrier It should be emphasized that the haemophilia gene may be carried recessively in the male as a part of his genetic makeup But if he marries a woman with the same outlaw gene the result will be haemophilia if the offspring is male In the case of royal families where intermarriage was common the chances of the gene reproducing once it entered the family tree were high  thus the name Kings Evil Haemophilia also showed up in significant quantities in Appalachia during the earlier part of this century and is commonly noticed in those cultures where incest and the marriage of first cousins is common With the TK phenomenon the male appears to be the carrier the TK gene may be recessive in the female but dominates only in the female It appears that Ralph White carried the gene Margaret Brigham by purest name also carried the outlaw gene sign but we may be fairly confident that it was recessive as no information has ever been found to indicate that she had telekinetic powers resembling her daughters Investigations are now being conducted into the life of Margaret Brighams grandmother Sadie Cochran  for if the dominantrecessive pattern obtains with TK as it does with haemophilia Mrs Cochran must have been TKdominant If the issue of the White marriage had been male the result would have been another carrier Chances that the mutation would have died with him would have been excellent as neither side of the Ralph White  Margaret Brigham alliance had cousins of a comparable age for the theoretical male offspring to marry And the chances of meeting and marrying another woman with TK gene at random would be small None of the teams working on the problem have yet isolated the gene Surely no one can doubt in light of the Maine holocaust that isolating this gene must become one of medicines numberone priorities The haemophiliac or Hgene produces male issue with a lack of blood platelets The telekineticn or TKgene produces female Typhoid Marys capable of destroying almost at will  Wednesday afternoon Susan and fourteen other students  The Spring Ball Decoration Committee no less  were working on the huge mural that would hang behind the twin bandstand on Friday night The theme was Springtime in Venice who picked thew hokey themes Sue wondered She had been a student at Ewen for four years had after two Balls and she still didnt know Why did the goddam thing need a theme anyway Why not just have a sock hop and be done with W George Chizmar Ewens most artistic student had done a small chalk sketch of gondolas on a canal at sunset and a gondolier in a huge straw fedora leaning against the tiller as a gorgeous panoply of pinks and reds and oranges stained both sky and water It was beautiful no doubt about that He had redrawn it in silhouette on a huge fourteenbytwentyfoot canvas flat numbering the various sections to go with the various chalk hues Now the Committee was patiently colouring it in like children crawling over a huge page in a giants colouring book Still Sue thought looking at her hands and forearms both heavily dusted with pink chalk it was going to be the prettiest prom ever Next to her Helen Shyres sat up on her haunches stretched and groaned as her back popped She brushed a hank of hair from her forehead with the back of her hand leaving a rosecoloured smear How in hell did you talk me into this You want it to be nice dont you Sue mimicked Miss Geer the spinster chairman apt enough term for Miss Mustache of the Decoration Committee Yeah but why not the refreshment Committee or the Entertainment Committee Less back more mind The mind thats my area Besides youre not even  She bit down on the words Going Susan shrugged and picked up her chalk again She had a monstrous writers cramp No but I still want it to be nice She added shyly Tommys going They worked in silence for a bit and then Helen stopped again No one was near them the closest was Holly Marshall on the other end of the mural colouring the gondolas keel Can I ask you about it Sue Helen asked finally God everybodys talking Sure Sue stopped colouring and flexed her hand Maybe I ought to tell someone just so the story stays straight I asked Tommy to take Carrie Im hoping itll bring her out of herself a little  knock down some of the barriers I think I owe her that much Whom does that put the rest of us Helen asked without rancour Sue shrugged You have to make up your own mind about what we did Helen Im in no position to throw stones But I dont want people to think Im uh  She put the dress on for the first time on the morning of May in her room She had bought a special brassiere to go with it which gave her breasts the proper uplift not that they actually needed it but left their top halves uncovered Wearing it gave her a weird dreamy feeling that was half shame and half defiant excitement The dress itself was nearly floorlength The skirt was loose but the waist was snug the material rich and unfamiliar against her skin which was used only to cotton and wool The hang of it seemed to be right  or would be with the new shoes She slipped them on adjusted the neckline and went to the window She could see only a maddening ghost image of herself but everything seemed to be right Maybe later she could The door swung open behind her with only a soft snick of the latch and Carrie turned to look at her mother She was dressed for work wearing her white sweater and holding her black pocketbook in one hand In the other she was holding Daddy Ralphs Bible They looked at each other Hardly conscious of it Carrie felt her back straighten until she stood straight in the patch of early spring sunshine that fell through the window Red Momma murmured I might have known it would be red Carrie said nothing I can see your dirtypillows Everyone will Theyll be looking at your body The Book says Those are my breasts Momma Every woman has them Take of that dress Momma said No Take it of Carrie Well go down and bum it in the incinerator together and then pray for forgiveness Well do penance Her eyes began to sparkle with the strange disconnected zeal that came over her at events which she considered to be tests of faith Ill stay home from work and youll stay home from school Well pray Well ask for a sign Well get us down on our knees and ask for the Pentecostal Fire No Momma Her mother reached up and pinched her own face It left a red mark She looked to Carrie for reaction saw none hooked her right hand into claws and ripped it across her own cheek bringing thin blood She whined and rocked back on her heels Her eyes glowed with exultation Stop hurting yourself Momma Thats not going to make me stop either Momma screamed She made her right hand a fist and struck herself in the mouth bringing blood She dabbled her fingers in it looked at it dreamily and daubed a spot on the cover of the Bible Washed in the Blood of the Lamb she whispered Many times Many times he and Go away Momma She looked up at Carrie her eyes glowing There was a terrifying expression of righteous anger graven on her face The Lord is not mocked she whispered Be sure your sin will find you out Burn it Carrie Cast that devils red from you and burn it Burn it Burn it The door slammed open by itself Go away Momma Momma smiled Her bloody mouth made the smile grotesque twisted As Jezebel fell from the tower let it be with you she said And the dogs came and licked up the blood Its in the Bible Its Her feet began to slip along the floor and she looked down at them bewildered The wood might have turned to ice Stop that She screamed She was in the hall now She caught the doorjamb and held on for a moment then her fingers were torn loose seemingly by nothing I love you Momma Carrie said steadily Im sorry She envisioned the door swinging shut and the door did just that as if moved by a light breeze Carefully so as not to hurt her she disengaged the mental hands she had pushed her mother with A moment later Margaret was pounding on the door Carrie held it shut her lips trembling Theres going to be a judgment Margaret White raved I wash my hands of it I tried Pilate said that Carrie murmured Her mother went away A minute later Carrie saw her go down the walk and cross the street on her way to work Momma she said softly and put her forehead on the glass From The Shadow Exploded p  Before turning to a more detailed analysis of Prom Night itself it might be well to sum up what we know of Carrie White the person We know that Carrie was the victim of her mothers religious mania We know that she possessed a latent telekinetic talent commonly referred to as TK We know that this led wild talent is really a hereditary trait produced by a gene that is usually recessive if present at all We suspect that the TK ability may be glandular in nature We know that Carrie produced at least one demonstration of her ability as a small girl when she was put into an extreme situation of guilt and stress We know that a second extreme situation of guilt and stress arose from a showerroom hazing incident It has been theorized especially by WG Throneberry and Julia Givens Berkeley that resurgence of the TK ability at this point was caused by both psychological factors ie the reaction of the other girls and Carrie herself to their first menstrual period and physiological factors ie the advent of puberty And finally we know that on Prom Night a third sum situation arose causing the terrible events which we now must begin to discuss We will begin with  i am not nervous not a bit nervous Tommy had called earlier with her corsage and now she was pinning it to the shoulder of her gown herself There was no momma of course to do it for her and make sure it was in the right place Momma had locked herself in the chapel and had been in there for the last two hours praying hysterically Her voice rose and fen in frightening incoherent cycles Im sorry momma but I cant be sorry When she had it fixed to her satisfaction she dropped her hands and stood quietly for a moment with her eyes closed There was no fulllength mirror in the house vanity vanity all is vanity but she thought she was all right She had to be She She opened her eyes again The Black Forest cuckoo clock bought with Green Stamps said seventen hell be here in twenty minutes Would he Maybe it was all just an elaborate joke the final crusher the ultimate punch line To leave her sitting here half the night in her crushedvelvet prom gown with its princess waistline juliet sleeves and simple straight skirt  and her tea roses pinned to her left shoulder From the other room on the rise now    in hallowed earth We know thou bringst the Eye That Watcheth the hideous threelobbed eye and the sound of black trumpets We most heartily repent Carrie did not think anyone could understand the brute courage it had taken to reconcile herself to this to leave herself open to whatever fearsome possibilities the night might realize Being stood up could hardly be the worst of them In fact in a kind of sneaking wishful way she thought it might be for the best if no stop that Of course it would be easier to stay here with Momma Safer She knew what They thought of Momma Well maybe Momma was a fanatic a freak but at least she was predictable the house was predictable She never came home to laughing shrieking girls who threw things And if he didnt come if she drew back and gave up High school would be over in a month Then what A creeping subterranean existence in this house supported by Momma watching game shows and soap operas all day on television at Mrs Garrisons house when she had Carrie In To Visit Mrs Garrison was eightysix walking down to the Centre to get a malted after supper at the Kelly Fruit when it was deserted getting fatter losing hope losing even the power to think No Oh dear God please no please let it be a happy ending protect us from he with the split foot who waits in the alleys and in the parking lots of roadhouses O Saviour Seven twentyfive Restlessly without thinking she began to lift objects with her mind and put them back down the way a nervous woman awaiting someone in a restaurant will fold and unfold her napkin She could dangle half a dozen objects in air at one time and not a sign of tiredness or headache She kept waiting for the power to abate but it remained at high water with no sign of waning The other night on her way home from school she had rolled a parked car oh please god let it not be a joke twenty feet down the main street curb with no strain at all The courthouse idlers had stared at it as if their eyes would pop out and of course she stared too but she was smiling inside The cuckoo popped out of the clock and spoke once Seventhirty She had grown a little wary of the terrific strain using the power seemed to put on her heart and lungs and internal thermostat she suspected it would be all too possible for her heart to literally burst with the strain It was like being in anothers body and forcing her to run and run and run You would not pay the cost yourself the other body would She was beginning to realize that her power was perhaps not so different from the powers of Indian fakirs who stroll across hot coals run needles into their eyes or blithely bury themselves for periods up to six weeks Mind over matter in any form is a terrific drain on the bodys resources Seven thirtytwo hes not coming dont think about it a watched pot doesnt boil hell Come no he wont hes out laughing at you with his friends and after a little bit theyll drive by in one of their fast noisy cars laughing and hooting and yelling Miserably she began lifting the sewing machine up and down swinging it in widening arcs throught the air and protect us also from rebellious daughters imbued with the willfulness of the Wicked One Shut up Carrie screamed suddenly There was startled silence for a moment and then the babbling chant began again Seven thirtythree Not coming then ill wreck the house The thought came to her naturally and cleanly First the sewing machine driven through the living room wall The couch through a window Tables chairs books and tracts all flying the plumbing ripped loose and still spurting like arteries ripped free of flesh The roof itself if that were within her power shingles exploding upward into the night like startled pigeons Lights splashed gaudily across the window Other cars had gone by making her heart leap a little but this one was going much more slowly O She ran to the window unable to restrain herself and it was him Tommy just climbing out of his car and even under the street light he was handsome and alive and almost  crackling The odd word made her want to giggle Momma had stopped praying She grabbed her fight silken wrap from where it had lain across the back of her chair and put it around her bare shoulders She bit her lip touched her hair and would have sold her soul for a mirror The buzzer in the hall made its harsh cry She made herself wait controlling the twitch in her hands for the second buzz Then she went slowly with silken swish She opened the door and he was there nearly blinding in white dinner jacket and dark dress pants They looked at each other and neither said a word She felt that her heart would break if he uttered so much as the wrong sound and if he laughed she would die She felt actually physicallyher whole miserable life narrow to a point that might be an end or the beginning of a widening beam Finally helpless she said Do you like me He said Youre beautiful She was From The Shadow Exploded p  While those going to the Ewen Spring Ball were gathering at the high school or just leaving preProm buffets Christine Hargensen and William Nolan had met in a room above a local townlimits tavern called The Cavalier We know that they had been meeting there for some time that is in the records of the White Commission What we dont know is whether their plans were complete and irrevocable or if they went ahead almost on whim  Is it time yet She asked him in the darkness He looked at his watch No Faintly through the board floor came the thump of the juke playing Shes Got To Be a Saint by Ray Price The Cavalier Chris reflected hadnt changed their records since the first time shed been there with a forged ID two years ago Of course then shed been down in the taprooms not on one of Sam Deveauxs specials Billys cigarette winked fitfully in the dark like the eye of an uneasy demon She watched it introspectively She hadnt let him sleep with her until last Monday when he had promised that he and his greaser friends would help her pull the string on Carrie White if she actually dared to go to the Prom with Tommy Ross But they had been here before and had had some pretty hot necking going on  what she thought of as Scotch love and what he would call in his unfailing ability to pinpoint the vulgar the  dry humps She had meant to make him wait until he had actually done something but of course he did he got the blood but it had all begun to slip out of her hands and it made heir uneasy If she had not given in willingly on Monday he would have taken her by force Billy had not been her first lover but he was the first she could not dance and dandle at her whim Before him her boys had been clever marionettes with clear pimplefree faces and parents with connections and countryclub memberships They drove their own VWs or Javelins or Dodge Chargers They went to UMass or Boston College They wore fraternity windbreakers in the fall and muscleshirts with bright stripes in the summer They smoked marijuana a great deal and talked about the funny things that happened to them when they were wrecked They began by treating her with patronizing good fellowship all high school girls no matter how goodlooking were Bush League and always ended up trotting after her with panting doglike lust If they trotted long enough and spent enough in the Process she usually let them go to bed with her Quite often she lay passively beneath them not helping or hindering until it was over Later she achieved her own solitary climax while viewing the incident as a single closed loop of memory She had met Billy Nolan following a drug bust at a Cambridge apartment Four students including Chriss date for the evening had been busted for possession Chris and the other girls were charged with being present there Her father took care of it with quiet efficiency and asked her if she knew what would happen to his image and his practice if his daughter was taken up on a drug charge She told him that she doubted if anything could hurt either one and he took her car away Billy offered her a ride home from school one afternoon a week later and she accepted He was what the other kids called a whitesoxer or a machineshop Chuck Yet something about him excited her and now lying drowsily in this illicit bed but with an awakening sense of excitement and pleasurable fear she thought it might have been his car at least at the start It was a million miles from the machinestamped anonymous vehicles of her fraternity dates with their ventless windows foldup steering wheels and vaguely unpleasant smell of plastic scat covers and windshield solvent Billys car was old dark somehow sinister the windshield was milky around the edges as if a cataract was beginning to form The seats were loose and unanchored Beer bottles clicked and rolled in the back her fraternity dates drank Budweiser Billy and his friends drank Rheingold and she had to place her feet around a huge greaseclotted Craftsman toolkit without a lid The tools inside were of many different makes and she suspected that many of them were stolen The car smelled of oil and gas The sound of straight pipes came loudly and exhilaratingly through the thin floorboards A row of dials slung under the dash registered amps oil pressure and tach whatever that was The back wheels were jacked and the hood seemed to point at the road And of course he drove fast On the third ride home one of the bald front tyres blew at sixty miles an hour the car went into a screaming slide and she shrieked aloud suddenly positive of her own death An image of her broken bloody corpse thrown against the base of a telephone pole like a pile of rags flashed through her mind like a tabloid photograph Billy cursed and whipped the fuzzcovered steering wheel from side to side They came to a stop on the lefthand shoulder and when she got out of the car on knees that threatened to buckle at every step she saw that they had left a looping trail of scorched rubber for seventy feet Billy was already opening the trunk pulling out a jack and muttering to himself Not a hair was out of place He passed her a cigarette already dangling from the corner of his mouth Bring that toolkit babe She was flabbergasted Her mouth opened and closed twice like a beached fish before she could get the words out II will not You almost kyoualmostyou crazy bastard Besides its dirty He turned around and looked at her his eyes flat You bring it or I aint taking you to the fuckin fights tomorrow night I hate the fights She had never been but her anger and outrage required absolutes Her fraternity dates took her to rock concerts which she hated They always ended up next to someone who hadnt bathed in weeks He shrugged went back to the front end and began jacking She brought the toolkit getting grease all over a brandnew sweater He grunted without turning around His teeshirt had pulled out of his jeans and the flesh of his back was smooth tanned alive with muscles It fascinated her and she felt her tongue creep into the corner of her mouth She helped him pull the tyre of the wheel getting her hands black The car rocked alarmingly on the jack and the spare was down to the canvas in two places When the job was finished and she got back in there were heavy smears of grease across both the sweater and the expensive red skirt she was wearing If you think she began as he got behind the wheel He slid across the seat and kissed her his hands moving heavily on her from waist to breasts His breath was redolent of tobacco there was the smell of Brylcreem and sweat She broke it at last and stared down at herself gasping for breath The sweater was blotted with road grease and dirt now Twentysevenfifty in Jordan Marsh and it was beyond anything but the garbage can She was intensely almost painfully excited How are you going to explain that he asked and kissed her again His mouth felt as if he might be grinning Feel me she said in his car Feel me all over Get me dirty He did One nylon split like a gaping mouth Her skirt short to begin with was pushed rudely up to her waist He groped greedily with no finesse at all And something  perhaps that perhaps the sudden brush with death  brought her to a sudden jolting orgasm She had gone to the fights with him Quarter to eight he said and sat up in bed He put on the lamp and began to dress His body still fascinated her She thought of last Monday night and how it had been He had no Tune enough to think of that later maybe when it would do something for her besides cause useless arousal She swung her own legs over the edge of the bed and slid into gossamer panties Maybe its a bad idea she said not sure if she was testing him or herself Maybe we ought to just get back into bed and Its a good idea he said and a shadow of humour crossed his face Pig blood for a pig What Nothing Come on Get dressed She did and when they left by the back stairs she could feel a large excitement blooming like a rapacious and nightflowering vine in her belly From My Name Is Susan Snell p  You know Im not as sorry about all of it as people seem to think I should be Not that they say it right out theyre the ones who always say how dreadfully sorry they are Thats usually just before they ask for my autograph But they expect you to be sorry They expect you to get weepy to wear a lot of black to drink a little too much or take drugs They say things like Oh its such a shame But you know what happened to her and blah blah blah But sorry is the KoolAid of human emotions Its what you say when you spill a cup of coffee or throw a gutterball when youre bowling with the girls in the league True sorrow is as rare as true love Im not sorry that Tommy is dead any more He seems too much like a daydream I once had You probably think thats cruel but theres been a lot of water under the bridge since Prom Night And Im not sorry for my appearance before The White Commission I told the truth  as much of it as I knew But I am sorry for Carrie Theyve forgotten her you know Theyve made her into some kind of a symbol and forgotten that she was a human being as real as you reading this with hopes and dreams and blah blah blah Useless to tell you that I suppose Nothing can change her back now from something made out of newsprint into a person But she was and she hurt More than any of us probably know she hurt And so Im sorry and I hope it was good for her that prom Until the terror began I hope it was good and fine and wonderful and magic  Tommy pulled into the parking lot beside the high schools new wing let the motor idle for just a second and then switched it of Carrie sat on her side of the seat holding her wrap around her bare shoulders It suddenly seemed to her that she was living in a dream of hidden intentions and had just become aware of the fact What could she be doing She had left Momma alone Nervous He asked and she jumped Yes He laughed and got out She was about to open the door when he opened it for her Dont be nervous he mid Youre like Galatea Who Galatea We read about her in Mr Evers class She turned from a drudge into a beautiful woman and nobody even knew her She considered it I want them to know me she said finally I dont blame you Come on George Dawson and Frieda Jason were standing by the Coke machine Frieda was in an orange tulle concoction and looked a little like a tuba Donna Thibodeau was taking tickets at the door along with David Bracken They were both National Honour Society members part of Miss personal Gestapo and they wore white slacks and red blazers  the school colours Tina Blake and Norma Watson were handing out programmes and seating people inside according to their chart Both of them were dressed in black and Carrie supposed they thought they were very chic but to her they looked like cigarette girls in an old gangster movie All of them turned to look at Tommy and Carrie when they came in and for a moment there was a stiff awkward silence Carrie felt a strong urge to wet her lips and controlled it Then George Dawson said Gawd you look queer Ross Tommy smiled When did you come out of the treetops Bomba Dawson lurched forward with his fists up and for a moment Carrie felt stark terror In her keyedup state she came within an ace of picking George up and throwing him across the lobby Then she realized it was an old game often played wellloved The two of them sparred in a growing circle Then George who had been tagged twice in the ribs began to gobble and yell Kill them Congs Get them Gooks Pongee sticks Tiger cages and Tommy collapsed his guard laughing Dont let it bother you Frieda said tilting her letteropener nose and strolling over If they kill each other Ill dance with you They look too stupid to kill Carrie ventured Like dinosaurs And when Frieda grinned she felt something very old and rusty loosen inside her A warmth came with At Relief Ease Whered you buy your dress Frieda asked I love it I made it Made it Friedas eyes opened in unaffected surprise No shit Carrie felt herself blushing furiously Yes I did I  I like to sew I got the material at Johns in Andover The pattern is really quite easy Come on George said to all of them in general Bands gonna start He rolled his eyes and went through a limber satiric buckandwing Vibes vibes vibes Us Gooks love them big Fender viyyybrations When they went in George was doing impressions of Flash Bobby Pickett and mugging Carrie was telling Freida about her dress and Tommy was grinning hands stuffed in his pockets Spoiled the lines of his dinner jacket Sue would be telling him but fuck it it seems to be working So far it was working fine He and George and Frieda had less than two hours to live From The Shadow Exploded p  The White Commissions stand on the trigger of the whole affair  two buckets of pig blood on a beam over the stage  seems to be overly weak and vacillating even in light of the scant concrete proof If one chooses to believe the hearsay evidence of Nolans immediate circle of friends and to be brutally frank they do not seem intelligent enough to lie convincingly then Nolan took this part of the conspiracy entirely out of Christine Hargensens hands and acted on his own initiative  He didnt talk when he drove he liked to drive The operation gave him a feeling of power that nothing could rival not even fucking The road unrolled before them in photographic blacks and whites and the speedometer trembled just past seventy He came from what the social workers called a broken home his father had taken off after the failure of a badly managed gasstation venture when Billy was twelve and his mother had four boyfriends at last count Brucie was in greatest favour right now He was a Seagrams  man She was turning into one ugly bag too But the car the car fed him power and glory from its own mystic lines of force It made him someone to be reckoned with someone with mana It was not by accident that he had done most of his balling in the back seat The car was his slave and his god It gave and it could take away Billy had used it to take away many times On long sleepless nights when his mother and Brucie were fighting Billy made popcorn and went out cruising for stray dogs Some mornings he let the car roll engine dead into the garage he had constructed behind the house with its front bumper dripping She knew his habits well enough by now and did not bother making conversation that would simply be ignored anyway She sat beside him with one leg curled under her gnawing a knuckle The fights of the cars streaking past them on  gleamed softly in her hair streaking it silver He wondered how long she would last Maybe not long after tonight Somehow it had all led to this even the early part and when it was done the glue that had held them together would be thin and might dissolve leaving them to wonder how it could have been in the first place He thought she would start to look less like a goddess and more like the typical society bitch again and that would make him want to belt her around a little Or maybe a lot Rub her nose in it They breasted the Brickyard Hill and there was the high school below them the parking lot filled with plump glistening daddies cars He felt the familiar gorge of disgust and hate rise in his throat Well give them something a night to remember all right We can do that The classroom wings were dark and silent and deserted the lobby was lit with a standard yellow glow and the bank of glass that was the gymnasiums east side glowed with a soft orangey light that was ethereal almost ghostly Again the bitter taste and the urge to throw rocks I see the lights I see the party fights he murmured Huh She turned to him startled out of her own thoughts Nothing He touched the nape of her neck I think Im gonna let you pull the string Billy did it by himself because he knew perfectly well that he could trust nobody else That had been a hard lesson much harder than the ones they taught you in school but he had learned it well The boys who had gone with him to Hentys place the night before had not even known what he wanted the blood for They probably suspected Chris was involved but they could not even be sure of that He drove to the school minutes after Thursday night had become Friday morning and cruised by twice to make sure it was deserted and neither of Chamberlains two police cars was in the area He drove into the parking lot with his lights off and swung around in back of the building Further back the football field glimmered beneath a thin membrane of ground fog He opened the trunk and unlocked the ice chest The blood had frozen solid but that was all right It would have the next twentyfour hours to thaw He put the buckets on the ground then got a number of tools from his kit He stuck them in his back pocket and grabbed a brown bag from the seat Screws clinked inside He worked without hurry with the easeful concentration of one who is unable to conceive of interruption The gym where the dance was to be held was also the school auditorium and the small row of windows looking toward where he had parked opened on the backstage storage area He selected a flat tool with a spatulate end and slid it through the small jointure between the upper and lower panes of one window It was a good tool He had made it himself in the Chamberlain metal shop He wriggled it until the windows slip lock came free He pushed the window up and slid in It was very dark The predominant odour was of old paint from the Dramatic Club canvas flats The gaunt shadows of Band Society music stands and instrument cases stood around like sentinels Mr Downers piano stood in one corner Billy took a small flashlight out of the bag and made his way to the stage and stepped through the red velvet curtains The gym floor with its painted basketball lines and highly varnished surface glimmered at him like an amber lagoon He shone his light on the apron in front of the curtain There in ghostly chalk fines someone had drawn the floor silhouette of the King and Queen thrones which would be placed the following day Then the entire apron would be strewn with paper flowers  why Christ only knew He craned his neck and shone the beam of his light up into the shadows Overhead girders crisscrossed in shadowy lines The girders over the dance floor had been sheathed in crepe paper but the arm directly over the apron hadnt been decorated A short draw curtain obscured the girders up there and they were invisible from the gym Floor The draw curtain also hid a bank of lights that would highlight the gondola mural Billy turned off the flashlight walked to the lefthand edge of the apron and mounted a steelrunged ladder bolted to the wall The contents of his brown bag which he had tucked into his shirt for safety jingled with a strange hollow jolliness in the deserted gymnasium At the top of the ladder was a small platform Now as he faced outward toward the apron the stage flies were to his right the gym itself on his left In the flies the Dramatic Club props were stored some of them dating back to the s A bust of Pallas used in some ancient dramatic version of Poes Me Raven stared at Billy with blind floating eyes from atop a rusting bedspring Straight ahead a steel girder ran out over the apron Lights to be used against the mural were bolted to the bottom of it He stepped out on to it and walked effortlessly without fear over the drop He was humming a popular tune under his breath The beam was inchthick with dust and he left long shuffling tracks Halfway he stopped dropped to his knees and peered down Yea With the help of his light he could make out the chalk lines of the apron directly below He made a soundless whistling bombs away He Xd the precise spot in the dust then beamwalked back to the platform No one would be up here between now and the Ball the lights that shone on the mural and on the apron where the King and Queen would be crowned theyll get crowned an right were controlled from a box backstage Anyone looking up from directly below would be blinded by those same lights His arrangements would be noticed only if someone went up into the flies for something He didnt believe anyone would It was an acceptable risk He opened the brown bag and took out a pair of Playtex rubber gloves put them on and then took out one of two small pulleys he had purchased yesterday He had gotten them at a hardware store in Boxford just to be safe He popped a number of nails into his mouth like cigarettes and got the hammer Still humming around his mouthful of nails he fixed the pulley neatly in the corner above the platform Beside it he fixed a small eyehole screw He went back down the ladder crossed backstage and climbed another ladder not far from where he had come in He was in the loft  sort of a catchall school attic Here there were stacks of old yearbooks motheaten athletic uniforms and ancient textbooks that had been nibbled by mice Looking left he could shine his light over the stage flies and spotlight the pulley he had just put up Turning right cool night air played on his face from a vent in the wall Still humming he took out the second pulley and nailed it up He went back down crawled out the window he had forced and got the two buckets of pig blood He had been about his business for a half hour but it showed no signs of thawing He picked the buckets up and walked back to the window silhouetted in the darkness like a farmer coming back from the first milking He lifted them inside and went in after Beamwalking was easier with a bucket in each hand for balance When he reached his dustmarked X he put the buckets down peered at the chalk marks on the apron once more nodded and walked back to the platform He thought about wiping the buckets on his last trip out to them  Kennys prints would be on them Dons and Steves as well  but it was better not to Maybe they would have a little surprise on Saturday morning The thought made his lips quirk The last item in the bag was a coil of jute twine He walked back out to the buckets and tied the handles of both with running slipknots He threaded the screw then the pulley He threw the uncoiling twine across to the left and then threaded that one He probably would not have been amused to know that in the gloom of the auditorium covered and streaked with decadesold dust grey kitties flying dreamily about his crows nest hair he looked like a hunched halfmad Rube Goldberg intent upon creating the better mousetrap He piled the slack twine on top of a stack of crates within reach of the vent He climbed down for the last time and dusted off his hands The thing was done He looked out the window then wriggled through and thumped to the ground He closed the window reinserted his jimmy and closed the lock as far as he could Then he went back to his car Chris said chances were good that Tommy Ross and the White bitch would be the ones under the buckets she had been doing a little quiet promoting among her friends That would be good if it happened But for Billy any of the others would be all right too He was beginning to think that it would be all right if it was Chris herself He drove away From My Name Is Susan Snell p  Carrie went to see Tommy the day before the prom She was waiting outside one of his classes and he said she looked really wretched as if she thought hed yell at her to stop hanging around and stop bugging him She said she had to be in by eleventhirty at the latest or her momma would be worried She said she wasnt going to spoil his time or anything but it wouldnt be fair to worry her momma Tommy suggested they stop at the Kelly Fruit after and grab a root beer and a burger All the other kids would be going to Westover or Lewiston and they would have the place to themselves Carries face fit up he said She told him that would be fine Just fine This is the girl they keep caning a monster I want you to keep that firmly in mind The girl who could be satisfied with a hamburger and a dime root beer after her only school dance so her momma wouldnt be worried The first thing that struck Carrie when they walked in was Glamour Not glamour but Glamour Beautiful shadows rustled about in chiffon lace silk satin The air was redolent with the odour of flowers the nose was constantly amazed by it Girls in dresses with low backs with scooped bodices showing actual cleavage with Empire waists Long skirts pumps Blinding white dinner jackets cumberbunds black shoes that had been spitshined A few people were on the dance floor not many yet and in the soft revolving gloom they were wraiths without substance She did not really want to see them as her classmates She wanted them to be beautiful strangers Tommys hand was firm on her elbow The murals nice he said Yes she agreed faintly It had taken on a soft nether light under the orange spots the boatman leaning with eternal indolence against his tiller while the sunset blazed around him and the buildings conspired together over urban waters She knew with suddenness and ease that this moment would be with her always within hands reach of memory She doubted if they all sensed it  they had seen the worldbut even George was silent for a minute as they looked and the scone the smell even the sound of the band playing a faintly recognizable movie theme was locked forever in her and she was at peace Her soul knew a moments calm as if it had been uncrumpled and smoothed under an iron V George yelled suddenly and led Frieda out on to the floor He began to do a sarcastic jitterbug to the oldtimey bigband music and someone catcalled over to him George blabbered leered and went into a brief armscrossed Cossack routine that nearly landed him on his butt Carrie smiled George is funny she said Sure he is Hes a good guy There are lots of good people around Want to sit down Yes she said gratefully He went back to the door and returned with Norma Watson whose hair had been pulled into a huge teased explosion for the affair Its on the other SIDE she said and her bright gerbels eyes picked Carrie up and down looking for an exposed strap an eruption of pimples any news to carry back to the door when her errand was done Thats a LOVELY dress Carrie Where did you EVER get it Carrie told her while Norma led them around the dance floor to their table She exuded odours of Avon soap Woolworths perfume and Juicy Fruit gum There were two folding chairs at the table looped and beribboned with the inevitable crepe paper and the table itself was decked with crepe paper in the school colours On top was a candle in a wine bottle a dance programme a tiny gilded pencil and two party favours  gondolas filled with Planters Mixed Nuts I cant get OVER it Norma was saying You look so DIFFERENT She cast an odd furtive look at Carries face and it made her feel nervous Youre positively GLOWING Whats your SECRET Im Don MacLeans secret lover Carrie said Tommy sniggered and quickly smothered it Normas smile slipped a notch and Carrie was amazed by her own wit and audacity Thats what you looked like when the joke was on you As though a bee had stung your rear end Carrie found she liked Norma to look that way It was distinctly unchristian Well I have to get back she said Isnt it EXCITING Tommy Her smile was sympathetic Wouldnt it be exciting if Cold sweat is running down my thighs in rivers Tommy said gravely Norma left with an odd puzzled smile It had not gone the way things were supposed to go Everyone knew how things were supposed to go with Carrie Tommy sniggered again Would you like to dance he asked She didnt know how but wasnt ready to admit to that yet Lets just sit for a minute While he held out her chair she saw the candle and asked Tommy if he would light it He did Their eyes met over its flame He reached out and took her hand And the band played on From The Shadow Exploded pp  Perhaps a complete study of Carries mother will be undertaken someday when the subject of Carrie herself becomes more academic I myself might attempt it if only to gain access to the Brigham family tree It might be extremely interesting to know what odd occurrences one might come across two or three generations back And there is of course the knowledge that Carrie went home on Prom Night Why It is hard to tell just how sane Carries motives were by that time She may have gone for absolution and forgiveness or she may have gone for the express purpose of committing matricide In any event the physical evidence seems to indicate that Margaret White was waiting for her The house was completely silent She was gone At night Gone Margaret White walked slowly from her bedroom into the living room First had come the flow of blood and the filthy fantasies the Devil sent with it Then this hellish Power the Devil had given to her It came at the time of the blood and the time of hair on the body of course Oh she knew about the Power Her own grandmother had it She had been able to light the fireplace without even stirring from her rocker by the window It made her eyes glow with thou shalt not suffer a witch to live a kind of witchs light And sometimes at the supper table the sugar bowl would whirl madly like a dervish Whenever it happened Gram would cackle crazily and drool and make the sign of the Evil Eye all around her Sometimes she panted like a dog on a hot day and when she died of a heart attack at sixtysix senile to the point of idiocy even at that early age Carrie had not even been a year old Margaret had gone into her bedroom not four weeks after Grams funeral and there her girlchild had lain in her crib laughing and gurgling watching a bottle that was dangling in thin air over her head Margaret had almost killed her then Ralph had stopped her She should not have let him stop her Now Margaret White stood in the middle of the living room Christ on Calvary looked down at her with his wounded suffering reproachful eyes The Black Forest cuckoo clock ticked It was ten minutes after eight She had been able to feel actually feel the Devils Power working in Carrie It crawled all over you lifting and pulling like evil tickling little fingers She had set out to do her duty again when Carrie was three when she had caught her looking in sin at the Devils slut in the next yard over Then the stones had come and she had weakened And the power had risen again after thirteen years God was not mocked First the blood then the power you sign your name you sign it in blood now a boy and dancing and he would take her to a roadhouse after take her into the parking lot take her into the back seat take her Blood fresh blood Blood was always at the root of it and only blood could expiate it She was a big woman with massive upper arms that had swarfed her elbows to dimples but her head was surprisingly small on the end of her strong corded neck It had once been a beautiful face It was still beautiful in a weird zealous way But the eyes had taken on a strange wandering cast and the lines had deepened cruelly around the denying but oddly weak mouth Her hair which had been almost all black a year ago was now almost white The only way to kill sin true black sin was to drown it in the blood of she must be sacrificed a repentant heart Surely God understood that and had laid His finger upon her Had not God Himself commanded Abraham to take his son Isaac up upon the mountain She shuffled out into the kitchen in her old and splayed slippers and opened the kitchen utensil drawer The knife they used for carving was long and sharp and arched in the middle from constant honing She sat down on the high stool by the counter found the sliver of whetstone in its small aluminium dish and began to scrub it along the gleaming edge of the blade with the apathetic fixated attention of the damned The Black Forest cuckoo clock ticked and ticked and finally the bird jumped out to call once and announce eightthirty In her mouth she tasted olives THE SENIOR CLASS PRESENTS SPRING BALL  May  Music by The Billy Bosman Band Music by Josie and the Moonglows

Ewen High School Chorus Bridge Over Troubled Waters CHAPERONES Mr Stephens Miss Geer Mr and Mrs Lublin Miss Desjardin Coronation at  PM Remember its YOUR prom make it one to remember always When he asked her the third time Carrie had to admit that she didnt know how to dance She didnt add that now that the rock band had taken over for a halfhour set she would feel out of place gyrating on the floor and sinful yes and sinful Tommy nodded then smiled He leaned forward and told her that he hated to dance Would she like to go around and visit some of the other tables Trepidation rose thickly in her throat but she nodded Yes that would be nice He was seeing to her She must see to him even if he really did not expect it that was part of the deal And she felt dusted over with the enchantment of the evening She was suddenly hopeful that no one would stick out a foot or slyly paste a kickmehard sign on her back or suddenly squirt water in her face from a novelty carnation and retreat cackling while everyone laughed and pointed and catcalled And if there was enchantment it was not divine but pagan Carrie a voice said hesitantly She had been so wrapped up in watching the band and the dance floor and the other tables that she hadnt seen anyone coming at all Tommy had gone to get them punch She turned around and saw Miss Desjardin For a moment the two of them merely looked at each other and the memory travelled between them com she saw me she saw me naked and screaming and bloody without words or thought It was in the eyes Then Carrie said shyly You look very pretty Miss Desjardin She did She was dressed in a glimmering silver sheath a perfect complement to her blonde hair which was up A simple pendant hung around her neck She looked very young young enough to be attending rather than chaperoning Thank you She hesitated then put a gloved hand on Carries arm You are beautiful she said and each word carried a peculiar emphasis Carrie felt herself blushing again and dropped her eyes to the table Its awfully nice of you to say so I know Im not  not really  but thank you anyway Its true Desjardin said Carrie anything that happened before  well its all forgotten I wanted you to know that I cant forget it Carrie said She looked up The words that rose to her lips were I dont blame anyone any more She bit them off It was a lie She blamed them all and always would and she wanted more than anything else to be honest But its over with Now its over with Miss Desjardin smiled and her eyes seemed to catch and hold the soft mix of lights in an almost liquid sparkling She looked across toward the dance floor and Carrie followed her gaze I remember my own prom Desjardin said softly I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown The tailpipe was broken on his car and the engine made  oh an awful racket But it was magic I dont know why But Ive never had a date like it ever again She looked at Carrie Is it like that for you Its very nice Carrie said And is that all No Theres more I couldnt tell it all Not to anybody Desjardin smiled and squeezed her arm Youll never forget it she said Never I think youre right Have a lovely time Carrie Thank you Tommy came up with two Dude cups of punch as Desjardin left walking around the dance floor toward the chaperones table What did she want he asked putting the Dude caps down carefully Carrie looking after her said I think she wanted to say she was sorry momma untie your apron strings im getting big and she wanted it that way Look he said as they got up Two or three stagehands were sliding the King and Queen thrones from the wings while Mr Lavoie the head custodian directed them with hand motions toward preset marks on the apron She thought they looked quite Arthurian those thrones dressed all in blinding white strewn with real flowers as well as huge crepe banners Theyre beautiful she said Youre beautiful Tommy said and she became quite sure that nothing bad could happen this night  perhaps they themselves might even be voted King and Queen of the Prom She smiled at her own folly It was nine oclock Sue Snell sat quietly in the living room of her house hemming a dress and listening to the Jefferson Airplane Long John Silver album It was old and badly scratched but soothing Her mother and father had gone out for the evening They knew what was going on she was sure of that but they had spared her the bumbling talks about how proud they were of Their Girl or how glad they were that she was finally Growing Up She was glad they had decided to leave her alone because she was still uncomfortable about her own motives and afraid to examine them too deeply lest she discover a jewel of selfishness glowing and winking at her from the black velvet of her subconscious She had done it that was enough she was satisfied maybe hell fall in love with her She looked up as if someone had spoken from the hallway a startled smile curving her lips That would be a fairytale ending all right The Prince bends over the Sleeping Beauty touches his lips to hers Sue I dont know how to tell you this but The smile faded Her period was late Almost a week late And she had always been as regular as an almanac The record changer clicked another record dropped down In the sudden brief silence she heard something within her turn over Perhaps only her soul It was ninefifteen Billy drove to the far end of the parking lot and pulled into a stall that faced the asphalt ramp leading to the highway Chris started to get out and he jerked her back His eyes glowed ferally in the dark What she said with angry nervousness They use a PA system to announce the King and Queen he said Then one of the bands will play the school song That means theyre sitting there in those thrones on target I know all that Let go of me Youre hurting He squeezed her wrist tighter still and felt small bones grind It gave him a grim pleasure Still she didnt cry out She was pretty good You listen to me I want you to know what youre getting into Pull the rope when the song is playing Pull it hard There will be a little slack between the pulleys but not much When you pull it and feel those buckets go run You dont stick around to hear the screams or anything else This is out of the cutelittlejoke league This is criminal assault you know They dont fine you They put you in jail and throw the key over their shoulder It was an enormous speech for him Her eyes only glared at him full of defiant anger Dig it Yes All right When thebuckets go Im going to run When I get to the car Im going to drive away If youre there you can come If youre not Ill leave you If I leave you and you spill your guts Ill kill you Do you believe me Yes Take your fucking hand off me He did An unwilling shadowgrin touched his face May Its going to be good They got out of the car It was almost ninethirty Vic Mooney President of the Senior Class was calling jovially into the mike All right ladies and gennelmen Take your seats please Ifs time for the voting Were going to vote for the King and Queen This contest insults women Myra Crewes called with uneasy good nature It insults men too George Dawson called back and there was general laughter Myra was silent She had made her token protest take your seats please Vic was smiling into the mike and blushing furiously fingering a pimple on his chin The huge Venetian boatman behind him looked dreamily over Vics shoulder Time to vote Carrie and Tommy sat down Tina Blake and Norma Watson were circulating mimeographed ballots and when Norma dropped one at their table and breathed Good LUCK Carrie picked up the ballot and studied it Her mouth popped open Tommy were on here Yeah I saw that he said The school votes for single candidates and their dates get sort of shanghaied into it Welcome aboard Shall we decline She bit her lip and looked at him Do you want to decline Hell no he said cheerfully If you win an you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance and wave a sceptre and look like a goddam idiot They take your picture for the yearbook so everyone can see you look like a goddam idiot Who do we vote for She looked doubtfully from the ballot to the tiny pencil by her boatful of nuts Theyre more your crowd than mine A chuckle escaped her In fact I dont really have a crowd He shrugged Lets vote for ourselves To the devil with false modesty She laughed out loud then clapped a hand over her mouth The sound was almost entirely foreign to her Before she could think she circled their names third from the top The tiny pencil broke in her hand and she gasped A splinter had scratched the pad of one finger and a small bead of blood welled You hurt yourself No She smiled but suddenly it was difficult to smile The sight of the blood was distasteful to her She blotted it away with her napkin But I broke the pencil and it was a souvenir Stupid me Theres your boat he said and pushed it toward her Toot toot Her throat closed and she felt sure she would weep and then be ashamed She did not but her eyes glimmered like prisms and she lowered her head so he would not see The band was playing catchy fillin music while the Honour Society ushers collected the foldedover ballots They were taken to the chaperones table by the door where Vic and Mr Stephens and the Lublins counted them Miss Geer surveyed it all with grim gimlet eyes Carrie felt an unwilling tension worm into her tightening muscles in her stomach and back She held Tommys hand tightly It was absurd of course No one was going to vote for them The stallion perhaps but not when harnessed in tandem with a sheox It would be Frank and Jessica or maybe Don Farnham and Helen Shyres Or hell Two piles were growing larger than the others Mr Stephens finished dividing the slips and all four of them took turns at counting the large piles which looked about the same They put their heads together conferred and counted once more Mr Stephens nodded thumbed the ballots once more like a man about to deal a hand of poker and gave them back to Vic He climbed back on stage and approached the mike The Billy Bosman Band played a flourish Vic smiled nervously harrumphed into the mike and blinked at the sudden feedback whine He nearly dropped the ballots to the floor which was covered with heavy electrical cables and somebody snickered Weve sort of hit a snag Vic said artlessly Mr Lublin says this is the first time in the history of the Spring Ball How far does he go back someone behind Tommy mumbled Eighteen hundred Weve got a tie This got a murmer from the crowd Polka dots or striped George Dawson called and there was some laughter Vic gave a twitchy smile and almost dropped the ballots again Sixtythree votes for Frank Grier and Jessica MacLean and sixtythree votes for Thomas Ross and Carrie White This was followed by a moment of silence and then sudden swelling applause Tommy looked across at his date Her head was lowered as if in shame but he had a sudden feeling carrie carrie carrie not unlike the one he had had when he asked her to the prom His mind felt as if something alien was moving in there calling Carries name over and over again As if Attention Vic was calling If I could have your attention please The applause quieted Were going to have a runoff ballot When the people passing out the slips of paper get to you please write the couple you favour on it He left the mike looking relieved The ballots were circulated they had been hastily torn from leftover prom programmes The band played unnoticed and people talked excitedly They werent applauding for us Carrie said looking up The thing he had felt or thought he had felt was gone It couldnt have been for us Maybe it was for you She looked at him mute Whats taking it so long she hissed at him I beard them clap Maybe that was it If you fucked up The length of jute cord hung between them limply untouched since Billy had poked a screwdriver through the vent and lifted it out Dont worry he said calmly Theyll play the school song They always do But Shut up You talk too fucking much The tip of his cigarette winked peacefully in the dark She shut But oh when this is over youre going to get it buddy maybe youll go to bed with lovers nuts tonight her mind ran furiously over his words storing them People did not speak to her in such a manner Her father was a lawyer It was seven minutes to ten He was holding the broken pencil in his hand ready to write when she touched his wrist lightly tentatively Dont   What Dont vote for us she said finally He raised his eyebrows quizzically Why not In for a penny in for a pound Thats what my mother always says mother A picture rose in her mind instantly her mother droning endless prayers to a towering faceless columnar God who prowled roadhouse parking lots with a sword of fire in one hand Terror rose in her blackly and she had to fight with all her spirit to hold it back She could not explain her dread her sense of premonition She could only smile helplessly and repeat Dont Please The Honour Society ushers were coming back collecting folded slips He hesitated a moment longer then suddenly scrawled Tommy and Carrie on the ragged slip of paper For you he said Tonight you go firstclass She could not reply for the premonition was on her her mothers face The knife slipped from the whetstone and in an instant it had sliced the cup of her palm below the thumb She looked at the cut It bled slowly thickly from the open lips of the wound running out of her hand and spotting the worn linoleum of the kitchen floor Good then It was good The blade had tasted flesh and let blood She did not bandage it but tipped the flow over the cutting edge letting the blood dull the blades edge then she began to sharpen again heedless of the droplets which splattered her dress If thine right eye offend thee pluck it out If it was a hard scripture it was also sweet and good A fitting scripture for those who lurked in the doorway shadows of onenight hotels and in the weeds behind bowling alleys Pluck it out oh and the nasty music they play Pluck it the girls show their underwear how it sweats how it sweats blood out The Black Forest cuckoo began to strike ten and cut her guts out on the floor if thine right eye offend thee pluck it out The dress was done and she could not watch the television or take out her books or call Nancy on the phone There was nothing to do but sit on the sofa facing the blackness of the kitchen window and feel some nameless sort of fear growing in her like an infant coming to dreadful term With a sigh she began to massage her arms absently They were cold and prickly It was twelve after ten and there was no reason really no reason to feel that the world was coming to an end The stacks were higher this time but they still looked exactly the same Again three counts were taken to make sure Then Vic Mooney went to the mike again He paused a moment relishing the blue feel of tension in the air and then announced simply Tommy and Carrie win By one vote Dead silence for a moment then applause filled the hall again some of it not without satiric overtones Carrie drew in a startled smothered gasp and Tommy again felt but for only a second that weird vertigo in his mind carrie carrie carrie carrie that seemed to blank out all thought but the name and image of this strange girl he was with For a fleeting second he was literally scared shitless Something fell on the floor with a clink and at the same instant the candle between them whiffed out Then Josie and the Moonglows were playing a rock version of Pomp and Circumstance the ushers appeared at their table almost magically all this had been rehearsed meticulously by Miss Geer who according to rumour ate slow and clumsy ushers for lunch a sceptre wrapped in aluminium foil was thrust into Tommys hand a robe with a lush dogfur collar was thrown over Carries shoulders and they were being led down the centre aisle by a boy and a girl in white blazers The band blared The audience applauded Miss Geer looked vindicated Tommy Ross was grinning bemusedly They were ushered up the steps to the apron led across to the thrones and seated Still the applause swelled The sarcasm in it was lost now it was honest and deep a little frightening Carrie was glad to sit down It was all happening too fast Her legs were trembling under her and suddenly even with the comparatively high neck of her gown her breasts dirtypillows felt dreadfully exposed The sound of the applause in her ears made her feel woozy almost punchdrunk Part of her was actually convinced that all this was a dream from which she would wake with mixed feeling of loss and relief Vic boomed into the mike The King and Queen of the  Spring Ball  Tommy ROSS and Carrie WHITE Still applause swelling and booming and crackling Tommy Ross in the fading moments of his life now took Carries hand and grinned at her thinking that Suzies intuition had been very right Somehow she grinned back TOMMY she was right and i love her well i love this one too this carrie she is beautiful and its right and i love all of them the light the light in her eyes and Carrie cant see them the lights are too bright i can hear them but cant see them the shower remember the shower o momma its too high i think i want to get down o are they laughing and ready to throw things to point and scream with laughter i cant see them i cant see them its all too bright and the beam above them Both bands in a sudden and serendipitous coalition of rock and brass swung into the school song The audience rose to its feet and began to sing still applauding It was tenoseven Billy had just flexed his knees to make the Joints pop Chris Hargensen stood next to him with increasing aura of nervousness Her hands played aimlessly along the seams of the jeans she had worn and she was biting the softness of her lower lip chewing at it making it a little ragged You think theyll vote for them Billy said softly They will she said I set it up it wont even be close Why do they keep applauding Whats going on in there Dont ask me babe The school song suddenly roared out full and strong on the soft May air and Chris jumped as if stung A soft gasp of surprise escaped her All rise for Thomas Ewen Hiiiiyyygh  Go on he said Theyre there His eyes glowed softly in the dark The odd halfgrin had touched his features She licked her lips They both stared at the length of jute cord We will raise your banners to the skyyyyy Shut up she whispered She was trembling and he thought that her body had never looked so lush or exciting When this was over he was going to have her until every other time shed been had was like two pumps with a fags little finger He was going on her like a raw cob through butter No guts babe He leaned forward I wont pull it for you babe It can sit there till bell freezes With pride we wear the red and whiiyyyte A sudden smothered sound that might have been a scream came from her mouth and she leaned forward and pulled violently on the cord with both hands It came loose with slack for a moment making her think that Billy had been having her on all this time that the rope was attached to nothing but thin air Then it snubbed tight held for a second and then came through her palm harshly leaving a thin burn she began The music inside came to a jangling discordant halt For a moment ragged You continued oblivious and then they stopped Then was a beat of silence and then someone screamed Silence again They stared at each other in the dark frozen by the actual act as thought never could have done Her very breath turned to glass in her throat Then inside the laughter began It was ten twentyfive and the feeling had been getting worse and worse Sue stood in front of the gas range on one foot waiting for the milk to begin steaming so she could dump in the Nestles Twice she had begun to go upstairs and put on a nightgown and twice she had stopped drawn for no reason at all to the kitchen window that looked down Brickyard Hill and the spiral of Route  that led into town Now as the whistle mounted atop the town hall on Main Street suddenly began to shriek into the night and falling in cycles of panic she did not evert immediately to the window but only tamed the heat oft under the milk so it would not burn The town hall whistle went off every day at twelve noon and that was all except to call the volunteer fire department during grassfire season in August and September It was strictly for major disasters and its sound was dreamy and terrifying in the empty house She went to the window but slowly The shrieking of the whistle rose and fell rose and fell Somewhere horns were beginning to blast as if for a wedding She could see her reflection in the darkened glass lips parted eyes wide and then the condensation of her breath obscured it A memory halfforgotten came to her As children in grammar school they had practised airraid drills When the teacher clapped her hands and said The town whistle is blowing you were supposed to crawl under your desk and put your hands over your head and wait either for the allclear or for enemy missiles to blow you to powder Now in her mind as clearly as a leaf pressed in plastic the town whistle is blowing she heard the words clang in her mind Far below to the left where the high school parking lot was  the ring of sodium are lamps made it a sure landmark although the school building itself was invisible in the dark a spark glowed as if God has struck a flintandsteel thats whew the oil tanks are The spark hesitated then bloomed orange Now you could see the school and it was on fire She was already on her way to the closet to get her coat when the first dull booming explosion shook the floor under her feet and made her mothers china rattle in the cupboards From We Survived the Black Prom by Norma Watson Published in the August  issue of The Readers Digest as a Drama in Real Life article  and it happened so quickly that no one really knew what was happening We were all standing and applauding and singing the school song Then  I was at the ushers table just inside the main doors looking at the stage  there was a sparkle as the big lights over the stage apron reflected on something metallic I was standing with Tina Blake and Stella Horan and I think they saw it too All at once there was a huge red splash in the air Some of it hit the mural and ran in long drips I knew right away even before it hit them that it was blood Stella Horan thought it was paint but I had a premonition just like the time my brother got hit by a hay truck They were drenched Carrie got it the worst She looked exactly like she had been dipped in a bucket of red paint She just sat there She never moved The band that was closest to the stage Josie and the moonglows got splattered The lead guitarist had a white instrument and it splattered all over it I say My God thats blood When I said that Tina screamed It was very loud and it rang out clearly in the auditorium People had stopped singing and everything was completely quiet I couldnt move I was rooted to the spot I looked up and there were two buckets dangling high over the thrones swinging and banging together They were still dripping All of a sudden they fell with a lot of loose string paying out behind them One of them hit Tommy Ross on the head It made a very loud noise like a gong That made someone laugh I dont know who it was but it wasnt the way a person laughs when they we something funny and gay It was raw and hysterical and awful At the same instant Carrie opened her eyes wide That was when they all started laughing I did too God help me It was so  weird When I was a little girl I had a Walt Disney storybook called Song of the South and it had that Uncle Remus story about the tarbaby in it There was a picture of the tarbaby sitting in the middle of the road looking like one of those oldtime Negro minstrels with the blackface and great white eyes When Carrie opened her eyes it was like that They were the only part of her that wasnt completely red And the light had gotten in them and made them glassy God help me but she looked for all the world like Eddie Cantor doing that popeyed act of his That was what made people laugh We couldnt help it It was one of those things where you laugh or go crazy Carrie had been the butt of every joke for so long and we all felt that we were part of something special that night It was as if we were watching a person rejoin the human race and I for one thanked the Lord for it And that happened That horror And so there was nothing else to do It was either laugh or cry and who could bring himself to cry over Carrie after all those years She just sat there staring out at them and the laughter kept swelling getting louder and louder People were holding their bellies and doubling up and pointing at her Tommy was the only one who wasnt looking at her He was sort of slumped over in his seat as if lied gone to sleep You couldnt tell he was hurt though he was splashed too bad And then her face  broke I dont know how else to describe it She put her hands up to her face and halfstaggered to her feet She almost got tangled in her own feet and fell over and that made people laugh even more Then she sort of  hopped off the stage It was like watching a big red frog hopping off a lily pad She almost fell again but kept on her feet Miss Desjardin came running over to her and she wasnt laughing any more She was holding out her arms to her But then she veered off and hit the wall beside the stage  It was the strangest thing She didnt stumble or anything It was as if someone had pushed her but there was no one there Carrie ran through the crowd with her hands clutching her face and somebody put his foot out I dont know who it was but she went sprawling on her face leaving a long red streak on the floor And she said Ooof I remember that It made me laugh even harder hearing Carrie say Oof like that She started to crawl along the floor and then she got up and ran out She ran right past me You could smell the blood It smelled like something sick and rotted She went down the stairs two at a time and then out the doors And was gone The laughter just sort of faded off a little at a time Some people were still hitching and snorting Lennie Brock had taken out a big white handkerchief and was wiping his eyes Sally McManus looked all white like she was going to throw up but she was still giggling and she couldnt seem to stop Billy Bosnan was just standing there with his little conductors stick in his hand and shaking his head Mr Lublin was sitting by Miss Desjardin and calling for a Kleenex She had a bloody nose You have to understand that all this happened in no more than two minutes Nobody could put it all together We were stunned Some of them were wandering around talking a little but not much Helen Shyres burst into tears and that made some of the others start up Then someone yelled Call a doctor Hey call a doctor quick It was Josie Vreck He was up on the stage kneeling by Tommy Ross and his face was white as paper He tried to pick him up and the throne fell over and Tommy rolled on to the floor Nobody moved They were all just staring I felt like I was frozen in ice My God was all I could think My God my God my God And then this other thought crept in and it was as if it wasnt my own at all I was thinking about Carrie And about God It was all twisted up together and it was awful Stella looked over at me and said Carries back And I said Yea thats right The lobby doors all slammed shut The sound was like hands clapping Somebody in the back screamed and that started the stampede They ran for the doors in a rush I just stood there not believing it And when I looked just before the first of them got there and started to push I saw Carrie looking in her face all smeared like an Indian with war paint on She was smiling They were pushing at the doors hammering on them but they wouldnt budge As more of them crowded up to them I could see the first ones to get there being battered against them grunting and wheezing They wouldnt open and those doors are never locked Its a state law Mr Stephens and Mr Lublin waded in and began to pull them away grabbing jackets shorts anything They were all screaming and burrowing like cattle Mr Stephens slapped a couple of girls and punched Vic Mooney in the eye They were yelling for them to go out the back fire doors Some did Those were the ones who lived Thats when it started to rain  at least thats what I thought it was at first There was water falling all over the place I looked up and all the sprinklers were on all over the gym Water was hitting the basketball court and splashing Josie Vreck was yelling for the guys in his band to turn off the electric amps and mikes quick but they were all gone He jumped down from the stage The panic at the doors stopped People backed away looking up at the ceiling I heard somebody  Don Farnham I thinksay This is gonna wreck the basketball court A few other people started to go over and look at Tommy Ross All at once I knew I wanted to get out of there I took Tina Blakes hand and said Lets run Quick To get to the fire doors you had to go down a short corridor to the left of the stage There were sprinklers there too but they werent on And the doors were open  I could see a few people running out But most of them were just standing around in little groups blinking at each other Some of them were looking at the smear of blood where Carrie fell down the water was washing it away I took Tinas hand and started to pull her toward the EXIT sign At that same instant there was a huge flash of fight a scream and a horrible feedback whine I looked around and saw Josie Vreck holding on to one of the mike stands He couldnt let go His eyes were bugging out and his hair was on end and it looked like he was dancing His feet were sliding around in the water and smoke started to come out of his shirt He fell over on one of the amps  they were big ones five or six feet high  and it fell into the water The feedback went up to a scream that was headsplitting and then there was another sizzling flash and it stopped Josies shirt was on fire Run Tina yelled at me Come on Norma Please We ran out into the hallway and something exploded backstage  the main power switches I guess For just a second I looked back You could see right out on to the stage where Tommys body was because the curtain was up All the heavy light cables were in the air flowing and jerking and writhing like snakes out of an Indian fakirs basket Then one of them pulled in two There was a violent flash when it hit the water and then everybody was screaming at once Then we were out the door and running across the parking lot I think I was screaming I dont remember very well I dont remember anything very well after they started screaming After those highvoltage cables hit that watercovered floor  For Tommy Ross age eighteen the end came swiftly and mercifully and almost without pain He was never even aware that something of importance was happening There was a clanging clashing noise that he associated momentarily with there go the milk buckets a childhood memory of his Uncle Galens farm and then with somebody dropped something the band below him He caught a glimpse of Josie Vreck looking over his head what have i got a halo or something and then the quarterfull bucket of blood struck him The raised lip along the bottom of the rim struck him on top of the head and hey that hurt he went swiftly down into unconsciousness He was still sprawled on the stage when the fire originating in the electrical equipment of Josie and the Moonglows spread to the mural of the Venetian boatman and then to the rat warren of old uniforms books and papers backstage and overhead He was dead when the oil tank exploded a half hour later From the New England AP ticker  PM

mothers car from the pegboard beside the refrigerator and ran to the garage The kitchen clock read exactly  She flooded the car on her first try and forced herself to wait before trying again This time the motor coughed and caught and she roared out of the garage heedlessly dinging one fender She turned around and the rear wheels splurted gravel Her mothers  Plymouth swerved on to the road almost fishtailing on to the shoulder and making her feel sick to her stomach It was only at this point that she realized she was moaning deep in her throat like an animal in a trap She did not pause at the stop sign that marked the intersection of Route  and the Back Chamberlain Road Fire sirens filled the night in the cast where Chamberlain bordered Westover and from the south behind herMotton She was almost at the base of the hill when the school exploded She jammed on the power brakes with both feet and was thrown into the steering wheel like a rag doll The tyres wailed on the pavement Somehow she fumbled the door open and was out shading her eyes against the glare A gout of flame had ripped skyward trailing a nimbus of fluttering steel roof panels wood and paper The smell was thick and oily Main Street was lit as if by a flashgun In that terrible hallway between seconds she saw that the entire gymnasium wing of Ewen High was a gutted flaming ruin Concussion struck a moment later knocking her backwards Road litter blew past her on a sudden and tremendous rush along with a blast of warm air that reminded her fleetingly of the smell of subways a trip she had taken to Boston the year before The windows of Bills Home Drugstore and the Kelly Fruit Company jingled and fell inward She had fallen on her side and the fire lit the street with hellish noonday What happened next happened in slow motion as her mind ran steadily onward dead are they all dead carrie why think carrie at its own clip Cars were rushing toward the scene and some people were running in robes nightshorts pyjamas She saw a man come out of the front door of Chamberlains combined police station and courthouse He was moving slowly The cars were moving slowly Even the people running were moving slowly She saw the man on the policestation steps cup his hands around his mouth and scream something unclear over the shrieking town whistle the fire sirens the monstermouth of fire Sounded like Heyret Dont hey that ass The street was all wet down there The light danced on the water Down by Teddys Amoco station hey thats And then the world exploded From the sworn testimony of Thomas K Quillan taken before The State Investigatory Board of Maine in connection with the events of May  in Chamberlain Maine abridged version which follows is from Black Prom The White Commission Report Signet

trying to get the blood off and thinking shed never get it off and how she was going to pour blood on the whole town and make them pay It was awful stuff Q How would you have any idea what she was thinking A I dont know I cant explain Q For the remainder of your testimony I wish you would stick to what you saw Mr Quillan A Okay There was a hydrant on the corner of Grass Plaza and that one went too I could see that one better The big lug nuts on the sides were unscrewing themselves I saw that happening It blew just like the other one And she was happy She was saying to herself thatll give em a shower thatll  whoops sorry The fire trucks started to go by then and I lost track of her The new pumper pulled up to the school and they started on those hydrants and saw they wasnt going to get no water Chief Burton was hollering at them and thats when the school exploded Jesus Q Did you leave the police station A Yeah I wanted to find Plessy and tell him about that crazy broad and the fire hydrants I glanced over at Teddys Amoco and I seen something that made my blood run cold All six gas pumps was off their hooks Teddy Duchamps been dead since  God love him but his boy locked those pumps up every night just like Teddy himself used to do Every one of them Yale padlocks was hanging busted by their hasps The nozzles were laying on the tarmac and the automatic feeds was set on every one Gas was pouring out on to the sidewalk and into the street Holy mother of God when I seen that my balls drew right up Then I saw this gay running along with a lighted cigarette Q What did you do A Hollered at him Something like Hey Watch that cigarette Hey dont thats gas He never heard me Fire wrens and the town whistle and cars ripassing up and down the street I dont wonder I saw he was going to pitch it so I started to duck back inside Q What happened next A Next Why next thing the Devil came to Chamberlain  When the buckets fell she was at first only aware of a loud metallic clang cutting through the music and then she was deluged in warmth and wetness She closed her eyes instinctively There was a grunt from beside her and in the part of her mind that had come so recently awake she sensed brief pain tommy The music came to a crashing discordant halt a few voices hanging on after it like broken strings and in the sudden deadness of anticipation filling the gap between event and realization like doom she beard someone say quite clearly My God thats blood A moment later as if to ram the truth of it home to make it utterly and exactly clear someone screamed Carrie sat with her eyes closed and felt the black bulge of terror rising in her mind Momma had been right after all They had taken her again gulled her again made her the butt again The horror of it should have been monotonous but it was not they had gotten her up here up here in front of the whole school and had repeated the showerroom scene  only the voice had said my god thats blood something too awful to be contemplated If she opened her eyes and it was true oh what then What then Someone began to laugh a solitary affrightened hyena sound and she did open her eyes opened them to see who it was and it was true the final nightmare she was red and dripping with it they had drenched her in the very secretness of blood in front of all of them and her thought ohi  COVERED with it was coloured a ghastly purple with her revulsion and her shame She could smell herself and it was the stink of blood the awful wet coppery smell In a flickering kaleidoscope of images she saw the blood running thickly down her naked thighs hear the constant beating of the shower on the tiles felt the soft patter of tampons and napkins against her skin as voices exhorted her to plug it UP tasted the plump fulsome bitterness of horror They had finally given her the shower they wanted A second voice joined the first and was followed by a third  girls soprano giggle  a fourth a fifth six a dozen all of them all laughing Vic Mooney was laughing She could see him His face was utterly frozen shocked but that laughter issued forth just the same She sat quite still letting the noise wash over her like surf They were still all beautiful and there was still enchantment and wonder but she had crossed a line and now the fairy tale was green with corruption and evil In this one she would bite a poison apple be attacked by trolls be eaten by tigers They were laughing at her again And suddenly it broke The horrible realization of how badly she had been cheated came over her and a horrible soundless cry theyre LOOKING at me tried to come out of her She put her hands over her face to hide it and staggered out of the chair Her only thought was to run to get out of the light to let the darkness have her and hide her But it was like trying to run through molasses Her traitor mind had slowed time to a crawl it was as if God had switched the whole scene from  rpm to   Even the laughter seemed to have deepened and slowed to a sinister bass rumble Her feet tangled in each other and she almost fell of the edge of the stage She recovered herself bent down and hopped down to the floor The grinding laughter swelled louder It was like rocks rubbing together She wanted not to see but she did see the lights were too bright and she could see all their faces Their mouths their teeth their eyes She could see her own gorestreaked hands in front of her face Miss Desjardin was running toward her and Miss Desjardins face was filled with lying compassion Carrie could we beneath the surface to where the real Miss Geer was giggling and chuckling with rancid oldmaid ribaldry Miss Desjardins mouth opened and her voice issued forth horrible and slow and deep Let me help you dear Oh I am so sor She struck out at her flex and Miss Desjardin went flying to rattle off the wall at the side of the stage and fall into a heap Carrie ran She ran through the middle of them Her hands were to her face but she could see through the prison of her fingers could see them how they were beautiful wrapped in light swathed in the bright angelic robes of Acceptance The shined shoes the clear faces the careful beautyparlour hairdos the glittery gowns They stepped back from her as if she was plague but they kept laughing then a foot was stuck slyly out o yes that comes next o yes and she fell over on her hands and knew and began to crawl to crawl along the floor with her bloodclotted hair hanging in her face crawling like St Paul on the Damascus Road whose eyes had been blinded by the light Next someone would kick her ass But no one did and then she was scrabbling to her feet again Things began to speed up She was out through the door out into the lobby then flying down the stairs that she and Tommy had swept up so grandly two hours ago tommys dead full price paid full price for bringing a plague into the place of light She went down them in great awkward leaps with the sound of the laughter flapping around her like black birds Then darkness She fled across the schools wide front lawn losing both of her prom slippers and fleeing barefoot The closely cut school lawn was like velvet lightly dusted with dewfall and the laughter was behind her She began to calm slightly Then her feet did tangle and she fell at full length out by the flagpole She lay quiescent breathing raggedly her hot face buried in the cool grass The tears of shame began to flow as hot and as heavy as that first flow of menstrual blood had been They had beaten her bested her once and for all time It was over She would pick herself up very soon now and sneak home by the back streets keeping to the shadows in case someone came looking for her find Momma admit she had been wrong  NO  The steel in her and there was a great deal of it suddenly rose up and cried the word out strongly The closet The endless wandering prayers The tracts and the cross and only the mechanical bird in the Black Forest cuckoo clock to mark off the rest of the hours and days and years and decades of her life Suddenly as if a videotape machine had been turned on in her mind she saw Miss Desjardin running toward her and saw her thrown out of her way like a rag doll as she used her mind on her without even consciously thinking of it She rolled over on her back eyes staring wildly at the stars from her painted face She was forgetting  THE POWER  It was time to teach them a lesson Time to show them a thing or two She giggled hysterically It was one of Mommas pet phrases momma coming home putting her purse down eyeglasses flashing well i guess i showed that elt a thing or two at the shop today There was the sprinkler system She could turn it on turn it on easily She giggled again and got up began to walk barefoot back toward the lobby doors Turn on the sprinkler system and close all the doors Look in and let them see her looking in watching and laughing while the shower ruined their dresses and their hairdos and took the shine off their shoes Her only regret was that it couldnt be blood The lobby was empty She paused halfway up the stairs and FLEX the doors all slammed shut under the concentrated force she directed at them the pneumatic doorclosers snapping of She heard some of them scream and it was music sweet soul music For a moment nothing changed and then she could feel them pushing against the doors wanting them to open The pressure was negligible They were trapped trapped and the word echoed intoxicatingly in her mind They were under her thumb in her power Power What a word that was She went the rest of the way up and looked in and George Dawson was smashed up against the glass struggling pushing his face distorted with effort There were others behind him and they all looked like fish in an aquarium She glanced up and yes there were the sprinkler pipes with their tiny nozzles like metal daisies The pipes went through small holes in the green cinderblock wall There were a great many inside she remembered Fire laws or something Fire laws In a flash her mind recalled black thick cords like snakes the power cords strung all over the stage They were out of the audiences sight hidden by the footlights but she had had to step carefully over them to get to the throne Tommy had been holding her arm fire and water She reached up with her mind felt the pipes traced them Cold full of water She tasted iron in her mouth cold wet metal the taste of water drank from the nozzle of a garden hose Flex For a moment nothing happened Then they began to back away from the doors looking around She walked to the small oblong of glass in the middle door and looked inside It was raining in the gym Carrie began to smile She hadnt gotten all of them only some But she found that by looking up at the sprinkler system with her eyes she could trace its course more easily with her mind She began to turn on more of the nozzles and more Yet it wasnt enough They werent crying yet so it wasnt enough hurt them then hurt them There was a boy up on the stage by Tommy gesturing wildly and shouting something As she watched he climbed down and ran toward the rock bands equipment He caught hold one of the microphone stands and was transfixed Carrie watched amazed as his body went through a nearly motionless dance of electricity His feet shuffled in the water his hair stood up in spikes and his mouth jerked open like the mouth of a fish He looked funny She began to laugh by christ then let them all look funny And in a sudden blind thrust she yanked at all the power she could feel Some of the fights puffed out There was a dazzling flash somewhere as a live power cord hit a puddle of water There were dull thumps in her mind as circuit breakers went into hopeless operation The boy who had been holding the mike stand fell over on one of his amps and there was an explosion of purple sparks and then the crepe bunting that faced the stage was burning Just below the thrones a live volt electricity cable was crackling on the floor and beside it Rhonda Simard was doing a crazed puppet dance in her green tulle formal Its full skirt suddenly blazed into flame and she fell forward still jerking It might have been at that moment that Carrie went over the edge She leaned against the doors her heart pumping wildly yet her body as cold as ice cubes Her face was livid but dull red fever spots stood on each cheek Her head throbbed thickly and conscious thought was lost She reeled away from the doors still holding them shut doing it without thought or plan Inside the fire was brightening and she realized dimly that the mural must have caught on fire She collapsed on the top step and put her head down on her knees trying to slow her breathing They were trying to get out the doors again but she held them shut easilythat alone was no strain Some obscure sense told her that a few were getting out the fire doors but let them She would get them later She would get all of them Every last one She went down the stairs slowly and out the front doors still holding the gymnasium doors closed It was easy All you had to do was see them in your mind The town whistle went off suddenly making her scream and put her hands in front of her face the whistle its just the fire whistle for a moment Her minds eye lost sight of the gymnasium doors and some of them almost got out No no Naughty She slammed them shut again catching somebodys fingersit felt like Dale Norbert in the jamb and severing one of them She began to reel across the lawn again a scarecrow fig with bulging eyes toward Main Street On her right was dowtown  the department store the Kelly Fruit the beauty parlour and barbershop gas stations police station fire station theyll put out my fire But they wouldnt She began to giggle and it was an insane sound triumphant lost victorious terrified She came to the first hydrant and tried to twist the huge painted lug nut on the side ohuh It was heavy It was very heavy Metal twisted fight to balk here Didnt matter She twisted harder and felt it give Then the other side Then the top Then she twisted all three at once standing back and they unscrewed in a flash Water exploded outward and upward one of the lug nuts flying five feet in front of her at suicidal speed It hit the street caromed high into the air and was gone Water gushed with white pressure in a cruciform pattern Smiling staggering her heart beating at over two hundred per minute she began to to walk down toward Grass Plaza She was unaware that she was scrubbing her bloodied hands against her dress like Lady Macbeth or that she was weeping even as she laughed or that one hidden part of her mind was keening over her final and utter ruin Bemuse she was going to take them with her and there was going to be a great burning until the land was full of its stink She opened the hydrant at Grass Plaza and then began to walk down to Teddys Amoco It happened to be the first gas station she came to but it was not the last From the sworn testimony of Sheriff Otis Doyle taken before The State Investigatory Board of Maine from The White Commission Report pp  Q Sheriff where were you on the night of May twentyseventh A I was on Route  known as Old Bentown Road investigating an automobile accident This was actually over the Chamberlain town line and into Durham but I was assisting Mel Crager who is the Durham constable Q When were you first informed that trouble had broken out at Ewen High School A I received a radio transmission from Officer Jacob Plessy at  Q What was the nature of the radio call A Officer Plessy said there was trouble at the school but he didnt know if it was serious or not There was a lot of shouting going on he said and someone had pulled a couple of fire alarms he said He was going over to try and determine the nature of the trouble Q Did he say the school was on fire A No sir Q Did you ask him to report back to you A I did Q Did Officer Plessy report back A No He was killed in the subsequent explosion of Teddys Amoco gas station on the corner of Main and Summer Q When did you next have a radio communication concerning Chamberlain A At  I was at that time returning to Chamberlain with a suspect in the back of my car  a drunk driver As I have said the case was actually in Mel Cragers town but Durham has no jail When I got him to Chamberlain we didnt have much of one either Q What communication did you receive at  A I got a call from the State police that had been relayed from the Motton Fire Department The State Police dispatcher said there was a fire and an apparent riot at Ewen High School and a probable explosion No one was sure of anything at that time Remember it all happened in a space of forty minutes Q We understand that Sheriff What happened then A I drove back to Chamberlain with siren and flasher I was trying to raise Jake Plessy and not having any luck Thats when Tom Quillan came on and started to babble about the whole town going up in flames and no water Q Do you know what time that was A Yes sir I was keeping a record by then It was  Q Quillan claims the Amoco station exploded at  A Id take the average sir Call it  Q At what time did you arrive in Chamberlain A At   PM Q What was your immediate impression upon arriving Sheriff Doyle A I was stunned I couldnt believe what I was seeing Q What exactly were you seeing A The entire upper half of the towns business section was burning The Amoco station was gone Woolworths was nothing but a blazing frame The fire had spread to three wooden store fronts next to that  Duffys Bar and Grille The Kelly Fruit Company and the billiard parlour The heat was ferocious Sparks were flying on to the roofs of The Maitland Real Estate Agency and Doug Branns Western Auto Store Fire trucks were coming in but they could do very little Every fire hydrant on that side of the street was stripped The only tracks doing any business at all were two old volunteer fire department pumpers from Westover and about all they could do was wet the roofs of the surrounding buildings And of course the high school It was just  gone Of course its fairly isolatednothing close enough to it to burn  but my God all those kids inside  all those kids  Q Did you meet Susan Snell upon entering town A Yes sir She flagged me down Q What time was this A Just as I entered   no later Q What did she say A She was distraught Shed been in a minor car accident  skidding  and she was barely making sense She asked me if Tommy was dead I asked her who Tommy was but she didnt answer She asked me if we had caught Carrie yet Q The Commission is extremely interested in this part of your testimony Sheriff Doyle A Yes sir I know that Q How did you respond to her question A Well theres only one Carrie in town as far as I know and thats Margaret Whites daughter I asked her if Carrie had something to do with the fires Miss Snell told me Carrie had done it Those were her words Carrie did it Carrie did it She said it twice Q Did she say anything else A Yes sir She said Theyve hurt Carrie for the last time Q Sheriff are you sure she didnt say Weve hurt Carrie for the last time A I am quite sure Q Are you positive One hundred per cent A Sir the town was burning around our heads I Q Had she been drinking A I beg pardon Q Had she been drinking You said she had been involved in a car smash A I believe I said a minor skidding accident Q And you cant be sure she didnt say we instead Of they A I guess she might have but Q What did Miss Snell do then A She burst into tears I slapped her Q Why did you do that A She seemed hysterical Q Did she quiet eventually A Yes sir She quieted down and got control of herself pretty well in light of the fact that her boy friend was probably dead Q Did you interrogate her A Well not the way youd interrogate a criminal if thats what you mean I asked her if she knew anything about what had happened She repeated what she had already said but in a calmer way I asked her where she had been when the trouble began and she told me that she had been at home Q Did you interrogate her further A No sir Q Did she say anything else to you A Yes sir She asked me  begged me  to find Carrie White Q What was your reaction to that A I told her to go home Q Thank you Sheriff Doyle Vic Mooney lurched out of the shadows near the Bankers Trust drivein office with a grin on his face It was a huge and awful grin a Cheshire cat grin floating dreamily in the fireshot darkness like a trace memory of lunacy His hair carefully slicked down for this emcee duties was now sticking up in a crows nest Tiny drops of blood were branded across his forehead from some unremembered fall in his mad flight from the Spring Ball One eye was swelled purple and screwed shut He walked into Sheriff Doyles squad car bounced back like a pool ball and grinned in at the drunk driver dozing in the back then he turned to Doyle who had just finished with Sue Snell The fire cast wavering shadows of light across everything turning the world into the maroon tones of dried blood As Doyle turned Vic Mooney clutched him He clutched Doyle as an amorous swam might clutch his lady in a hug dance He clutched Doyle with both arms and squeezed him all the while goggling upward into Doyles face with his great crazed grin Vic Doyle began She pulled all the plugs Vic said lightly Pulled all the plugs and turned on the water and buzz buzz buzz Vic We cant let em Oh no NoNoNo We cant Carrie pulled all the plugs Rhonda Simard burnt up Oh Jeeeeeeeeeesuuuuuuuuusss Doyle slapped him twice calloused palm cracking flatly on the boys face The scream died with shocking suddenness but the grin remained like an echo of evil It was loose and terrible What happened Doyle said roughly What happened at the school Carrie Vic Muttered Carrie happened at the school She  He trailed of and grinned at the ground Doyle gave him three brisk shakes Vics teeth clicked together like castanets What about Carrie Queen of the Prom Vic muttered They dumped blood on her and Tommy What It was   Tonys Citgo on Summer Street suddenly exploded with a great coughing roar The street went daylight that made them both stagger back against the police car and shield their eyes A huge oily cloud of fire climbed over the elms in Courthouse Park lighting the duck pond and the Little League diamond in scarlet Amid the hungry crackling roar that followed Doyle could hear glass and wood and hunks of gasstation cinderblock rattling back to earth A secondary explosion followed making them wince again He still couldnt get it straight my town this is happening in my town That this was happening in Chamberlain in Chamberlain for Gods sake where he drank iced tea on his mothers sun porch and refereed PAL basketball and made one last cruise out Route past The Cavalier before turning in at  every morning His town was burning UP Tom Quillan came out of the police station and ran down the sidewalk to Doyles cruiser His hair was standing up every which way he was dressed in dirty green work fatigues and an undershirt and he had his loafers on the wrong feet but Doyle thought he had never been so glad to see anyone in his life Tom Quillan was as much Chamberlain as anything and he was thereintact Holy God he panted Did you see that Whats been happening Doyle asked curtly I been monitorin the radio Quillan said Motton and Westover wanted to know if they should send ambulances and I said bell yes send everything Hearses too Did I do right Yes Doyle ran his hands through his hair Have you seen Harry Block Block was the towns Commissioner of Public Utilities and that included water Nope But Chief Deighan says they got water in the old Rennet Block across town Theyre laying hose now I collared some kids and theyre settin up a hospital in the police station Theyre good boys but theyre gonna get blood on your floor Otis Otis Doyle felt unreality surge over him Surely this conversation couldnt be happening in Chamberlain Couldnt Thats all right Tommy You did right You go back there and start calling every doctor in the phone book Im going over to Summer Street Okay Otis If you see that crazy broad be careful Who Doyle was not a barking man but now he did Tom Quillan flinched back Carrie Carrie White Who How

UNCONFIRMED ENDS  PM MAY  F AP There were no more AP reports from Chamberlain At  AM a Jackson Avenue gas main was opened At  an ambulance attendant from Motton tossed out a cigarette butt as the rescue vehicle sped toward Summer Street The explosion destroyed nearly half a block at a stroke including the offices of The Chamberlain Clarion By  AM Chamberlain was cut off from the country that slept in reason beyond At  still seven minutes before the gasmain explosion the telephone exchange experienced a softer explosion a complete jam of every town phone line still in operation The three harried girls on duty stayed at their posts but were utterly unable to cope They worked with expressions of wooden horror on their faces trying to place unplaceable calls And so Chamberlain drifted into the streets They came like an invasion from the graveyard that lay in the elbow creek formed by the intersection of The Bellsqueeze Road and Route  they came in white nightgowns and in robes as if in winding shrouds They came in pyjamas and curlers Mrs Dawson she of the nowdeceased son who had been a very funny fellow came in a mudpack as if dressed for a minstrel show they came to see what happened to their town to see if it was indeed lying burnt and bleeding Many of them also came to die Carlin Street was thronged with them a riptide of them moving downtown through the hectic light in the sky when Carrie came out of the Carlin Street Congregational Church where she had been praying She had gone in only five minutes before after opening the gas main it had been easy as soon as she pictured it lying there under the street it had been easy but it seemed like hours She had prayed long and deeply sometimes aloud sometimes silently Her heart thudded and laboured The veins on her face and neck bulged Her mind was filled with the huge knowledge of POWERS and of an ABYSS She prayed in front of the altar kneeling in her wet and torn and bloody gown her feet bare and dirty and bleeding from a broken bottle she had stepped on Her breath sobbed in and out of her throat and the church was filled with groanings and swayings and sunderings as psychic energy sprang from her Pews fell hymnals flew and a silver Communion set cruised silently across the vaulted darkness of the nave to crash into the far wall She prayed and there was no answering No one was there  or if there was HeIt was cowering from her God had turned His face away and why not This horror was as much His doing as hers And so she left the church left it to go home and find her momma and make destruction complete She paused on the lower step looking at the flocks of people streaming toward the centre of town Animals Let them burn then Let the streets be filled with the smell of their sacrifice Let this place be called racca ichabod wormwood Flex And power transformers atop lightpoles bloomed into nacreous purple light spitting catherinewheel sparks Hightension wires fell into the streets in pickupsticks tangles and some of them ran and that was bad for them because now the whole street was littered with wires and the stink began the burning began People began to scream and back away and touched the cables and went into jerky electrical dances Some had already slumped into the street their robes and pyjamas smouldering Carrie turned back and looked fixedly at the church she had just left The heavy door suddenly swung shut as if in a hurricane wind Carrie turned towards home From the sworn testimony of Mrs Cora Simard taken before The State Investigatory Board from The White Commission Report pp  Q Mrs Simard the Board understands that you lost your daughter on Prom Night and we sympathise with you deeply We will make this as brief as possible A Thank you I want to help if I can of course Q Were you on Carlin Street at approximately  when Carietta White came out of the First Congregational Church on that street A Yes Q Why were you there A My husband had to be in Boston over the weekend on business and Rhonda was at the Spring Ball I was home alone watching TV and waiting up for her I was watching the Friday Night Movie when the town hall whistle went off but I didnt connect that with the dance But then the explosion  I didnt know what to do I tried to call the police but got a busy signal after the first three numbers I  IThen  Q Take your time Mrs Simard All the time you need A I was getting frantic There was a second explosion  Teddys Amoco station I know now  And I decided to go downtown and see what was happening There was a glow in the sky an awful glow That was when Mrs Shyres pounded on the door Q Mrs Georgette Shyres A Yes they live around the corner  Willow Thats just of Carlin Street She was pounding and calling Cora are you in there Are you in there I went to the door She was in her bathrobe and slippers Her feet looked cold She said they had called Auburn to see if they knew anything and they told her the school was on fire I said Oh dear God Rhondas at the dance Q Is this when you decided to go downtown with Mrs Shyres A We didnt decide anything We just went I put on a pair of slippers  Rhondas I think They had little white puffballs on them I should have worn my shoes but I wasnt thinking I guess Im not thinking now What do you want to hear about my shoes for Q You tell it in your own way Mrs Simard A TThank you I gave Mrs Shyres some old jacket that was around and we went Q Were there many people walking down Carlin street A I dont know I was too upset Maybe thirty Maybe more Q What happened A Georgette and I were walking toward Main Street holding hands just like two little girls walking across a meadow after dark Georgettes teeth were clicking I remember that I wanted to ask her to stop clicking her teeth but I thought it would be impolite A block and a half from the Congo Church I saw the door open and I thought Someone has gone in to ask Gods help But a second later I knew that wasnt true Q How did you know It would be logical to assume just what you first assumed wouldnt it A I just knew Q Did you know the person who came out of the church A Yes It was Carrie White Q Had you ever seen Carrie White before A No She was not one of my daughters friends Q Had you ever seen a picture of Carrie White A No Q And in any case it was dark and you were a block and a half from the church A Yes sir Q Mrs Simard how did you know it was Carrie White A I just knew Q This knowing Mrs Simard was it like a light going on in your head A No sir Q What way it A I cant tell you It faded away the way a dream does An hour after you get up you can only remember you had a dream But I knew Q Was there an emotional feeling that went with this knowledge A Yes Horror Q What did you do then A I turned to Georgette and said There she is Georgette said Yes thats her She started to say something else and then the whole street was lit up by a bright glow and there were crackling noises and then the power lines started to fall into the street some of them spitting live sparks One of them hit a man in front of us and he bburst into flames Another man started to run and he stepped on one of them and his body just arched backward as if his back had turned into elastic And then he fell down Other people were screaming and running just running blindly and more and more cables fell They were strung all over the place like snakes And she was glad about it Glad I could feel her being glad I knew I had to keep my head The people who were running were getting electrocuted Georgette said Quick Cora Oh God I dont want to get burned alive I said Stop that We have to use our heads Georgette or well never use them again Something foolish like that But she wouldnt listen She let go of my hand and started to ran for the sidewalk I screamed at her to stop  there was one of those heavy main cables broken off right in front of us  but she didnt listen And she  she oh I could smell her when she started to burn Smoke just seemed to burst out of her clothes and I thought thats what it must be like when someone gets electrocuted The smell was sweet like pork Have any of you ever smelled that Sometimes I smell it in my dreams I stood still watching Georgette Shyres turn black There was a big explosion over in the West Endthe gas main I suppose  but I never even noticed it I looked around and I was all alone Everyone else had either run away or was burning I saw maybe six bodies They were like piles of old rags One of the cables had fallen on to the porch of a house to the left and it was catching on fire I could hear the oldfashioned shake shingles popping like Corn it seemed like I stood there a long time telling myself to keep my head It seemed like hours I began to be afraid that I would faint and fall on one of the cables or that I would panic and start to run Like  like Georgette So then I started to walk One step at a time Me street got even brighter because of the burning house I stepped over two live wires and went around a body that wasnt much more than a puddle III had to look to see where I was going There was a wedding ring on the bodys hand but it was all black All black Jesus I was Oh dear Lord I stepped over another one and then there were three all at once I just stood there looking at them I thought if I got over those Id be all right but  I didnt dare Do you know what I kept thinking of That game you play when youre kids Giant Step A voice in my mind was saying Cora take one giant step over the live wires in the street And I was thinking May P May P One of them was still spitting a few sparks but the other two looked dead But you cant tell The third rail looks dead too So I stood there waiting for someone to come and nobody did The house was still burning and the flames had spread to the lawn and the trees and the hedge beside it But no fire trucks came Of course they didnt The whole west side was burning up by that time And I felt so faint And at last I knew it was take the giant step or faint and so I took it as big a giant step as I could and the heel of my slipper came down not an inch from the last wire Then I got over and went around the end of one more wire and then I started to run And thats all I remember When morning came I was lying on a blanket in the police station with a lot of other people Some of them  a fewwere kids in their prom getups and I started to ask them if they had seen Rhonda And said  they sssaid  A short recess Q You are personally sure that Carrie White did this A Yes Q Thank you Mrs Simard A Id like to ask a question if you please Q Of course A What happens if there are others like her What happens to the world From The Shadow Exploded p   By  on the morning of May  the situation in Chamberlain was critical The school had burned itself out on a fairly isolated piece of ground but the entire downtown area was ablaze Almost all the city water in that area had been tapped but enough was available at low pressure from Deighan Street water mains to save the business buildings below the intersection of Main and Oak a The explosion of Tonys Citgo on upper Summer Street had resulted in a ferocious fire that was not to be controlled until nearly ten oclock that morning There was water on Summer Street there simply were no firemen or firefighting equipment to utilize it Equipment was then on its way from Lewiston Auburn Lisbon and Brunswick but nothing arrived until one oclock On Carlin Street an electrical fire caused by downed power lines had begun It was eventually to gut the entire north side of the street including the bungalow where Margaret White gave birth to her daughter On the west end of town just below what is commonly caned Brickyard Hill the worst disaster had taken place The explosion of a gas main and a resulting fire that raged out of control through most of the next day And if we look at these flash points on a municipal map see page facing we can pick out Carries route  a wandering looping path of destruction through the town but one with an almost certain destination home  Something toppled over in the living room and Margaret White straightened up cocking her head to one side The butcher knife glittered dully in the light of the flames The electric power had gone off sometime before and the only fight in the house came from the fire up the street One of the pictures fell from the wall with a thump A moment later the Black Forest cuckoo clock fell The mechanical bird gave a small strangled squawk and was still From the town the sirens whooped endlessly but she could still hear the footsteps when they turned up the walk The door blew open Steps in the hall She heard the plaster plaques in the living room CHRIST THE UNSEEN GUEST WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THE HOUR DRAWETH NIGH IF TONIGHT BECAME JUDGMENT WOULD YOU BE READY explode one after the other like plaster birds in a shooting gallery o ive been there and seen the harlots shimmy on wooden stages She sat up on her stool like a very bright scholar who has gone to the head of the class but her eyes were deranged The livingroom windows blew outward The kitchen door dammed and Carrie walked in Her body seemed to have become twisted shrunken cronelike The prom dress was in tatters and flaps and the pig blood had began to clot and streak There was a smudge of grease on her forehead and both knees were scraped and rawlooking Momma she whispered Her eyes were preternaturally bright hawklike but her mouth was trembling If someone had been them to watch he would have been struck by the resemblance between them Margaret White sat on her kitchen stool the carving knife hidden among the folds of her dress in her lap I should have killed myself when he put it in me she said clearly After the first time before we were married he promised Never again He said we just  slipped I believed him I fell down and I lost the baby and that was Gods judgment I felt that the sin had been expiated By blood But sin never dies Sin  never  dies Her eyes glittered Momma At first it was all right We lived sinlessly We slept in the same bed belly to belly sometimes and O I could feel the presence of the Serpent but we never did until She began to grin and it was a hard terrible grin And that night I could see him looking at me That Way We got down on our knees to pray for strength and he touched me In that place That woman place And I sent him out of the house He was gone for hours and I prayed for him I could see him in my minds eye walking the midnight streets wrestling with the devil as Jacob wrestled with the Angel of the Lord And when he came back my heart was filled with thanksgiving She paused grinning her dry spitless grin into the shifting shadows of the room Momma I dont want to hear it Plates began to explode in the cupboards like clay pigeons It wasnt until he came in that I smelled the whiskey on his breath And he took me Took me With the stink of filthy roadhouse whiskey still on him he took me  and I liked it She screamed out the last words at the ceiling I liked it o all that dirty fucking and his hands on me ALL OVER ME MOMMA MOMMA She broke off as if slapped and blinked at her daughter I almost killed myself she said in a more normal tone of voice And Ralph wept and talked about atonement and I didnt and then he was dead and then I thought God had visited me with cancer that He was turning my female parts into something as black and rotten as my sinning soul But that would have been too easy The Lord works in mysterious ways His wonders to perform I see that now When the pains began I went and got a knife  this knife she held it up and waited for you to come so I could make my sacrifice But I was weak and backsliding I took this knife in hand again when you were three and I backslid again So now the devil has come home She held the knife up and her eyes fastened hypnotically on the glittering hook of its blade Carrie took a slow blundering step forward He smiled Maybe But he wouldnt Not any more Come on Were going to town They went downstairs and through the empty dance hall where chairs were still pushed back and beers were standing flat on the tables As they went out through the fire door Billy said This place sucks anyway They got into his car and he started it up When he popped on the headlights Chris began to scream hands in fists up to her cheeks Billy felt it at the same time Something in his mind came came came came a presence Carrie was standing in front of them perhaps seventy feet away The high beams picked her out in ghastly horrormovie blacks and whites dripping and clotted with blood Now much of it was her own The hilt of the butcher knife still protruded from her shoulder and her gown was covered with dirt and grass stain She had crawled much of the distance from Carlin Street half fainting to destroy this roadhouse perhaps the very one where the doom of her creation had begun She stood swaying her arms thrown out like the arms of a stage hypnotist and she began to totter toward them It happened in the blink of a second Chris had not had time to expend her first scream Billys reflexes were good and his reaction was instantaneous He shifted into low popped the clutch and floored it The Chevrolets tyres screamed against the asphalt and the car sprang forward like some old and terrible mancater The figure swelled in the windshield and as it did the presence became louder CARRIE CARRIE CARRIE and louder CARRIE CARRIE CARRIE like a radio being turned up to full volume Time seemed to close around them in a frame and for a moment they were frozen even in motion Billy CARRIE just like the dogs CARRIE jut like the goddam dogs CARRIE brucie i wish i could CARRIE be CARRIE you and Chris CARRIE Jesus not to kill her CARRIE didnt mean to kill her CARRIE billy i dont CARRIE want to CARRIE see it CA and Carrie herself see the wheel car wheel gas pedal i see the WHEEL o god my heart my heart my heart And Billy suddenly felt his car turn traitor come alive slither in his hands The Chevvy dug around in a smoking halfcircle straight pipes racketing and suddenly the clapboard side of The Cavalier was swelling swelling swelling and this is they slammed into it at forty still accelerating and wood sprayed up in a neontinted detonation Billy was thrown forward and the steering column speared him Chris was thrown into the dashboard The gas tank split open and fuel began to puddle around the rear of the car Part of one straight pipe fell into it and the gas bloomed into flame Carrie lay on her side eyes closed panting thickly Her chest was on fire She began to drag herself across the parking lot going nowhere momma im sorry it all went wrong o momma o please o please i hurt so bad momma what do i do And suddenly it didnt seem to matter any more nothing would matter if she could turn over turn over and see the stars turn over and look once and die And that was how Sue found her at two oclock When Sheriff Doyle left her Sue walked down the Street and sat on the steps of the Chamberlain UWashIt She stared at the burning sky without swing it Tommy was dead She knew it was true and accepted it with an case that was dreadful And Carrie had done it She had no idea how she knew it but the conviction was as pure and right as arithmetic Time passed It didnt matter Macbeth hath murdered sleep and Carrie hath murdered time Pretty good A bon mot Sue smiled dolefully Can this be the end of our heroine Miss Sweet Little Sixteen No worries about the country club and Kleen Korners now Not ever Gone Burned out Someone ran past blabbering that Carlin Street was on fire Good for Carlin Street Tommy was gone And Carrie had gone home to murder her mother  She sat bolt upright staring into the darkness  She didnt know how she knew It bore no relationship to anything she had ever read about telepathy There were no pictures in her head no great white flashes of revelation only prosaic knowledge the way you know summer follows spring that cancer can kill you that Carries mother was dead already that  Her heart row thickly in her chest Dead She examined in her knowledge of the incident trying to disregard the insistent weirdness of knowing from nothing Yes Margaret White was dead something to do with her heart But she had stabbed Carrie Carrie was badly hurt She was There was nothing more She got up and ran back to her mothers car Ten minutes later she parked on the corner of Branch and Carlin Street which was on fire No trucks were available to fight the blaze yet but sawhorses had been put across both ends of the street and greasily smoking roads pots lit a sign which said DANGER LIVE WIRES Sue cut through two back yards and forced her way through a budding hedge that scraped at her white short stiff bristles She came out one yard from the Whites house and crossed over The house was in flames the roof blazing It was impossible to even think about getting close enough to look in But in the strong firelight she saw something better the splashed trail of Carries blood She followed it with her head down past the larger spots where Carrie had rested through another hedge across a Willow Street back yard and then through an undeveloped tangle of scrub pine and oak Beyond that a short unpaved spur  little more than a footpath  wound up the rise of land to the right angling away from Route  She stopped suddenly as doubt struck her with vicious and corrosive force Suppose she could find her What then Heart failure Set on fire Controlled and forced to walk in front of an oncoming car or fire engine Her peculiar knowledge told her Carrie would be capable of all things find a policeman She giggled a little at that one and sat down in the grass which was silked with dew She had already found a policeman And even supposing Otis Doyle had believed her what then A mental picture came to her of a hundred desperate manhunters surrounding Came demanding her to hand over her weapons and give up Carrie obediently raises her hands and plucks her head from her shoulders Hands it to Sheriff Doyle who solemnly puts it in a wicker basket marked Peoples Exhibit A and tommys dead Well well She began to cry She put her hands over her face and sobbed into them A soft breeze snuffled through the juniper bushes on top of the hill More fire engines screamed by on Route  like huge red hounds in the night the towns burning down o well She had no idea how long she sat there crying in a grainy halfdoze She was not even aware that she was following Carries progress toward The Cavalier no more than she was aware of the process of respiration unless she thought about it Carrie was hurt very badly was going on brute determination alone at this point It was three miles out to The Cavalier even acrosscountry as Carrie was going Sue watched thought doesnt matter as Carrie fell in a brook and dragged herself out icy and shivering It was really amazing that she kept going But of course it was for Momma Momma wanted her to be the Angels Fiery Sword to destroy shes going to destroy that too She got up and began to run clumsily not bothering to follow the trail of blood She didnt need to follow it any more From The Shadow Exploded pp  Whatever any of us may think of the Carrie White affair it is over Its time to turn to the future As Dean McGuffin points out in his excellent Science Yearbook article if we refuse to do this we will almost certainly have to pay the piper  and the price is apt to be a high one A thorny moral question is raised here Progress is already being made toward complete isolation of the TK gene It is more or less assumed in the scientific community see for instance Bourke and Hannegans A View Toward Isolation of the TK Gene with Specific Recommendations for Control Parameters in Mocrobiology Annual Berkeley  that when a testing procedure is established all schoolage children will undergo the test as routinely as they now undergo the TB skinpatch Yet TK is not a germ it is as much a part of the afflicted person as the colour of his eyes If overt TK ability occurs as a part of puberty and if this hypothetical TK test is performed on children entering the first grade we shall certainly be forewarned But in this case is forewarned forearmed If the TB test shows positive a child can be treated or isolated If the TK test shows positive we have no treatment except a bullet in the head And how is it possible to isolate a person who will eventually have the power to knock down all walls And even if isolation could be made successful would the American people allow a small pretty girlchild to be ripped away from her parents at the first sign of puberty to be locked in a bank vault for the rest of her life I doubt it Especially when The White Commission has worked so hard to convince the public that the nightmare in Chamberlain was a complete fluke Indeed we seem to have returned to Square One From the sworn testimony of Susan Snell taken before The State Investigatory Board of Maine from The White Commission Report pp  Q Now Miss Snell the Board would like to go through your testimony concerning your alleged meeting with Carrie White in The Cavalier parking lot A Why do you keep asking the same questions over and over Ive told you twice already Q We want to make sure the record is correct in every A You want to catch me in a lie isnt that what you really mean You dont think Im telling the truth do YOU Q You say you came upon Carrie at A Will you answer me Q at  on the morning of May th Is that correct A Im not going to answer any more questions until you answer the one I just asked Q Miss Snell this body is empowered to cite you for contempt if you refuse to answer on any other grounds than Constitutional ones A I dont care what youre empowered to do Ive lost someone I love Go and throw me in jail I dont care I  go to hell All of you go to hell Youre trying to  to  I dont know crucify me or something Just lay off me A short recess Q Miss Snell are you willing to continue your testimony at this time A Yes But I wont be badgered Mr Chairman Q Of course not young lady No one wants to badger you Now you claim to have come upon Carrie in the parking lot of this tavern at  Is that correct A Yes Q You knew it was  A I was wearing the watch you see on my wrist right now Q To be sure Isnt The Cavalier better than six miles from where you left your mothers car A It is by the road Its close to three as the crow flies Q You walked this distance X Yes Q Now you testified earlier that you knew you were getting close to Carrie Can you explain this A No Q Could you smell her A What Q Did you follow your nose Laughter in the galleries A Are you playing games with me Q Answer the question please A No I didnt follow my nose Q Could you see her A No Q Hear her A No Q Then how could you possibly know she was there A How did Tom Quillan know Or Cora Simard Or poor Vic Mooney How did any of them know Q Answer the question miss This is hardly the place or the time for impertinence A But they did say they just knew didnt they I read Mrs Simards testimony in the paper And what about the fire hydrants that opened themselves And the gas pumps that broke their own locks and turned themselves on The power lines that climbed down off their poles And Q Miss Snell please A Those things are in the record of this Commissions proceedings Q This is not an issue here A Then what is Are you looking for the truth or just a scapegoat Q You deny you had prior knowledge of Carrie Whites whereabouts A Of course I do Its an absurd idea Q Oh And why is it absurd A Well if youre suggesting some kind of conspiracy its absurd because Carrie was dying when I found her It could not have been an easy way to die Q If you had no prior knowledge of her whereabouts how could you go directly to her location A Oh you stupid man Have you listened to anything thats been said here Everybody knew it was Carrie Anyone could have found her if they had put their minds to it Q But not just anyone found her You did Can you tell us why people did not show up from all over like iron filings drawn to a magnet A She was weakening rapidly I think that perhaps the the zone of her influence was shrinking Q I think you will agree that that is a relatively uninformed supposition A Of course it is On the subject of Carrie White were all relatively uninformed Q Have it your way Miss Snell Now if we could turn to  At first when she climbed up the enbankment between Henry Drains meadow and the parking lot of The Cavalier she thought Carrie was dead Her figure was halfway across the parking lot and she looked oddly shrunken and crumpled Sue was reminded of dead animals she had seen on   woodchucks groundhogs skunks  that had been crushed by speeding trucks and station wagons But the presence was still in her mind vibrating stubbornly repeating the call letters of Carrie Whites personality over and over An essence of Carrie a gestalt Muted now not strident not announcing itself with a clarion but waxing and waning in steady oscillations Unconscious Sue climbed over the guard rail that bordered the parking lot feeling the heat of the fire against her face The Cavalier was a wooden frame building and it was burning briskly The charred remains of a car were limned in flame to the right of the back door Carrie had done that She did not go to look and see if anyone had been in it It didnt matter not now She walked over to where Carrie lay on her side unable to hear her own footsteps under the hungry crackle of the fire She looked down at the curledup figure with a bemused and bitter pity The knife hilt protruded cruelly from her shoulder and she was lying in a small pool of blood  some of it was trickling from her mouth She looked as if she had been trying to turn herself over when unconsciousness had taken her Able to start fires pull down electric cables able to kill almost by thought alone lying here unable to turn herself over Sue knelt took her by one arm and the unhurt shoulder and gently turned her on to her back Carrie moaned thickly and her eyes fluttered The perception of her in Sues mind sharpened as if a mental picture was coming into focus whos there And Sue without thought spoke in the same fashion me sue snell Only there was no need to think of her name The thought of herself as herself was neither words nor pictures The realization suddenly brought everything up close made it real and compassion for Carrie broke through the dullness of her shock And Carrie with faraway dumb reproach you tricked me you all tricked me carrie i dont even know what happened is tommy you tricked me that happened trick trick trick o dirty trick The mixture of image and emotion was staggering indescribable Blood Sadness Fear The latest dirty trick in a long series of dirty tricks they flashed by in a dizzying shuffle that made Sues mind reel helplessly hopelessly They shared the awful totality of perfect knowledge carrie dont dont dont hurts me Now girls throwing sanitary napkins chanting laughing Sues face mirrored in her own mind ugly caricatured all mouth cruelly beautiful see the dirty tricks see my whole life one long dirty trick look carrie look inside me And Carrie looked The sensation was terrifying Her mind and nervous system had become a library Someone in desperate need ran through her fingers trailing lightly over shelves of books lifting some out scanning them putting them back letting some fall leaving the pages to flutter wildly glimpses thats me as a kid hate him daddy o mommy wide lips o teeth bobby pushed me o my knee car want to ride in the car were going to see aunt cecily mommy come quick i made pee in the wind of memory and still on and on finally reaching a shelf marked TOMMY subheaded PROM Books thrown open flashes of experience marginal notations in all the hiergglyphs of emotion more complex than the Rosetta Stone Looking Finding more than Sue herself had suspectedlove for Tommy jealousy selfishness a need to subjugate him to her will on the matter of taking Carrie disgust for Carrie herself she could take better care of herself she does look just like a GODDAM TOAD hate for Miss Desjardin hate for herself But no ill will for Carrie personally no plan to get her in front of everyone and undo her The feverish feeling of being raped in her most secret corridors began to fade She felt Carrie puffing back weak and exhausted why didnt you just leave me alone carrie i momma would be alive i killed my momma i want her o it hurts my chest my shoulder o o o i want my momma carrie i And there was no way to finish that thought nothing there to complete it with Sue was suddenly overwhelmed with terror the worse because she could put no name to it The bleeding freak on this oilstained asphalt suddenly seemed meaningless and awful in its pain and dying o momma im scared momma MOMMA Sue tried to pull away to disengage her mind to allow Carrie at least the privacy of her dying and was unable to She felt that she was dying herself and did not want to see this preview of her own eventual end carrie let me GO Momma Momma Momma oooooooooooo  The mental scream reached a flaring unbelievable crescendo and then suddenly faded For a moment Sue felt as if she were watching a candle flame disappear down a long black tunnel at a tremendous speed shes dying o my god im feeling her die And then the fight was gone and the last conscious thought had been momma im sorry where and it broke up and Sue was tuned in only on the blank idiot frequency of the physical nerve endings that would take hours to die She stumbled away from it holding her arms out in front of her like a blind woman toward the edge of the parking lot She tripped over the kneehigh guard rail and tumbled down the embankment She got to her feet and stumbled into the field which was filling with mystic white pockets of ground mist Crickets chirruped mindlessly and a whippoorwill whippoorwill somebodys dying called in the great stillness of morning She began to run breathing deep in her chest running from Tommy from the fires and explosions from Carrie but mostly from the final horrorthat last lighted thought carried swiftly down into the black tunnel of eternity followed by the blank idiot hum of prosaic electricity The afterimage began to fade reluctantly leaving a blessed cooling darkness in her mind that knew nothing She slowed halted and became aware that something had begun to happen She stood in the middle of the great and misty field waiting for realization Her rapid breathing slowed slowed caught suddenly as if on a thorn And suddenly vented itself in one howling cheated scream As she felt the slow course of dark menstrual blood down her thighs Part Three Wreckage From the national AP ticker Friday June  CHAMBERLAIN MAINE AP STATE OFFICIALS SAY THAT THE DEATH TOLL IN CHAMBERLAIN STANDS AT  WITH  STILL LISTED AS MISSING INVESTIGATION

layoffs are a strong possibility We have the orders Chamblis said but you cant run a mill without people to punch the time clock We dont have them Ive gotten notice from thirtyfour men since August th The only thing we can see to do now is close up the dye house and job our work out Wed hate to let the men go but this thing is getting down to a matter of financial survival Roger Fearon has lived in Chamberlain for twentytwo years and has been with the mill for eighteen of those years He has risen during that time from a thirdfloor bagger making seventythree cents an hour to dyehouse foreman yet he seems strangely unmoved by the possibility of losing his job Id lose a damned good wage Fearon said Its not something you take lightly The wife and I have talked it over We could sell the house

death and destruction through Worcester the air was filled with the sound of hammers the smell of new timber and a feeling of optimism and human resilience There is none of that in Chamberlain this fall The main road has been cleared of rubble and that is about the extent of it The faces that you meet are full of dull hopelessness Men drink beer without talking in Franks Bar on the corner of Sullivan Street and women exchange tales of grief and loss in back yards Chamberlain has been declared a disaster area and money is available to help put the town back on its feet and begin rebuilding the business district But the main business of Chamberlain in the last four months has been funerals Four hundred and forty are now known dead eighteen more still unaccounted for And sixtyseven of the dead were Ewen High School Seniors on the verge of graduation It is this perhaps more than anything else that has taken the guts out of Chamberlain They were buried on June  and  in three mass ceremonies A memorial service was held on June  in the town square It was the most moving ceremony that this reporter has ever witnessed Attendance was in the thousands and the entire assemblage was still as the school band stripped from fiftysix to a bare forty played the school song and taps There was a sombre graduation ceremony the following week at neighbouring Motton Academy but there were only fiftytwo Seniors left to graduate The valedictorian Henry Stampel broke into tears halfway through his speech and could not continue There were no Graduation Night parties following the ceremony the Seniors merely took their diplomas and went home And still as the summer progressed the hearses continued to roll as more bodies were discovered To some residents it seemed that each day the scab was ripped  again so that the wound could bleed afresh If you are one of the many curiosityseekers who have been through Chamberlain in the last week you have seen a town that may be suffering from terminal cancer of the spirit A few people looking lost wander through the aisles of the AP The Congregational Church on Carlin Street is gone swept away by fire but the brick Catholic Church still stands on Elm Street and the trim Methodist Church on outer Main Street although singed by fire is unhurt Yet attendance has been poor The old men still sit on the benches in Courthouse Square but there is little interest in the checkerboards or even in conversation The overall impression is one of a town that is waiting to die It is not enough these days to say that Chamberlain will never be
