One How long will the magic stay At first no one answered Rolands question and so he asked it again this time looking across the living room of the rectory to where Henchick of the Manni sat with Cantab who had married one of Henchicks numerous granddaughters The two men were holding hands as was the Manni way The older man had lost a granddaughter that day but if he grieved the emotion did not show on his stony composed face Next to Roland holding no ones hand silent and dreadfully white sat Eddie Dean Beside him crosslegged on the floor was Jake Chambers He had pulled Oy into his lap a thing Roland had never seen before and would not have believed the billybumbler would allow Both Eddie and Jake were splattered with blood That on Jakes shirt belonged to his friend Benny Slightman That on Eddies belonged to Margaret Eisenhart once Margaret of Redpath the lost granddaughter of the old patriarch Both Eddie and Jake looked as tired as Roland felt but he was quite sure there would be no rest for them this night Distant from town came the sounds of fireworks and singing and celebration There was no celebration here Benny and Margaret were dead and Susannah was gone Henchick tell me I beg how long will the magic stay The old man stroked his beard in a distracted fashion Gunslinger Roland  I cant say The magic of the door in that cave is beyond me As thee must know Tell me what you think Based on what youdo know Eddie raised his hands They were dirty there was blood under the nails and they trembled Tell Henchick he said speaking in a voice humble and lost that Roland had never heard before Tell I beg Rosalita Pere Callahans woman of all work came in with a tray There were cups on it and a carafe of steaming coffee She at least had found time to change out of her bloody dusty jeans and shirt and into a housedress but her eyes were still shocked They peered from her face like small animals from their burrows She poured the coffee and passed the cups without speaking Nor had she gotten all the blood Roland saw as he took one of the cups There was a streak of it on the back of her right hand Margarets or Bennys He didnt know Or much care The Wolves had been defeated They might or might not come again to Calla Bryn Sturgis That was kas business Theirs was Susannah Dean who had disappeared in the aftermath taking Black Thirteen with her Henchick said Ye ask of kaven Aye father Roland agreed The persistence of magic Father Callahan took a cup of coffee with a nod and a distracted smile but no word of thanks He had spoken little since theyd come back from the cave In his lap was a book calledSalems Lot by a man of whom he had never heard It purported to be a work of fiction but he Donald Callahan was in it He had lived in the town of which it told had taken part in the events it recounted He had looked on the back and on the rear flap for the authors photograph queerly certain that he would see a version of his own face looking back at him the way hed looked in  when these events had taken place most likely but there had been no picture just a note about the books writer that told very little He lived in the state of Maine He was married Hed written one previous book quite well reviewed if you believed the quotations on the back The greater the magic the longer it persists Cantab said and then looked at Henchick questioningly Aye Henchick said Magic and glammer both are one and they do unroll from the back He paused From the past doee ken This door opened on many places and many times in the world my friends came from Roland said I would open it again but just on the last two The most recent two Can that be done They waited as Henchick and Cantab considered The Manni were great travelers If anyone knew if anyone could do what Roland wanted  what they all wanted  it would be these folk Cantab leaned deferentially toward the old man the dinh of Calla Redpath He whispered Henchick listened his face expressionless then turned Cantabs head with one gnarled old hand and whispered back Eddie shifted and Roland felt him getting ready to break loose perhaps to begin shouting He put a restraining hand on Eddies shoulder and Eddie subsided For the time being at least The whispered consultation went on for perhaps five minutes while the others waited The sounds of celebration in the distance were difficult for Roland to take God knew how they must make Eddie feel At last Henchick patted Cantabs cheek with his hand and turned to Roland We think this may be done he said Thank God Eddie muttered Then louder ThankGod Lets go up there We can meet you on the East Road   Both of the bearded men were shaking their heads Henchick with a kind of stern sorrow Cantab with a look that was almost horror Well not go up to the Cave of the Voices in the dark Henchick said Wehave to Eddie burst out You dont understand Its not just a question of how long the magic will or wont last its a question of time on the other side It goes faster over there and once its gone its gone Christ Susannah could be having that baby right now and if its some kind of cannibal   Listen to me young fellow Henchick said and hear me very well I beg The day is nigh gone This was true Never in Rolands experience had a day run so quickly through his fingers There had been the battle with the Wolves early not long after dawn then celebration there on the road for the victory and sorrow for their losses which had been amazingly small as things had fallen Then had come the realization that Susannah was gone the trek to the cave their discoveries there By the time theyd gotten back to the East Road battlefield it had been past noon Most of the townsfolk had left bearing their saved children home in triumph Henchick had agreed willingly enough to this palaver but by the time theyd gotten back to the rectory the sun had been on the wrong side of the sky Were going to get a nights rest after allRoland thought and didnt know whether to be glad or disappointed He could use sleep that much he did know I listen and hear Eddie said but Rolands hand was still on his shoulder and he could feel the younger man trembling Even were we willing to go we couldnt persuade enough of the others to come wi us Henchick said Youre their dinh   Aye so you call it and so I suppose I am although it isnt our word ye ken In most things theyd follow me and they know the debt they owe your katet out of this days work and would say thank ya any way they could But they wouldnt go up that path and into that haunted place after dark Henchick was shaking his head slowly and with great certainty No  that they will not do Listen young man Cantab and I can be back at Redpath Kraten well before full dark There well call our menfolk to the Tempa which is to us as the Meeting Hall is to the forgetful folk He glanced briefly at Callahan Say pardon Pere if the term offends ye Callahan nodded absently without looking up from the book which he was turning over and over in his hands It had been covered in protective plastic as valuable first editions often are The price lightly penciled on the flyleaf was Some young mans second novel He wondered what made it so valuable If they ran into the books owner a man named Calvin Tower he would surely ask And that would only be the start of his questioning Well explain what it is ye want and ask for volunteers Of the sixtyeight men of Redpath Kraten I believe all but four or five will agree to help  to blend their forces together It will make powerful khef Is that what ye call it Khef The sharing Yes Roland said The sharing of water we say You couldnt fit anywhere that number of men in the mouth of that cave Jake said Not even if half of them sat on the other halfs shoulders No need Henchick said Well put the most powerful inside  what we call the senders The others can line up along the path linked hand to hand and bob to bob Theyll be there before the sun goes rooftop tomorrow I set my watch and warrant on it Well need tonight to gather our mags and bobs anyway Cantab said He was looking at Eddie apologetically and with some fear The young man was in terrible pain that was clear And he was a gunslinger A gunslinger might strike out and when one did it was never blindly It could be too late Eddie said low He looked at Roland with his hazel eyes They were now bloodshot and dark with exhaustion Tomorrow could be too late even if the magichasnt gone away Roland opened his mouth and Eddie raised a finger Dont say ka Roland If you say ka one more time I swear my headll explode Roland closed his mouth Eddie turned back to the two bearded men in their dark Quakerish cloaks And you cant be sure the magic will stay can you What could be opened tonight could be closed against us forever tomorrow Not all the magnets and plumbbobs in Manni creation could open it Aye Henchick said But your woman took the magic ball with her and whateveree may think MidWorld and the Borderlands are well shed of it Id sell my soul to have it back and in my hands Eddie said clearly They all looked shocked at this even Jake and Roland felt a deep urge to tell Eddie he must take that back must unsay it There were powerful forces working against their quest for the Tower dark ones and Black Thirteen was their clearest sigul What could be used could also be misused and the bends o the rainbow had their own malevolent glammer Thirteen most of all Was the sum of all perhaps Even if they had possessed it Roland would have fought to keep it out of Eddie Deans hands In his current state of sorrowing distraction the ball would either destroy him or make him its slave in minutes A stone might drink if it had a mouth Rosa said dryly startling them all Eddie questions of magic aside think of the path that goes up there Then think of five dozen men many of them nigh as old as Henchick one or two blind as bats trying to climb it after dark The boulder Jake said Remember the boulder you have to kind of slide by with your feet sticking out over the drop Eddie nodded reluctantly Roland could see him trying to accept what he couldnt change Groping for sanity Susannah Dean is also a gunslinger Roland said Mayhap she can take care of herself a little while I dont think Susannahs in charge anymore Eddie replied and neither do you Its Mias baby after all and itll be Mia at the controls until the baby  the chap  comes Roland had an intuition then and like so many hed had over the years it turned out to be true She may have been in charge when they left but she may not be able to stay in charge Callahan spoke at last looking up from the book which had so stunned him Why not Because its not her world Roland said Its Susannahs If they cant find a way to work together they may die together Two Henchick and Cantab went back to Manni Redpath first to tell the gathered and entirely male elders about the days work and then to tell them what payment was required Roland went with Rosa to her cottage It stood up the hill from a formerly neat privy which was now mostly in ruins Within this privy standing useless sentinel was what remained of Andy the Messenger Robot many other functions Rosalita undressed Roland slowly and completely When he was mothernaked she stretched beside him on her bed and rubbed him with special oils catoil for his aches a creamier faintly perfumed blend for his most sensitive parts They made love They came together the sort of physical accident fools take for fate listening to the crackle of firecrackers from the Callas high street and the boisterous shouts of thefolken most of them now well past tipsy from the sound Sleep she said Tomorrow I see you no more Not me not Eisenhart or Overholser not anyone in the Calla Do you have the sight then Roland asked He sounded relaxed even amused but even when he had been deep in her heat and thrusting the gnaw of Susannah had never left his mind one of his katet and lost Even if there had been no more than that it would have been enough to keep him from true rest or ease No said she but I have feelings from time to time like any other woman especially about when her man is getting ready to move on Is that what I am to you Your man Her gaze was both shy and steady For the little time yeve been here aye I like to think so Doee call me wrong Roland He shook his head at once It was good to be some womans man again if only for a short time She saw he meant it and her face softened She stroked his lean cheek We were wellmet Roland were we not Wellmet in the Calla Aye lady She touched the remains of his right hand then his right hip And how are your aches To her he wouldnt lie Vile She nodded then took hold of his left hand which hed managed to keep away from the lobstrosities And this un Fine he said but he felt a deep ache Lurking Waiting its time to come out What Rosalita called the dry twist Roland said she Aye Her eyes looked at him calmly She still had hold of his left hand touching it culling out its secrets Finish your business as soon as you can Is that your advice Aye dearheart Before your business finishes you Three Eddie sat on the back porch of the rectory as midnight came and what these folk would ever after call The Day of the East Road Battle passed into history after which it would pass into mythalways assuming the world held together long enough for it to happen In town the sounds of celebration had grown increasingly loud and feverish until Eddie seriously began to wonder if they might not set the entire high street afire And would he mind Not a whit say thanks and youre welcome too While Roland Susannah Jake Eddie and three women  Sisters of Oriza they called themselves  stood against the Wolves the rest of the Callafolkenhad either been cowering back in town or in the rice by the riverbank Yet ten years from now  maybe even five  they would be telling each other about how theyd bagged their limit one day in autumn standing shoulder to shoulder with the gunslingers It wasnt fair and part of him knew it wasnt fair but never in his life had he felt so helpless so lost and so consequently mean He would tell himself not to think of Susannah to wonder where she was or if her demon child had yet been delivered and find himself thinking of her anyway She had gone to New York of that much he was sure But when Were people traveling in hansom cabs by gaslight or jetting around in antigrav taxis driven by robots from North Central Positronics Is she even alive He would have shuddered away from this thought if he could have but the mind could be so cruel He kept seeing her in the gutter somewhere down in Alphabet City with a swastika carved on her forehead and a placard reading GREETINGS FROM YOUR FRIENDS IN OXFORD TOWN hung around her neck Behind him the door from the rectorys kitchen opened There was the soft padding sound of bare feet his ears were sharp now trained like the rest of his killers equipment and the click of toenails Jake and Oy The kid sat down next to him in Callahans rocking chair He was dressed and wearing his dockers clutch In it was the Ruger Jake had stolen from his father on the day he had run away from home Today it had drawnwell not blood Not yet Oil Eddie smiled a little There was no humor in it Cant sleep Jake Ake Oy agreed and collapsed at Jakes feet muzzle resting on the boards between his paws No Jake said I keep thinking about Susannah He paused then added And Benny Eddie knew that was natural the boy had seen his friend blown apart before his very eyes ofcourse hed be thinking about him but Eddie still felt a bitter spurt of jealousy as if all of Jakes regard should have been saved for Eddie Deans wife That Tavery kid Jake said Its his fault Panicked Got running Broke his ankle If not for him Bennyd still be alive And very softly  it would have chilled the heart of the boy in question had he heard it Eddie had no doubt of that  Jake said FrankfuckingTavery Eddie reached out a hand that did not want to comfort and made it touch the kids head His hair was long Needed a wash Hell needed a cut Needed a mother to make sure the boy under it took care of it No mother now though not for Jake And a little miracle giving comfort made Eddie feel better Not a lot but a little Let it go he said Done is done Ka Jake said bitterly Kiyet ka Oy said without raising his muzzle Amen Jake said and laughed It was disturbing in its coldness Jake took the Ruger from its makeshift holster and looked at it This one will go through because it came from the other side Thats what Roland says The others may too because we wont be going todash If they dont Henchick will cache them in the cave and maybe we can come back for them If we wind up in New York Eddie said therell be plenty of guns And well find them Not like Rolands I hope like hell they go through There arent any guns left in any of the worlds like his Thats what I think It was what Eddie thought too but he didnt bother saying so From town there came a rattle of firecrackers then silence It was winding down there Winding down at last Tomorrow there would undoubtedly be an allday party on the common a continuation of todays celebration but a little less drunk and a little more coherent Roland and his katet would be expected as guests of honor but if the gods of creation were good and the door opened they would be gone Hunting Susannah Finding her Never mind huntingFinding As if reading his thoughts and he could do that he was strong in the touch Jake said Shes still alive How can you know that We would have felt it if she was gone Jake can you touch her No but   Before he could finish a deep rumbling came from the earth The porch suddenly began to rise and fall like a boat on a heavy sea They could hear the boards groaning From the kitchen came the sound of rattling china like chattering teeth Oy raised his head and whined His foxy little face was comically startled his ears laid back along his skull In Callahans parlor something fell over and shattered Eddies first thought illogical but strong was that Jake had killed Suze simply by declaring her still alive For a moment the shaking intensified A window shattered as its frame was twisted out of shape There was a crump from the darkness Eddie assumed  correctly  that it was the ruined privy now falling down completely He was on his feet without realizing it Jake was standing beside him gripping his wrist Eddie had drawn Rolands gun and now they both stood as if ready to begin shooting There was a final grumbling from deep in the earth and then the porch settled under their feet At certain key points along the Beam people were waking up and looking around dazed In the streets of one New York when a few car alarms were going off The following days papers would report a minor earthquake broken windows no reported casualties Just a little shake of the fundamentally sound bedrock Jake was looking at Eddie eyes wide And knowing The door opened behind them and Callahan came out onto the porch dressed in flimsy white underpants that fell to his knees The only other thing on him was the gold crucifix around his neck It was an earthquake wasnt it he said I felt one in northern California once but never since coming to the Calla It was a hell of a lot more than an earthquake Eddie said and pointed The screenedin porch looked east and over there the horizon was lit by silent artillery bursts of green lightning Downhill from the rectory the door of Rosalitas snug creaked open and then banged shut She and Roland came up the hill together she in her chemise and the gunslinger in a pair of jeans both barefoot in the dew Eddie Jake and Callahan went down to them Roland was looking fixedly at the already diminishing flickers of lightning in the east where the land of Thunderclap waited for them and the Court of the Crimson King and at the end of EndWorld the Dark Tower itself IfEddie thoughtIf it still stands Jake was just saying that if Susannah died wed know it Eddie said That thered be what you call a sigul Then comes this He pointed to the Peres lawn where a new ridge had humped up peeling the sod apart in one tenfoot line to show the puckered brown lips of the earth A chorus of dogs was barking in town but there were no sounds from thefolken at least not yet Eddie supposed a goodly number had slept through the whole thing The sleep of the drunken victorious But it wasnt anything to do with Suze Was it Not directly no And it wasnt ours Jake put in or the damage would have been a lot worse Dont you think Roland nodded Rosa looked at Jake with a mixture of puzzlement and fright Wasnt ourwhat boy What are you talking about It wasnt an earthquake sure No Roland said aBeam quake One of the Beams holding up the Tower  which holds up everything  just let go Just snapped Even in the faint light from the four seners flickering on the porch Eddie saw Rosalita Munozs face lose its color She crossed herself ABeam One of theBeams Say no Say not true Eddie found himself thinking of some longago baseball scandal Of some little boy beggingSay it aint so Joe I cant Roland told her because it is How many of these Beams are there Callahan asked Roland looked at Jake and nodded slightlySay your lesson Jake of New York  speak and be true Six Beams connecting twelve portals Jake said The twelve portals are at the twelve ends of the earth Roland Eddie and Susannah really started their quest from the Portal of the Bear and picked me up between there and Lud Shardik Eddie said He was watching the last flickers of lightning in the east That was the bears name Yes Shardik Jake agreed So were on the Beam of the Bear All the Beams come together at the Dark Tower Our Beam on the other side of the Tower He looked at Roland for help Roland in turn looked at Eddie Dean Even now it seemed Roland was not done teaching them the Way of Eld Eddie either didnt see the look or chose to ignore it but Roland would not be put off Eddie he murmured Were on the Path of the Bear Way of the Turtle Eddie said absently I dont know why it would ever matter since the Towers as far as were going but on the other side its the Path of the Turtle Way of the Bear And he recited See the TURTLE of enormous girth On his shell he holds the earth His thought is slow but always kind He holds us all within his mind At this point Rosalita took up the verse On his back the truth is carried And there are love and duty married He loves the earth and loves the sea And even loves a child like me Not quite the way I learned it in my cradle and taught it to my friends Roland said but close enough by watch and by warrant The Great Turtles name is Maturin Jake said and shrugged If it matters You have no way of telling which one broke Callahan said studying Roland closely Roland shook his head All I know is that Jakes right  it wasnt ours If it had been nothing within a hundred miles of Calla Bryn Sturgis would be standing Or maybe within a thousand miles  who could know The very birds would have fallen flaming from the sky You speak of Armageddon Callahan said in a low troubled voice Roland shook his head but not in disagreement I dont know that word Pere but Im speaking of great death and great destruction sure And somewhere  along the Beam connecting Fish to Rat perhaps  that has now happened Are you positive this is true Rosa asked low Roland nodded He had been through this once before when Gilead fell and civilization as he then understood it had ended When he had been cast loose to wander with Cuthbert and Alain and Jamie and the few others of their katet One of the six Beams had broken then and almost certainly not the first How many Beams remain to hold the Tower Callahan asked For the first time Eddie seemed interested in something other than the fate of his lost wife He was looking at Roland with what was almost attention And why not This was after all the crucial questionAll things serve the Beam they said and although the actual truth was that all things served the Tower it was the Beams which held the Tower up If they snapped  Two Roland said There have to be at least two Id say The one running through Calla Bryn Sturgis and another But God knows how long theyll hold Even without the Breakers working on them I doubt theyd hold for long We have to hurry Eddie had stiffened If youre suggesting we go on without Suze   Roland shook his head impatiently as if to tell Eddie not to be a fool We cant win through to the Tower without her For all I know we cant win through without Mias chap Its in the hands of ka and there used to be a saying in my country Ka has no heart or mind  That one I can agree with Eddie said We might have another problem Jake said Eddie frowned at him We dontneed another problem I know butwhat if the earthquake blocked the mouth of that cave Or Jake hesitated then reluctantly brought out what he was really afraid of Or knocked it down completely Eddie reached out took hold of Jakes shirt and bundled it into his fist Dont say that Dont you eventhink that Now they could hear voices from town Thefolken would be gathering on the common again Roland guessed He further guessed that this day  and now this night  would be remembered in Calla Bryn Sturgis for a thousand years If the Tower stood that was Eddie let go of Jakes shirt and then pawed at the place he had grabbed as if to erase the wrinkles He tried a smile that made him look feeble and old Roland turned to Callahan Will the Manni still turn up tomorrow You know this bunch better than I Callahan shrugged Henchicks a man of his word Whether he can hold the others to his word after what just happenedthat Roland I dont know He better be able to Eddie said darkly He just better be Roland of Gilead said Whos for Watch Me Eddie looked at him unbelieving Were going to be up until morning light the gunslinger said We might as well pass the time So they played Watch Me and Rosalita won hand after hand adding up their scores on a piece of slate with no smile of triumph  with no expression at all that Jake could read At least not at first He was tempted to try the touch but had decided that to use it for any but the strongest reasons was wrong Using it to see behind Rosas poker face would be like watching her undress Or watching her and Roland make love Yet as the game went on and the northeast finally began to grow lighter Jake guessed he knew what she was thinking of after all because it was whathe was thinking of On some level of their minds all of them would be thinking of those last two Beams from now until the end Waiting for one or both of them to snap Whether it was them trailing Susannah or Rosa cooking her dinner or even Ben Slightman mourning his dead son out there on Vaughn Eisenharts ranch all of them would now be thinking of the same thing only two left and the Breakers working against them night and day eating into themkilling them How long before everything ended Andhow would it end Would they hear the vast rumble of those enormous slatecolored stones as they fell Would the sky tear open like a flimsy piece of cloth spilling out the monstrosities that lived in the todash darkness Would there be time to cry out Would there be an afterlife or would even Heaven and Hell be obliterated by the fall of the Dark Tower He looked at Roland and sent a thought as clearly as he couldRoland help us And one came back filling his mind with cold comfort ah but comfort served cold was better than no comfort at allIf I can Watch Me said Rosalita and laid down her cards She had built Wands the high run and the card on top was Madame Death STAVE Commalacomecome Theres a young man with a gun Young man lost his honey When she took it on the run RESPONSE Commalacomeone She took it on the run Left her baby lonely but Her baby aint done One They neednt have worried about the Mannifolk showing up Henchick dour as ever appeared at the town common which had been the designated settingout point with forty men He assured Roland it would be enough to open the Unfound Door if it could indeed be opened now that what he called the dark glass was gone The old man offered no word of apology for showing up with less than the promised number of men but he kept tugging on his beard Sometimes with both hands Why does he do that Pere do you know Jake asked Callahan Henchicks troops were rolling eastward in a dozen bucka waggons Behind these drawn by a pair of albino asses with freakishly long ears and fiery pink eyes was a twowheeled fly completely covered in white duck To Jake it looked like a big JiffyPop container on wheels Henchick rode upon this contraption alone gloomily yanking at his chinwhiskers I think it means hes embarrassed Callahan said I dont see why Im surprised so many showed up after the Beamquake and all What he learned when the ground shook is that some of his men were more afraid of that than of him As far as Henchicks concerned it adds up to an unkept promise Not justany unkept promise either but one he made to your dinh Hes lost face And without changing his tone of voice at all tricking him into an answer he would not otherwise have given Callahan asked Is she still alive then your molly Yes but in ter  Jake began then covered his mouth He looked at Callahan accusingly Ahead of them on the seat of the twowheeled fly Henchick looked around startled as if they had raised their voices in argument Callahan wondered if everyone in this damned story had the touch but him Its not a story Its not a story its my life But it was hard to believe that wasnt it when youd seen yourself set in type as a major character in a book with the word FICTION on the copyright page Doubleday and Company  A book about vampires yet which everyoneknew werent real Except they had been And in at least some of the worlds adjacent to this one still were Dont treat me like that Jake said Donttrick me like that Not if were all on the same side Pere Okay Im sorry Callahan said And then Cry pardon Jake smiled wanly and stroked Oy who was riding in the front pocket of his poncho Is she   The boy shook his head I dont want to talk about her now Pere Its best we not even think about her I have a feeling  I dont know if its true or not but its strong  that somethings looking for her If there is its better it not overhear us And it could Something Jake reached out and touched the kerchief Callahan wore around his neck cowboystyle It was red Then he put a hand briefly over his left eye For a moment Callahan didnt understand and then he did The red eye The Eye of the King He sat back on the seat of the waggon and said no more Behind them not talking Roland and Eddie rode horseback side by side Both were carrying their gunna as well as their guns and Jake had his own in the waggon behind him If they came back to Calla Bryn Sturgis after today it wouldnt be for long In terrorwas what he had started to say but it was worse than that Impossibly faint impossibly distant but still clear Jake could hear Susannah screaming He only hoped Eddie did not Two So they rode away from a town that mostly slept in emotional exhaustion despite the quake which had struck it The day was cool enough so that when they started out they could see their breath on the air and a light scrim of frost coated the dead cornstalks A mist hung over the Devartete Whye like the rivers own spent breath Roland thoughtThis is the edge of winter An hours ride brought them to the arroyo country There was no sound but the jingle of trace the squeak of wheels the clop of horses an occasional sardonic honk from one of the albino asses pulling the fly and distant the call of rusties on the wing Headed south perhaps if they could still find it Ten or fifteen minutes after the land began to rise on their right filling in with bluffs and cliffs and mesas they returned to the place where just twentyfour hours before they had come with the children of the Calla and fought their battle Here a track split off from the East Road and rambled more or less northwest In the ditch on the other side of the road was a raw trench of earth It was the hide where Roland his katet and the ladies of the dish had waited for the Wolves And speaking of the Wolves where were they When theyd left this place of ambush it had been littered with bodies Over sixty all told manshaped creatures who had come riding out of the west wearing gray pants green cloaks and snarling wolfmasks Roland dismounted and walked up beside Henchick who was getting down from the twowheeled fly with the stiff awkwardness of age Roland made no effort to help him Henchick wouldnt expect it might even be offended by it The gunslinger let him give his dark cloak a final settling shake started to ask his question and then realized he didnt have to Forty or fifty yards farther along on the right side of the road was a vast hill of uprooted cornplants where no hill had been the day before It was a funerary heap Roland saw one which had been constructed without any degree of respect He hadnt lost any time or wasted any effort wondering how thefolken had spent the previous afternoon  before beginning the party they were now undoubtedly sleeping off  but now he saw their work before him Had they been afraid the Wolves might come back to life he wondered and knew that on some level that was exactly what theyd feared And so theyd dragged the heavy inert bodies gray horses as well as grayclad Wolves off into the corn stacked them willyrully then covered them with uprooted cornplants Today theyd turn this bier into a pyre And if the seminon winds came Roland guessed theyd light it up anyway and chance a possible conflagration in the fertile land between road and river Why not The growing season was over for the year and there was nothing like fire for fertilizer so the old folks did say besides thefolken would not really rest easy until that hill was burned And even then few of them would like to come out here Roland look Eddie said in a voice that trembled somewhere between sorrow and rage Ah goddammitlook  Near the end of the path where Jake Benny Slightman and the Tavery twins had waited before making their final dash for safety across the road stood a scratched and battered wheelchair its chrome winking brilliantly in the sun its seat streaked with dust and blood The left wheel was bent severely out of true Why doee speak in anger Henchick inquired He had been joined by Cantab and half a dozen elders of what Eddie sometimes referred to as the Cloak Folk Two of these elders looked a good deal older than Henchick himself and Roland thought of what Rosalita had said last nightMany of them nigh as old as Henchick trying to climb that path after dark Well it wasnt dark but he didnt know if some of these would be able to walk as far as the upsy part of the path to Doorway Cave let alone the rest of the way to the top They brought your womans rolling chair back here to honor her And you So why doee speak in anger Because its not supposed to be all banged up and shes supposed to be in it Eddie told the old man Do you ken that Henchick Anger is the most useless emotion Henchick intoned destructive to the mind and hurtful of the heart Eddies lips thinned to no more than a white scar below his nose but he managed to hold in a retort He walked over to Susannahs scarred chair  it had rolled hundreds of miles since theyd found it in Topeka but its rolling days were done  and looked down at it moodily When Callahan approached him Eddie waved the Pere back Jake was looking at the place on the road where Benny had been struck and killed The boys body was gone of course and someone had covered his spilled blood with a fresh layer of the oggan but Jake found he could see the dark splotches anyway And Bennys severed arm lying palmup Jake remembered how his friends Da had staggered out of the corn and seen his son lying there For five seconds or so he had been capable of no sound whatever and Jake supposed that was time enough for someone to have told sai Slightman theyd gotten off incredibly light one dead boy one dead ranchers wife another boy with a broken ankle Piece of cake really But no one had and then Slightman the Elder had shrieked Jake thought he would never forget the sound of that shriek just as he would always see Benny lying here in the dark and bloody dirt with his arm off Beside the place where Benny had fallen was something else which had been covered with dirt Jake could see just a small wink of metal He dropped to one knee and excavated one of the Wolves deathballs things called sneetches The Harry Potter model according to what was written on them Yesterday hed held a couple of these in his hand and felt them vibrating Heard their faint malevolent hum This one was as dead as a rock Jake stood up and threw it toward the heap of corncovered dead Wolves Threw hard enough to make his arm hurt That arm would probably be stiff tomorrow but he didnt care Didnt care much about Henchicks low opinion of anger either Eddie wanted his wife back Jake wanted his friend And while Eddie might get whathe wanted somewhere down the line Jake Chambers never would Because dead was the gift that kept on giving Dead like diamonds was forever He wanted to get going wanted this part of the East Road looking at his back He also wanted not to have to look at Susannahs empty beatup chair any longer But the Manni had formed a ring around the spot where the battle had actually taken place and Henchick was praying in a high rapid voice that hurt Jakes ears it sounded quite a lot like the squeal of a frightened pig He spoke to something called the Over asking for safe passage to yon cave and success of endeavor with no loss of life or sanity Jake found this part of Henchicks prayer especially disturbing as hed never thought of sanity as a thing to be prayed for The bossman also begged the Over to enliven their mags and bobs And finally he prayed for kaven the persistence of magic a phrase that seemed to have a special power for these people When he was finished they all said Oversam Overkra Overcantah in unison and dropped their linked hands A few went down on their knees to have a little extra palaver with the reallybig boss Cantab meanwhile led four or five of the younger men to the fly They folded back its snowy white top revealing a number of large wooden boxes Plumbbobs and magnets Jake guessed and a lot bigger than the ones they wore around their necks Theyd brought out the heavy artillery for this little adventure The boxes were covered with designs  stars and moons and odd geometric shapes  that looked cabalistic rather than Christian But Jake realized he had no basis for believing the Manni were Christians They mightlook like Quakers or Amish with their cloaks and beards and roundcrowned black hats might throw the occasionalthee orthou into their conversation but so far as Jake knew neither the Quakers nor the Amish had ever made a hobby of traveling to other worlds Long polished wooden rods were pulled from another wagon They were thrust through metal sleeves on the undersides of the engraved boxes The boxes were called coffs Jake learned The Manni carried them like religious artifacts through the streets of a medieval town Jake supposed that in a way theywere religious artifacts They started up the path which was still scattered with hairribbons scraps of cloth and a few small toys These had been bait for the Wolves and the bait had been taken When they reached the place where Frank Tavery had gotten his foot caught Jake heard the voice of the useless gits beautiful sister in his mindHelp him please sai I beg He had God forgive him And Benny had died Jake looked away grimacing then thoughtYoure a gunslinger now you gotta do better He forced himself to look back Pere Callahans hand dropped onto his shoulder Son are you all right Youre awfully pale Im okay Jake said A lump had risen in his throat quite a large one but he forced himself to swallow past it and repeat what hed just said telling the lie to himself rather than to the Pere Yeah Im okay Callahan nodded and shifted his own gunna the halfhearted packsack of a town man who does not in his heart believe hes going anywhere from his left shoulder to his right And whats going to happen when we get up to that caveIf we can get up to that cave Jake shook his head He didnt know Three The path was okay A good deal of loose rock had shaken down on it and the going was arduous for the men carrying the coffs but in one respect their way was easier than before The quake had dislodged the giant boulder that had almost blocked the path near the top Eddie peered over and saw it lying far below shattered into two pieces There was some sort of lighter sparkly stuff in its middle making it look to Eddie like the worlds largest hardboiled egg The cave was still there too although a large pile of talus now lay in front of its mouth Eddie joined some of the younger Manni in helping to clear it tossing handfuls of bustedup shale garnets gleaming in some of the pieces like drops of blood over the side Seeing the caves mouth eased a band which had been squeezing Eddies heart but he didnt like the silence of the cave which had been damnably chatty on his previous visit From somewhere deep in its gullet he could hear the grating whine of a draft but that was all Where was his brother Henry Henry should have been bitching about how Balazars gentlemen had killed him and it was all Eddies fault Where was his Ma who should have been agreeing with Henry and in equally dolorous tones Where was Margaret Eisenhart complaining to Henchick her grandfather about how shed been branded forgetful and then abandoned This had been the Cave of the Voices long before it had been the Doorway Cave but the voices had fallen silent And the door lookedstupidwas the word which first came to Eddies mind The second wasunimportant This cave had once been informed and defined by the voices from below the door had been rendered awful and mysterious and powerful by the glass ball  Black Thirteen  which had come into the Calla through it But now its left the same way and its just an old door that doesnt  Eddie tried to stifle the thought and couldnt  that doesnt go anywhere He turned to Henchick disgusted by the sudden welling of tears in his eyes but unable to stop them Theres no magic left here he said His voice was wretched with despair Theres nothing behind that fucking door but stale air and fallen rock Youre a fool and Im another There were shocked gasps at this but Henchick looked at Eddie with eyes that almost seemed to twinkle Lewis Thonnie he said almost jovially Bring me the Branni coff Two strapping young men with short beards and hair pulled back in long braids stepped forward Between them they bore an ironwood coff about four feet long and heavy from the way they carried the poles They set it before Henchick Open it Eddie of New York Thonnie and Lewis looked at him questioning and a little afraid The older Manni men Eddie saw were watching with a kind of greedy interest He supposed it took a few years to become fully invested in the Manni brand of extravagant weirdness in time Lewis and Thonnie would get there but they hadnt made it much past peculiar as yet Henchick nodded a little impatiently Eddie bent and opened the box It was easy There was no lock Inside was a silk cloth Henchick removed it with a magicians flourish and disclosed a plumbbob on a chain To Eddie it looked like an oldfashioned childs top and was nowhere near as big as he had expected It was perhaps eighteen inches long from its pointed tip to its broader top and made of some yellowish wood that looked greasy It was on a silver chain that had been looped around a crystal plug set in the coffs top Take it out Henchick said and when Eddie looked to Roland the hair over the old mans mouth opened and a set of perfect white teeth displayed themselves in a smile of astounding cynicism Why doee look to your dinh young snivelment The magics gone out of this place you said so yourself And wouldee not know Why thee must be all ofI dont knowtwentyfive Snickers from the Manni who were close enough to hear this jape several of them not yet twentyfive themselves Furious with the old bastard  and with himself as well  Eddie reached into the box Henchick stayed his hand Touch not the bob itself Not if theed keep thy cream in on one side and thy crap on the other By the chain doee kennit Eddie almost reached for the bob anyway  hed already made a fool of himself in front of these people there was really no reason not to finish the job  but he looked into Jakes grave gray eyes and changed his mind The wind was blowing hard up here chilling the sweat of the climb on his skin making him shiver Eddie reached forward again took hold of the chain and gingerly unwound it from the plug Lift him out Henchick said Whatll happen Henchick nodded as if Eddie had finally talked some sense Thats to see Lift him out Eddie did so Given the obvious effort with which the two young men had been carrying the box he was astounded at how light the bob was Lifting it was like lifting a feather which had been attached to a fourfoot length of finelink chain He looped the chain over the back of his fingers and held his hand in front of his eyes He looked a little like a man about to make a puppet caper Eddie was about to ask Henchick again what the old man expected to happen but before he could the bob began to sway back and forth in modest arcs Im not doing that Eddie said At least I dont think I am It must be the wind I dont think it can be Callahan said There are no flukes to   Hush Cantab said and with such a forbidding look that Callahan did hush Eddie stood in front of the cave with all the arroyo country and most of Calla Bryn Sturgis spread out below him Dreaming bluegray in the far distance was the forest through which they had come to get here  the last vestige of MidWorld where they would never go more The wind gusted blowing his hair back from his forehead and suddenly he heard a humming sound Except he didnt The humming was inside the hand in front of his eyes the one with the chain lying upon the spread fingers It was in his arm And most of all in his head At the far end of the chain at about the height of Eddies right knee the bobs swing grew more pronounced and became the arc of a pendulum Eddie realized a strange thing each time the bob reached the end of its swing it grew heavier It was like holding onto something that was being pulled by some extraordinary centrifugal force The arc grew longer the bobs swings faster the pull at the end of each swing stronger And then  Eddie Jake called somewhere between concern and delight Do you see Of course he did Now the bob was growingdim at the end of each swing The downward pressure on his arm  the bobs weight  was rapidly growing stronger as this happened He had to support his right arm with his left hand in order to maintain his grip and now he was also swaying at the hips with the swing of the bob Eddie suddenly remembered where he was  roughly seven hundred feet above the ground This baby would shortly yank him right over the side if it wasnt stopped What if he couldnt get the chain off his hand The plumbbob swung to the right tracing the shape of an invisible smile in the air gaining weight as it rose toward the end of its arc All at once the puny piece of wood hed lifted from its box with such ease seemed to weigh sixty eighty a hundred pounds And as it paused at the end of its arc momentarily balanced between motion and gravity he realized he could see the East Road through it not just clearly butmagnified Then the Branni bob started back down again plummeting shedding weight But when it started up again this time to his left Okay I get the point Eddie shouted Get it off me Henchick At least make it stop Henchick uttered a single word one so guttural it sounded like something yanked from a mudflat The bob didnt slow through a series of diminishing arcs but simply quit again hanging beside Eddies knee with the tip pointing at his foot For a moment the humming in his arm and head continued Then that also quit When it did the bobs disquieting sense of weight lifted The damn thing was once more featherlight Doee have something to say to me Eddie of New York Henchick asked Yeah cry your pardon Henchicks teeth once more put in an appearance gleaming briefly in the wilderness of his beard and then gone Thees not entirely slow is thee I hope not Eddie said and could not forbear a small sigh of relief as Henchick of the Manni lifted the finelink silver chain from his hand Four Henchick insisted on a dryrun Eddie understood why but he hated all this foreplay crap The passing time now seemed almost to be a physical thing like a rough piece of cloth slipping beneath the palm of your hand He kept silent nevertheless Hed already pissed off Henchick once and once was enough The old man brought six of hisamigos five of them looked older than God to Eddie into the cave He passed bobs to three of them and shellshaped magnets to the other three The Branni bob almost certainly the tribes strongest he kept for himself The seven of them formed a ring at the mouth of the cave Not around the door Roland asked Not until we have to Henchick said The old men joined hands each holding a bob or a mag at the clasping point As soon as the circle was complete Eddie heard that humming again It was as loud as an overamped stereo speaker He saw Jake raise his hands to his ears and Rolands face tighten in a brief grimace Eddie looked at the door and saw it had lost that dusty unimportant look The hieroglyphs on it once more stood out crisply some forgotten word that meant UNFOUND The crystal doorknob glowed outlining the rose carved there in lines of white light Could I open it nowEddie wonderedOpen it and step through He thought not Not yet anyway But he was a hell of a lot more hopeful about this process than hed been five minutes ago Suddenly the voices from deep in the cave came alive but they did so in a roaring jumble Eddie could make out Benny Slightman the Younger screaming the wordDogan heard his Ma telling him that now to top off a career of losing things hed lost hiswife heard some man probably Elmer Chambers telling Jake that Jake had gone crazy he wasfou he wasMonsieur Lunatique More voices joined in and more and more Henchick nodded sharply to his colleagues Their hands parted When they did the voices from below ceased in midbabble And Eddie was not surprised to see the door immediately regained its look of unremarkable anonymity  it was any door you ever passed on the street without a second look What in Gods name wasthat  Callahan asked nodding toward the deeper darkness where the floor sloped down It wasnt like that before I believe that either the quake or the loss of the magic ball has driven the cave insane Henchick said calmly It doesnt matter to our business here anyroa Our business is with the door He looked at Callahans packsack Once you were a wandering man So I was Henchicks teeth made another brief guest appearance Eddie decided that on some level the old bastard was enjoying this From the look of your gunna sai Callahan youve lost the knack I suppose its hard for me to believe that were really going anywhere Callahan said and offered a smile Compared to Henchicks it was feeble And Im older now Henchick made a rude sound at that  fahit sounded like Henchick Roland said do you know what caused the ground to shake early this morning The old mans blue eyes were faded but still sharp He nodded Outside the caves mouth in a line going down the path almost three dozen Manni men waited patiently Beam let go is what we think What I think too Roland said Our business grows more desperate Id have an end to idle talk if it does ya Lets have what palaver we must have and then get on with our business Henchick looked at Roland as coldly as he had looked at Eddie but Rolands eyes never wavered Henchicks brow furrowed then smoothed out Aye he said Asee will Roland Thees rendered us a great service Manni and forgetful folk alike and wed return it now as best we can The magics still here and thick Wants only a spark We can make that spark aye easy as commala You may get whatee want On the other hand we all may go to the clearing at the end of the path together Or into the darkness Does thee understand Roland nodded Wouldee go ahead Roland stood for a moment with his head lowered and his hand on the butt of his gun When he looked up he was wearing his own smile It was handsome and tired and desperate and dangerous He twirled his whole left hand twice in the airLets go Five The coffs were set down  carefully because the path leading up to what the Manni called Kra Kammen was narrow  and the contents were removed Longnailed fingers the Manni were allowed to cut their nails only once a year tapped the magnets producing a shrill hum that seemed to slice through Jakes head like a knife It reminded him of the todash chimes and he guessed that wasnt surprising those chimeswere the kammen What does Kra Kammen mean he asked Cantab House of Bells House of Ghosts he replied without looking up from the chain he was unwinding Leave me alone Jake this is delicate work Jake couldnt see why it would be but he did as bade Roland Eddie and Callahan were standing just inside the caves mouth Jake joined them Henchick meanwhile had placed the oldest members of his group in a semicircle that went around the back of the door The front side with its incised hieroglyphs and crystal doorknob was unguarded at least for the time being The old man went to the mouth of the cave spoke briefly with Cantab then motioned for the line of Manni waiting on the path to move up When the first man in line was just inside the cave Henchick stopped him and came back to Roland He squatted inviting the gunslinger with a gesture to do the same The caves floor was powdery with dust Some came from rocks but most of it was the bone residue of small animals unwise enough to wander in here Using a fingernail Henchick drew a rectangle open at the bottom and then a semicircle around it The door he said And the men of my kra Doee kennit Roland nodded You and your friends will finish the circle he said and drew it The boys strong in the touch Henchick said looking at Jake so suddenly that Jake jumped Yes Roland said Well put him direct in front of the door then but far enough away so that if it opens hard  and it may  it wont clip his head off Willee stand boy Yes until you or Roland says different Jake replied Youll feel something in your head  like a sucking Its not nice He paused Yed open the door twice Yes Roland said Twim Eddie knew the doors second opening was about Calvin Tower and hed lost what interest hed had in the bookstore proprietor The man wasnt entirely without courage Eddie supposed but he was also greedy and stubborn and selfinvolved the perfect twentiethcentury New York City man in other words But the most recent person to use this door had been Suze and the moment it opened he intended to dart through If it opened a second time on the little Maine town where Calvin Tower and his friend Aaron Deepneau had gone to earth fine and dandy If the rest of them wound up there trying to protect Tower and gain ownership of a certain vacant lot and a certain wild pink rose also fine and dandy Eddies priority was Susannah Everything else was secondary to that Even the tower Six Henchick said Who wouldee send the first time the door opens Roland thought about this absently running his hand over the bookcase Calvin Tower had insisted on sending through The case containing the book which had so upset the Pere He did not much want to send Eddie a man who was impulsive to begin with and now all but blinded by his concern and his love after his wife Yet would Eddie obey him if Roland ordered him after Tower and Deepneau instead Roland didnt think so Which meant  Gunslinger Henchick prodded The first time the door opens Eddie and I will go through Roland said The door will shut on its own Indeed it will Henchick said You must be as quick as the devils bite or youll likely be cut in two half of you on the floor of this cave and the rest wherever the brownskinned woman took herself off to Well be as quick as we can sure Roland said Aye thats best Henchick said and put his teeth on display once more This was a smile whats he not telling something he knows or only thinks he knows Roland would have occasion to think of not long hence Id leave your guns here Henchick said If you try to carry them through you may lose them Im going to try and keep mine Jake said It came from the other side so it should be all right If its not Ill get another one Somehow I expect mine may travel as well Roland said Hed thought about this carefully and had decided to try and keep the big revolvers Henchick shrugged as if to sayAs you will What about Oy Jake Eddie asked Jakes eyes widened and his jaw dropped Roland realized the boy hadnt considered his bumbler friend until this moment The gunslinger reflected not for the first time how easy it was to forget the most basic truth about John Jake Chambers he was just a kid When we went todash Oy   Jake began This aint that sugar Eddie said and when he heard Susannahs endearment coming out of his mouth his heart gave a sad cramp For the first time he admitted to himself that he might never see her again any more than Jake might see Oy once they left this stinking cave But Jake began and then Oy gave a reproachful little bark Jake had been squeezing him too tightly Well keep him for you Jake Cantab said gently Keep him very well say true Therell be folk posted here until thee comes back for thy friend and all the rest of thy goodsIf you ever do was the part he was too kind to state Roland read it in his eyes however Roland are you sure I cantthat he cantno I see Not todash this time Okay No Jake reached into the front pocket of the poncho lifted Oy out set him on the powdery floor of the cave He bent down hands planted just above his knees Oy looked up stretching his neck so that their faces almost touched And Roland now saw something extraordinary not the tears in Jakes eyes but those that had begun to well up in Oys A billybumbler crying It was the sort of story you might hear in a saloon as the night grew late and drunk  the faithful bumbler who wept for his departing master You didnt believe such stories but never said so in order to save brawling perhaps even shooting Yet here it was he was seeing it and it made Roland feel a bit like crying himself Was it just more bumbler imitation or did Oy really understand what was happening Roland hoped for the former and with all his heart Oy you have to stay with Cantab for a little while Youll be okay Hes a pal Tab the bumbler repeated Tears fell from his muzzle and darkened the powdery surface where he stood in dimesized drops Roland found the creatures tears uniquely awful somehow even worse than a childs might have been AkeAke  No I gotta split Jake said and wiped at his cheeks with the heels of his hands He left dirty streaks like warpaint all the way up to his temples No Ake I gotta You stay with Cantab Ill come back for you Oy  unless Im dead Ill come back He hugged Oy again then stood up Go to Cantab Thats him Jake pointed Go on now you mind me Ake Tab The misery in that voice was impossible to deny For a moment Oy stayed where he was Then still weeping  or imitating Jakes tears Roland still hoped for that  the bumbler turned trotted to Cantab and sat between the young mans dusty shorboots Eddie attempted to put an arm around Jake Jake shook it off and stepped away from him Eddie looked baffled Roland kept his Watch Me face but inside he was grimly delighted Not thirteen yet no but there was no shortage of steel there And it was time Henchick Aye Wouldee speak a word of prayer first Roland To whatever God thee holds I hold to no God Roland said I hold to the Tower and wont pray to that Several of Henchicksmigos looked shocked at this but the old man himself only nodded as if he had expected no more He looked at Callahan Pere Callahan said God Thy hand Thy will He sketched a cross in the air and nodded at Henchick If were goin lets go Henchick stepped forward touched the Unfound Doors crystal knob then looked at Roland His eyes were bright Hear me this last time Roland of Gilead I hear you very well I am Henchick of the Manni Kra RedpathaSturgis We are farseers and far travelers We are sailors on kas wind Would thee travel on that wind Thee and thine Aye to where it blows Henchick slipped the chain of the Branni bob over the back of his hand and Roland at once felt some power let loose in this chamber It was small as yet but it was growing Blooming like a rose How many calls would you make Roland held up the remaining fingers of his right hand Two Which is to saytwim in the Eld Two or twim both the same Henchick said Commalacometwo he raised his voice Come Manni Comecommala join your force to my force Come and keep your promise Come and pay our debt to these gunslingers Help me send them on their wayNow  Seven Before any of them could even begin to register the fact that ka had changed their plans ka had worked its will on them But at first it seemed that nothing at all would happen The Manni Henchick had chosen as senders  six elders plus Cantab  formed their semicircle behind the door and around to its sides Eddie took Cantabs hand and laced his fingers through the Mannis One of the shellshaped magnets kept their palms apart Eddie could feel it vibrating like something alive He supposed it was Callahan took his other hand and gripped it firmly On the other side of the door Roland took Henchicks hand weaving the Branni bobs chain between his fingers Now the circle was complete save for the one spot directly in front of the door Jake took a deep breath looked around saw Oy sitting against the wall of the cave about ten feet behind Cantab and nodded Oy stay Ill be backJake sent and then he stepped into his place He took Callahans right hand hesitated and then took Rolands left The humming returned at once The Branni bob began to move not in arcs this time but in a small tight circle The door brightened and became morethere  Jake saw this with his own eyes The lines and circles of the hieroglyphs spelling UNFOUND grew clearer The rose etched into the doorknob began to glow The door however remained closed Concentrate boy That was Henchicks voice so strong in his head that it almost seemed to slosh Jakes brains He lowered his head and looked at the doorknob He saw the rose He saw it very well He imagined it turning as the knob upon which it had been cast turned Once not so long ago he had been obsessed by doors and the other world MidWorld he knew must lie behind one of them This felt like going back to that He imagined all the doors hed known in his life  bedroom doors bathroom doors kitchen doors closet doors bowling alley doors cloakroom doors movie theater doors restaurant doors doors marked KEEP OUT doors marked EMPLOYEES ONLY refrigerator doors yes even those  and then saw them all opening at once Openhe thought at the door feeling absurdly like an Arabian princeling in some ancient storyOpen sesame Open says me From the caves belly far below the voices began to babble once more There was a whooping windy sound the heavy crump of something falling The caves floor trembled beneath their feet as if with another Beamquake Jake paid no mind The feeling of live force in this chamber was very strong now  he could feel it plucking at his skin vibrating in his nose and eyes teasing the hairs out from his scalp  but the door remained shut He bore down more strongly on Rolands hand and the Peres concentrating on firehouse doors police station doors the door to the Principals Office at Piper even a science fiction book hed once read calledThe Door into Summer The smell of the cave  deep must ancient bones distant drafts  seemed suddenly very strong He felt that brilliant exuberant uprush of certainty  Now it will happen now I know it will  yet the door still stayed closed And now he could smell something else Not the cave but the slightly metallic aroma of his own sweat rolling down his face Henchick its not working I dont think I   Nar not yet  and never think thee needs to do it all thyself lad Feel for something between you and the doorsomething like a hookor a thorn As he spoke Henchick nodded at the Manni heading the line of reinforcements Hedron come forward Thonnie take hold of Hedrons shoulders Lewis take hold of Thonnies And on back Do it The line shuffled forward Oy barked doubtfully Feel boy Feel for that hook Its between thee and tdoor Feel for it Jake reached out with his mind while his imagination suddenly bloomed with a powerful and terrifying vividness that was beyond even the clearest dreams He saw Fifth Avenue between Fortyeighth and Sixtieth the twelve blocks where my Christmas bonus disappears every January his father had liked to grumble He saw every door on both sides of the street swinging open at once Fendi Tiffany Bergdorf Goodman Cartier Doubleday Books The Sherry Netherland Hotel He saw an endless hallway floored with brown linoleum and knew it was in the Pentagon He saw doors at least a thousand of them all swinging open at once and generating a hurricane draft Yet the door in front of him the only one that mattered remained closed Yeah but  It was rattling in its frame He could hear it Go kid Eddie said The words came from between clamped teeth If you cant open it knock the fucker down Help me Jake shouted Helpme goddammitAll of you  The force in the cave seemed to double The hum seemed to be vibrating the very bones of Jakes skull His teeth were rattling Sweat ran into his eyes blurring his sight He saw two Henchicks nodding to someone behind him Hedron And behind Hedron Thonnie And behind Thonnie all the rest snaking out of the cave and down thirty feet of the path Get ready lad Henchick said Hedrons hand slipped under Jakes shirt and gripped the waistband of his jeans Jake felt pushed instead of pulled Something in his head bolted forward and for a moment he saw all the doors of a thousand thousand worlds flung wide generating a draft so great it could almost have blown out the sun And then his progress was stopped There was somethingsomething right in front of the door The hook Its the hook He slipped himself over it as if his mind and lifeforce were some sort of loop At the same time he felt Hedron and the others pulling him backward The pain was immediate enormous seeming to tear him apart Then the draining sensation began It was hideous like having someone pull his guts out a loop at a time And always the manic buzzing in his ears and deep in his brain He tried to cry out  No stop let go its too much  and couldnt He tried to scream and heard it but only inside his head God he was caught Caught on the hook and being ripped in two One creaturedid hear his scream Barking furiously Oy darted forward And as he did the Unfound Door sprang open swinging in a hissing arc just in front of Jakes nose BeholdHenchick cried in a voice that was at once terrible and exaltedBehold the door opens Oversam kammen Cantah cankavar kammen Overcantah The others responded but by then Jake Chambers had already been torn loose from Rolands hand on his right By then he was flying but not alone Pere Callahan flew with him Eight There was just time for Eddie to hear New Yorksmell New York and to realize what was happening In a way that was what made it so awful  he was able to register everything going diabolically counter to what he had expected but not able to do anything about it He saw Jake yanked out of the circle and felt Callahans hand ripped out of his own he saw them fly through the air toward the door actually looping the loop in tandem like a couple of fuckedup acrobats Something furry and barking like a motherfucker shot past the side of his head Oy doing barrelrolls his ears laid back and his terrified eyes seeming to start from his head And more Eddie was aware of dropping Cantabs hand and lunging forward toward the door  hisdoorhis city and somewhere in ithis lost and pregnant wife He was aware exquisitely so of the invisible hand thatpushed him back and a voice that spoke but not in words What Eddie heard was far more terrible than any words could have been With words you could argue This was only an inarticulate negation and for all he knew it came from the Dark Tower itself Jake and Callahan were shot like bullets from a gun shot into a darkness filled with the exotic sounds of honking horns and rushing traffic In the distance but clear like the voices you heard in dreams Eddie heard a rapid rapping ecstatic voice streetbopping its message SayGawd brotha thats right sayGawd on Second Avenue sayGawd on Avenue B sayGawd in the Bronx I sayGawd I sayGawd bomb I sayGawd  The voice of an authentic New York crazy if Eddie had ever heard one and it laid his heart open He saw Oy zip through the door like a piece of newspaper yanked up the street in the wake of a speeding car and then the door slammed shut swinging so fast and hard that he had to slit his eyes against the wind it blew into his face a wind that was gritty with the bonedust of this rotten cave Before he could scream his fury the door slapped open again This time he was dazzled by hazy sunshine loaded with birdsong He smelled pine trees and heard the distant backfiring of what sounded like a big truck Then he was sucked into that brightness unable to yell that this was fucked up assbackw  Something collided with the side of Eddies head For one brief moment he was brilliantly aware of his passage between the worlds Then the gunfire Then the killing STAVE Commalacomecoo The windll blow ya through Ya gotta go where kas wind blows ya Cause theres nothin else to do RESPONSE Commalacometwo Nothin else to do Gotta go where kas wind blows ya Cause theres nothin else to do One Until June first of Trudy Damascus was the sort of hardheaded woman whod tell you that most UFOs were weather balloons and those that werent were probably the fabrications of people who wanted to get on TV the Shroud of Turin was some fourteenthcentury con mans trick and that ghosts  Jacob Marleys included  were either the perceptions of the mentally ill or caused by indigestion She was hardheaded sheprided herself on being hardheaded and had nothing even slightly spiritual on her mind as she walked down Second Avenue toward her business an accounting firm called Guttenberg Furth and Patel with her canvas carrybag and her purse slung over her shoulder One of GFPs clients was a chain of toy stores called KidzPlay and KidzPlay owed GFP a goodly sum of money The fact that they were also tottering on the edge of Chapter Eleven meant el zippo to Trudy She wanted that  and had spent most of her lunchhour in a back booth of Denniss Waffles and Pancakes which had been Chew Chew Mamas until  mulling over ways to get it During the last two years she had taken several steps toward changing Guttenberg Furth and Patel to Guttenberg Furth Patel and Damascus forcing KidzPlay to cough up would be yet another step  a long one  in that direction And so as she crossed Fortysixth Street toward the large dark glass skyscraper which now stood on the uptown corner of Second and Fortysixth where there had once been a certain Artistic Deli and then a certain vacant lot Trudy wasnt thinking about gods or ghosts or visitations from the spirit world She was thinking about Richard Goldman the asshole CEO of a certain toy company and how  But that was when Trudys life changed At  PM EDT to be exact She had just reached the curb on the downtown side of the street Was in fact stepping up And all at once a woman appeared on the sidewalk in front of her A wideeyed AfricanAmerican woman There was no shortage of black women in New York City and God knew there had to be a fair percentage of them with wide eyes but Trudy had never seen one emerge directly from thin air before which was what this one did And there was something else something even more unbelievable Ten seconds before Trudy Damascus would have laughed and saidnothing could be more unbelievable than a woman flicking into existence in front of her on a Midtown sidewalk but there was There definitely was And now she knew how all those people who reported seeing flying saucers not to mention ghosts wrapped in clanking chains must feel how they must grow frustrated by the entrenched disbelief of people likewell people like the one Trudy Damascus had been at  PM on that day in June the one who said goodbye for good on the downtown side of Fortysixth Street You could tell peopleYou dont understand this REALLY HAPPENED and it cut zero ice They said stuff likeWell she probably came out from behind the bus shelter and you just didnt notice orShe probably came out of one of the little stores and you just didnt notice You could tell them that therewas no bus shelter on the downtown side of Second and Fortysixth or on the uptown side for that matter and it did no good You could tell them therewere no little stores in that area not since  Hammarskjld Plaza went up and that didnt work either Trudy would soon find these things out for herself and they would drive her close to insanity She was not used to having her perceptions dismissed as no more than a blob of mustard or a bit of underdone potato No bus shelter No little shops There were the steps going up to Hammarskjld Plaza where a few late lunchers were still sitting with their brown bags but the ghostwoman hadnt come from there either The fact was this when Trudy Damascus put her sneakerclad left foot up on the curb the sidewalk directly ahead of her was completely empty As she shifted her weight preparatory to lifting her right foot up from the street a woman appeared For just a moment Trudy could see Second Avenue through her and something else as well something that looked like the mouth of a cave Then that was gone and the woman was solidifying It probably took only a second or two that was Trudys estimate she would later think of that old sayingIf you blinked you missed it and wish she had blinked Because it wasnt just the materialization The black lady grew legs right in front of Trudy Damascuss eyes Thats right grew legs There was nothing wrong with Trudys powers of observation and she would later tell people fewer and fewer of whom wanted to listen that every detail of that brief encounter was imprinted on her memory like a tattoo The apparition was a little over four feet tall That was a bit on the stumpy side for an ordinary woman Trudy supposed but probably not for one who quit at the knees The apparition was wearing a white shirt splattered with either maroon paint or dried blood and jeans The jeans were full and round at the thighs where therewere legs inside them but below the knees they trailed out on the sidewalk like the shed skins of weird blue snakes Then suddenly they plumped upPlumped up the very words sounded insane but Trudy saw it happen At the same moment the woman rose from her nothingbelowtheknee fourfeetfour to her allthere height of perhaps fivesix or seven It was like watching some extraordinary camera trick in a movie but this was no movie it was Trudyslife Over her left shoulder the apparition wore a clothlined pouch that looked as if it had been woven of reeds There appeared to be plates or dishes inside it In her right hand she clutched a faded red bag with a drawstring top Something with square sides at the bottom swinging back and forth Trudy couldnt make out everything written on the side of the bag but she thought part of it was MIDTOWN LANES Then the woman grabbed Trudy by the arm What you got in that bag she asked You got shoes This caused Trudy to look at the black womans feet and she saw another amazing thing when she did the AfricanAmerican womans feet werewhite As white as her own Trudy had heard of people being rendered speechless now it had happened to her Her tongue was stuck to the roof of her mouth and wouldnt come down Still there was nothing wrong with her eyes They saw everything The white feet More droplets on the black womans face almost certainly dried blood The smell of sweat as if materializing on Second Avenue like this had only come as the result of tremendous exertion If you got shoes lady you best give em to me I dont want to kill you but I got to get to folks thatll help me with my chap and I cant do that barefoot No one on this little piece of Second Avenue People  a few anyway  sitting on the steps of  Hammarskjld Plaza and a couple were looking right at Trudy and the black woman themostly black woman but not with any alarm or even interest what the hell waswrong with them were they blind Well its not them shes grabbing for one thing And its not them shes threatening to kill for anoth  The canvas Borders bag with her office shoes inside it sensible halfheels cordovancolored was snatched from her shoulder The black woman peered inside it then looked up at Trudy again What sizere these Trudys tongue finally came unstuck from the roof of her mouth but that was no help it promptly fell dead at the bottom Nemine Susannah says you look like about a seven Thesell d   The apparitions face suddenly seemed to shimmer She lifted one hand  it rose in a loose loop with an equally loose fist anchoring the end as if the woman didnt have very good control of it  and thumped herself on the forehead right between the eyes And suddenly her face was different Trudy had Comedy Central as part of her basic cable deal and shed seen standup comics who specialized in mimicry change their faces that same way When the black woman spoke again her voice had changed too Now it was that of an educated woman And Trudy would have sworn it a frightened one Help me she said My name is Susannah Dean and IIoh dearohChrist   This time it was pain that twisted the womans face and she clutched at her belly She looked down When she looked back up again the first one had reappeared the one who had talked of killing for a pair of shoes She took a step back on her bare feet still holding the bag with Trudys nice Ferragamo lowheels and herNew York Times inside it Oh Christ she said Oh dont that hurtMama You got to make it stop It cant come yet not right out here on the street you got to make it stop awhile Trudy tried to raise her voice and yell for a cop Nothing came out but a small whispering sigh The apparition pointed at her You want to get out of here now she said And if you rouse any constabulary or raise any posse Ill find you and cut your breasts off She took one of the plates from the reed pouch Trudy observed that the plates curved edge was metal and as keen as a butchers knife and suddenly found herself in a struggle to keep from wetting her pants Find you and cut your breasts offand an edge like the one she was looking at would probably do the job Zipzoop instant mastectomy O dear Lord Good day to you madam Trudy heard her mouth saying She sounded like someone trying to talk to the dentist before the Novocain has worn off Enjoy those shoes wear them in good health Not that the apparition looked particularly healthy Not even with her legs on and her fancy white feet Trudy walked She walked down Second Avenue She tried to tell herself with no success at all that she hadnot seen a woman appear out of thin air in front of  Hammarskjld the building the folks who worked there jokingly called the Black Tower She tried to tell herself also with no success at all that this was what she got for eating roast beef and fried potatoes She should have stuck to her usual waffleandegg you went to Denniss forwaffles not for roast beef and potatoes and if you didnt believe that look what had just happened to her Seeing AfricanAmerican apparitions and  And her bag Her canvas Borders bag She must have dropped it Knowing better All the time expecting the woman to come after her shrieking like a headhunter from the deepest darkest jungles of Papua There was a ninglytumb place on her back she meanta tinglynumb place but ninglytumb was how it actually felt kind of loose and cool and distant where she knew the crazy womans plate would bite into her drinking her blood and then eating one of her kidneys before coming to rest still quivering in the live chalk of her spine She would hear it coming somehow she knew that it would make a whistling sound like a childs top before it chunked into her and warm blood went splashing down over her buttocks and the backs of her legs  She couldnt help it Her bladder let go her urine gushed and the front of her slacks part of atrs expensive Norma Kamali suit went distressingly dark She was almost at the corner of Second and Fortyfifth by then Trudy  never again to be the hardheaded woman shed once fancied herself  was finally able to stop and turn around She no longer felt quite so ninglytumb Only warm at the crotch And the woman the mad apparition was gone Two Trudy kept some softballpractice clothes  teeshirts and two old pairs of jeans  inside her office storage cabinet When she got back to Guttenberg Furth and Patel she made changing her first priority Her second was a call to the police The cop who took her report turned out to be Officer Paul Antassi My name is Trudy Damascus she said and I was just mugged on Second Avenue Officer Antassi was extremely sympathetic on the phone and Trudy found herself imagining an Italian George Clooney Not a big stretch considering Antassis name and Clooneys dark hair and eyes Antassi didnt look a bit like Clooney in person but hey who expected miracles and movie stars it was a real world they were living in Althoughconsidering what had happened to her on the corner of Second and Fortysixth at  PM EDT Officer Antassi arrived at about threethirty and she found herself telling him exactly what had happened to hereverything even the part about feeling ninglytumb instead of tinglynumb and her weird certainty that the woman was getting ready to throw that dish at her  Dish had a sharpened edge you say Antassi asked jotting on his pad and when she said yes he nodded sympathetically Something about that nod had struck her as familiar but right then shed been too involved in telling her tale to chase down the association Later though she wondered how she could possibly have been so dumb It was every sympathetic nod shed ever seen in one of those ladygonecrazy films fromGirl Interrupted with Winona Ryder all the way back toThe Snake Pit with Olivia de Havilland But right then shed been too involved Too busy telling the nice Officer Antassi about how the apparitions jeans had been dragging on the sidewalk from the knees down And when she was done she for the first time heard the one about how the black woman had probably come out from behind a bus shelter Also the one  thisll killya  about how the black woman had probably just stepped out of some little store there were billions of them in that neighborhood As for Trudy she premiered her bit about how therewere no bus shelters on that corner not on the downtown side of Fortysixth not on the uptown side either Also the one about how all the shops were gone on the downtown side since  Hammarskjld went up that would prove to be one of her most popular routines would probably get her onstage at Radio Goddam City someday She was asked for the first time what shed had for lunch just before seeing this woman and realized for the first time that shed had a twentiethcentury version of what Ebenezer Scrooge had eaten shortly before seeing his old and longdead business partner potatoes and roast beef Not to mentionseveral blots of mustard She forgot all about asking Officer Antassi if hed like to go out to dinner with her In fact she threw him out of her office Mitch Guttenberg poked his head in shortly thereafter Do they think theyll be able to get your bag back Tru   Get lost Trudy said without looking up Right now Guttenberg assessed her pallid cheeks and set jaw Then he retired without saying another word Three Trudy left work at fourfortyfive which was early for her She walked back to the corner of Second and Fortysixth and although that ninglytumb feeling began to work its way up her legs and into the pit of her stomach again as she approached Hammarskjld Plaza she never hesitated She stood on the corner ignoring both white WALK and red DON  T WALK She turned in a tight little circle almost like a ballet dancer also ignoring her fellow Second Avenueites and being ignored in turn Right here she said It happened right here I know it did She asked me what size I was and before I could answer  Iwould have answered I would have told her what color my underwear was if she asked I was in shock  before I could answer she said Nemine Susannah says you look like about a seven Thesell do Well no she hadnt quite finished that last part but Trudy was sure that was what the woman had meant to say Only then her face had changed Like a comic getting ready to imitate Bill Clinton or Michael Jackson or maybe even George Clooney And shed asked for help Asked for help and said her name waswhat Susannah Dean Trudy said That was the name I never told Officer Antassi Well yeah but fuck Officer Antassi Officer Antassi with his bus shelters and little stores justfuck him That woman  Susannah Dean Whoopi Goldberg Coretta Scott King whoever she was  thought she was pregnant Thought she was inlaborIm almost sure of it Did she look pregnant to you Trudes No she said On the uptown side of Fortysixth white WALK once again became red DON  T WALK Trudy realized she was calming down Something about just standing here with  Dag Hammarskjld Plaza on her right was calming Like a cool hand on a hot brow or a soothing word that assured you that there was nothing absolutelynothing to feel ninglytumb about She could hear a humming she realized A sweet humming sound Thats not humming she said as red DON  T WALK cycled back to white WALK one more time she remembered a date in college once telling her the worst karmic disaster he could imagine would be coming back as a traffic light Thats not humming thatssinging  And then right beside her  startling her but not frightening her  a mans voice spoke Thats right he said Trudy turned and saw a gentleman who looked to be in his early forties I come by here all the time just to hear it And Ill tell you something since were just ships passing in the night so to speak  when I was a young man I had the worlds most terrible case of acne I think coming here cleared it up somehow You think standing on the corner of Second and Fortysixth cleared up your acne she said His smile only a small one but very sweet faltered a tiny bit I know it sounds crazy   I saw a woman appear out of nowhere right here Trudy said Three and a half hours ago I saw this When she showed up she had no legs from the knees down Then she grew the rest of em So whos crazy my friend He was looking at her wideeyed just some anonymous timeserver in a suit with his tie pulled down at the end of the workday And yes she could see the pits and shadows of old acne on his cheeks and forehead This is true She held up her right hand If Im lyin Im dyin Bitch stole my shoes She hesitated No she wasnt a bitch I dont believe she was a bitch She was scared and she was barefooted and she thought she was in labor I just wish Id had time to give her my sneakers instead of my good goddam shoes The man was giving her a cautious look and Trudy Damascus suddenly felt tired She had an idea this was a look she was going to get used to The sign said WALK again and the man whod spoken to her started across swinging his briefcase Mister He didnt stop walking but did look back over his shoulder What used to be here back when you used to stop by for acne treatments Nothing he said It was just a vacant lot behind a fence I thought it would stop  that nice sound  when they built on the site but it never did He gained the far curb Walked off up Second Avenue Trudy stood where she was lost in thoughtI thought it would stop but it never did Now why would that be she asked and turned to look more directly at  Hammarskjld Plaza The Black Tower The humming was stronger now that she was concentrating on it And sweeter Not just one voice but many of them Like a choir Then it was gone Disappeared as suddenly as the black woman had done the opposite No it didntTrudy thoughtI just lost the knack of hearing it thats all If I stood here long enough I bet it would come back Boy this is nuts Imnuts Did she believe that The truth was that she did not All at once the world seemed very thin to her more an idea than an actual thing and barely there at all She had never felt less hardheaded in her life What she felt was weak in her knees and sick to her stomach and on the verge of passing out Four There was a little park on the other side of Second Avenue In it was a fountain nearby was a metal sculpture of a turtle its shell gleaming wetly in the fountains spray She cared nothing for fountains or sculptures but there was also a bench W ALK had come around again Trudy tottered across Second Avenue like a woman of eightythree instead of thirtyeight and sat down She began to take long slow breaths and after three minutes or so felt a little better Beside the bench was a trash receptacle with KEEP LITTER IN ITS PLACE stenciled on the side Below this in pink spraypaint was an odd little graffitoSee the TURTLE of enormous girth Trudy saw the turtle but didnt think much of its girth the sculpture was quite modest She saw something else as well a copy of theNew York Times rolled up as she always rolled hers if she wanted to keep it a little longer and happened to have a bag to stow it in Of course there were probably at least a million copies of that daysTimes floating around Manhattan but this one was hers She knew it even before fishing it out of the litter basket and verifying what she knew by turning to the crossword which shed mostly completed over lunch in her distinctive lilaccolored ink She returned it to the litter basket and looked across Second Avenue to the place where her idea of how things worked had changed Maybe forever Took my shoes Crossed the street and sat here by the turtle and put them on Kept my bag but dumped theTimesWhyd she want my bag She didnt have any shoes of her own to put in it Trudy thought she knew The woman had put her plates in it A cop who got a look at those sharp edges might be curious about what you served on dishes that could cut your fingers off if you grabbed them in the wrong place Okay but then where did she go There was a hotel down at the corner of First and Fortysixth Once it had been the UN Plaza Trudy didnt know what its name was now and didnt care Nor did she want to go down there and ask if a black woman in jeans and a stained white shirt might have come in a few hours ago She had a strong intuition that her version of Jacob Marleys ghost had done just that but here was an intuition she didnt want to follow up on Better to let it go The city was full of shoes butsanity onessanity  Better to head home take a shower and justlet it go Except  Something is wrong she said and a man walking past on the sidewalk looked at her She looked back defiantly Somewhere something isvery wrong Its   Tippingwas the word that came to mind but she would not say it As if to say it would cause the tip to become a topple It was a summer of bad dreams for Trudy Damascus Some were about the woman who first appeared and thengrew These were bad but not the worst In the worst ones she was in the dark and terrible chimes were ringing and she sensed something tipping further and further toward the point of no return STAVE Commalacomekey Can ya tell me what ya see Is it ghosts or just the mirror That makes ya want to flee RESPONSE Commalacomethree I beg ya tell me Is it ghosts or just your darker self That makes ya want to flee One Susannahs memory had become distressingly spotty unreliable like the halfstripped transmission of an old car She remembered the battle with the Wolves and Mia waiting patiently while it went on No that wasnt right Wasnt fair Mia had been doing a lot more than waiting patiently She had been cheering Susannah and the others on with her own warriors heart Holding the labor in abeyance while her chaps surrogate mother dealt death with her plates Only the Wolves had turned out to be robots so could you really say Yes Yes you can Because they were more than robots much more and we killed them Rose up righteous and killed their asses But that was neither here nor there because it was over And once it was she had felt the labor coming back and strong She was going to have the kid at the side of the damn road if she didnt look out and there it would die because it was hungry Mias chap washongry and You got to help me Mia And impossible not to respond to that cry Even while she felt Mia pushing her aside as Roland had once pushed Detta Walker aside it was impossible not to respond to that wild mothers cry Partly Susannah supposed because it washer body they shared and the body had declared itself on behalf of the baby Probably could not do otherwise And so she had helped She had done what Mia herself no longer could do had stopped the labor a bit longer Although that in itself would become dangerous to the chap funny how that word insinuated itself into her thoughts became her word as well as Mias word if it was allowed to go on too long She remembered a story some girl had told during a latenight hen party in the dorm at Columbia half a dozen of them sitting around in their pjs smoking cigarettes and passing a bottle of Wild Irish Rose absolutelyverboten and therefore twice as sweet The story had been about a girl their age on a long cartrip a girl whod been too embarrassed to tell her friends she needed a peestop According to the story the girl had suffered a ruptured bladder and died It was the kind of tale you simultaneously thought was bullshit and believed absolutely And this thing with the chapthebaby  But whatever the danger shed been able to stop the labor Because there were switches that could do that Somewhere in the Dogan Only the machinery in the Dogan had never been meant to do what she  they  us we were making it do Eventually it would overload and rupture all the machines would catch fire burn out Alarms going off Control panels and TV screens going dark How long before that happened Susannah didnt know She had a vague memory of taking her wheelchair out of a bucka waggon while the rest of them were distracted celebrating their victory and mourning their dead Climbing and lifting werent easy when you were legless from the knees down but they werent as hard as some folks might believe either Certainly she was used to mundane obstacles  everything from getting on and off the toilet to getting books off a shelf that had once been easily accessible to her there had been a stepstool for such chores in every room of her New York apartment In any case Mia had been insisting  had actually beendriving her as a cowboy might drive a stray dogie And so Susannah had hoisted herself into the bucka had lowered the wheelchair down and then had lowered herself neatly into it Not quite as easy as rolling off a log but far from the hardest chore shed ever done since losing her last sixteen inches or so The chair had taken her one last mile maybe a little more no legs for Mia daughter of none not in the Calla Then it smashed into a spur of granite spilling her out Luckily she had been able to break her fall with her arms sparing her turbulent and unhappy belly She remembered picking herself up  correction she remembered Mia picking up Susannah Deans hijacked body  and working her way on up the path She had only one other clear memory from the Calla side and that was of trying to stop Mia from taking off the rawhide loop Susannah wore around her neck A ring hung from it a beautiful light ring that Eddie had made for her When hed seen it was too big meaning it as a surprise he hadnt measured her finger he had been disappointed and told her hed make her another You go on and do just that if you likeshed saidbut Ill always wear this one She had hung it around her neck liking the way it felt between her breasts and now here was this unknown woman thisbitch trying to take it off Detta hadcome forward struggling with Mia Detta had had absolutely no success in trying to reassert control over Roland but Mia was no Roland of Gilead Mias hands dropped away from the rawhide Her control wavered When it did Susannah felt another of those labor pains sweep through her making her double over and groan It has to come offMia shoutedOtherwise theyll have hisscent as well as yours Your husbands You dont want that believe me WhoSusannah had askedWho are you talking about Never mind  theres no time But if he comes after you  and I know you think hell try  they mustnt have his scent Ill leave it here where hell find it Later if ka wills you may wear it again Susannah had thought of telling her they could wash the ring off wash Eddies smell off it but she knew it wasnt just a smell Mia was speaking of It was a lovering and that scent would always remain But for whom The Wolves she supposed Thereal Wolves The ones in New York The vampires of whom Callahan had spoken and the low men Or was there something else Something even worse Help meMia cried and again Susannah found that cry impossible to resist The baby might or might not be Mias and it might or might not be a monster but her body wanted to have it Her eyes wanted to see it whatever it was and her ears wanted to hear it cry even if the cries were really snarls She had taken the ring off kissed it and then dropped it at the foot of the path where Eddie would surely see it Because he would follow her at least this far she knew it Then what She didnt know She thought she remembered riding on something most of the way up a steep path surely the path which led to the Doorway Cave Then blackness not blackness No notcomplete blackness There were blinking lights The low glow of television screens that were for the time being projecting no pictures but only soft gray light The faint hum of motors the click of relays This was the Dogan Jakes Dogan some sort of control room Maybe a place she had constructed herself maybe her imaginations version of a Quonset hut Jake had found on the west side of the River Whye The next thing she remembered clearly was being back in New York Her eyes were windows she looked through as Mia stole some poor terrified womans shoes Susannahcame forward again asking for help She meant to go on to tell the woman she needed to go to the hospital needed a doctor she was going to have a baby and something was wrong with it Before she could get any of that out another labor pain washed over her this one monstrous deeper than any pain she had ever felt in her life worse even than the pain shed felt after the loss of her lower legs This though  this  Oh Christ she said but Mia took over again before she could say anything else telling Susannah that she had to make it stop and telling the woman that if she whistled for any John Laws shed lose a pair of something a lot more valuable to her than shoes Mia listen to meSusannah told herI can stop it again  I thinkI can  but you have to help You have to sit down If you dont settle for awhile God Himself wont be able to stop your labor from running its course Do you understand Do you hear me Mia did She stayed where she was for a moment watching the woman from whom shed stolen the shoes Then almost timidly she asked a questionWhere should I go Susannah sensed that her kidnapper was for the first time becoming aware of the enormous city in which she now found herself was finally seeing the surging schools of pedestrians the floods of metal carriages every third one it seemed painted a yellow so bright it almost screamed and towers so high that on a cloudy day their tops would have been lost to view Two women looked at an alien city through one set of eyes Susannah knew it washer city but in many ways it no longer was Shed left New York in  How many years further along was this Twenty Thirty Never mind let it go Now was not the time to worry about it Their combined gaze settled on the little pocket park across the street The labor pains had ceased for the time being and when the sign over there said WALK Trudy Damascuss black woman who didnt look particularly pregnant crossed walking slowly but steadily On the far side was a bench beside a fountain and a metal sculpture Seeing the turtle comforted Susannah a little it was as if Roland had left her this sign what the gunslinger himself would have called a sigul Hell come after me tooshe told MiaAnd you should ware him woman You should ware him very well Ill do what I need to doMia repliedYou want to see the womans papers Why I want to see when this is The newspaper will say Brown hands pulled the rolledup newspaper from the canvas Borders bag unrolled it and held it up to blue eyes that had started that day as brown as the hands Susannah saw the date  June st   and marveled over it Not twenty years or even thirty but thirtyfive Until this moment she hadnt realized how little shed thought of the worlds chances to survive so long The contemporaries shed known in her old life  fellow students civil rights advocates drinking buddies and folkmusicaficionados  would now be edging into late middle age Some were undoubtedly dead EnoughMia said and tossed the newspaper back into the trash barrel where it curled into its former rolled shape She brushed as much dirt as she could from the soles of her bare feet because of the dirt Susannah did not notice they had changed color and then put on the stolen shoes They were a little tight and with no socks she supposed theyd give her blisters if she had to walk very far but  What do you care rightSusannah asked herAint your feet And knew as soon as shed said it for thiswas a form of talking what Roland called palaver that she might be wrong about that Certainly her own feet those which had marched obediently through life below the body of Odetta Holmes and sometimes Detta Walker were long gone rotting or  more likely  burned in some municipal incinerator But she did not notice the change in color Except later shed thinkYou noticed all right Noticed it and blocked it right out Because too much is too much Before she could pursue the question as much philosophical as it was physical of whose feet she now wore another labor pain struck her It cramped her stomach and turned it to stone even as it loosened her thighs For the first time she felt the dismaying and terrifying need topush You have to stop itMia criedWoman you have to For the chaps sake and for ours too Yes all right but how Close your eyesSusannah told her What Didnt you hear me Youve got to  I heard youSusannah saidClose your eyes The park disappeared The world went dark She was a black woman still young and undoubtedly beautiful sitting on a park bench beside a fountain and a metal turtle with a wet and gleaming metal shell She might have been meditating on this warm latespring afternoon in the year of  Im going away for a little while nowSusannah saidIll be back In the meantime sit where you are Sit quiet Dont move The pain should draw back again but even if it doesnt at first sit still Moving around will only make it worse Do you understand me Mia might be frightened and she was certainly determined to have her way but she wasnt dumb She asked only a single question Where are you going Back to the DoganSusannah said MyDogan The one inside Two The building Jake had found on the far side of the River Whye was some sort of ancient communicationsandsurveillance post The boy had described it to them in some detail but he still might not have recognized Susannahs imagined version of it which was based on a technology which had been far out of date only thirteen years later when Jake had left New York for MidWorld In Susannahs when Lyndon Johnson had been President and color TV was still a curiosity Computers were huge things that filled whole buildings Yet Susannah had visited the city of Lud and seen some of the wonders there and so Jakemight have recognized the place where he had hidden from Ben Slightman and Andy the Messenger Robot after all Certainly he would have recognized the dusty linoleum floor with its checkerboard pattern of black and red squares and the rolling chairs along consoles filled with blinking lights and glowing dials And he would have recognized the skeleton in the corner grinning above the frayed collar of its ancient uniform shirt She crossed the room and sat in one of the chairs Above her blackandwhite TV screens showed dozens of pictures Some were of Calla Bryn Sturgis the town common Callahans church the general store the road leading east out of town Some were still pictures like studio photographs one of Roland one of a smiling Jake holding Oy in his arms and one  she could hardly bear to look at it  of Eddie with his hat tipped back cowpokestyle and his whittling knife in one hand Another monitor showed the slim black woman sitting on the bench beside the turtle knees together hands folded in her lap eyes closed a pair of stolen shoes on her feet She now had three bags the one shed stolen from the woman on Second Avenue the rush sack with the sharpened Orizas in itand a bowling bag This one was a faded red and there was something with square corners inside it A box Looking at it in the TV screen made Susannah feel angry  betrayed  but she didnt know why The bag was pink on the other sideshe thoughtIt changed color when we crossed but only a little The womans face on the blackandwhite screen above the control board grimaced Susannah felt an echo of the pain Mia was experiencing only faint and distant Got to stop that And quick The question still remained how The way you did on the other side While she was horsing her freight up to that cave just as fast as she damn could But that seemed a long time ago now in another life And why not Ithad been another life another world and if she ever hoped to get back there she had to help right now So what had she done You used this stuff thats what you did Its only in your head anyway  what Professor Overmeyer called a visualization technique back in Psych One Close your eyes Susannah did so Now both sets of eyes were closed the physical ones that Mia controlled in New York and the ones in her mind Visualize She did Or tried Open She opened her eyes Now on the panel in front of her there were two large dials and a single toggleswitch where before there had been rheostats and flashing lights The dials looked to be made of Bakelite like the ovendials on her mothers stove back in the house where Susannah had grown up She supposed there was no surprise there all you imagined no matter how wild it might seem was no more than a disguised version of what you already knew The dial on her left was labeled EMOTIONAL TEMP The markings on it ran from  to   in blue  in bright red It was currently set at  The dial in the middle was marked LABOR FORCE The numbers around its face went from  to  and it was currently turned to  The label under the toggleswitch simply read CHAP and there were only two settings AWAKE and ASLEEP It was currently set to AWAKE Susannah looked up and saw one of the screens was now showing a babyin utero It was a boy Abeautiful boy His tiny penis floated like a strand of kelp below the lazy curl of his umbilical cord His eyes were open and although the rest of the image was black and white those eyes were a piercing blue The chaps gaze seemed to go right through her Theyre Rolands eyesshe thought feeling stupid with wonderHow can that be It couldnt of course All this was nothing but the work of her own imagination a visualization technique But if so why would she imagine Rolands blue eyes Why not Eddies hazel ones Why not her husbands hazel eyes No time for that now Do what you have to do She reached out to EMOTIONAL TEMP with her lower lip caught between her teeth on the monitor showing the park bench Mia also began biting her lower lip She hesitated then dialed it back to  exactly as if it was a thermostat And wasnt it Calm immediately filled her She relaxed in her chair and let her lip escape the grip of her teeth On the park monitor the black woman did the same All right so far so good She hesitated for a moment with her hand not quite touching the LABOR FORCE dial then moved on to CHAP instead She flipped the toggle from AWAKE to ASLEEP The babys eyes closed immediately Susannah found this something of a relief Those blue eyes were disconcerting All right back to LABOR FORCE Susannah thought this was the important one what Eddie would call the Big Casino She took hold of the oldfashioned dial applied a little experimental force and was not exactly surprised to find the clunky thing dully resistant in its socket It didnt want to turn But you willSusannah thoughtBecause we need you to We needyou to She grasped it tightly and began turning it slowly counterclockwise A pain went through her head and she grimaced Another momentarily constricted her throat as if shed gotten a fishbone stuck in there but then both pains cleared To her right an entire bank of lights flashed on most of them amber a few bright red WARNING said a voice that sounded eerily like that of Blaine the Mono THIS OPERATION MAY EXCEED SAFETY PARAMETERS No shit SherlockSusannah thought The LABOR FORCE dial was now down to  When she turned it past  another bank of amber and red lights flashed on and three of the monitors showing Calla scenes shorted out with sizzling pops Another pain gripped her head like invisible pressing fingers From somewhere beneath her came the startup whine of motors or turbines Big ones from the sound She could feel them thrumming against her feet which were bare of course  Mia had gotten the shoesOh well she thoughtI didnt have any feet at all before this so maybe Im ahead of the game WARNING said the mechanical voice WHAT YOURE DOING IS DANGEROUS SUSANNAH OF NEW YORK HEAR ME I BEG ITS NOT NICE TO FOOL MOTHER NATURE One of Rolands proverbs occurred to her You do whatyou need to and Ill do whatI need to and well see who gets the goose She wasnt sure what it meant but it seemed to fit this situation so she repeated it aloud as she slowly but steadily turned the LABOR FORCE dial past  to  She meant to turn the dial all the way back to  but the pain which ripped through her head when the absurd thing passed  was so huge  sosickening  that she dropped her hand For a moment the pain continued  intensified even  and she thought it would kill her Mia would topple off the bench where she was sitting and both of them would be dead before their shared body hit the concrete in front of the turtle sculpture Tomorrow or the next day her remains would take a quick trip to Potters Field And what would go on the death certificate Stroke Heart attack Or maybe that old standby of the medical man in a hurry natural causes But the pain subsided and she was still alive when it did She sat in front of the console with the two ridiculous dials and the toggleswitch taking deep breaths and wiping the sweat from her cheeks with both hands Boyhowdy when it came to visualization technique she had to be the champ of the world This is more than visualization  you know that right She supposed she did Something had changed her  had changed all of them Jake had gotten the touch which was a kind of telepathy Eddie had grown was still growing into some sort of ability to create powerful talismanic objects  one of them had already served to open a door between two worlds And she Isee Thats all Except if I see it hard enough it starts to be real The way Detta Walker got to be real All over this version of the Dogan amber lights were glowing Even as she looked some turned red Beneath her feet  special guest feet she thought them  the floor trembled and thrummed Enough of this and cracks would start to appear in its elderly surface Cracks that would widen and deepen Ladies and gentlemen welcome to the House of Usher Susannah got up from the chair and looked around She should go back Was there anything else that needed doing before she did One thing occurred to her Three Susannah closed her eyes and imagined a radio mike When she opened them the mike was there standing on the console to the right of the two dials and the toggleswitch She had imagined a Zenith trademark right down to the lightningbolt Z on the microphones base but NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS had been stamped there instead So something was messing in with her visualization technique She found that extremely scary On the control panel directly behind the microphone was a semicircular tricolored readout with the words SUSANNAHMIO printed below it A needle was moving out of the green and into the yellow Beyond the yellow segment the dial turned red and a single word was printed in black DANGER Susannah picked up the mike saw no way to use it closed her eyes again and imagined a toggleswitch like the onemarked with AWAKE and ASLEEP only this time on the side of the mike When she opened her eyes again the switch was there She pressed it Eddie she said She felt a little foolish but went on anyway Eddie if you hear me Im okay at least for the time being Im with Mia in New York Its June first of  and Im going to try and help her have the baby I dont see any other choice If nothing else I have to be rid of it myself Eddie you take care of yourself I Her eyes welled with tears I love you sugar So much The tears spilled down her cheeks She started to wipe them away and then stopped herself Didnt she have a right to cry for her man As much right as any other woman She waited for a response knowing she could make one if she wanted to and resisting the urge This wasnt a situation where talking to herself in Eddies voice would do any good Suddenly her vision doubled in front of her eyes She saw the Dogan for the unreal shade that it was Beyond its walls were not the deserty wastelands on the east side of the Whye but Second Avenue with its rushing traffic Mia had opened her eyes She was feeling fine again  thanks to me honeybunch thanks to me  and was ready to move on Susannah went back Four A black woman who still thought of herself as a Negro woman was sitting on a bench in New York City in the spring of  A black woman with her traveling bags  her gunna  spread around her One of them was a faded red N OTHING BUT STRIKES AT MIDTOWN LANES was printed on it It had been pink on the other side The color of the rose Mia stood up Susannah promptlycame forward and made her sit down again What did you do that forMia asked surprised I dont know I dont have a clue But lets us palaver a little Why dont you start by telling me where you want to go I need a telefung Someone will call Telephone Susannah saidAnd by the way theres blood on our shirt sugar Margaret Eisenharts blood and sooner or later someones gonna recognize it for what it is Then where will you be The response to this was wordless a swell of smiling contempt It made Susannah angry Five minutes ago  or maybe fifteen it was hard to keep track of time when you were having fun  this hijacking bitch had been screaming for help And now that shed gotten it what her rescuer got was an internal contemptuous smile What made it worse was that the bitch was right she could probably stroll around Midtown all day without anyone asking her if that was dried blood on her shirt or had she maybe just spilled her chocolate eggcream All rightshe saidbut even if nobody bothers you about the blood where are you going to store your goods Then another question occurred to her one that probably should have come to her right away Mia how do you even know what a telephone is And dont tell me they have em where you came from either No response Only a kind of watchful silence But she had wiped the smile off the bitchs face shed done that much You have friends dont you Or at least you think theyre friends Folks youve been talking to behind my back Folks thatll help you Or so you think Areyougoing to help me or not Back to that And angry But beneath the anger what Fright Probably that was too strong at least for now But worry certainlyHow long have I  have we  got before the labor starts up again Susannah guessed somewhere between six and ten hours  certainly before midnight saw in June second  but tried to keep this to herself I dont know Not all that long Then we have to get started I have to find a telefungPhoneIn a private place Susannah thought there was a hotel at the First Avenue end of Fortysixth Street and tried to keep this to herself Her eyes went back to the bag once pink now red and suddenly she understood Not everything but enough to dismay and anger her Ill leave it hereMia had said speaking of the ring Eddie had made herIll leave it here where hell find it Later if ka wills you may wear it again Not a promise exactly at least not a direct one but Mia had certainlyimplied  Dull anger surged through Susannahs mind No shed not promised She had simply led Susannah in a certain direction and Susannah had done the rest She didnt cozen me she let me cozen myself Mia stood up again and once again Susannahcame forward and made her sit down Hard this time What Susannah you promised The chap  Ill help you with the chapSusannah replied grimly She bent forward and picked up the red bag The bag with the box inside it And inside the box The ghostwood box with UNFOUND written upon it in runes She could feel a baleful pulse even through the layer of magical wood and cloth which hid it Black Thirteen was in the bag Mia had taken it through the door And if it was the ball that opened the door how could Eddie get to her now I did what I had toMia said nervouslyIts my baby my chap and every hand is against me now Every hand but yours and you only help me because you have to Remember what I saidif ka wills I said  It was Detta Walkers voice that replied It was harsh and crude and brooked no argument I dont give a shit bout ka she said and you bes be rememberin dat You got problems girl Got a rugmonkey comin you dont know what it is Got folks say theyll hep you and you dont

still be sittin here with these bags come nightfall and you can have your precious chap on this bench and wash him off in the fuckin fountain The woman on the bench bared her teeth in a gruesome smile that was all Detta Walker Youcare bout dat chapand Susannah she care alittle bout dat chapbut I been mosly turned out of this body and Idontgivea shit A woman pushing a stroller it looked as divinely lightweight as Susannahs abandoned wheelchair gave the woman on the bench a nervous glance and then pushed her own baby onward so fast she was nearly running So Detta said brightly Its be purty out here dont you think Good weather for talkin You hear me mamma No reply from Mia daughter of none and mother of one Detta wasnt put out of countenance her grin widened You hear me all right you hear me justfahn So lets us have a little chat Lets us palaver STAVE Commalacomeko Whatcha doin at my do If you doan tell me now my friend Ill lay ya on de flo RESPONSE Commalacome fo I can lay ya low The things I done to such as you You never want to know One Mia saidTalking will be easier quicker and clearer too  if we do it facetoface How can weSusannah asked Well have our palaver in the castleMia replied promptlyThe Castle on the Abyss In the banquet room Do you remember the banquet room Susannah nodded but hesitantly Her memories of the banquet room were but recently recovered and consequently vague She wasnt sorry either Mias feeding there had beenwell enthusiastic to say the very least Shed eaten from many plates mostly with her fingers and drunk from many glasses and spoken to many phantoms in many borrowed voices Borrowed Hellstolen voices Two of these Susannah had known quite well One had been Odetta Holmess nervous  and rather hoitytoity  social voice Another had been Dettas raucous whogivesashit bellow Mias thievery had extended to every aspect of Susannahs personality it seemed and if Detta Walker was back pumped up and ready to cut butt that was in large part this unwelcome strangers doing The gunslinger saw me thereMia saidThe boy too There was a pause Then I have met them both before Who Jake and Roland Aye they Where When How could y  We cant speak here Please Let us go somewhere more private Someplace with a phone isnt that what you mean So your friends can call you I only know a little Susannah of New York but what little I know I think you would hear Susannah thought so too And although she didnt necessarily want Mia to realize it she was also anxious to get off Second Avenue The stuff on her shirt might look like spilled eggcream or dried coffee to the casual passerby but Susannah herself was acutely aware of what it was not just blood but the blood of a brave woman who had stood true on behalf of her towns children And there were the bags spread around her feet Shed seen plenty of bagfolkenin New York aye Now she felt like one herself and she didnt like the feeling Shed been raised to better as her mother would have said Each time someone passing on the sidewalk or cutting through the little park gave her a glance she felt like telling them she wasnt crazy in spite of how she looked stained shirt dirty face hair too long and in disarray no purse only those three bags at her feet Homeless aye  had anyone ever been as homeless as she not just out of house but out of time itself  but in her right mind She needed to palaver with Mia and get an understanding of what all this was about that was true What shewanted was much simpler to wash to put on fresh clothes and to be out of public view for at least a little while Might as well wish for the moon sugarshe told herselfand Mia if Mia was listeningPrivacy costs money Youre in a version of New York where a single hamburger might cost as much as a dollar crazy as that sounds And you dont have a sou Just a dozen or so sharpened plates and some kind of blackmagic ball So what are you gonna do Before she could get any further in her thinking New York was swept away and she was back in the Doorway Cave Shed been barely aware of her surroundings on her first visit  Mia had been in charge then and in a hurry to make her getaway through the door  but now they were very clear Pere Callahan was here So was Eddie And Eddies brother in a way Susannah could hear Henry Deans voice floating up from the caves depths both taunting and dismayed Im in hell bro Im in hell and I cant get a fix andits all your fault  Susannahs disorientation was nothing to the fury she felt at the sound of that nagging hectoring voice Most of what was wrong with Eddie wasyour fault  she screamed at him You should have done everyone a favor and died young Henry Those in the cave didnt even look around at her What was this Had she come here todash from New York just to add to the fun If so why hadnt she heard the chimes Hush Hush loveThat was Eddies voice in her mind clear as dayJust watch Do you hear himshe asked MiaDo you  Yes Now shut up How long will we have to be here do you think Eddie asked Callahan Im afraid itll be awhile Callahan replied and Susannah understood she was seeing something that had already happened Eddie and Callahan had gone up to the Doorway Cave to try to locate Calvin Tower and Towers friend Deepneau Just before the showdown with the Wolves this had been Callahan was the one whod gone through the door Black Thirteen had captured Eddie while the Pere was gone And almost killed him Callahan had returned just in time to keep Eddie from hurling himself from the top of the bluff and into the draw far below Right now though Eddie was dragging the bag  pink yes shed been right about that on the Calla side it had been pink  out from underneath the troublesome sai Towers bookcase of first editions They needed the ball inside the bag for the same reason Mia had needed it because it opened the Unfound Door Eddie lifted it started to turn then froze He was frown What is it Callahan asked Theres something in here Eddie replied The box   No in the bag Sewn into the lining It feels like a little rock or something Suddenly he seemed to be looking directly at Susannah and she was aware that she was sitting on a park bench It was no longer voices from the depths of the cave she heard but the watery hiss and plash of the fountain The cave was fading Eddie and Callahan were fading She heard Eddies last words as if from a great distance Maybe theres a secret pocket Then he was gone Two She hadnt gone todash at all then Her brief visit to the Doorway Cave had been some kind of vision Had Eddie sent it to her And if he had did it mean hed gotten the message shed tried to send him from the Dogan These were questions Susannah couldnt answer If she saw him again shed ask him After shed kissed him a thousand times or so that was Mia picked up the red bag and ran her hands slowly down its sides There was the shape of the box inside yes But halfway down there was something else a small bulge And Eddie was right it felt like a stone She  or perhaps it was they it no longer mattered to her  rolled the bag down not liking the intensified pulse from the thing hidden inside but setting her mind against it Here it was right in hereand something that felt like a seam She leaned closer and saw not a seam but some kind of a seal She didnt recognize it nor would Jake have done but Eddie would have known Velcro when he saw it Shehad heard a certain ZZ Top tribute to the stuff a song called Velcro Fly She got a fingernail into the seal and pulled with her fingertip It came loose with a soft ripping sound revealing a small pocket on the inside of the bag What is itMia asked fascinated in spite of herself Well lets just see She reached in and brought out not a stone but a small scrimshaw turtle Made of ivory from the look of it Each detail of the shell was tiny and precisely executed although it had been marred by one tiny scratch that looked almost like a questionmark The turtles head poked halfway out Its eyes were tiny black dots of some tarry stuff and looked incredibly alive She saw another small imperfection in the turtles beak  not a scratch but a crack Its old she whispered aloud So old YesMia whispered back Holding it made Susannah feel incredibly good It made her feelsafesomehow See the Turtleshe thoughtSee the Turtle of enormous girth on his shell he holds the earth Was that how it went She thought it was at least close And of course that was the Beam they had been following to the Tower The Bear at one end  Shardik The Turtle at the other  Maturin She looked from the tiny totem shed found in the lining of the bag to the one beside the fountain Barring the difference in materials  the one beside her bench was made of dark metal with brighter coppery glints  they were exactly the same right down to the scratch on the shell and the tiny wedgeshaped break in the beak For a moment her breath stopped and her heart seemed to stop also She went along from moment to moment through this adventure  sometimes even from day to day  without thinking much but simply driven by events and what Roland insisted was ka Then something like this would happen and she would for a moment glimpse a far bigger picture one that immobilized her with awe and wonder She sensed forces beyond her ability to comprehend Some like the ball in the ghostwood box were evil But thisthis Wow someone said Almost sighed She looked up and saw a businessman  a very successful one from the look of his suit  standing there by the bench Hed been cutting through the park probably on his way to someplace as important as he was some sort of meeting or a conference maybe even at the United Nations which was close by unless that had changed too Now however he had come to a dead stop His expensive briefcase dangled from his right hand His eyes were large and fixed on the turtle in SusannahMias hand On his face was a large and rather dopey grin Put it awayMia cried alarmedHell steal it Like to see him tryDetta Walker replied Her voice was relaxed and rather amused The sun was out and she  all parts of she  suddenly realized that all else aside this day was beautiful And precious And gorgeous Precious and beautiful and gorgeous said the businessman or perhaps he was a diplomat who had forgotten all about his business Was it the day he was talking about or the scrimshaw turtle Its bothSusannah thought And suddenly she thought she understood this Jake would have understood too  no one better She laughed Inside her Detta and Mia also laughed Mia a bit against her will And the businessman or diplomat he laughed too Yah its both the businessman said In his faint Scandinavian accentboth came outboad What a lovely thing you haveWhad a loffly thing Yes itwas lovely A lovely little treasure And once upon a time not so long ago Jake Chambers had found something queerly similar In Calvin Towers bookshop Jake had bought a book calledCharlie the ChooChoo by Beryl Evans Why Because it had called to him Later  shortly before Rolands katet had come to Calla Bryn Sturgis in fact  the authors name had changed to Claudia y Inez Bachman making her a member of the everexpanding KaTet of Nineteen Jake had slipped a key into that book and Eddie had whittled a double of it in MidWorld Jakes version of the key had both fascinated the folks who saw it and made them extremely suggestible Like Jakes key the scrimshaw turtle had its double she was sitting beside it The question was if the turtle was like Jakes key in other ways Judging from the fascinated way the Scandinavian businessman was looking at it Susannah was pretty sure the answer was yes She thoughtDadachuck dadachurtle dont worry girl you got the turtle It was such a silly rhyme she almost laughed out loud To Mia she saidLet me handle this Handle what I dont understand  I know you dont So let me handle it Agreed She didnt wait for Mias reply She turned back to the businessman smiling brightly holding the turtle up where he could see it She floated it from right to left and noted the way his eyes followed it although his head with its impressive mane of white hair never moved Whats your name sai Susannah asked Mathiessen van Wyck he said His eyes rolled slowly in their sockets watching the turtle I am second assistant to the Swedish Ambassador to the United Nations My wife has taken a lover This makes me sad My bowels are regular once again the tea the hotel masseuse recommended worked for me and this makes me happy A pause Then Yourskldpadda makes me happy Susannah was fascinated If she asked this man to drop his trousers and evacuate his newly regularized bowels on the sidewalk would he do it Of course he would She looked around quickly and saw no one in the immediate vicinity That was good but she thought it would still behoove her to transact her business here as quickly as she could Jake had drawn quite the little crowd with his key She had no urge to do the same if she could avoid it Mathiessen she began you mentioned   Mats he said Beg your pardon Call me Mats if you would I prefer it All right Mats you mentioned a   Do you speak Swedish No she said Then we will speak English Yes Id prefer   I have quite an important position Mats said His eyes never left the turtle I am meeting many important peoples I am going to cocktail parties where goodlooking women are wearing the little black dress  That must be quite a thrill for you Mats I want you to shut your trap and only open it to speak when I ask you a direct question Will you do that Mats closed his mouth He even made a comical little zipping gesture across his lips but his eyes never left the turtle You mentioned a hotel Do you stay at a hotel Yah I am staying at the New York Plaza  Park Hyatt at the corner of First and Fortysixth Soon I am getting the condominium apartment   Mats seemed to realize he was saying too much again and shut his mouth Susannah thought furiously holding the turtle in front of her breasts where her new friend could see it very well Mats listen to me okay I listen to hear mistresssai and hear to obey That gave her a nasty jolt especially coming out as it did in Matss cute little Scandihoovian accent Do you have a credit card Mats smiled proudly I have many I have American Express MasterCard and Visa I have the EuroGold Card I have   Good thats good I want you to go down to the   For a moment her mind blanked and then it came   to the Plaza  Park Hotel and rent a room Rent it for a week If they ask tell them its for a friend of yours a lady friend An unpleasant possibility occurred to her This was New York thenorth in the year  and a person liked to believe that things continued to go in the right direction but it was best to be sure Will they make any unpleasantness about me being a Negro No of course not He looked surprised Rent the room in your name and tell the clerk that a woman named Susannah Mia Dean will be using it Do you understand Yah Susannah Mia Dean What else Money of course She asked him if he had any Her new friend removed his wallet and handed it to her She continued to hold the turtle where he could see it in one hand while she riffled through the wallet a very nice Lord Buxton with the other There was a wad of travelers checks  no good to her not with that insanely convoluted signature  and about two hundred dollars in good old American cabbage She took it and dropped it into the Borders bag which had lately held the pair of shoes When she looked up she was dismayed to see that a couple of Girl Scouts maybe fourteen years old and both wearing backpacks had joined the businessman They were staring at the turtle with shiny eyes and wet lips Susannah found herself remembering the girls in the audience on the night Elvis Presley had playedThe Ed Sullivan Show Toocoooool  one of them said almost in a sigh Totally awesome said the other You girls go on about your business Susannah said Their faces tucked in assuming identical looks of sorrow They could almost have been twins from the Calla Do we have to asked the first YesSusannah said Thankeesai long days and pleasant nights said the second Tears had begun to roll down her cheeks Her friend was also crying Forget you saw me Susannah called as they started away She watched them nervously until they reached Second Avenue and headed uptown then turned her attention back to Mats van Wyck You get a wiggle on too Mats Hoss your freight down to that hotel and rent a room Tell them your friend Susannah will be right along What is this freighthossing I do not understand   It means hurry up She handed back his wallet minus the cash wishing she could have gotten a longer look at all those plastic cards wondering why anyone would need so many Once you have the room nailed down go on to where you were going Forget you ever saw me Now like the girls in their green uniforms Mats began to weep Must I also forget theskldpadda  Yes Susannah remembered a hypnotist shed once seen performing on some TV variety show maybe evenEd Sullivan No turtle but youre going to feel good the rest of the day you hear me Youre going to feel likeA million bucks might not mean that much to him and for all she knew a million kroner wouldnt buy a haircut Youre going to feel like the Swedish Ambassador himself And youll stop worrying about your wifes fancyman To hell with him right Yah to hell witdot guy Mats cried and although he was still weeping he was now smiling too There was something divinely childish in that smile It made Susannah feel happy and sad at the same time She wanted to do something else for Mats van Wyck if she could And your bowels Yah Like clockwork for the rest of your life Susannah said holding the turtle up Whats your usual time Mats I am going yust after breakfast Then thats when itll be For the rest of your life Unless youre busy If youre late for an appointment or something like that just sayumMaturinand the urgell pass until the next day Maturin Correct Go on now May I not take theskldpadda  No you may not Go on now He started away then paused and looked back at her Although his cheeks were wet his expression was pixieish a trifle sly Perhaps I should take it he said Perhaps it is mine by right Like to see you try honkywas Dettas thought but Susannah  who felt more and more in charge of this wacky triad at least for the time being  shushed her Why would you say that my friend Tell I beg The sly look remainedDont kid a kidder it said That was what it looked like to Susannah anyway Mats Maturin he said Maturin Mats You see Susannah did She started to tell him it was just a coincidence and then thoughtCalla Callahan I see she said but theskldpadda isnt yours Nor mine either Then whose PlaintiveDen hoose it sounded like And before her conscious mind could stop her or at least censor her Susannah spoke the truth her heart and soul knew It belongs to the Tower sai The Dark Tower And its to there Ill return it ka willing Gods be with you ladysai And you Mats Long days and pleasant nights She watched the Swedish diplomat walk away then looked down at the scrimshaw turtle and said That was pretty amazing Mats old buddy Mia had no interest in the turtle she had but a single objectThis hotel she saidWill there be a telephone Three SusannahMia put the turtle into the pocket of her bluejeans and forced herself to wait for twenty minutes on the park bench She spent much of this time admiring her new lower legs whoever they belonged to they were pretty fine and wiggling her new toes inside her new stolen shoes Once she closed her eyes and summoned up the control room of the Dogan More banks of warning lights had gone on there and the machinery under the floor was throbbing louder than ever but the needle of the dial marked SUSANNAHMIO was still just a little way into the yellow Cracks in the floor had begun to appear as she had known they would but so far they didnt look serious The situation wasnt that great but she thought they could live with it for now What are you waiting forMia demandedWhy are we just sitting here Im giving the Swede a chance to do his business for us at the hotel and clear outSusannah replied And when she thought enough time had passed for him to have done that she gathered her bags got up crossed Second Avenue and started down Fortysixth Street to the Plaza  Park Hotel Four The lobby was full of pleasant afternoon light reflected by angles of green glass Susannah had never seen such a beautiful room  outside of St Patricks that was  but there was something alien about it too Because its the futureshe thought God knew there were enough signs of that The cars looked smaller and entirely different Many of the younger women she saw were walking around with their lower bellies exposed and their brastraps showing Susannah had to see this latter phenomenon four or five times on her stroll down Fortysixth Street before she could completely convince herself that it was some sort of bizarre fashion fillip and not a mistake In her day a woman with a brastrap showing or an inch of slipsnowing down south they used to say would have ducked into the nearest public restroom to pin it up and at once As for the deal with the nude bellies Would have gotten you arrested anywhere but Coney Islandshe thoughtNo doubt about it But the thing which made the biggest impression was also the hardest thing to define the city just seemedbigger It thundered and hummed all around her It vibrated Every breath of air was perfumed with its signature smell The women waiting for taxis outside the hotel with or without their brastraps showing could only be New York women the doormen not one but two flagging cabs could only be New York doormen the cabbies she was amazed by how many of them were darkskinned and she saw one who was wearing aturban  could only be New York cabbies but they were alldifferent The world had moved on It was as if her New York that of  had been a tripleA ballclub This was the major leagues She paused for a moment just inside the lobby pulling the scrimshaw turtle out of her pocket and getting her bearings To her left was a parlor area Two women were sitting there chatting and Susannah stared at them for a moment hardly able to credit how much leg they were showing under the hems of their skirts whatskirts haha And they werent teenagers or kollege kuties either these were women in their thirties at least although she supposed they might be in theirsixties who knew what scientific advances there might have been over the last thirtyfive years To the right was a little shop Somewhere in the shadows behind it a piano was tinkling out something blessedly familiar  Night and Day  and Susannah knew if she went toward the sound shed find a lot of leather seats a lot of sparkling bottles and a gentleman in a white coat whod be happy to serve her even if itwas only the middle of the afternoon All this was a decided relief Directly ahead of her was the reception desk and behind it was the most exotic woman Susannah had ever seen in her life She appeared to be white black and Chinese all whipped together In  such a woman would undoubtedly have been called a mongrel no matter how beautiful she might have been Here she had been popped into an extremely handsome ladies suit and put behind the reception desk of a large firstclass hotel The Dark Tower might be increasingly shaky Susannah thought and the world might be moving on but she thought the lovely desk clerk was proof if any were needed that noteverything was falling down or going in the wrong direction She was talking to a customer who was complaining about his inroom movie bill whatever that might be Never mind its the futureSusannah told herself once againIts science fiction like the City of Lud Best leave it at that I dont care what it is or whenMia saidI want to be near a telephone I want to see to my chap Susannah walked past a sign on a tripod then turned back and gave it a closer look AS OF JULY ST  THE NEW YORK PLAZA  PARK HYATT WILL BECOME THE REGAL UN PLAZA HOTEL ANOTHER GREATSOMBRANORTH CENTRAL PROJECT Susannah thoughtSombra as in Turtle Bay Luxury Condominiumswhich never got built from the look of that blackglass needle back on the corner And North Central as in North Central Positronics Interesting She felt a sudden twinge of pain go through her head Twinge Hell a bolt It made her eyes water And she knew who had sent it Mia who had no interest in the Sombra Corporation North Central Positronics or the Dark Tower itself was becoming impatient Susannah knew shed have to change that or at least try Mia was focused blindly on her chap but if she wanted tokeep the chap she might have to widen her field of vision a little bit She fight you ever damn step of the wayDetta said Her voice was shrewd and tough and cheerfulYou know dat too dont you She did Susannah waited until the man with the problem finished explaining how he had ordered some movie calledXRated by accident and he didnt mind paying as long as it wasnt on his bill and then she stepped up to the desk herself Her heart was pounding I believe that my friend Mathiessen van Wyck has rented a room for me she said She saw the reception clerk looking at her stained shirt with wellbred disapproval and laughed nervously I really cant wait to take a shower and change my clothes I had a small accident At lunch Yes madam Just let me check The woman went to what looked like a small TV screen with a typewriter attached She tapped a few keys looked at the screen and then said Susannah Mia Dean is that correct You say true I say thank yarose to her lips and she squelched it Yes thats right May I see some identification please For a moment Susannah was flummoxed Then she reached into the rush bag and took out an Oriza being careful to hold it by the blunt curve She found herself remembering something Roland had said to Wayne Overholser the Callas big rancherWe deal in lead The Rizas werent bullets but surely they were the equivalent She held the plate up in one hand and the small carved turtle in the other Will this do she asked pleasantly What   the beautiful desk clerk began then fell silent as her eyes shifted from the plate to the turtle They grew wide and slightly glassy Her lips coated with an interesting pink gloss it looked more like candy than lipstick to Susannah parted A soft sound came from between themohhhh Its my drivers license Susannah said Do you see Luckily there was no one else around not even a bellman The lateday checkouts were on the sidewalk fighting for hacks in here the lobby was adoze From the bar beyond the gift shop Night and Day gave way to a lazy and introspective version of Stardust Drivers license the desk clerk agreed in that same sighing wondering voice Good Are you supposed to write anything down NoMr Van Wyck rented the roomall I need is toto check yourmay I hold the turtle maam No Susannah said and the desk clerk began to weep Susannah observed this phenomenon with bemusement She didnt believe she had made so many people cry since her disastrous violin recital both first and last at the age of twelve No I may not hold it the desk clerk said weeping freely No no I may not may not hold it ah Discordia I may not   Hush up your snivel Susannah said and the desk clerk hushed at once Give me the roomkey please But instead of a key the Eurasian woman handed her a plastic card in a folder Written on the inside of the folder  so wouldbe thieves couldnt easily see it presumably  was the number  Which didnt surprise Susannah at all Mia of course could not have cared less She stumbled on her feet a little Reeled a little Had to wave one hand the one holding her drivers license for balance There was a moment when she thought she might tumble to the floor and then she was okay again Maam the desk clerk inquired Looking remotely  veryremotely  concerned Are you feeling all right Yeah Susannah said Onlylost my balance there for a second or two WonderingWhat in the blue hell just happened Oh but she knew the answer Mia was the one with the legsMia Susannah had been driving the bus ever since encountering old Mr May I Not Take TheSkldpadda and this body was starting to revert to its leglessbelowtheknee state Crazy but true Her body was going Susannah on her Mia get up here Take charge I cant Not yet As soon as were alone I will And dear Christ Susannah recognized that tone of voice recognized it very well The bitch wasshy To the desk clerk Susannah said Whats this thing Is it a key Why  yes sai You use it in the elevator as well as to open your room Just push it into the slot in the direction the arrows point Remove it briskly When the light on the door turns green you may enter I have slightly over eight thousand dollars in my cash drawer Ill give it all to you for your pretty thing your turtle yourskldpadda yourtortuga yourkavvit your   No Susannah said and staggered again She clutched the edge of the desk Her equilibrium was shot Im going upstairs now Shed meant to visit the gift shop first and spend some of Matss dough on a clean shirt if they carried such things but that would have to waitEverything would have to wait Yes sai No moremaam not now The turtle was working on her Sanding away the gap between the worlds You just forget you saw me all right Yes sai Shall I put a donotdisturb on the phone Mia clamored Susannah didnt even bother paying attention No dont do that Im expecting a call As you like sai Eyes on the turtle Ever on the turtle Enjoy the Plaza  Park Would you like a bellman to assist you with your bags Look like I need help with these three pukey lil thingsDetta thought but Susannah only shook her head Very well Susannah started to turn away but the desk clerks next words swung her back in a hurry Soon comes the King he of the Eye Susannah gaped at the woman her surprise close to shock She felt gooseflesh crawling up her arms The desk clerks beautiful face meanwhile remained placid Dark eyes on the scrimshaw turtle Lips parted now damp with spittle as well as glossIf I stay here much longer Susannah thoughtshell start to drool Susannah very much wanted to pursue the business of the King and the Eye  it washer business  and she could she was the one up front and driving the bus but she staggered again and knew she couldntunless that was she wanted to crawl to the elevator on her hands and knees with the empty lower legs of her jeans trailing out behind herMaybe later she thought knowing that was unlikely things were moving too fast now She started across the lobby walking with an educated stagger The desk clerk spoke after her in a voice expressing pleasant regret no more than that When the King comes and the Tower falls sai all such pretty things as yours will be broken Then there will be darkness and nothing but the howl of Discordia and the cries of the can toi Susannah made no reply although the gooseflesh was now all the way up the nape of her neck and she could feel her scalp tightening on her very skull Her legs someoneslegs anyway were rapidly losing all feeling If shed been able to look at her bare skin would she have seen her fine new legs going transparent Would she have been able to see the blood flowing through her veins bright red going down darker and exhausted heading back up to her heart The interwoven pigtails of muscle She thought yes She pushed the UP button and then put the Oriza back into its bag praying one of the three elevator doors would open before she collapsed The piano player had switched to Stormy Weather The door of the middle car opened SusannahMia stepped in and pushed  The door slid shut but the car went nowhere The plastic cardshe reminded herselfYou have to use the card She saw the slot and slid the card into it being careful to push in the direction of the arrows This time when she pushed  the number lit up A moment later she was shoved rudely aside as Miacame forward Susannah subsided at the back of her own mind with a kind of tired relief Yes let someone else take over why not Let someone else drive the bus for awhile She could feel the strength and substance coming back into her legs and that was enough for now Five Mia might have been a stranger in a strange land but she was a fast learner In the nineteenthfloor lobby she located the arrow with    beneath it and walked briskly down the corridor to  The carpet some thick green stuff that was delightfully soft whispered beneath her their stolen shoes She inserted the keycard opened the door and stepped in There were two beds She put the bags on one of them looked around without much interest then fixed her gaze on the telephone SusannahImpatient What How do I make it ring Susannah laughed with genuine amusementHoney you arent the first person to ask thatquestion believe me Or the millionth It either will or it wont In its own good time Meanwhile why dont you have a look around See if you cant find a place to store your gunna She expected an argument but didnt get one Mia prowled the room not bothering to open the drapes although Susannah very much wanted to see the city from this height peeked into the bathroom palatial with what looked like a marble basin and mirrors everywhere then looked into the closet Here sitting on a shelf with some plastic bags for drycleaning on top was a safe There was a sign on it but Mia couldnt read it Roland had had similar problems from time to time but his had been caused by the difference between the English language alphabet and InWorlds great letters Susannah had an idea that Mias problems were a lot more basic although her kidnapper clearly knew numbers Susannah didnt think the chaps mother could read at all Susannahcame forward but not all the way For a moment she was looking through two sets of eyes at two signs the sensation so peculiar that it made her feel nauseated Then the images came together and she could read the message THIS SAFE IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PLAZA  PARK HYATT ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITEMS LEFT HERE CASH AND JEWELRY SHOULD BE DEPOSITED IN THE HOTEL SAFE DOWNSTAIRS TO SET CODE PUNCH IN FOUR NUMBERS PLUS ENTER TO OPEN ENTER YOUR FOURNUMBER CODE AND PUSH OPEN Susannah retired and let Mia select four numbers They turned out to be a one and three nines It was the current year and might be one of the first combinations a room burglar would try but at least it wasnt quite the room number itself Besides they were theright numbers Numbers of power Asigul They both knew it Mia tried the safe after programming it found it locked tightly then followed the directions for opening it There was a whirring noise from somewhere inside and the door popped ajar She put in the faded red MIDTOWN LANES bag  the box inside just fit on the shelf  and then the bag of Oriza plates She closed and locked the safes door again tried the handle found it tight and nodded The Borders bag was still on the bed She took the wad of cash out of it and tucked it into the right front pocket of her jeans along with the turtle Have to get a clean shirtSusannah reminded her unwelcome guest Mia daughter of none made no reply She clearly caredbupkes for shirts clean or dirty Mia was looking at the telephone For the time being with her labor on hold the phone was all she cared about Now we palaverSusannah saidYou promised and its a promise youre going to keep But not in that banquet room She shudderedSomewhere outside hear me I beg I want fresh air That banqueting hall smelled of death Mia didnt argue Susannah got a vague sense of the other woman riffling through various files of memory  examining rejecting examining rejecting  and at last finding something that would serve How do we go thereMia asked indifferently The black woman who was now two women again sat on one of the beds and folded her hands in her lapLike on a sled the womans Susannah part saidIll push you steer And remember SusannahMio if you want my cooperation you give me some straight answers I willthe other repliedJust dont expect to like them Or even understand them What do you  Never mind Gods I never metanyonewho could ask so many questions Time is short When the telephone rings our palaver ends So if youd palaver at all  Susannah didnt bother giving her a chance to finish She closed her eyes and let herself fall back No bed stopped that fall she went right through it She was falling for real falling through space She could hear the jangle of the todash chimes dim and far Here I go againshe thought AndEddie I love you STAVE Commalaginjive Aint it grand to be alive To look out on Discordia When the Demon Moon arrives RESPONSE Commalacomefive Even when the shadows rise To see the world and walk the world Makes ya glad to be alive One All at once she was falling into her body again and the sensation provoked a memory of blinding brilliance Odetta Holmes at sixteen sitting on her bed in her slip sitting in a brilliant bar of sun and pulling up a silk stocking For the moment this memory held she could smell White Shoulders perfume and Ponds Beauty Bar her mothers soap and her mothers borrowed perfume so grownup to be allowed perfume and she thoughtIts the Spring Hop Im going with Nathan Freeman Then it was gone The sweet smell of Ponds soap was replaced by a clean and cold but somehow dank night breeze and all that remained was that sense so queer and perfect of stretching into a new body as if it were a stocking one was pulling up over ones calf and knee She opened her eyes The wind gusted blowing a fine grit in her face She squinted against it grimacing and raising an arm as if she might have to ward off a blow Over here a womans voice called It wasnt the voice Susannah would have expected Not strident not a triumphant caw Over here out of the wind She looked and saw a tall and comely woman beckoning to her Susannahs first look at Mia in the flesh astounded her because the chaps mother waswhite Apparently Odettathatwas now had a Caucasian side to her personality and how that must frost Detta Walkers racially sensitive butt She herself was legless again and sitting in a kind of rude oneperson cart It had been parked at a notch in a low parapet wall She looked out at the most fearsome forbidding stretch of countryside she had ever seen in her life Huge rock formations sawed at the sky and jostled into the distance They glistened like alien bone beneath the glare of a savage sickle moon Away from the glare of that lunar grin a billion stars burned like hot ice Amid the rocks with their broken edges and gaping crevices a single narrow path wound into the distance Looking at it Susannah thought that a party would have to travel that path in single fileAnd bring plenty of supplies No mushrooms to pick along the way no pokeberries either And in the distance  dim and baleful its source somewhere over the horizon  a dark crimson light waxed and wanedHeart of the rose she thought and thenNo not that Forge of the King She looked at the pulsing sullen light with helpless horrified fascination Flexand loosen Waxand wane An infection announcing itself to the sky Come to me now if youd come at all Susannah of New York said Mia She was dressed in a heavy serape and what looked like leather pants that stopped just below the knee Her shins were scabbed and scratched She wore thicksoledhuaraches on her feet For the King can fascinate even at a distance Were on the Discordia side of the Castle Would you like to end your life on the needles at the foot of this wall If he fascinates you and tells you to jump youll do just that Your bossy gunslingermen arent here to help you now are they Nay nay Youre on your own so yare Susannah tried to pull her gaze from that steadily pulsing glow and at first couldnt do it Panic bloomed in her mind if he fascinates you and tells you to jump and she seized it as a tool compressing it to an edge with which to cut through her frightened immobility For a moment nothing happened and then she threw herself backward so violently in the shabby little cart that she had to clutch the edge in order to keep herself from tumbling to the cobbles The wind gusted again blowing stonedust and grit against her face and into her hair seeming to mock her But that pullfascinationglammerwhatever it had been it was gone She looked at the dogcart so she thought it whether that was the right name or not and saw at once how it worked Simple enough too With no mule to draw itshe was the mule It was miles from the sweet light little chair theyd found in Topeka and lightyears from being able to walk on the strong legs that had conveyed her from the little park to the hotel God she missed having legs Missed it already But you made do She seized hold of the carts wooden wheels strained produced no movement strained harder Just as she was deciding shed have to get out of the chair and hopcrawl her ignominious way to where Mia waited the wheels turned with a groaning oilless creak She rumbled toward Mia who was standing behind a squat stone pillar There were a great many of these marching away into the dark along a curve Susannah supposed that once upon a time before the world had moved on archers would have stood behind them for protection while the assaulting army fired their arrows or redhot catapults or whatever you called them Then theyd step into the gaps and fire their own weapons How long ago had that been What worldwas this And how close to the Dark Tower Susannah had an idea it might be very close indeed She pushed the balky gawky protesting cart out of the wind and looked at the woman in the serape ashamed to be so out of breath after moving less than a dozen yards but unable to help panting She drew down deep breaths of the dank and somehow stony air The pillars  she had an idea they were called merlons or something like that  were on her right On her left was a circular pool of darkness surrounded by crumbling stone walls Across the way two towers rose high above the outer wall but one had been shattered as if by lightning or some powerful explosive This where we stand is the allure Mia said The wallwalk of the Castle on the Abyss once known as Castle Discordia You said you wanted fresh air I hope this does ya as they say in the Calla This is far beyond there Susannah this is deep in EndWorld near the place where your quest ends for good or for ill She paused and then said For ill almost surely Yet I care nothing for that no not I I am Mia daughter of none mother of one I care for my chap and nothing more Chap be enough for me aye Would you palaver Fine Ill tell you what I may and be true Why not What is it to me one way or the other Susannah looked around When she faced in toward the center of the castle  what she supposed was the courtyard  she caught an aroma of ancient rot Mia saw her wrinkle her nose and smiled Aye theyre long gone and the machines the later ones left behind are mostly stilled but the smell of their dying lingers doesnt it The smell of death always does Ask your friend the gunslinger thetrue gunslinger He knows for hes dealt his share of it He is responsible for much Susannah of New York The guilt of worlds hangs around his neck like a rotting corpse Yet hes gone far enough with his dry and lusty determination to finally draw the eyes of the great He will be destroyed aye and all those who stand with him I carry his doom in my own belly and I care not Her chin jutted forward in the starlight Beneath the serape her breasts heavedand Susannah saw her belly curved In this world at least Mia was very clearly pregnant Ready to burst in fact Ask your questions have at me Mia said Just remember we exist in the other world too the one where were bound together Were lying on a bed in the inn as if asleepbut we dont sleep do we Susannah Nay And when the telephone rings when my friends call we leave this place and go to them If your questions have been asked and answered fine If not thats also fine Ask Orare you not a gunslinger Her lips curved in a disdainful smile Susannah thought she was pert yes pert indeed Especially for someone who wouldnt be able to find her way from Fortysixth Street to Fortyseventh in the world they had to go back to Soshoot I should say Susannah looked once more into the darkened broken well that was the castles soft center where lay its keeps and lists its barbicans and murder holes its Godknewwhat She had taken a course in medieval history and knew some of the terms but that had been long ago Surely there was a banqueting hall somewhere down there one that she herself had supplied with food at least for awhile But her catering days were done If Mia tried to push her too hard or too far shed find that out for herself Meantime she thought shed start with something relatively easy If this is the Castle on the Abyss she said wheres the Abyss I dont see anything out that way except for a minefield of rocks And that red glow on the horizon Mia her shoulderlength black hair flying out behind her not a bit of kink in that hair as there was in Susannahs Mias was like silk pointed across the inner chasm below them to the far wall where the towers rose and the allure continued its curve This is the inner keep she said Beyond it is the village of Fedic now deserted all dead of the Red Death a thousand years ago and more Beyond that   The Red Death Susannah asked startled also frightened in spite of herself PoesRed Death Like in the story And why not Hadnt they already wandered into  and then back out of  L Frank Baums Oz What came next The White Rabbit and the Red Queen Lady I know not All I can tell you is that beyond the deserted village is the outer wall and beyond the outer wall is a great crack in the earth filled with monsters that cozen diddle increase and plot to escape Once there was a bridge across but it fell long ago In the time before counting as tis said Theyre horrors that might drive an ordinary man or woman mad at a glance She favored Susannah with a glance of her own A decidedly satiric one But not agunslinger Surely not one such asthee  Why do you mock me Susannah asked quietly Mia looked startled then grim Was it my idea to come here To stand in this miserable cold where the Kings Eye dirties the horizon and sullies the very cheek of the moon with its filthy light Nay lady Twas you so harry me not with your tongue Susannah could have responded that it hadnt been her idea to catch preg with a demons baby in the first place but this would be a terrible time to get into one of those yesyoudid noIdidnt squabbles I wasnt scolding Susannah said only asking Mia made an impatient shooing gesture with her hand as if to sayDont split hairs and halfturned away Under her breath she said I didnt go to Morehouse orno house And in any case Ill bear my chap do you hear Whichever way the cards fall Bear him and feed him All at once Susannah understood a great deal Mia mocked because she was afraid In spite of all she knew so much of herwas Susannah I didnt go to Morehouse or no housefor instance that was fromInvisible Man by Ralph Ellison When Mia had bought into Susannah she had purchased at least two personalities for the price of one It was Mia after all whod brought Detta out of retirement or perhaps deep hibernation and it was Detta who was particularly fond of that line which expressed so much of the Negros deepheld disdain for and suspicion of what was sometimes called the finer postwar Negro education Not to Morehouse orno house I know what I know in other words I heard it through the grapevine I got it on the earie dearie I picked it up on the jungle telegraph Mia she said now Whose chap is it besides yours What demon was his father do you know Mia grinned It wasnt a grin Susannah liked There was too much Detta in it too much laughing bitter knowledge Aye lady I know And youre right It was a demon got him on you a very great demon indeed say true A human one It had to have been so for know you that true demons those left on the shore of these worlds which spin around the Tower when thePrim receded are sterile And for a very good reason Then how   Your dinh is the father of my chap Mia said Roland of Gilead aye he Steven Deschain finally has his grandson although he lies rotten in his grave and knows it not Susannah was goggling at her unmindful of the cold wind rushing out of the Discordia wilderness RolandIt cant be He was beside me when the demon wasin me he was pulling Jake through from the house on Dutch Hill and fucking was thelast thing on his mind She trailed off thinking of the baby shed seen in the Dogan Thinking of those eyes Those blue bombardiers eyesNo No I refuse to believe it All the same Roland is his father Mia insisted And when the chap comes I shall name him from your own mind Susannah of New York from what you learned at the same time you learned of merlons and courtyards and trebouchets and barbicans Why not Tis a good name and fair Professor Murrays Introduction to Medieval History thats what shes talking about I will name him Mordred said she Hell grow quickly my darling boy quicker than human after his demon nature Hell grow strong The avatar of every gunslinger that ever was And so like the Mordred of your tale will he slay his father And with that Mia daughter of none raised her arms to the starshot sky and screamed although whether in sorrow terror or joy Susannah could not tell Two Hunker Mia said I have this From beneath her serape she produced a bundle of grapes and a paper sack filled with orange pokeberries as swollen as her belly Where Susannah wondered had the fruit come from Was their shared body sleepwalking back in the Plaza  Park Hotel Had there perhaps been a fruit basket she hadnt noticed Or were these the fruits of pure imagination Not that it mattered Any appetite she might have had was gone robbed by Mias claim The fact that it was impossible somehow only added to the monstrosity of the idea And she couldnt stop thinking of the baby shed seenin utero on one of those TV screens Those blue eyes No It cant be do you hear Itcannot be The wind coming through the notches between the merlons was chilling her to the bone She swung off the seat of the cart and settled herself against the allure wall beside Mia listening to the winds constant whine and looking up at the alien stars Mia was cramming her mouth with grapes Juice ran from one corner of her mouth while she spat seeds from the other corner with the rapidity of machinegun bullets She swallowed wiped her chin and said It can It can be And more it is Are you still glad you came Susannah of New York or do you wish youd left your curiosity unsatisfied If Im gonna have a baby I didnt hump for Im gonna know everything about that baby that I can Do you understand that Mia blinked at the deliberate crudity then nodded If you like Tell me how it can be Rolands And if you want me to believe anything you tell me you better start by making me believe this Mia dug her fingernails into the skin of a pokeberry stripped it away in one quick gesture and ate the fruit down greedily She considered opening another then simply rolled it between her palms those disconcertingly white palms warming it After enough of this Susannah knew the fruit would split its skin on its own Then she began Three How many Beams do there be Susannah of New York Six Susannah said At least there were I guess now there are only two that   Mia waved a hand impatiently as if to sayDont waste my time Six aye And when the Beams were created out of that greater Discordia the soup of creation some including the Manni call the Over and some call thePrim what made them I dont know Susannah said Was it God do you think Perhaps there is a God but the Beams rose from thePrim on the airs of magic Susannah the true magic which passed long ago Was it God that made magic or was it magic that made God I know not Its a question for philosophers and motherings my job But once upon a time all was Discordia and from it strong and all crossing at a single unifying point came the six Beams There was magic to hold them steady for eternity but when the magic left from all there is but the Dark Tower which some have called Can Calyx the Hall of Resumption men despaired When the Age of Magic passed the Age of Machines came North Central Positronics Susannah murmured Dipolar computers Slotrans engines She paused Blaine the Mono But not in our world No Do you say your world is exempt What about the sign in the hotel lobby The pokeberry popped Mia stripped it and gobbled it drizzling juice through a knowing grin I had an idea you couldnt read Susannah said This was beside the point but it was all she could think of to say Her mind kept returning to the image of the baby to those brilliant blue eyes Gunslingers eyes Aye but I know my numbers and when it comes to your mind I read very well Do you say you dont recall the sign in the hotel lobby Will you tell me that Of course she remembered According to the sign the Plaza  Park would be part of an organization called SombraNorth Central in just another month And when shed saidNot in our world of course she had been thinking of   the world of blackandwhite television absurdly bulky roomsized computers and Alabama cops more than willing to sic the dogs on black marchers for voting rights Things had changed greatly in the intervening thirtyfive years The Eurasian desk clerks combination TV and typewriter for instance  how did Susannah know that wasnt a dipolar computer run by some form of slotrans engine She did not Go on she told Mia Mia shrugged You doom yourselves Susannah You seem positively bent on it and the root is always the same your faith fails you and you replace it with rational thought But there is no love in thought nothing that lasts in deduction only death in rationalism What does this have to do with your chap I dont know Theres much I dont know She raised a hand forestalling Susannah before Susannah could speak And no Imnot playing for time or trying to lead you away from what youd know Im speaking as my heart tells me Would you hear or not Susannah nodded Shed hear thisfor a little longer at least But if it didnt turn back to the baby soon shed turn it back in that direction herself The magic went away Maerlyn retired to his cave in one world the sword of Eld gave way to the pistols of the gunslingers in another and the magic went away And across the arc of years great alchemists great scientists and great  what  technicians I think Great men of thought anyway thats what I mean great men ofdeduction  these came together and created the machines which ran the Beams They were great machines but they weremortal machines They replaced themagic withmachines do ya kennit and now the machines are failing In some worlds great plagues have decimated whole populations Susannah nodded We saw one of those she said quietly They called it the superflu The Crimson Kings Breakers are only hurrying along a process thats already in train The machines are going mad Youve seen this for yourself The men believed there would always be more men like them to make more machines None of them foresaw whats happened Thisthis universal exhaustion The world has moved on Aye lady It has And left no one to replace the machines which hold up the last magic in creation for thePrim has receded long since The magic is gone and the machines are failing Soon enough the Dark Tower will fall Perhaps therell be time for one splendid moment of universal rational thought before the darkness rules forever Wouldnt that be nice Wont the Crimson King be destroyed too when the Tower falls Him and all his crew The guys with the bleeding holes in their foreheads He has been promised his own kingdom where hell rule forever tasting his own special pleasures Distaste had crept into Mias voice Fear too perhaps Promised Promised by whom Who is more powerful than he Lady I know not Perhaps this is only what he has promised himself Mia shrugged Her eyes wouldnt quite meet Susannahs Can nothing prevent the fall of the Tower Not even your gunslinger friend hopes toprevent it Mia said only to slow it down by freeing the Breakers and  perhaps  slaying the Crimson King Save itSave it O delight Did he ever tell you that was his quest Susannah considered this and shook her head If Roland had ever said that in so many words she couldnt remember And she was sure she would have No Mia went on for he wont lie to his katet unless he has to tis his pride What he wants of the Tower is only tosee it Then she added rather grudgingly Oh perhaps to enter it and climb to the room at the top his ambition may strike so far He may dream of standing on its allure as we hunker on this one and chant the names of his fallen comrades and of his line all the way back to Arthur Eld Butsave it No good lady Only a return of the magic could possibly save it and  as you yourself well know  your dinh deals only in lead Never since crossing the worlds had Susannah heard Rolands trade of hand cast in such a paltry light It made her feel sad and angry but she hid her feelings as best she could Tell me how your chap can be Rolands son for I would hear Aye tis a good trick but one the old people of River Crossing could have explained to you Ive no doubt Susannah started at that How do you know somuch of me Because you are possessed Mia said and I am your possessor sure I can look through any of your memories that I like I can read what your eyes see Now be quiet and listen if you would learn for I sense our time has grown short Four This is what Susannahs demon told her There are six Beams as you did say but there are twelve Guardians one for each end of each Beam This  for were still on it  is the Beam of Shardik Were you to go beyond the Tower it would become the Beam of Maturin the great turtle upon whose shell the world rests Similarly there are but six demon elementals one for each Beam Below them is the whole invisible world those creatures left behind on the beach of existence when thePrim receded There are speaking demons demons of house which some call ghosts illsick demons which some  makers of machines and worshippers of the great false god rationality if it does ya  call disease Many small demons but only six demon elementals Yet as there are twelve Guardians for the six Beams there are twelve demonaspects for each demon elemental is both male and female Susannah began to see where this was going and felt a sudden sinking in her guts From the naked bristle of rocks beyond the allure in what Mia called the Discordia there came a dry feverish cackle of laughter This unseen humorist was joined by a second a third a fourth and fifth Suddenly it seemed that the whole world was laughing at her And perhaps with good reason for it was a good joke But how could she have known As the hyenas  or whatever they were  cackled she said Youre telling me that the demon elementals are hermaphrodites Thats why theyre sterile because theyre both Aye In the place of the Oracle your dinh had intercourse with one of these demon elementals in order to gain information whats calledprophecy in the High Speech He had no reason to think the Oracle was anything but a succubus such as those that sometimes exist in the lonely places   Right Susannah said just a runofthemill demon sexpot If you like Mia said and this time when she offered Susannah a pokeberry Susannah took it and began to roll it between her palms warming the skin She still wasnt hungry but her mouth was dry So dry The demon took the gunslingers seed as female and gave it back to you as male When we were in the speaking ring Susannah said dismally She was remembering how the pouring rain had pounded against her upturned face the sense of invisible hands on her shoulders and then the things engorgement filling her up and at the same time seeming to tear her apart The worst part had been the coldness of the enormous cock inside her At the time shed thought it was like being fucked by an icicle And how had she gotten through it By summoning Detta of course By calling on the bitch victor in a hundred nasty little sexskirmishes fought in the parking lots of two dozen roadhouses and countyline honkytonks Detta who had trapped it  It tried to get away she told Mia Once it figured out it had its cock caught in a damn Chinese fingerpuller it tried to get away If it had wanted to get away Mia said quietly itwould have Why would it bother fooling me Susannah asked but she didnt need Mia to answer that question not now Because it had needed her of course It had needed her to carry the baby Rolandsbaby Rolands doom You know everything you need to know about the chap Mia said Dont you Susannah supposed she did A demon had taken in Rolands seed while female had stored it somehow and then shot it into Susannah Dean as male Mia was right She knew what she needed to know Ive kept my promise Mia said Lets go back The colds not good for the chap Just a minute longer Susannah said She held up the pokeberry Golden fruit now bulged through ruptures in the orange skin My berry just popped Let me eat it I have another question Eat and ask and be quick about both Who areyou  Who are you really Are you this demon Does she have a name by the way She and he do they have a name No Mia said Elementals have no need of names they are what they are Am I a demon Is that what youd know Yar I suppose I am Or I was All that is vague now like a dream And youre not meor are you Mia didnt answer And Susannah realized that she probably didnt know Mia Low Musing Mia was hunkering against the merlon with her serape tucked between her knees Susannah could see that her ankles were swollen and felt a moments pity for the woman Then she squashed it This was no time for pity for there was no truth in it You aint nothing but the babysitter girl The reaction was all shed hoped for and more Mias face registered shock then anger Hellfury Youlie Im this chapsmother And when he comes Susannah there will be no more combing the world for Breakers for my chap will be the greatest of them all able to break both of the remaining Beams all by himself Her voice had filled with pride that sounded alarmingly close to insanity My Mordred Do you hear me Oh yes Susannah said I hear And youre actually going to go trotting right to those whove made it their business to pull down the Tower arent you They call you come She paused then finished with deliberate softness And when you get to them theyll take your chap and thank you very much and then send you back into the soup you came from Nay I shall have the raising of him for so they have promised Mia crossed her arms protectively over her belly Hes mine Im his mother and I shall have the raising of him Girl why dont you getreal Do you think theyllkeep their wordThem How can you see so much and not see that Susannah knew the answer of course Motherhood itself had deluded her Why would they not let me raise him Mia asked shrilly Who better Who better than Mia who was made for only two things to bear a son and raise him But youre not just you Susannah said Youre like the children of the Calla and just about everything else my friends and I have run into along the way Youre atwin Mia Im your other half your lifeline You see the world through my eyes and breathe through my lungs I had to carry the chap because you couldnt could you Youre as sterile as the big boys And once theyve got your kid their Abomb of a Breaker theyll get rid of you if only so they can get rid of me I have their promise she said Her face was downcast set in its stubbornness Turn it around Susannah said Turn it around I beg If I were in your place and you in mine what would you think if I spoke of such a promise Id tell you to stop your blabbering tongue Who are you really Where in the hell did they get you Was it like a newspaper ad you answered Surrogate Mother Wanted Good Benefits Short Term of Employment Who are you really Shut up Susannah leaned forward on her haunches This position was ordinarily exquisitely uncomfortable for her but shed forgotten both her discomfort and the halfeaten pokeberry in her hand Come on she said her voice taking on the rasping tones of Detta Walker Come on and take off yo blindfold honeybunch jus like you made me take off mine Tell the truth and spit in the devils eyeWho the fuck are you  I dont knowMia screamed and below them the jackals hidden in the rocks screamed back only their screams were laughterI dont know I dont know who I am does that satisfy It did not and Susannah was about to press on and press harder when Detta Walker spoke up Five This is what Susannahs other demon told her Babydoll you need to think bout this a little seem to meShecaint she stone dumb caint read caint cipher more than just a little aint been to Morehouse aint been to nohouse but youhave Miss OhDetta Holmes been to Co  lumbeeya lahdedah de Gem ob de Ocean aint we jus so fine You need to think bout how she pregnant for one thing She say she done fucked Roland out of his jizz then turn male into the Demon of the Ring and shot it into you and den you carryin it you tossin all those nasty things she made you eat down yo throat so whereshein all this now dat what Detta like to know How come shesettin there pregnant under dat greaser blanket she wearin Is it more of datwhat you call itvisualization technique Susannah didnt know She only knew that Mia was looking at her with suddenly narrowed eyes She was doubtless picking up some of this monologue How much Not much at all that was Susannahs bet maybe a word here and there but mostly it was just quack And in any case Mia certainlyacted like the babys mother Baby Mordred It was like a Charles Addams cartoon Dat she doDetta musedShe acklike a Mommy she wrapped around it root and branch you right bout dat much But maybe Susannah thought that was just her nature Maybe once you got beyond the mothering instinct therewas no Mia A cold hand reached out and seized Susannahs wrist Who is it Is it that nastytalking one If it is banish her She scares me She still scared Susannah a little in all truth but not as much as when shed first come to accept that Detta was real They hadnt become friends and probably never would but it was clear that Detta Walker could be a powerful ally She was more than mean Once you got past the idiotic Butterfly McQueen accent she was shrewd Dis Mia make a mighty powful ally her ownself if you cd get her on yo side Aint hardly nothin in the world as powful as a pissedoff Mommy Were going back Mia said Ive answered your questions the colds bad for the baby and the mean ones here Palavers done But Susannah shook off her grip and moved back a little out of Mias immediate reach In the gap between the merlons the cold wind knifed through her light shirt but it also seemed to clear her mind and refresh her thinking Part of her is me because she has access to my memories Eddies ring the people of River Crossing Blaine the Mono But shes got to bemorethan me as well becausebecause Go on girl you aint doin bad but youslow Because she knows all thisotherstuff as well She knows about the demons both the little ones and the elementals She knows how the Beams came into being  sort of  and about this magical soup of creation the PrimAs far as I ever knew prims a word you use for girls who are always yanking their skirts down over their knees She didnt get that other meaning from me It occurred to her what this conversation was like parents studying their new baby Their new chap Hes got your nose Yes but hes gotyour eyes and But my goodnesswhere did he get that hair Detta saidAnd she also got friens back in New York dont forget datLeast she want to thinkthey her friens So shes someone or something else as well Someone from the invisible world of house demons and illsicks But who Is she really one of the elementals Detta laughedShe say so but she lyin bout dat sugar I know she is Then what is she Whatwasshe before she was Mia All at once a phone amplified to almost earsplitting shrillness began to ring It was so out of place on this abandoned castle tower that at first Susannah didnt know what it was The things out there in the Discordia  jackals hyenas whatever they were  had been subsiding but with the advent of this sound they began to cackle and shriek again Mia daughter of none mother of Mordred knew that ringing for what it was immediately however Shecame forward Susannah at once felt this world waver and lose its reality It seemed almost to freeze and become something like a painting Not a very good one either No she shouted and threw herself at Mia But Mia  pregnant or not scratched up or not swollen ankles or no swollen ankles  overpowered her easily Roland had shown them several handtohand tricks the Detta part of her had crowed with delight at the nastiness of them but they were useless against Mia she parried each before Susannah had done more than get started Sure yes of course she knows your tricks just like she knows about Aunt Talitha in River Crossing and Topsy the Sailor in Lud because she has access to your memories because she is at least to some extentyou  And here her thoughts ended because Mia had twisted her arms up behind her and oh dear God the pain was enormous Aint you just the most babyish cuntDetta said with a kind of genial panting contempt and before Susannah could reply an amazing thing happened the world ripped open like a brittle piece of paper This rip extended from the dirty cobbles of the allures floor to the nearest merlon and then on up into the sky It raced into that starshot firmament and tore the crescent moon in two There was a moment for Susannah to think that this was it one or both of the final two Beams had snapped and the Tower had fallen Then through the rip she saw two women lying on one of the twin beds in room  of the Plaza  Park Hotel Their arms were around each other and their eyes were shut They were dressed in identical bloodstained shirts and bluejeans Their features were the same but one had legs below the knee and straight silky hair and white skin Dont you mess with me Mia panted in her ear Susannah could feel a fine tickling spray of saliva Dont you mess with me or with my chap Because Im stronger do you hearIm stronger  There was no doubt about that Susannah thought as she was propelled toward the widening hole At least for now She was pushed through the rip in reality For a moment her skin seemed simultaneously on fire and coated with ice Somewhere the todash chimes were ringing and then  Six  she sat up on the bed One woman not two but at least one with legs Susannah was shoved reeling to the back Mia in charge now Mia reaching for the phone at first getting it wrongwayup and then reversing it Hello Hello Hello Mia My name is   She overrode him Are you going to let me keep my baby This bitch inside me says youre not There was a pause first long and then too long Susannah felt Mias fear first a rivulet and then a floodYou dont have to feel that way she tried to tell herYoure the one with what they want with what they needdont you see that Hello are you there Godsare you there PLEASE TELL ME YOURE STILL THERE  Im here the mans voice said calmly Shall we start again Mia daughter of none Or shall I ring off until youre feelinga little more yourself No No dont do that dont do that I beg You wont interrupt me again Because theres no reason for unseemliness I promise My name is Richard P Sayre A name Susannah knew but from where You know where you need to go dont you Yes Eager now Eager to please The Dixie Pig Sixtyfirst and Lexingworth Lexington Sayre said Odetta Holmes can help you find it Im sure Susannah wanted to screamThats not my name She kept silent instead This Sayre would like her to scream wouldnt he Would like her to lose control Are you there Odetta Pleasantly teasing Are you there you interfering bitch She kept silent Shes in there Mia said I dont know why shes not answering Im not holding her just now Oh I thinkI know why Sayre said indulgently She doesnt like that name for one thing Then in a reference Susannah didnt get  Dont call me Clay no more Clay my slave name call me Muhammad Ali Right Susannah Or was that after your time A little after I think Sorry Time can be so confusing cant it Never mind I have something to tell you in a minute my dear You wont like it very much I fear but I think you should know Susannah kept silent It was getting harder As for the immediate future of your chap Mia Im surprised youd even feel it necessary to ask Sayre told her He was a smoothie whoever he was his voice containing exactly the right amount of outrage The King keeps his promises unlike some I could name And issues of our integrity aside think of thepractical issues Who else should have the keeping of perhaps the most important child to ever be bornincludingChristincluding Buddhaincluding the Prophet Muhammad To who elses breast if I may be crude would we trust his suck Music to her earsSusannah thought dismallyAll the things shes been thirsting to hear And why Because she is Mother Youd trust him to me Mia cried Only to me of course Thank youThank you Susannah spoke at last Toldher not to trusthim And was of course roundly ignored Id no more lie to you than break a promise to my own mother said the voice on the phone Did you ever have one sugarDetta wanted to know Even though the truth sometimes hurts lies have a way of coming back to bite us dont they The truth of this matter is you wont have your chap for long Mia his childhood wont be like that of other children normal children   I know Oh I know   but for the five years youdo have himor perhaps seven it might be as many as sevenhell have the best of everything From you of course but also from us Our interference will be minimal   Detta Walker leaped forward as quick and as nasty as a greaseburn She was only able to take possession of Susannah Deans vocal cords for a moment but it was aprecious moment Dass raht dahlin dass raht she cackled he wont come in yo mouf or get it in you hair Shut that bitch UPSayre whipcracked and Susannah felt the jolt as Mia shoved Detta head over heels  but still cackling  to the back of their shared mind again Once more into the brig Had mah say though damn if I didntDetta criedAh tolethat honky muhfuh Sayres voice in the telephones earpiece was cold and clear Mia do you have control or not Yes Yes I do Then dont let that happen again I wont And somewhere  it felt like above her although there were no real directions here at the back of the shared mind  something clanged shut It sounded like iron We reallyarein the brig she told Detta but Detta just went on laughing Susannah thoughtIm pretty sure I know who she is anyway Besides me that is This truth seemed obvious to her The part of Mia that wasnt either Susannah or something summoned from the void world to do the Crimson Kings biddingsurely the third part really was the Oracle elemental or not the female force that had at first tried to molest Jake and then had taken Roland instead That sad craving spirit She finally had the body she needed One capable of carrying the chap Odetta Sayres voice teasing and cruel Or Susannah if you like that better I promised you news didnt I Its kind of a good news  bad news thing Im afraid Would you like to hear it Susannah held her silence The bad news is that Mias chap may not be able to fulfill the destiny of his name by killing his father after all The good news is that Roland will almost surely be dead in the next few minutes As for Eddie Im afraid theres no question He doesnt have either your dinhs reflexes or his battle experience My dear youre going to be a widow very soon Thats the bad news She could hold her silence no longer and Mia let her speak You lie Abouteverything  Not at all Sayre said calmly and Susannah realized where she knew that name from the end of Callahans story Detroit Where hed violated his churchs most sacred teaching and committed suicide to keep from falling into the hands of the vampires Callahan had jumped out of a skyscraper window to avoid that particular fate He had landed first in MidWorld and gone from there via the Unfound Door into the Calla Borderlands And what hed been thinking the Pere had told them wasThey dont get to win they dont get to win And he was right about thatright goddammit But if Eddie died  We knew where your dinh and your husband would be most likely to end up should they be swept through a certain doorway Sayre told her And calling certain people beginning with a chap named Enrico BalazarI assure you Susannah that waseasy  Susannah heard the sincerity in his voice If he didnt mean what he said then he was the worlds best liar How could you find such a thing out Susannah asked When there was no answer she opened her mouth to ask the question again Before she could she was tumbled backward once more Whatever Mia might have been once she had grown to incredible strength inside Susannah Is she gone Sayre was asking Yes gone in the back Servile Eager to please Then come to us Mia The sooner you come to us the sooner you can look your chap in the face Yes Mia cried delirious with joy and Susannah caught a sudden brilliant glimpse of something It was like peeking beneath the hem of a circus tent at some bright wonder Or a dark one What she saw was as simple as it was terrible Pere Callahan buying a piece of salami from a shopkeeper AYankee shopkeeper One who ran a certain general store in the town of East Stoneham Maine in the year of  Callahan had told them all this story in the rectoryand Mia had been listening Comprehension came like a red sun rising on a field where thousands have been slaughtered Susannah rushed forward again unmindful of Mias strength screaming it over and over again Bitch Betraying bitch Murdering bitch You told them where the Door would send them Where it would send Eddie and Roland Oh youBITCH Seven Mia was strong but unprepared for this new attack It was especially ferocious because Detta had joined her own murderous energy to Susannahs understanding For a moment the interloper was pushed backward eyes wide In the hotel room the telephone dropped from Mias hand She staggered drunkenly across the carpet almost tripped over one of the beds then whirled about like a tipsy dancer Susannah slapped at her and red marks appeared on her cheek like exclamation points Slapping myself thats all Im doingSusannah thoughtBeating up the equipment how stupid is that But she couldnt help it The enormity of what Mia had done the betrayingenormity  Inside in some battlering which was not quite physical but not entirely mental either Mia was finally able to clutch SusannahDetta by the throat and drive her back Mias eyes were still wide with shock at the ferocity of the assault And perhaps with shame as well Susannah hoped she was able to feel shame that she hadnt gone beyond that I did what I had to doMia repeated as she forced Susannah back into the brigIts my chap every hand is against me I did what I had to do You traded Eddie and Roland for your monster thats what you didSusannah screamedBased on what you overheard and then passed on Sayre was sure theyd use the Door to go after Tower wasnt he And how many has he set against them The only answer was that iron clang Only this time it was followed by a second And a third Mia had had the hands of her hostess clamped around her throat and was consequently taking no chances This time the brigs door had been triplelocked Brig Hell might as well call it the Black Hole of Calcutta When I get out of here Ill go back to the Dogan and disable all the switchesshe criedI cant believe I tried to help you Well fuck that Have it on the street for all of me Youcantget out Mia replied almost apologeticallyLater if I can Ill leave you in peace  What kind of peace will there be for me with Eddie dead No wonder you wanted to take his ring off How could you bear to have it lie against your skin knowing what youd done Mia picked up the telephone and listened but Richard P Sayre was no longer there Probably had places to go and diseases to spread Susannah thought Mia replaced the telephone in its cradle looked around at the empty sterile room the way people do when they wont be coming back to a place and want to make sure theyve taken everything that matters She patted one pocket of her jeans and felt the little wad of cash Touched the other and felt the lump that was the turtle theskldpadda Im sorryMia saidI have to take care of my chap Every hand is against me now Thats not trueSusannah said from the locked room where Mia had thrown her And where was it really In the deepest darkest dungeons of the Castle on the Abyss Probably Did it matterI was on your side I helped you I stopped your damn labor when you needed it stopped And look what you did How could you ever be so cowardly and low Mia paused with her hand on the rooms doorknob her cheeks flushing a dull red Yes she was ashamed all right But shame wouldnt stop herNothing would stop her Until that was she found herself betrayed in turn by Sayre and his friends Thinking of that inevitability gave Susannah no satisfaction at all Youre damnedshe saidYou know that dont you I dont care Mia said An eternity in hells a fair price to pay for one look in my chaps face Hear me well I beg And then carrying Susannah and Detta with her Mia opened the hotel room door reentered the corridor and took her first steps on her course toward the Dixie Pig where terrible surgeons waited to deliver her of her equally terrible chap STAVE Commalamoxnix Youre in a nasty fix To take the hand in a traitors glove Is to grasp a sheaf of sticks RESPONSE Commalacomesix Nothing there but thorns and sticks When you find your hand in a traitors glove Youre in a nasty fix One Roland Deschain was the last of Gileads last great band of warriors for good reason with his queerly romantic nature his lack of imagination and his deadly hands he had ever been the best of them Now he had been invaded by arthritis but there was no dry twist in his ears or eyes He heard the thud of Eddies head against the side of the Unfound Door as they were sucked through and ducking down at the last split second only just avoided having his own skull broken in by the Doors top jamb He heard the sound of birds at first strange and distant like birds singing in a dream then immediate and prosaic and completely there Sunlight struck his face and should have dazzled him blind coming as he was from the dimness of the cave But Roland had turned his eyes into slits the moment hed seen that bright light had done it without thinking Had he not he surely would have missed the circular flash from two oclock as they landed on hardpacked oildarkened earth Eddie would have died for sure Maybe both of them would have died In Rolands experience only two things glared with that perfect brilliant circularity eyeglasses and the long sight of a weapon The gunslinger grabbed Eddie beneath the arm as unthinkingly as hed slitted his eyes against the glare of onrushing sunlight Hed felt the tension in the younger mans muscles as their feet left the rockand bonelittered floor of the Doorway Cave and he felt them go slack when Eddies head connected with the side of the Unfound Door But Eddie was groaning still trying to talk so he was at least partly aware Eddie to meRoland bellowed scrambling to his feet Bitter agony exploded in his right hip and raced almost all the way down to his knee but he gave no sign Barely registered it in fact He hauled Eddie with him toward a building some building and past what even Roland recognized as oil or gasoline pumps These were marked MOBIL instead of CITGO or SUNOCO two other names with which the gunslinger was familiar Eddie was semiconscious at best His left cheek was drenched with blood from a laceration in his scalp Nevertheless he put his legs to work as best he could and stumbled up three wooden steps to what Roland now recognized as a general store It was quite a bit smaller than Tooks but otherwise not much d A limber whipcrack of sound came from behind and slightly to the right The shooter was close enough for Roland to feel confident that if he had heard the sound of the shot the man with the rifle had already missed Something passed within an inch of his ear making its own perfectly clear soundMizzzzzz The glass in the little mercantiles front door shattered inward The sign which had been hanging there  WERE OPEN SO COME IN N VISIT  jumped and twisted Rolan Eddies voice weak and distant sounded as if it were coming through a mouthful of mush Rolan whawhoOWF This last a grunt of surprise as Roland threw him flat inside the door and landed on top of him Now came another of those limber whipcracks there was a gunner with an extremely highpowered rifle out there Roland heard someone shout Aw fuck at Jack and a moment later a speedshooter  what Eddie and Jake called a machinegun  opened up The dirty display windows on both sides of the door came crashing down in bright shards The paperwork which had been posted inside the glass  town notices Roland had no doubt  went flying Two women and a gent of goingonelderly years were the only customers in the stores aisles All three were turned toward the front  toward Roland and Eddie  and on their faces was the eternal uncomprehending look of the gunless civilian Roland sometimes thought it a grasseating look as though such folk  those in Calla Bryn Sturgis mostly no different  were sheep instead of people DownRoland bellowed from where he lay on his semiconscious and now breathless companion For the love of your godsget DOWN  The goingonelderly gent who was wearing a checked flannel shirt in spite of the stores warmth let go of the can hed been holding there was a picture of a tomato on it and dropped The two women did not and the speedshooters second burst killed them both caving in the chest of one and blowing off the top of the others head The chestshot woman went down like a sack of grain The one whod been headshot took two blind blundering steps toward Roland blood spewing from where her hair had been like lava from an erupting volcano Outside the store a second and third speedshooter began filling the day with noise filling the air above them with a deadly crisscross of slugs The woman whod lost the top of her head spun around twice in a final dancestep arms flailing and then collapsed Roland went for his gun and was relieved to find it still in its holster the reassuring sandalwood grip So that much was well The gamble had paid off And he and Eddie certainly werent todash The gunners had seen them seen them very well More Had beenwaiting for them Move in someone was screaming Move in move in dont give em a chance to find their peckers move in youcatzarros  Eddie Roland roared Eddie you have to help me now Hizz Faint Bemused Eddie looking at him with only one eye the right The left was temporarily drowned in blood from his scalpwound Roland reached out and slapped him hard enough to make blood fly from his hair HarriersComing to kill us Kill all here Eddies visible eye cleared It happened fast Roland saw the effort that took  not to regain his wits but to regain them at such speed and despite a head that must be pounding monstrously  and took a moment to be proud of Eddie He was Cuthbert Allgood all over again Cuthbert to the life What the hells this someone called in a cracked excited voice Justwhat in the bluehell isthis  Down Roland said without looking around If you want to live get on the floor Do what he says Chip someone else replied  probably Roland thought the man whod been holding the can with the tomato on it Roland crawled through litters of broken glass from the door feeling pricks and prinks of pain as some cut his knees and knuckles not caring A bullet buzzed past his temple Roland ignored that too Outside was a brilliant summer day In the foreground were the two oilpumps with MOBIL printed on them To one side was an old car probably belonging to either the women shoppers whod never need it again or to Mr Flannel Shirt Beyond the pumps and the oiled dirt of the parking area was a paved country road and on the other side of that a little cluster of buildings painted a uniform gray One was marked TOWN OFFICE one STONEHAM FIRE AND RESCUE The third and largest was the TOWN GARAGE The parking area in front of these buildings was also paved metaledwas Rolands word for it and a number of vehicles had been parked there one the size of a large buckawaggon From behind them came more than half a dozen men at full charge One hung back and Roland recognized him Enrico Balazars ugly lieutenant Jack Andolini The gunslinger had seen this man die gunshot and then eaten alive by the carnivorous lobstrosities which lived in the shallow waters of the Western Sea but here he was again Because infinite worlds spun on the axle which was the Dark Tower and here was another of them Yet only one world was true only one where when things were finished theystayed finished It might be this one it might not be In either case this was no time to worry about it Up on his knees Roland opened fire fanning the trigger of his revolver with the hard ridge of his right hand aiming first at the boys with the speedshooters One of them dropped dead on the country roads white centerline with blood boiling out of his throat The second was flung backward all the way to the roads dirt shoulder with a hole between his eyes Then Eddie was beside him also on his knees fanning the trigger of Rolands other gun He missed at least two of his targets which wasnt surprising given his condition Three others dropped to the road two dead and one screamingIm hit Ah Jack help me Im hit in the guts Someone grabbed Rolands shoulder unaware of what a dangerous thing that was to do to a gunslinger especially one in a firefight Mister what in the hell   Roland took a quick look saw a fortyish man wearing both a tie and a butchers apron had time to thinkShopkeeper probably the one who gave Pere directions to the post office and then shoved the man violently backward A split second later blood dashed backward from the left side of the mans head Grooved the gunslinger judged but not seriously hurt at least not yet If Roland hadnt pushed him however  Eddie was reloading Roland did the same taking a bit longer thanks to the missing fingers on his right hand Meanwhile two of the surviving harriers had taken cover behind one of the old cars on this side of the road Too close Not good Roland could hear the rumble of an approaching motor He looked back at the fellow whod been quickwitted enough to drop when Roland told him to thus avoiding the fate of the ladies You Roland said Do you have a gun The man in the flannel shirt shook his head His eyes were a brilliant blue Frightened but not Roland judged panicky In front of this customer the shopkeeper was sitting up spreadlegged looking with sickened amazement at the red droplets pattering down and spreading on his white apron Shopkeeper do you keep a gun Roland asked Before the shopkeeper could answer  if he was capable of answering  Eddie grabbed Rolands shoulder Charge of the Light Brigade he said The words came out mushy  sharr uvva lie briggay  but Roland wouldnt have understood the reference in any case The important thing was that Eddie had seen another six men dashing across the road This time they were spread out and zigzagging from side to side Vai vai vaiAndolini bawled from behind them sweeping both hands in the air Christ Roland thats Tricks Postino Eddie said Tricks was once more toting an extremely large weapon although Eddie couldnt be sure it was the oversized M hed called The Wonderful Rambo Machine In any case he was no luckier here than hed been in the shootout at the Leaning Tower Eddie fired and Tricks went down on top of one of the guys already lying in the road still firing his assault weapon at them as he did so This was probably nothing more heroic than a fingerspasm final signals sent from a dying brain but Roland and Eddie had to throw themselves flat again and the other five outlaws reached cover behind the old cars on this side of the road Worse still Backed by covering fire from the vehicles across the street  the vehicles these boys had come in Roland was quite sure  they would soon be able to turn this little store into a shooting gallery without too much danger to themselves All of this was too close to what had happened at Jericho Hill It was time to beat a retreat The sound of the approaching vehicle continued to swell  a big engine laboring under a heavy load from the sound What topped the rise to the left of the store was a gigantic truck filled with enormous cut trees Roland saw the drivers eyes widen and his mouth drop open and why not Here in front of this smalltown mercantile where he had doubtless stopped many times for a bottle of beer or ale at the end of a long hot day in the woods lay half a dozen bleeding bodies scattered in the road like soldiers killed in a battle Which was Roland knew exactly what they were The big trucks front brakes shrieked From the rear came the angrydragon chuff of the airbrakes There was an accompanying scream of huge rubber tires first locking and then smoking black tracks on the metaled surface of the road The trucks multiton load began to slew sideways Roland saw splinters flying from the trees and into the blue sky as the outlaws on the far side of the road continued to fire heedlessly There was something almost hypnotic about all this like watching one of the Lost Beasts of Eld come tumbling out of the sky with its wings on fire The trucks horseless front end ran over the first of the bodies Guts flew in red ropes and splashed the dirt of the shoulder Legs and arms were torn off A wheel squashed Tricks Postinos head the sound of his imploding skull like a chestnut bursting in a hot fire The trucks load broached sideways and began to totter Wheels fully as high as Rolands shoulders dug in and tossed up clouds of bloody dirt The truck slid by the store with a majestic lack of speed The driver was no longer visible in the cab For a moment the store and the people inside it were blocked from the superior firepower on the other side of the road The shopkeeper  Chip  and the surviving customer  Mr Flannel Shirt  were staring at the broaching truck with identical expressions of helpless amazement The shopkeeper absently wiped blood from the side of his head and flicked it onto the floor like water His wound was worse than Eddies Roland judged yet he seemed unaware of it Maybe that was good Out back the gunslinger said to Eddie Now Good call Roland grabbed the man in the flannel shirt by the arm The mans eyes immediately left the truck and went to the gunslinger Roland nodded toward the back and the elderly gent nodded back His unquestioning quickness was an unexpected gift Outside the trucks load finally overturned mashing one of the parked cars and the harriers hiding behind it Roland dearly hoped spilling logs first off the top and then simply spilling them all There was a gruesome endless sound of scraping metal that made the gunfire seem puny by comparison Two Eddie grabbed the storekeeper just as Roland had grabbed the other man but Chip showed none of his customers awareness or instinct for survival He merely went on staring through the jagged hole where his windows had been eyes wide with shock and awe as the pulptruck out there entered the final phase of its selfdestructive ballet the cab twisting free of the overloaded carrier and bouncing down the hill beyond the store and into the woods The load itself went sliding up the right side of the road creating a huge bowwave of dirt and leaving behind a deep groove a flattened Chevrolet and two more flattened harriers There were plenty more where those came from though Or so it seemed The gunfire continued Come on Chip time to split Eddie said and this time when he tugged the shopkeeper toward the back of the store Chip came still looking back over his shoulder and wiping blood from the side of his face At the rear of the market on the left was an addedon lunchroom with a counter a few patched stools three or four tables and an old lobsterpot over a newsstand which seemed to contain mostly outofdate girlie magazines As they reached this part of the building the gunfire from outside intensified Then it was dwarfed again this time by an explosion The pulpers fueltank Eddie assumed He felt the droning passage of a bullet and saw a round black hole appear in the picture of a lighthouse mounted on the wall Whoare those guys Chip asked in a perfectly conversational voice Who are you Am I hit My son was in Viet Nam you know Did you see that truck Eddie answered none of his questions just smiled and nodded and hustled Chip along in Rolands wake He had absolutely no idea where they were going or how they were going to get out of this fuckaree The only thing he was completely sure of was that Calvin Tower wasnt here Which was probably good Tower might or might not have brought down this particular batch of hellfire and brimstone but the hellfire and brimstone wasabout old Cal of that Eddie had no doubt If old Cal had only  A darningneedle of heat suddenly tore through his arm and Eddie shouted in surprise and pain A moment later another punched him in the calf His lower right leg exploded intoserious pain and he cried out again Eddie Roland chanced a look back Are you   Yeah fine go go Ahead of them now was a cheap fiberboard back wall with three doors in it One was marked BUOYS one GULLS one EMPLOYEES ONLY E MPLOYEES ONLY  Eddie shouted He looked down and saw a bloodringed hole in his bluejeans about three inches below his right knee The bullet hadnt exploded the knee itself which was to the good but oh Mama it hurt like the veriest motherfucker of creation Over his head a lightglobe exploded Glass showered down on Eddies head and shoulders Im insured but God knows if it covers somethin likethis  Chip said in his perfectly conversational voice He wiped more blood from his face then slatted it off his fingertips and onto the floor where it made a Rorschach inkblot Bullets buzzed around them Eddie saw one flip up Chips collar Somewhere behind them Jack Andolini  old DoubleUgly  was hollering in Italian Eddie somehow didnt think he was calling retreat Roland and the customer in the flannel shirt went through the EMPLOYEES ONLY door Eddie followed pumped up on the wine of adrenaline and still dragging Chip This was a storeroom and of quite a good size Eddie could smell different kinds of grain some sort of minty tang and most of all coffee Now Mr Flannel Shirt had taken the lead Roland followed him quickly down the storerooms center aisle and between pallets stacked high with canned goods Eddie limped gamely along after still hauling the shopkeeper Old Chip had lost a lot of blood from the wound on the side of his head and Eddie kept expecting him to pass out but Chip actually seemedwell chipper He was currently asking Eddie what had happened to Ruth Beemer and her sister If he meant the two women whod been in the store Eddie was pretty sure he did Eddie hoped that Chip wouldnt suddenly regain his memory There was another door at the back Mr Flannel Shirt opened it and started out Roland hauled him back by the shirt then went out himself low Eddie stood Chip beside Mr Flannel Shirt and himself just in front of them Behind them bullets smacked through the EMPLOYEES ONLY door creating startled white eyes of daylight Eddie Roland grunted To me Eddie limped out There was a loading dock here and beyond it about an acre of unlovely churnedup ground Trash barrels had been stacked haphazardly to the right of the dock and there were two Dumpsters to the left but it didnt look to Eddie Dean as if anyone had worried too much about putting litter in its place There were also several piles of beercans almost big enough to qualify as archaeological middensNothing like relaxing on the back porch after a hard day at the store Eddie thought Roland was pointing his gun at another oilpump this one rustier and older than the ones out front On it was a single word Diesel Roland said Does that mean fuel It does doesnt it Yeah Eddie said Chip does the diesel pump work Sure sure Chip said in a disinterested tone of voice Lotsa guys fill up back here I can run it mister said Flannel Shirt You better let me too  its tetchy Can you and your buddy cover me Yes Roland said Pour it in there And jerked a thumb at the storeroom Hey no Chip said startled How long did all these things take Eddie could not have said not for sure All he was aware of was a clarity he had known only once before while riddling Blaine the Mono It overwhelmed everything with its brilliance even the pain in his lower leg where the tibia might or might not have been chipped by a bullet He was aware of how funky it smelled back here  rotted meat and moldy produce the yeasty scent of a thousand departed brewskis the odors of dontcare laziness  and the divinely sweet firperfume of the woods just beyond the perimeter of this dirty little roadside store He could hear the drone of a plane in some distant quadrant of the sky He knew he loved Mr Flannel Shirt because Mr Flannel Shirt washere waswith them linked to Roland and Eddie by the strongest of bonds for these few minutes But time No he had no true sense of that But it couldnt have been much more than ninety seconds since Roland had begun their retreat or surely they would have been overwhelmed crashed truck or no crashed truck Roland pointed left then turned right himself He and Eddie stood back to back on the loading dock with about six feet between them guns raised to their cheeks like men about to commence a duel Mr Flannel Shirt hopped off the end of the dock spry as a cricket and seized the chrome crank on the side of the old diesel pump He began to spin it rapidly The numbers in their little windows spun backward but instead of returning to all zeros they froze at Mr Flannel Shirt tried the crank again When it refused to turn he shrugged and yanked the nozzle out of its rusty cradle John no Chip cried He was still standing in the doorway of his storeroom and holding up his hands one clean and the other bloody all the way up the forearm Get out of the way Chip or youre gonna   Two men dashed around Eddies side of the East Stoneham General Store Both were dressed in jeans and flannel shirts but unlike Chips shirt these looked brandnew with the creases still in the sleeves Purchased especially for the occasion Eddie had no doubt And one of the goons Eddie recognized quite well had last seen him in The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind Calvin Towers bookshop Eddie had also killed this fellow once before Ten years in the future if you could believe it In The Leaning Tower Balazars joint and with the same gun he now held in his hand A snatch of old Bob Dylan lyric occurred to him something about the price you had to pay to keep from going through everything twice Hey Big Nose Eddie cried as he seemed to each time he saw this particular piece of pond scum How you doing pal In truth George Biondi did not appear to be doing well at all Not even his mother would have considered him much more than presentable even on his best day that humungous beak and now his features were puffed and discolored by bruises that had only just begun to fade The worst of them was right between the eyes I did thatEddie thoughtIn the back of Towers bookstore It was true but it also seemed like something that had happened a thousand years ago Yousaid George Biondi He seemed too stunned to even raise his gunYou Here Me here Eddie agreed As for you you should have stayed in New York With that said he blew George Biondis face off His friends face too Flannel Shirt squeezed the pump handles pistol grip and dark diesel sprayed from the nozzle It doused Chip who cawed indignantly and then staggered out onto the loading dockStings he shoutedGorry dont that sting Quit it John John did not Another three men came dashing around Rolands side of the store took one look at the gunslingers calm and awful face tried to backtrack They were dead before they could do more than get the heels of their new country walking shoes planted Eddie thought of the halfdozen cars and the big Winnebago that had been parked across the street and had time to wonder just how many men Balazar had sent on this little expedition Certainly not just his own guys How had he paid for the imports He didnt have toEddie thoughtSomeone loaded him up with dough and told him to go buy the farm As many outoftown goons as he could get And somehow convinced him the guys they were going after deserved that kind of coverage From inside the store there came a dull percussive thud Soot blew out of the chimney and was lost against the darker oilier cloud rising from the crashed pulp truck Eddie thought somebody had tossed a grenade The door to the storeroom blew off its hinges walked halfway down the aisle surrounded by a cloud of smoke and fell flat Soon the fellow whod thrown the grenade would throw another and with the floor of the storeroom now covered in an inch of diesel fuel  Slow him down if you can Roland said Its not wet enough in there yet Slow down Andolini Eddie asked How do I do that With your everlastingmouth  Roland cried and Eddie saw a wonderful heartening thing Roland was grinning Almost laughing At the same time he looked at Flannel Shirt  John  and made a spinning gesture with his right handkeep pumping Jack Eddie shouted He had no idea where Andolini might be at this point and so simply yelled as loud as he could Having grown up ramming around Brooklyns less savory streets this was quite loud There was a pause The gunfire slowed then stopped Hey Jack Andolini called back He sounded surprised but in a goodhumored way Eddie doubted he was really surprised at all and he had no doubt whatsoever that what Jack wanted was payback Hed been hurt in the storage area behind Towers bookshop but that wasnt the worst of it Hed also been humiliated Hey Slick Are you the guy who was gonna send my brains to Hoboken then stuck a gun under my chin Man I got a mark there Eddie could see him making this rueful little speech all the time gesturing with his hands moving his remaining men into position How many was that Eight Maybe ten Theyd already taken out a bunch God knew And where would the remainder be A couple on the left of the store A couple more on the right The rest with Monsieur Grenades R Us And when Jack was ready those guys would charge Right into the new shallow lake of diesel fuel Or so Eddie hoped Ive got the same gun with me today he called to Jack This time Ill jam it up your ass howd that be Jack laughed It was an easy relaxed sound An act but a good one Inside Jack would be redlining heartrate up over onethirty bloodpressure up over oneseventy This was it not just payback for some little punk daring to blindside him but the biggest job of his stinking badguy career the Super Bowl Balazar gave the orders undoubtedly but Jack Andolini was the one on the spot the field marshal and this time the job wasnt just beating up a dicedopey bartender who wouldnt pay the vig on what he owed or convincing some Yid jewelrystore owner on Lenox Avenue that he needed protection this was an actual war Jack was smart  at least compared to most of the streethoods Eddie had met while doped up and running with his brother Henry  but Jack was also stupid in some fundamental way that had nothing to do with IQ scores The punk who was currently taunting him had already beaten him once and quite handily but Jack Andolini had contrived to forget that Diesel sloshed quietly over the loading dock and rippled along the old warped boards of the mercantiles storeroom John aka Sai Yankee Flannel Shirt gave Roland a questioning look Roland responded by first shaking his head and then twirling his right hand again more Wheres the bookstore guy Slick Andolinis voice just as pleasant as before but closer now Hed crossed the road then Eddie put him just outside the store Too bad diesel fuel wasnt more explosive Wheres Tower Give him to us and well leave you and the other guy alone until next time SureEddie thought and remembered something Susannah sometimes said in her best growling Detta Walker voice to indicate utter disbeliefAlso I wont come in yo mouth or get any in yo hair This ambush had been set up especially for visiting gunslingers Eddie was almost sure of it The bad boys might or might not know where Tower was he trusted what came out of Jack Andolinis mouth not at all but someone had known to exactly which where and when the Unfound Door was going to deliver Eddie and Roland and had passed that knowledge on to BalazarYou want the boy who embarrassed yourboy Mr Balazar The kid who peeled Jack Andolini and George Biondi off Tower before Tower had time to give in and give you what you wanted Fine Heres where hes going to show up Him and one other And by the way heres enough dough to buy an army of mercenaries in tutone shoes Might not be enough the kids hard and his buddys worse but you might get lucky Even if you dont even if the one named Roland gets away and leaves a bunch of dead guys behindwell getting the kids a start And there are always more gunnies arent there Sure The worlds full of them The worlds And what about Jake and Callahan Had there been a reception party waiting for them too and had it been twentytwo years up the line from this when The little poem on the fence surrounding the vacant lot suggested that if theyd followed his wife it had been  SUSANNAHMIO DIVIDED GIRL OF MINE the poem had said PARKED HER RIG IN THE DIXIE PIG IN THE YEAR OF  And if therehad been a reception party waiting could they possibly still be alive Eddie clung to one idea if any member of the katet died  Susannah Jake Callahan even Oy  he and Roland would know If he was kidding himself about that succumbing to some romantic fallacy so be it Three Roland caught the eye of the man in the flannel shirt and drew the side of his hand across his throat John nodded and let go of the oilpumps squeezehandle at once Chip the store owner was now standing beside the loading dock and where his face wasnt lathered with blood he was looking decidedly gray Roland thought he would pass out soon No loss there Jack the gunslinger shouted Jack Andolini His pronunciation of the Italian name was a pretty thing to listen to both precise and rippling You Slicks big brother Andolini asked He sounded amused And he sounded closer Roland put him in front of the store perhaps on the very spot where he and Eddie had come through He wouldnt wait long to make his next move this was the countryside but there were still people about The rising black plume of smoke from the overturned woodwaggon would already have been noticed Soon they would hear sirens I suppose youd call me his foreman Roland said He pointed at the gun in Eddies hand then pointed into the storeroom then pointed at himselfWait for my signal Eddie nodded Why dont you send him outmi amigo This doesnt have to be your concern Ill take him and let you go Slicks the one I want to talk to Getting the answers I need from him will be a pleasure You could never take us Roland said pleasantly Youve forgotten the face of your father Youre a bag of shit with legs Your own kadaddy is a man named Balazar and you lick his dirty ass The others know and they laugh at you Look at Jack they say all that asslicking only makes him uglier  There was a brief pause Then You got a mean mouth on you mister Andolinis voice was level but all the bogus good humor had gone out of it All the laughter But you know what they say about sticks and stones In the distance at last a siren rose Roland nodded first to John who was watching him alertly and then at EddieSoon that nod said Balazar will be building his towers of cards long after youre nothing but bones in an unmarked grave Jack Some dreams are destiny but not yours Yours are only dreams Shut up Hear the sirens Your times almost u   VaiJack Andolini shouted VaiGet em I want that old fuckers head do you hear me I want his head  A round black object arced lazily through the hole where the EMPLOYEES ONLY door had been Another grenado Roland had been expecting it He fired once from the hip and the grenado exploded in midair turning the flimsy wall between the storeroom and the lunchroom into a storm of destructive splintery blowback There were screams of surprise and agony Now EddieRoland shouted and began to fire into the diesel Eddie joined in At first Roland didnt think anything was going to happen but then a sluggish ripple of blue flame appeared in the center aisle and went snaking toward where the rear wall had been Not enough Gods how he wished it had been the kind they called gasoline Roland tipped out the cylinder of his gun dropped the spent casings around his boots and reloaded On your right mister John said almost conversationally and Roland dropped flat One bullet passed through the place where hed been The second flipped at the ends of his long hair Hed only had time to reload three of his revolvers six chambers but that was one more bullet than he needed The two harriers flew backward with identical holes in the center of their brows just below the hairline Another hoodlum dashed around the corner of the store on Eddies side and saw Eddie waiting for him with a grin on his bloody face The fellow dropped his gun immediately and began to raise his hands Eddie put a bullet through his chest before they got as high as his shouldersHes learning Roland thoughtGods help him but he is That fires a little slow for my taste boys said John and leaped up onto the loading dock The store was barely visible through the rolling smoke of the deflected grenado but bullets came flying through it John seemed not to notice them and Roland thanked ka for putting such a good man in their path Such a hard man John took a square silver object from his pants pocket flipped up the lid and produced a good flame with the flick of his thumb on a small wheel He tossed the little flaming tinderbox underhand into the storeroom Flames burst up all around it with awhoomp sound Whats the matter with youAndolini screamedGet them Come and do it yourself Roland called At the same time he pulled on Johns pants leg John jumped off the loading dock backward and stumbled Roland caught him Chip the storekeeper chose this moment to faint pitching forward to the trashlittered earth with a groan so soft it was almost a sigh Yeah come on Eddie goaded Come onSlick whatsamattaSlick dont send a boy to do a mans work you ever hear that one How many guys did you have over there two dozen And were still standing So come on Come on and do it yourself Or do you want to lick Enrico Balazars ass for the rest of your life More bullets came through the smoke and flame but the harriers in the store showed no interest in trying to charge through the growing fire No more came around the sides of the store either Roland pointed at Eddies lower right leg where the hole was Eddie gave him a thumbsup but the leg of his jeans now seemed too full below the knee  swollen  and when he moved his shorboot squelched The pain had settled to a steady hard ache that seemed to cycle with the beat of his heart Yet he was coming to believe it might have missed the boneMaybe he admitted to himselfbecause I want to believe it The first siren had been joined by two or three others and they were closing in GoJack screamed He now sounded on the verge of hystericsGo you chickenshit motherfuckers go get them Roland thought that the remaining badmen might have attacked a couple of minutes ago  maybe even thirty seconds ago  if Andolini had led their charge personally But now the frontalassault option had been closed off and Andolini must surely know that if he led men around either side of the store Roland and Eddie would pick them off like clay birds in a FairDay shooting contest The only workable strategies left to him were siege or a long flanking movement through the woods and Jack Andolini had no time for either Standing their ground back here however would present its own problems Dealing with the local constabulary for instance or the fire brigade if that showed up first Roland pulled John to him so he could speak quietly We need to get out of here right now Can you help us Oh ayuh I think so The wind shifted A draft blew through the mercantiles broken front windows through the place where the back wall had been and out the back door The diesel smoke was black and oily John coughed and waved it away Follow me Lets step lively John hurried across the ugly acre of waste ground behind the store stepping over a broken crate and weaving his way between a rusty incinerator and a pile of even rustier machine parts There was a name on the biggest of these that Roland had seen before in his wanderings JOHN DEERE Roland and Eddie walked backward protecting Johns back taking little glances over their own shoulders to keep from tripping Roland hadnt entirely given up hope that Andolini would make a final charge and he could kill him as he had done once before On the beach of the Western Sea that had been and here he was again not only back but ten yearsyounger While IRoland thoughtfeel at least a thousand years older Yet that was not really true Yes he was now suffering  finally  the ills an old man could reasonably expect But he had a katet to protect again and not just any katet but one ofgunslingers and they had refreshed his life in a way he never would have expected It all meant something to him again not just the Dark Tower butall of it So he wanted Andolini to come And if he killed Andolini in this world he had an idea Andolini would stay dead Because this world wasdifferent It had a resonance all the others even his own lacked He felt it in every bone and every nerve Roland looked up and saw exactly what he expected clouds in a line At the rear of the barren acre a path slipped into the woods its head marked by a pair of goodsized granite rocks And here the gunslinger saw herringbone patterns of shadows overlapping but all pointing the same way You had to look to see it but once seen it was unmistakable As in the version of New York where they had found the empty bag in the vacant lot and Susannah had seen the vagrant dead this was the true world the one where time always ran in a single direction They might be able to hop into the future if they could find a door as he was sure Jake and Callahan had done for Roland also remembered the poem on the fence and now understood at least part of it but they could never return to the past This was the true world the one where no roll of the dice could ever be taken back the one closest to the Dark Tower And they were still on the Path of the Beam John led them onto the way into the woods and quickly down it away from the rising pillars of thick dark smoke and the approaching whine of the sirens Four They hadnt gone even a quarter of a mile before Eddie began seeing blue glints through the trees The path was slippery with pine needles and when they came to the final slope  the one leading down to a long and narrow lake of surpassing loveliness  Eddie saw that someone had built a birch railing Beyond it was a stub of dock jutting out into the water Tied to the dock was a motorboat Thats mine John said I come over for mgroceries and a bite of lunch Didnt expect no excitement Well you got it Eddie said Ayuh thats a true thing Mind this last bit if you dont want to go on your keister John went nimbly down the final slope holding the rail for balance and sliding rather than walking On his feet was a pair of old scuffed workboots that would have looked perfectly at home in MidWorld Eddie thought He went next himself favoring his bad leg Roland brought up the rear From behind them came a sudden explosion as sharp and limber as that first highpowered rifleshot but far louder Thatd be Chips propane John said Cry pardon Roland asked Gas Eddie said quietly He means gas Ayuh stovegas John agreed He stepped into his boat grabbed the Evinrudes startercord gave it a yank The engine a sturdy little twentyhorse sewing machine of a thing started on the first pull Get in here boys and lets us vacate t area he grunted Eddie got in Roland paused for a moment to tap his throat three times Eddie had seen him perform this ritual before when about to cross open water and reminded himself to ask about it He never got the chance before the question occurred to him again death had slipped between them Five The skiff moved as quietly and as gracefully over the water as any motorpowered thing can skating on its own reflection beneath a sky of summers most pellucid blue Behind them the plume of dark smoke sullied that blue rising higher and higher spreading as it went Dozens of folk most of them in shorts or bathing costumes stood upon the banks of this little lake turned in the smokes direction hands raised to shade against the sun Few if any marked the steady and completely unshowy passage of the motorboat This is Keywadin Pond just in case you were wonderin John said He pointed ahead of them where another gray tongue of dock stuck out Beside this one was a neat little boathouse white with green trim its overhead door open As they neared it Roland and Eddie could see both a canoe and a kayak bobbing inside at tether Boathouse is mine the man in the flannel shirt added Theboat inboathouse came out in a way impossible to reproduce with mere letters  bwutwould probably come closest  but which both men recognized It was the way the word was spoken in the Calla Looks wellkept Eddie said Mostly to be sayingsomething Oh ayuh John said I do caretakin campcheckin some rough carpenterin Wouldnt look good fbusiness if I had a fallindown boathouse would it Eddie smiled Suppose not My place is about half a mile back from the water Names John Cullum He held out his right hand to Roland continuing to steer a straight course away from the rising pillar of smoke and toward the boathouse with the other Roland took the hand which was pleasantly rough Im Roland Deschain of Gilead Long days and pleasant nights John Eddie put out his own hand in turn Eddie Dean from Brooklyn Nice to meet you John shook with him easily enough but his eyes studied Eddie closely When their hands parted he said Young fella did somethin just happen It did didnt it I dont know Eddie said Not with complete honesty You aint been to Brooklyn for a long time son have you Aint been to Morehouse or tono house Eddie Dean said and then quickly before he could lose it Mias locked Susannah away Locked her away in the year of  Suze can get to the Dogan but going theres no good Mias locked off the controls Theres nothing Suze can do Shes kidnapped Sheshe He stopped For a moment everything had been soclear like a dream upon the instant of waking Then as so often happens with dreams it faded He didnt even know if it had been a real message from Susannah or pure imagination Young fella did somethin just happen So Cullum had felt it too Not imagination then Some form of the touch seemed more likely John waited and when there was no more from Eddie turned to Roland Does your pal come over funny that way often Not often no SaiMisterI mean Mister Cullum I thank you for helping us when we needed help I thank ya bigbig It would be monstrous impudent of us to ask for more but   But youre gonna Ayuh figgered John made a minute course correction toward the little boathouse with its square open mouth Roland estimated theyd be there in five minutes That was fine by him He had no objection to riding in this tight little motorpowered boat even though it rode rather low in the water with the weight of three grown men inside but Keywadin Pond was far too exposed for his taste If Jack Andolini or his successor should Jack be replaced asked enough of those shoregawkers he would eventually find a few who remembered the little skiff with the three men in it And the boathouse with the neat green trimJohn Cullums bwuthuss may it do ya fine these witnesses would say Best they should be farther along the Beam before that happened with John Cullum packed off to somewhere safe Roland judged safe in this case to be perhaps three looks to the horizonline or about a hundred wheels He had no doubt that Cullum a total stranger had saved their lives by stepping in decisively at the right moment The last thing he wanted was for the man to lose his own as a result Well Ill do what I can for ya already made up mmind to that but I got to ask you somethin now while I got the chance Eddie and Roland exchanged a brief look Roland said Well answer if we can Which is to say John of East Stoneham if we judge that the answer wont cause you harm John nodded He seemed to gather himself I know youre not ghosts because we all saw you back at the store and I just now touched you to shake hands I can see the shadders you cast He pointed at where they lay across the side of the boat Real as real So my question is this are you walkins Walkins Eddie said He looked at Roland but Rolands face was completely blank Eddie looked back at John Cullum sitting in the stern of the boat and steering them toward the boathouse Im sorry but I dont Been a lot of em around here last few years John said Waterford Stoneham East Stoneham Lovell Swedeneven over in Bridgton and Denmark This last township name came outDenmaaaaak He saw they were still puzzled Walkinsre people who justappear  he said Sometimes theyre dressed in oldfashioned clothes as if they came fromagoI guess youd say One was nekkid as a jaybird walkin right up the middle of Route  Junior Angstrom seen im Last November this was Sometimes they talk other languages One came to Don Russerts house over in Waterford Sat right there in the kitchen Donnies a retired history professor from Vanderbilt College and he taped the fella Fella jabbered quite awhile then went into the laundry room Donnie figured he musta taken it for the bathroom and went after him to turn him around but the fella was already gone No door for him to go out of but gone he was Donnie played that tape of his for just about everyone in the Vandy Languages Department Depaaaaatment and wasnt none of em recognized it One said it must be a completely madeup language like Esperanto Do you sabby Esperanto boys Roland shook his head Eddie said cautiously Ive heard of it but I dont really know what it i   And sometimes John said his voice lowering as they glided into the shadows of the boathouse sometimes theyre hurt Or disfigured Roont Roland started so suddenly and so hard that the boat rocked For a moment they were actually in danger of being tipped out What What do you say Speak again John for I would hear it very well John apparently thought it was purely an issue of verbal comprehension because this time he was at pains to pronounce the word more carefully RuinedLike folks whod been in a nuclear war or a fallout zone or something Slow mutants Roland said I think he might be talking about slow muties Here in this town Eddie nodded thinking about the Grays and Pubes in Lud Also thinking about a misshapen beehive and the monstrous insects which had been crawling over it John killed the little Evinrude engine but for a moment the three of them sat where they were listening to water slap hollowly against the aluminum sides of the boat Slow mutants the old fellow said almost seeming to taste the words Ayuh I guess thatd be as good a name for em as any But they aint the only ones Theres been animals too and kinds of birds no ones ever seen in these parts But mostly its the walkins thatve got people worried and talkin amongst themselves Donnie Russert called someone he knew at Duke University and that fella called someone in their Department of Psychic Studies  amazin theyve got such a thing as that in a real college but it appears they do  and the Psychic Studies woman said thats what such folks are called walkins And then when they disappear again  which they always do except for one fella over in East Conway Village who died  theyre called walkoutsThe lady said that some scientists who study such things  I guess you could call em scientists although I know a lot of folks might argue  blieve that walkins are aliens from other planets that spaceships drop em off and then pick em up again but most of em think theyre timetravelers or from different Earths that lie in a line with ours How long has this been going on Eddie asked How long have the walkins been showing up Oh two or three years And its gettin worse ruthern better I seen a couple of such fellas myself and once a woman with a bald head who looked like she had this bleedin eye in the middle of her forread But they was all at a distance and you fellas are up close John leaned toward them over his bony knees his eyes as blue as Rolands own gleaming Water slapped hollowly at the boat Eddie felt a strong urge to take John Cullums hand again to see if something else would happen There was another Dylan song called Visions of Johanna What Eddie wanted was not a vision of Johanna but the name was at least close to that Ayuh John was saying you boys are right up close and personal Now Ill help you along your way if I can because I dont sense nothing the least bit bad about either of you although Im going to tell you flat out that I aintnever seen such shooting but I want to know are you walkins or not Once more Roland and Eddie exchanged looks and then Roland answered Yes he said I suppose we are Gorry John whispered In his awe not even his seamed face could keep him from looking like a child Walkins And where is it youre from can you tell me that He looked at Eddie laughed the way people do when they are admitting youve put a good one over on them and said NotBrooklyn  But Iam from Brooklyn Eddie said The only thing was it hadnt beenthis worlds Brooklyn and he knew that now In the world he came from a childrens book namedCharlie the ChooChoo had been written by a woman named Beryl Evans in this one it had been written by someone named Claudia y Inez Bachman Beryl Evans sounded real and Claudia y Inez Bachman sounded phony as a threedollar bill yet Eddie was coming more and more to believe that Bachman was the true handle And why Because it came as part of this world Iam from Brooklyn though Just not thewellthe same one John Cullum was still looking at them with that wideeyed childs expression of wonder What about those other fellas The ones who were waiting for you Are they No Roland said Not they No more time for this John  not now He got cautiously to his feet grabbed an overhead beam and stepped out of the boat with a little wince of pain John followed and Eddie came last The two other men had to help him The steady throb in his right calf had receded a little bit but the leg was stiff and numb hard to control Lets go to your place Roland said Theres a man we need to find With the blessing you may be able to help us do that He may be able to help us in more ways than thatEddie thought and followed them back into the sunlight gimping along on his bad leg with his teeth gritted At that moment Eddie thought he would have slain a saint in exchange for a dozen aspirin tablets STAVE Commalaloafleaven They go to hell or up to heaven When the guns are shot and the fires hot You got to poke em in the oven RESPONSE Commalacomeseven Salt and yow for leaven Heat em up and knock em down And poke em in the oven One In the winter of   when Eddies heroin use was quietly sneaking across the border from the Land of Recreational Drugs and into the Kingdom of Really Bad Habits Henry Dean met a girl and fell briefly in love Eddie thought Sylvia Goldover was a SkankEl Supremo smelly armpits and dragon breath wafting out from between a pair of Mick Jagger lips but kept his mouth shut becauseHenry thought she was beautiful and Eddie didnt want to hurt Henrys feelings That winter the young lovers spent a lot of time either walking on the windswept beach at Coney Island or going to the movies in Times Square where they would sit in the back row and wank each other off once the popcorn and the extralarge box of Goobers were gone Eddie was philosophic about the new person in Henrys life if Henry could work his way past that awful breath and actually tangle tongues with Sylvia Goldover more power to him Eddie himself spent a lot of those mostly gray three months alone and stoned in the Dean family apartment He didnt mind liked it in fact If Henry had been there he would have insisted on TV and would have ragged Eddie constantly about his storytapes Oh boy Eddies gonna wissen to his wittle stowy about theelves and theogs and the cute wittlemidgets  Always calling the orcs the ogs and always calling the Ents the scawwy walkingtwees  Henry thought madeup shit was queer Eddie had sometimes tried to tell him there was nothing more madeup than the crud they showed on afternoon TV but Henry wasnt having any of that Henry could tell you all about the evil twins onGeneral Hospital and the equally evil stepmother onThe Guiding Light In many ways Henry Deans great love affair  which ended when Sylvia Goldover stole ninety bucks out of his wallet left a note sayingIm sorry Henry in its place and took off for points unknown with herold boyfriend  was a relief to Eddie Hed sit on the sofa in the living room put on the tapes of John Gielgud reading TolkiensRings trilogy skinpop along the inside of his right arm and nod off to the Forests of Mirkwood or the Mines of Moria along with Frodo and Sam Hed loved the hobbits thought he could have cheerfully spent the rest of his life in Hobbiton where the worst drug going was tobacco and big brothers did not spend entire days ragging on little brothers and John Cullums little cottage in the woods returned him to those days and that darktoned story with surprising force Because the cottage had a hobbithole feel about it The furniture in the living room was small but perfect a sofa and two overstuffed chairs with those white doilies on the arms and where the back of your head would rest The goldframed blackandwhite photograph on one wall had to be Cullums folks and the one opposite it had to be his grandparents There was a framed Certificate of Thanks from the East Stoneham Volunteer Fire Department There was a parakeet in a cage twittering amiably and a cat on the hearth She raised her head when they came in gazed greenly at the strangers for a moment then appeared to go back to sleep There was a standing ashtray beside what had to be Cullums easy chair and in it were two pipes one a corncob and the other a briar There was an oldfashioned Emerson recordplayerradio the radio of the type featuring a multiband dial and a large knurled tuning knob but no television The room smelled pleasantly of tobacco and potpourri As fabulously neat as it was a single glance was enough to tell you that the man who lived here wasnt married John Cullums parlor was a modest ode to the joys of bachelorhood Hows your leg John asked  Pears to have stopped bleeding at least but you got a pretty good hitch in your gitalong Eddie laughed It hurts like a son of a bitch but I can walk on it so I guess that makes me lucky Bathrooms in there if you want to wash up Cullum said and pointed Think I better Eddie said The washingup was painful but also a relief The wound in his leg was deep but seemed to have totally missed the bone The one in his arm was even less of a problem the bullet had gone right through praise God and there was hydrogen peroxide in Cullums medicine cabinet Eddie poured it into the hole teeth bared at the pain and then went ahead and used the stuff on both his leg and the laceration in his scalp before he could lose his courage He tried to remember if Frodo and Sam had had to face anything even close to the horrors of hydrogen peroxide and couldnt come up with anything Well of course theyd had elves to heal them hadnt they I got somethin might help out Cullum said when Eddie reappeared The old guy disappeared into the next room and returned with a brown prescription bottle There were three pills inside it He tipped them into Eddies palm and said This is from when I fell down on the ice last winter and busted my goddam collarbone Percodan its called I dunno if theres any good left in em or not but   Eddie brightened Percodan huh he asked and tossed the pills into his mouth before John Cullum could answer Dont you want some water with those son Nope Eddie said chewing enthusiastically Neats a treat A glass case full of baseballs stood on a table beside the fireplace and Eddie wandered over to look at it Oh my God he said youve got a signed Mel Parnell ball And a Lefty Grove Holy shit Those aint nothing Cullum said picking up the briar pipe Look up on t top shelf He took a sack of Prince Albert tobacco from the drawer of an endtable and began to fill his pipe As he did so he caught Roland watching him Do ya smoke Roland nodded From his shirt pocket he took a single bit of leaf Praps I might roll one Oh I can do ya better than that Cullum said and left the room again The room beyond was a study not much bigger than a closet Although the Dickens desk in it was small Cullum had to sidle his way around it Holy shit Eddie said seeing the baseball Cullum must have meant Autographed by the Babe Ayuh Cullum said Not when he was a Yankee either I got no use for baseballs autographed by Yankees That us signed when Ruth was still wearing a Red Sox He broke off Here they are knew I had em Might be stale but its a lot staler where theres none my mother used to say Here you go mister My nephew left em He aint hardly old enough to smoke anyway Cullum handed the gunslinger a package of cigarettes threequarters full Roland turned them thoughtfully over in his hand then pointed to the brand name I see a picture of a dromedary but that isnt what this says is it Cullum smiled at Roland with a kind of cautious wonder No he said That wordsCamel It means about the same Ah Roland said and tried to look as if he understood He took one of the cigarettes out studied the filter then put the tobacco end in his mouth No turn it around Cullum said Say true Ayuh Jesus Roland Hes got a Bobby Doerrtwo Ted Williams ballsa Johnny Peskya Frank Malzone Those names dont mean anything to you do they John Cullum asked Roland No Roland said My friendthank you He took a light from the match sai Cullum offered My friend hasnt been on this side very much for quite awhile I think he misses it Gorry Cullum said Walkins Walkins inmy house I cant hardly believe it Wheres Dewey Evans Eddie asked You dont have a Dewey Evans ball Pardon Cullum asked It came outpaaaaaadon Maybe they dont call him that yet Eddie said almost to himself Dwight Evans Right fielder Oh Cullum nodded Well I only have the best in that cabinet dont you know Dewey fills the bill believe me Eddie said Maybe hes not worthy of being in the John Cullum Hall of Fame yet but wait a few years Wait until  And by the way John as a fan of the game I want to say two words to you okay Sure Cullum said It came out exactly as the word was said in the Calla SHO ah Roland meanwhile had taken a drag from his smoke He blew it out and looked at the cigarette frowning The words areRoger Clemens  Eddie said Remember that name Clemens John Cullum said but dubiously Faintly from the far side of Keywadin Pond came the sound of more sirens Roger Clemens ayuh Ill remember Who is he Youre gonna want him in here leave it at that Eddie said tapping the case Maybe on the same shelf with the Babe Cullums eyes gleamed Tell me somethin son Have the Red Sox won it all yet Have they   This isnt a smoke its nothing but murky air Roland said He gave Cullum a reproachful look that was so unRoland that it made Eddie grin No taste to speak of at all People here actuallysmoke these Cullum took the cigarette from Rolands fingers broke the filter off the end and gave it back to him Try it now he said and returned his attention to Eddie So I got you out of a jam on tother side of the water Seems like you owe me one Have they ever won the Series At least up to your time Eddies grin faded and he looked at the old man seriously Ill tell you if you really want me to John Butdo ya John considered puffing his pipe Then he said I spose not Knowind spoil it Tell you one thing Eddie said cheerfully The pills John had given him were kicking in and hefelt cheerful A little bit anyway You dont want to die before  That ones gonna be a corker Ayuh Say absolutely true Then Eddie turned to the gunslinger What are we going to do about our gunna Roland Roland hadnt even thought about it until this moment All their few worldly possessions from Eddies fine new whittling knife purchased in Tooks Store to Rolands ancient growbag given to him by his father far on the other side of times horizon had been left behind when they came through the door When they had beenblown through the door The gunslinger assumed their gunna had been left lying in the dirt in front of the East Stoneham store although he couldnt remember for sure hed been too fiercely focused on getting Eddie and himself to safety before the fellow with the longsighted rifle blew their heads off It hurt to think of all those companions of the long trek burned up in the fire that had undoubtedly claimed the store by now It hurt even worse to think of them in the hands of Jack Andolini Roland had a brief but vivid picture of his growbag hanging on Andolinis belt like a backypouch or an enemys scalp and winced Roland What about our   We have our guns and thats all the gunna we need Roland said more roughly than he had intended Jake has theChooChoo book and I can make another compass should we need one Otherwise   But   If youre talkin about your goods sonny I cn ask some questions about em when the time comes Cullum said But for the time being I think your friends right Eddieknew his friend was right His friend was almostalways right which was one of the few things Eddie still hated about him He wanted his gunna goddammit and not just for the one clean pair of jeans and the two clean shirts Nor for extra ammo or the whittling knife fine as it was There had been a lock of Susannahs hair in his leather swagbag and it had still carried a faint whiff of her smellThat was what he missed But done was done John he said what day is this The mans bristly gray eyebrows went up You serious And when Eddie nodded Ninth of July Year of our Lord nineteenseventyseven Eddie made a soundless whistling noise through his pursed lips Roland the last stub of the Dromedary cigarette smoldering between his fingers had gone to the window for a looksee Nothing behind the house but trees and a few seductive blue winks from what Cullum called the Keywadin But that pillar of black smoke still rose in the sky as if to remind him that any sense of peace he might feel in these surroundings was only an illusion They had to get out of here And no matter how terribly afraid he was for Susannah Dean now that they were here they had to find Calvin Tower and finish their business with him And theyd have to do it quickly Because  As if reading his mind and finishing his thought Eddie said Roland Its speeding up Time on this side is speeding up I know It means that whatever we do we have to get it right the first time because in this world you can never come back earlier There are no doovers Roland knew that too Two The man were looking for is from New York City Eddie told John Cullum Ayuh plenty of those around in the summertime His names Calvin Tower Hes with a friend of his named Aaron Deepneau Cullum opened the glass case with the baseballs inside took out one withCarl Yastrzemski written across the sweet spot in that weirdly perfect script of which only professional athletes seem capable in Eddies experience it was the spelling that gave most of them problems and began to toss it from hand to hand Folks from away really pile in once June comes  you know that dont ya I do Eddie said feeling hopeless already He thought it was possible old DoubleUgly had already gotten to Cal Tower Maybe the ambush at the store had been Jacks idea of dessert I guess you cant   If I cant I guess I better goddam retire Cullum said with some spirit and tossed the Yaz ball to Eddie who held it in his right hand and ran the tips of his lefthand fingers over the red stitches The feel of them raised a wholly unexpected lump in his throat If a baseball didnt tell you that you were home what did Only this world wasnt home anymore John was right he was a walkin What do you mean Roland asked Eddie tossed him the ball and Roland caught it without ever taking his eyes off John Cullum I dont bother with names but I know most everyone who comes into this town just the same he said Know em by sight Same with any other caretaker worth his salt I spose You want to know whos in your territory Roland nodded at this with perfect understanding Tell me what this guy looks like Eddie said He stands about fivenine and weighsoh Im gonna say twothirty Heavyset then Do ya Also most of his hairs gone on the sides of his forehead Eddie raised his hands to his own head and pushed his hair back exposing the temples one of them still oozing blood from his nearfatal passage through the Unfound Door He winced a little at the pain this provoked in his upper left arm but there the bleeding had already stopped Eddie was more worried about the round hed taken in the leg Right now Cullums Percodan was dealing with the pain but if the bullet was still in there  and Eddie thought it might be  it would eventually have to come out How old is he Cullum asked Eddie looked at Roland who only shook his head Had Roland ever actually seen Tower At this particular moment Eddie couldnt remember He thought not I think in his fifties Hes the book collector aint he Cullum asked then laughed at Eddies expression of surprise Told you I keep a weather eye out on the summah folk You never know when ones gonna turn out to be a deadbeat Maybe an outright thief Or eight or nine years ago we had this woman from New Jersey who turned out to be a firebug Cullum shook his head Looked like a smalltown librarian the sort of lady who wouldnt say boo to a goose and she was lightin up barns all over Stoneham Lovell and Waterford How do you know hes a book dealer Roland asked and tossed the ball back to Cullum who immediately tossed it to Eddie Didnt knowthat  he said Only that he collects em because he told Jane Sargus Janes got a little shop right where Dimity Road branches off from Route  Thats about a mile south of here Dimity Roads actually where that fella and his friend are stayin if were talking about the right ones I guess we are His friends name is Deepneau Eddie said and tossed the Yaz ball to Roland The gunslinger caught it tossed it to Cullum then went to the fireplace and dropped the last shred of his cigarette onto the little pile of logs stacked on the grate Dont bother with names like I told you but the friends skinny and looks about seventy Walks like his hips pain him some Wears steelrimmed glasses Thats the guy all right Eddie said Janey has a little place called Country Collectibles She gut some furniture in the barn dressers and armoires and such but what she specializes in is quilts glassware and old books Sign says so right out front So Cal Towerwhat Just went in and started browsing Eddie couldnt believe it and at the same time he could Tower had been balky about leaving New York even after Jack and George Biondi had threatened to burn his most valuable books right in front of his eyes And once he and Deepneau got here the fool had signed up for general delivery at the post office  or at least his friend Aaron had and as far as the bad guys were concerned one was as good as the other Callahan had left him a note telling him to stop advertising his presence in East StonehamHow stupid can you be had been the Peres final communication to sai Tower and the answer seemed to be more stupid than a bag of hammers Ayuh Cullum said Only he did a lot moren browse His eyes as blue as Rolands were twinkling Bought a couple of hundred dollars worth of readin material Paid with travelers checks Then he gut her to give him a list of other used bookstores in the area Theres quite a few if you add in Notions in Norway and that Your Trash My Treasure place over in Fryeburg Plus he got her to write down the names of some local folks who have book collections and sometimes sell out of their houses Jane was awful excited Talked about it all over town she did Eddie put a hand to his forehead and groaned That was the man hed met all right that was Calvin Tower to the life What had he been thinking That once he gut north of Boston he was safe Can you tell us how to find him Roland asked Oh I cn do bettern that I can take you right to where theyre stayin Roland had been tossing the ball from hand to hand Now he stopped and shook his head No Youll be going somewhere else Where Anyplace youll be safe Roland said Beyond that sai I dont want to know Neither of us do Well call me Sam I say goddam Dunnos I like that much Doesnt matter Time is short Roland considered then said Do you have a cartomobile Cullum looked momentarily puzzled then grinned Yep a cartomobile and a truckomobile both Im loaded The last word came outludded Then youll lead us to Towers Dimity Road place in one while Eddie Roland paused for a moment Eddie do you still remember how to drive Roland youre hurtin my feelings Roland never a very humorous fellow even at the best of times didnt smile He returned his attention to the dantete  little savior  ka had put in their way instead Once weve found Tower youll go your course John Thats any course that isnt ours Take a little vacation if it does ya Two days should be enough then you can return to your business Roland hoped their own business here in East Stoneham would be done by sundown but didnt want to hex them by saying so I dont think you understand that this is my busy season Cullum said He held out his hands and Roland tossed him the ball I got a boathouse to painta barn that needs shinglin   If you stay with us Roland said youll likely never shingle another barn Cullum looked at him with an eyebrow cocked clearly trying to gauge Rolands seriousness and not much liking what he saw While this was going on Eddie found himself returning to the question of whether or not Roland had ever actually seen Tower with his own eyes And now he realized that his first answer to that question had been wrong  Rolandhad seen Tower Sure he did It was Roland who pulled that bookcase full of Towers first editions into the Doorway Cave Roland was looking right at him What he saw was probably distorted but That train of thought drifted away and by the seemingly inevitable process of association Eddies mind returned to Towers precious books such rarities asThe Dogan by Benjamin Slightman Jr andSalems Lot by Stephen King Ill just get mkeys and were off Cullum said but before he could turn away Eddie said Wait Cullum looked at him quizzically Weve got a little more to talk about I think And he held up his hands for the baseball Eddie our time is short Roland said I know that Eddie saidProbably better than you since its my woman the clocks running out on If I could Id leave that asshole Tower to Jack and concentrate on getting back to Susannah But ka wont let me do that Your damned old ka We need   Shut up He had never said such a thing to Roland in his life but now the words came out on their own and he felt no urge to call them back In his mind Eddie heard a ghostly CallachantCommalacomecome the palavers not done Whats on your mind Cullum asked him A man named Stephen King Do you know that name And saw by Cullums eyes that he did Three Eddie Roland said He spoke in an oddly tentative way the younger man had never heard beforeHes as at sea as I am Not a comforting thought Andolini may still be looking for us More important he may be looking for Tower now that weve slipped through his fingersand as sai Cullum has made perfectly clear Tower has made himself easy to find Listen to me Eddie replied Im playing a hunch here but a hunch isnot all this is Weve met one man Ben Slightman who wrote a book in another worldTowers worldThis world And weve met another one Donald Callahan who was acharacter in a book from another world Againthis world Cullum had tossed him the ball and now Eddie flipped it underhand and hard to Roland The gunslinger caught it easily This might not seem like such a big deal to me except weve beenhaunted by books havent weThe Dogan The Wizard of Oz Charlie the ChooChoo Even Jakes Final Essay And nowSalems Lot I think that if this Stephen King is real   Oh hes real all right Cullum said He glanced out his window toward Keywadin Pond and the sound of the sirens on the other side At the pillar of smoke now diffusing the blue sky with its ugly smudge Then he held his hands up for the baseball Roland threw it in a soft arc whose apogee almost skimmed the ceiling And I read that book youre all het up about Got it up to the City at Bookland Thought it was a corker too A story about vampires Ayuh I heard him talkin about it on the radio Said he got the idea fromDracula  You heard the writer on the radio Eddie said He was having that throughthelookingglass downtherabbithole offonacomet feeling again and tried to ascribe it to the Percodan It wouldnt work All at once he felt strangely unreal to himself a shade you could almost see through as thin aswell as thin as a page in a book It was no help to realize that this world lying in the summer of  on times beam seemed real in a way all the other wheres and whens  including his own  did not And that feeling was totally subjective wasnt it When you came right down to it how did anyone know they werent a character in some writers story or a transient thought in some busriding schmoes head or a momentary mote in Gods eye Thinking about such stuff was crazy and enough such thinking coulddrive you crazy And yet Dadachum dadachee not to worry youve got the key Keys my specialtyEddie thought And thenKings a key isnt he Calla Callahan Crimson King Stephen King Is Stephen King the Crimson King of this world Roland had settled Eddie was sure it hadnt been easy for him but the difficult had ever been Rolands specialty If you have questions to ask have at it And made the twirling gesture with his right hand Roland I hardly know where to start The ideas Ive got are so bigsoI dont know so fundamentally fuckingscary  Best to keep it simple then Roland took the ball when Eddie tossed it to him but now looked more than a little impatient with the game of toss We reallydo have to move on How Eddie knew it He would have asked his questions while they were rolling if they all could have ridden in the same vehicle But they couldnt and Roland had never driven a motor vehicle which made it impossible for Eddie and Cullum to ride in the same one All right he said Who is he Lets start with that Who is Stephen King A writer Cullum said and gave Eddie a look that saidAre you a fool son He lives over in Bridgton with his family Nice enough fella from what Ive heard How far away is Bridgton Ohtwenty twentyfive miles How old is he Eddie was groping maddeningly aware that the right questions might be out there but he had no clear idea of what they were John Cullum squinted an eye and seemed to calculate Not that old I shd think If hes thirty he just got there This bookSalems Lotwas it a bestseller Dunno Cullum said Lots of people around here read it tell you that much Because its set in Maine And because of the ads they had on TV you know Also there was a movie made out of his first book but I never went to see it Looked too bloody What was it called Cullum thought then shook his head Cant quite remember Twas just one word and Im pretty sure it was a girls name but thats the best I can do Maybe itll come to me Hes not a walkin you dont think Cullum laughed Born and raised right here in the State of Maine Guess that makes him alive in Roland was looking at Eddie with increasing impatience and Eddie decided to give up This was worse than playing Twenty Questions But goddammit Pere Callahan wasreal and he was also in a book of fiction written by this man King and King lived in an area that was a magnet for what Cullum called walkins One of those walkins had sounded very much to Eddie like a servant of the Crimson King A woman with a bald head who seemed to have a bleeding eye in the center of her forehead John had said Time to drop this for now and get to Tower Irritating he might be but Calvin Tower owned a certain vacant lot where the most precious rose in the universe was growing wild Also he knew all sorts of stuff about rare books and the folks who had written them Very likely he knew more about the author ofSalems Lot than sai Cullum Time to let it go But  Okay he said tossing the ball back to the caretaker Lock that thing up and well head off to the Dimity Road if it does ya Just a couple more questions Cullum shrugged and put the Yaz ball back into the case Its your nickel I know Eddie saidand suddenly for the second time since hed come through the door Susannah seemed weirdly close He saw her sitting in a room filled with antiqueylooking science and surveillance equipment Jakes Dogan for sureonly as Susannah must have imagined it He saw her speaking into a mike and although he couldnt hear her he could see her swollen belly and her frightened face Nowvery pregnant wherever she was Pregnant and ready to pop He knew well enough what she was sayingCome Eddie save me Eddie save both of us do it before its too late Eddie Roland said Youve come over all gray Is it your leg Yeah Eddie said although right now his leg didnt hurt at all He thought again of whittling the key The dreadful responsibility of knowing it had to be just right And here he was again in much the same situation He had hold of something he knew he didbut what Yeah my leg He armed sweat from his forehead John about the name of the bookSalems Lot Thats actually Jerusalems Lot right Ayuh Its the name of the town in the book Ayuh Stephen Kings second book Ayuh His secondnovel  Eddie Roland said surely thats enough Eddie waved him aside then winced at the pain in his arm His attention was fixed on John Cullum Thereis no Jerusalems Lot right Cullum looked at Eddie as if he were crazy Course not he said Its a madeup story about madeup folks in a madeup town Its aboutvampires  YesEddie thoughtand if I told you I have reason to believe that vampires are realnot to mention invisible demons magic balls and witchesyoud be absolutely positive I was nuts wouldnt you Do you happen to know if Stephen King has been living in this Bridgton town his whole life No he hasnt He n his family moved down here two maybe three years ago I blieve they lived in Windham first when they got down from the northern part of the state Or maybe twas Raymond One of the towns on Big Sebago anyway Would it be fair to say that these walkins you mentioned have been turning up since the guy moved into the area Cullums bushy eyebrows went up then knitted together A loud and rhythmic hooting began to come to them from over the water a sound like a foghorn You know Cullum said you might have somethin there son It might only be coincidence but maybe not Eddie nodded He felt emotionally wrung out like a lawyer at the end of a long and difficult crossexamination Lets blow this popshop he said to Roland Might be a good idea Cullum said and tipped his head in the direction of the rhythmic foghorn blasts Thats Teddy Wilsons boat Hes the county constable Also a game warden This time he tossed Eddie a set of carkeys instead of a baseball Im givin you the automatic transmission he said Just in case youre a little rusty The trucks a stick shift You follow me and if you get in trouble honk the horn I will believe me Eddie said As they followed Cullum out Roland said Was it Susannah again Is that why you lost all the color out of your face Eddie nodded Well help her if we can Roland said but this may be our only way back to her Eddie knew that He also knew that by the time they got to her it might be too late STAVE Commalakakate Youre in the hands of fate No matter if youre real or not The hour groweth late RESPONSE Commalacomeeight The hour groweth late No matter what the shade ya cast Youre in the hands of fate One Pere Callahan had made a brief visit to the East Stoneham Post Office almost two weeks before the shootout at Chip McAvoys store and there the former Jerusalems Lot parish priest had written a hurried note Although addressed to both Aaron Deepneau and Calvin Tower the note inside the envelope had been aimed at the latter and its tone had not been particularly friendly Tower  Im a friend of the guy who helped you with Andolini Wherever you are you need to move right away Find a barn unused camp even an abandoned shed if it comes down to that You probably wont be comfortable but remember that the alternative is being dead I mean every word I say Leave some lights on where you are staying now and leave your car in the garage or driveway Hide a note with directions to your new location under the driversside floormat or under the backporch step Well be in touch Remember that we are the only ones who can relieve you of the burden you carry But if we are to help you you must help us Callahan of the Eld And make this trip to the post office your LAST How stupid can you be Callahan had risked his life to leave that note and Eddie under the spell of Black Thirteen had nearly lost his And the net result of those risks and close calls Why Calvin Tower had gone jaunting merrily around the western Maine countryside looking for buys on rare and outofprint books Following John Cullum up Route  with Roland sitting silently beside him then turning to follow Cullum onto the Dimity Road Eddie felt his temper edging up into the red zone Gonna have to put my hands in my pockets and bite my tonguehe thought but in this case he wasnt sure even those old reliables would work Two About two miles from Route  Cullums Ford F made a right off Dimity Road The turn was marked by two signs on a rusty pole The top one said ROCKET RD Below it was another rustier still which promised LAKESIDE CABINS BY THE WK MO OR SEAS Rocket Road was little more than a trail winding through the trees and Eddie hung well behind Cullum to avoid the roostertail of dust their new friends old truck was kicking up The cartomobile was another Ford some anonymous twodoor model Eddie couldnt have named without looking at the chrome on the back or in the owners manual But it felt most religiously fine to be driving again with not a single horse between his legs but several hundred of them ready to run at the slightest motion of his right foot It was also good to hear the sound of the sirens fading farther and farther behind The shadows of overhanging trees swallowed them The smell of fir and pinesap was simultaneously sweet and sharp Pretty country the gunslinger said A man could take his long ease here It was his only comment Cullums truck began to pass numbered driveways Below each number was a small legend reading JAFFORDS RENTALS Eddie thought of pointing out to Roland that theyd known a Jaffords in the Calla known him very well and then didnt It would have been belaboring the obvious They passed   and  Cullum paused briefly to consider at  then stuck his arm out the cabs window and motioned them on again Eddie had been ready to move on even before the gesture knowing perfectly well that Cabin  wasnt the one they wanted Cullum turned in at the next drive Eddie followed the tires of the sedan now whispering on a thick bed of fallen pine needles Winks of blue once more began to appear between the trees but when they finally reached Cabin  and a view of the water Eddie saw that this unlike Keywadin was a true pond Probably not much wider than a football field The cabin itself looked like a tworoom job There was a screenedin porch facing the water with a couple of tatty but comfortablelooking rockers on it A tin stovestack poked up from the roof There was no garage and no car parked in front of the cabin although Eddie thought he could see where one had been With the cover of duff it was hard to tell for sure Cullum killed the trucks engine Eddie did likewise Now there was only the lap of water against the rocks the sigh of a breeze through the pines and the mild sound of birdsong When Eddie looked to the right he saw that the gunslinger was sitting with his talented longfingered hands folded peaceably in his lap How does it feel to you Eddie asked Quiet The word was spoken CallafashionCahhit Anyone here I think so yes Danger Yar Beside me Eddie looked at him frowning You Eddie You want to kill him dont you After a moment Eddie admitted it was so This uncovered part of his nature as simple as it was savage sometimes made him uneasy but he could not deny it was there And who after all had brought it out and honed it to a keen edge Roland nodded There came into my life after years during which I wandered in the desert as solitary as any anchorite a whining and selfinvolved young man whose only ambition was to continue taking a drug which did little but make him sniffle and feel sleepy This was a posturing selfish loudmouthed loutkin with little to recommend him   But goodlooking Eddie said Dont forget that The cat was a true sex mochine Roland looked at him unsmiling If I could manage not to kill you then Eddie of New York you can manage not to kill Calvin Tower now And with that Roland opened the door on his side and got out Well saysyou  Eddie told the interior of Cullums car and then got out himself Three Cullum was still behind the wheel of his truck when first Roland and then Eddie joined him Place feels empty to me he said but I see a light on in the kitchen Uhhuh Eddie said John Ive got   Dont tell me you got another question Only person I know whos got more of em is my grandnephew Aidan He just went three Go on ask Could you pinpoint the center of the walkin activity in this area over the last few years Eddie had no idea why he was asking this question but it suddenly seemed vitally important to him Cullum considered then said Turtleback Lane over in Lovell You sound pretty sure of that Ayuh Do you remember me mentionin my friend Donnie Russert the history prof from Vandy Eddie nodded Well after he met one of these fellas in person he got interested in the phenomenon Wrote several articles about it although he said no reputable magazined publish em no matter how well documented his facts were He said that writin about the walkins in western Maine taught him something hed never expected to learn in his old age that some things people just wont believe not even when you can prove em He used to quote a line from some Greek poet The column of truth has a hole in it Anyway he had a map of the seventown area mounted on one wall of his study Stoneham East Stoneham Waterford Lovell Sweden Fryeburg and East Fryeburg With pins stuck in it for each walkin reported do ya see See very well say thank ya Eddie said And Id have to sayyeah Turtleback Lanes the heart of it Why there were six or eight pins right there and the whole damn rud cant be moren two miles long its just a loop that runs off Route  along the shore of Kezar Lake and then back to  again Roland was looking at the house Now he turned to the left stopped and laid his left hand on the sandalwood butt of his gun John he said were wellmet but its time for you to roll out of here Ayuh You sure Roland nodded The men who came here are fools It still has the smell of fools which is partly how I know that they havent moved on Youre not one of that kind John Cullum smiled faintly Shd hope not he said but I gut tthankya for the compliment Then he paused and scratched his gray head If tis a compliment Dont get back to the main road and start thinking I didnt mean what I said Or worse that we werent here at all that you dreamed the whole thing Dont go back to your house not even to pack an extra shirt Its no longer safe Go somewhere else At least three looks to the horizon Cullum closed one eye and appeared to calculate In the fifties I spent ten miserable years as a guard at the Maine State Prison he said but I met a hell of a nice man there named   Roland shook his head and then put the two remaining fingers of his right hand to his lips Cullum nodded Well I fgit what his name is but he lives over in Vermont and Im sure Ill remember it  maybe where he lives too  by the time I get acrost the New Hampshire state line Something about this speech struck Eddie as a little false but he couldnt put his finger on just why and he decided in the end that he was just being paranoid John Cullum was a straight arrowwasnt he May you do well he said and gripped the old mans hand Long days and pleasant nights Same to you boys Cullum said and then shook with Roland He held the gunslingers threefingered right hand a moment longer Was it God saved my life back there do ya think When the bullets first started flyin Yar the gunslinger said If you like And may he go with you now As for that old Ford of mine   Either right here or somewhere nearby Eddie said Youll find it or someone else will Dont worry Cullum grinned Thats pretty much what I was gonna tell you Vaya con Dios Eddie said Cullum grinned Goes back double son You want to watch out for those walkins He paused Some of em arent very nice From all reports Cullum put his truck in gear and drove away Roland watched him go and said Dantete Eddie nodded Dantete Little savior It was as good a way to describe John Cullum  now as gone from their lives as the old people of River Crossing  as any other And hewas gone wasnt he Although thered been something about the way hed talked of his friend in Vermont Paranoia Simple paranoia Eddie put it out of his mind Four Since there was no car present and hence no driversside floormat beneath which to look Eddie intended to explore under the porch step But before he could take more than a single stride in that direction Roland gripped his shoulder in one hand and pointed with the other What Eddie saw was a brushy slope going down to the water and the roof of what was probably another boathouse its green shingles covered with a layer of dry needles Someone there Roland said his lips barely moving Probably the lesser of the two fools and watching us Raise your hands Roland do you think thats safe Yes Roland raised his hands Eddie thought of asking him upon what basis he placed his belief and knew the answer without asking intuition It was Rolands specialty With a sigh Eddie raised his own hands to his shoulders Deepneau Roland called out in the direction of the boathouse Aaron Deepneau Were friends and our time is short If thats you come out We need to palaver There was a pause and then an old mans voice called Whats your name mister Roland Deschain of Gilead and the line of the Eld I think you know it And your trade I deal in lead Roland called and Eddie felt goosebumps pebble his arms A long pause Then Have they killed Calvin Not thatwe know of Eddie called back If you know something we dont why dont you come on out here and tell us Are you the guy who showed up while Cal was dickering with that prick Andolini Eddie felt another throb of anger at the worddickering At the slant it put on what had actually been going down in Towers back room A dicker Is that what he told you it was And then without waiting for Aaron Deepneau to answer Yeah Im that guy Come out here and lets talk No answer Twenty seconds slipped by Eddie pulled in breath to call Deepneau again Roland put a hand on Eddies arm and shook his head Another twenty seconds went by and then there was the rusty shriek of a spring as a screen door was pushed open A tall skinny man stepped out of the boathouse blinking like an owl In one hand he held a large black automatic pistol by the barrel Deepneau raised it over his head Its a Beretta and unloaded he said Theres only one clip and its in the bedroom under my socks Loaded guns make me nervous Okay Eddie rolled his eyes Thesefolken were their own worst enemas as Henry might have said Fine Roland said Just keep coming And  wonders never ceased it seemed  Deepneau did Five The coffee he made was better by far than any theyd had in Calla Bryn Sturgis better than any Roland had had since his days in Mejis Dropriding out on the Rim There were also strawberries Cultivated and storebought Deepneau said but Eddie was transported by their sweetness The three of them sat in the kitchen of Jaffords Rentals Cabin  drinking coffee and dipping the big strawberries in the sugarbowl By the end of their palaver all three men looked like assassins whod dabbled the tips of their fingers in the spilled blood of their latest victim Deepneaus unloaded gun lay forgotten on the windowsill Deepneau had been out for a walk on the Rocket Road when he heard gunfire loud and clear and then explosions Hed hurried back to the cabin not that he was capable of too much hurry in his current condition he said and when he saw the smoke starting to rise in the south had decided that returning to the boathouse might be wise after all By then he was almost positive it was the Italian hoodlum Andolini so  What do you mean youreturned to the boathouse Eddie asked Deepneau shifted his feet under the table He was extremely pallid with purple patches beneath his eyes and only a few wisps of hair fine as dandelion fluff on his head Eddie remembered Towers telling him that Deepneau had been diagnosed with cancer a couple of years ago He didnt look great today but Eddie had seen folks  especially in the City of Lud  who looked a lot worse Jakes old pal Gasher had been just one of them Aaron Eddie asked What did you mean   I heard the question he said a trifle irritably We got a note via general delivery or rather Cal did suggesting we move out of the cabin to someplace adjacent and keep a lower profile in general It was from a man named Callahan Do you know him Roland and Eddie nodded This Callahanyou could say he took Cal to the woodshed Cal Calla CallahanEddie thought and sighed Cals a decent man in most ways but he does not enjoy being taken to the woodshed We did move down to the boathouse for a few days Deepneau paused possibly engaging in a brief struggle with his conscience Then he said Two days actually Only two And then Cal said we were crazy being in the damp was making his arthritis worse and he could hear me wheezing Next thing Ill have you in that little shitpot hospital over in Norway he said with pneumonia as well as cancer He said there wasnt a chance in hell of Andolini finding us up here as long as the young guy  you  he pointed a gnarled and strawberrystained finger at Eddie  kept his mouth shut Those New York hoodlums cant find their way north of Westport without a compass he said Eddie groaned For once in his life he absolutelyloathed being right about something He said wed been very careful And when I said Wellsomebody found us this Callahan found us Cal said well of course Again the finger pointed at Eddie Youmust have told Mr Callahan where to look for the zip code and after that it was easy Then Cal said And the post office was the best he could do wasnt it Believe me Aaron were safe out here No one knows where we are except the rental agent and shes back in New York Deepneau peered at them from beneath his shaggy eyebrows then dipped a strawberry and ate half of it Isthat how you found us The rental agent No Eddie said A local He took us right to you Aaron Deepneau sat back Ouch Ouch is right Eddie said So you moved back into the cabin and Cal went right on buying books instead of hiding out here and reading one Correct Deepneau dropped his eyes to the tablecloth You have to understand that Cal is very dedicated Books are his life No Eddie said evenly Cal isnt dedicated Cal isobsessed thats what Cal is I understand that you are a scrip Roland said speaking for the first time since Deepneau had led them into the cabin He had lit another of Cullums cigarettes after plucking the filter off as the caretaker had shown him and now sat smoking with what looked to Eddie like absolutely no satisfaction at all A scrip I dont A lawyer Oh Well yes But Ive been retired from practice since   We need you to come out of retirement long enough to draw up a certain paper Roland said and then explained what sort of paper he wanted Deepneau was nodding before the gunslinger had done more than get started and Eddie assumed Tower had already told his friend this part of it That was okay What he didnt like was the expression on the old fellas face Still Deepneau let Roland finish He hadnt forgotten the basics of relating to potential clients it seemed retired or not When he was sure Rolandwas finished Deepneau said I feel I must tell you that Calvin has decided to hold onto that particular piece of property a little longer Eddie thumped the unwounded side of his head being careful to use his right hand for this bit of theater His left arm was stiffening up and his leg was once more starting to throb between the knee and the ankle He supposed it was possible that good old Aaron was traveling with some heavyduty painkillers and made a mental note to ask for a few if he was Cry pardon Eddie said but I took a knock on the head while I was arriving in this charming little town and I think its screwed up my hearing I thought you said that saithat Mr Tower had decided against selling us the lot Deepneau smiled rather wearily You know perfectly well what I said But hessupposed to sell it to us He had a letter from Stefan Toren his threetimesgreat grandfather saying just that Cal says different Aaron responded mildly Have another strawberry Mr Dean No thank you Have another strawberry Eddie Roland said and handed him one Eddie took it Considered squashing it against Long Tall and Uglys beak just for the hell of it then dipped it first in a saucer of cream then in the sugarbowl He began to eat And damn it was hard to stay bitter with that much sweetness flooding your mouth A fact of which Roland Deepneau too for that matter was surely aware According to Cal Deepneau said there was nothing in the envelope he had from Stefan Toren except for this mans name He tilted his mostly hairless head toward Roland Torens will  what was in the olden days sometimes called a deadletter  was long gone I knew what was in the envelope Eddie said He asked me andI knew  So he told me Deepneau regarded him expressionlessly He said it was a trick any streetcorner magician could do Did he also tell you that hepromised to sell us the lot if I could tell him the name That he fuckingpromised  He claims to have been under considerable stress when he made that promise As I am sure he was Does the son of a bitch think we mean to weasel on him Eddie asked His temples were thudding with rage Had he ever been so angry Once he supposed When Roland had refused to let him go back to New York so he could score some horse Is that it Because we wont Well come up with every cent he wants and more I swear it on the face of my father And on the heart of my dinh Listen to me carefully young man because this is important Eddie glanced at Roland Roland nodded slightly then crushed out his cigarette on one bootheel Eddie looked back at Deepneau silent but glowering Hesays that is exactly the problem He says youll pay him some ridiculously low token amount  a dollar is the usual sum in such cases  and then stiff him for the rest He claims you tried to hypnotize him into believing you were a supernatural being or someone withaccess to supernatural beingsnot to mention access to millions from the Holmes Dental Corporationbut he was not fooled Eddie gaped at him These are things Calvinsays  Deepneau continued in that same calm voice but they are not necessarily the things Calvinbelieves  What in hell do you mean Calvin has issues with letting go of things Deepneau said He is quite good at finding rare and antiquarian books you know  a regular literary Sherlock Holmes  and he is compulsive about acquiring them Ive seen himhound the owner of a book he wants  Im afraid theres no other word that really fits  until the books owner gives in and sells Sometimes just to make Cal stop calling on the telephone Im sure Given his talents his location and the considerable sum of money to which he gained complete access on his twentysixth birthday Cal should have been one of the most successful antiquarian bookdealers in New York or in the whole country His problem isnt with buying but selling Once he has an item hes really worked to acquire he hates to let it go again I remember when a book collector from San Francisco a fellow almost as compulsive as Cal himself finally wore down Cal enough to sell him a signed first ofMobyDick Cal made over seventy thousand dollars on that one deal alone but he also didnt sleep for a week He feels much the same way about the lot on the corner of Second and Fortysixth Its the only real property other than his books which he still has And hes convinced himself that you want to steal it from him There was a short period of silence Then Roland said Does he know better in his secret heart Mr Deschain I dont understand what   Aye ya do Roland said Does he Yes Deepneau said at last I believe he does Does he understand in his secret heart that we are men of our word who will pay him for his property unless were dead Yes probably But   Does he understand that if he transfers ownership of the lot to us and if we make this transfer perfectly clear to Andolinis dinh  his boss a man named Balazar   I know the name Deepneau said dryly Its in the papers from time to time That Balazar will then leave your friend alone If that is he can be made to understand that the lot is no longer your friends to sell and that any effort to take revenge on sai Tower will cost Balazar himself dearly Deepneau crossed his arms over his narrow chest and waited He was looking at Roland with a kind of uneasy fascination In short if your friend Calvin Tower sells us that lot his troubles will be over Do you think he knowsthat in his secret heart Yes Deepneau said Its just that hes got thisthis kink about letting stuff go Draw up a paper Roland said Object the vacant square of waste ground on the corner of those two streets Tower the seller Us the buyer The Tet Corporation as buyer Eddie put in Deepneau was shaking his head I could draw it up but you wont convince him to sell Unless youve got a week or so that is and youre not averse to using hot irons on his feet Or maybe his balls Eddie muttered something under his breath Deepneau asked him what hed said Eddie told him nothing What hed said wasSounds good We will convince him Roland said I wouldnt be so sure of that my friend We will convince him Roland repeated He spoke in his driest tone Outside an anonymous little car a Hertz rental if Eddie had ever seen one rolled into the clearing and came to a stop Bite your tongue bite your tongueEddie told himself but as Calvin Tower got briskly out of the car giving the new vehicle in his dooryard only the most cursory glance Eddie felt his temples begin to heat up He rolled his hands into fists and when his nails bit into the skin of his palms he grinned in bitter appreciation of the pain Tower opened the trunk of his rental Chevy and pulled out a large bagHis latest haul Eddie thought Tower looked briefly south at the smoke in the sky then shrugged and started for the cabin Thats rightEddie thoughtthats right you whore just something on fire whats it to you Despite the throb of pain it caused in his wounded arm Eddie squeezed his fists tighter dug his nails in deeper You cant kill him EddieSusannah saidYou know that dont you Did he know it And even if he did could he listen to Suzes voice To any voice of reason for that matter Eddie didnt know What he knew was that the real Susannah was gone she had a monkey named Mia on her back and had disappeared into the maw of the future Tower on the other hand was here Which made sense in a way Eddie had read someplace that nuclear wars most likely survivors would be the cockroaches Never mind sugar you just bite down on your tongue and let Roland handle this You cant kill him No Eddie supposed not Not at least until sai Tower had signed on the dotted line After that howeverafter that Six Aaron Tower called as he mounted the porch steps Roland caught Deepneaus eyes and put a finger across his lips Aaron heyAaron  Tower sounded strong and happy to be alive  not a man on the run but a man on a wonderful busmans holiday Aaron I went over to that widows house in East Fryeburg and holy Joe shes got every novel Herman Wouk ever wrote Not the book club editions either which is what I expected but   Thescroink of the screen doors rusty spring being stretched was followed by the clump of shoes across the porch   the Doubleday firstsMarjorie Morningstar The Caine Mutiny I think somebody across the lake better hope their fire insurance is paid up because   He stepped in Saw Aaron Saw Roland sitting across from Deepneau looking at him steadily from those frightening blue eyes with the deep crows feet at the corners And last of all he saw Eddie But Eddie didnt see him At the last moment Eddie Dean had lowered his clasped hands between his knees and then lowered his head so his gaze was fixed upon them and the board floor below them He was quite literally biting his tongue There were two drops of blood on the side of his right thumb He fixed his eyes on these He fixed every iota of his attention on them Because if he looked at the owner of that jolly voice Eddie would surely kill him Saw our car Saw it but never went over for a look Never called out and asked his friend who was here or if everything was okay IfAaronwas okay Because he had some guy named Herman Wouk on his mind not book club editions but the real thing No worries mate Because youve got no more shortterm imagination than Jack Andolini You and Jack just a couple ragged cockroaches scuttling across the floor of the universe Eyes on the prize right Eyes on the fucking prize You Tower said The happiness and excitement were gone from his voice The guy from   The guy from nowhere Eddie said without looking up The one who peeled Jack Andolini off you when you were about two minutes from shitting in your pants And this is how you repay Youre quite the guy arent you As soon as he finished speaking Eddie clamped down on his tongue again His clasped hands were trembling He expected Roland to intervene  surely he would Eddie couldnt be expected to deal with this selfish monster on his own he wasnt capable of it  but Roland said nothing Tower laughed The sound was as nervous and brittle as his voice when hed realized who was sitting in the kitchen of his rented cabin Oh sirMr DeanI really think youve exaggerated the seriousness of that situation   What I remember Eddie said still without looking up is the smell of the gasoline I fired my dinhs gun do you recall that I suppose we were lucky there were no fumes and that I fired it in the right direction They poured gasoline all over the corner where you keep your desk They were going to burn your favorite booksor should I say your best friends your family Because thats what they are to you arent they And Deepneau who the fuck is he Just some old guy full of cancer who ran north with you when you needed a running buddy Youd leave him dying in a ditch if someone offered you a first edition of Shakespeare or some special Ernest Hemingway I resent that Tower cried I happen to know that my bookshop has been burned flat and through an oversight its uninsured Im ruined and its all your fault I want you out of here You defaulted on the insurance when you needed cash to buy that Hopalong Cassidy collection from the Clarence Mulford estate last year Aaron Deepneau said mildly You told me that insurance lapse was only temporary but   It was Tower said He sounded both injured and surprised as if he had never expected betrayal from this quarter Probably he hadnt Itwas only temporary goddammit   but to blame this young man Deepneau went on in that same composed but regretful voice seems most unfair I want you out of here Tower snarled at Eddie You and your friend as well I have no wish to do business with you If you ever thought I did it was aamisapprehension  He seized upon this last word as though upon a prize and nearly shouted it out Eddie clasped his hands more tightly yet He had never been more aware of the gun he was wearing it had gained a kind of balefully lively weight He reeked with sweat he could smell it And now drops of blood began to ooze out from between his palms and fall to the floor He could feel his teeth beginning to sink into his tongue Well it was certainly a way to forget the pain in ones leg Eddie decided to give the tongue in question another brief conditional parole What I remember most clearly about my visit to you   You have some books that belong to me Tower said I want them back Iinsist on   Shut up Cal Deepneau said WhatTower did not sound wounded now he sounded shocked Almost breathless Stop squirming Youve earned this scolding and you know it If youre lucky a scolding is all it will be So shut up and for once in your life take it like a man Hear him very well Roland said in a tone of dry approval What I remember most clearly Eddie pushed on is how horrified you were by what I told Jack  about how I and my friends would fill Grand Army Plaza with corpses if he didnt lay off Some of them women and children You didnt like that but do you know what Cal Jack Andolinis here right now in East Stoneham Youlie  Tower said He drew in breath as he said it turning the words into an inhaled scream God Eddie replied if only I did I saw two innocent women die Cal In the general store this was Andolini set an ambush and if you were a praying man  I suppose youre not unless theres some first edition you feel in danger of losing but if you were  you might want to get down on your knees and pray to the god of selfish obsessed greedy uncaring dishonest bookstore owners that it was a woman namedMia who told Balazars dinh where we were probably going to end upher not you Because if they followedyou Calvin those two womens blood is onyour hands  His voice was rising steadily and although Eddie was still looking steadfastly down his whole body had begun to tremble He could feel his eyes bulging in their sockets and the cords of strain standing out on his neck He could feel his balls drawn all the way up as small and as hard as peachpits Most of all he could feel the desire to spring across the room as effortless as a ballet dancer and bury his hands in Calvin Towers fat white throat He was waiting for Roland to intervene  hopingfor Roland to intervene  but the gunslinger did not and Eddies voice continued to rise toward the inevitable scream of fury One of those women went right down but the othershe stayed up for a couple of seconds A bullet took off the top of her head I think it was a machinegun bullet and for the couple of seconds she stayed on her feet she looked like a volcano Only she was blowing blood instead of lava Well but it was probably Mia who ratted Ive got a feeling about that Its not entirely logical but luckily for you itsstrong Mia using what Susannah knew and protecting her chap Mia Young man  Mr Dean  I know no   Shut up Eddie cried Shut up you rat You lying reneging weasel You greedy grasping piggy excuse for a man Why didnt you take out a few billboards H I IM CAL TOWER  I M STAYING ON THE ROCKET ROAD IN EAST STONEHAM W HY DON  T YOU COME SEE ME AND MY FRIEND AARON B RING GUNS  Slowly Eddie looked up Tears of rage were rolling down his face Tower had backed up against the wall to one side of the door his eyes huge and moist in his round face Sweat stood out on his brow He held his bag of freshly acquired books against his chest like a shield Eddie looked at him steadily Blood dripped from between his tightly clasped hands the spot of blood on the arm of his shirt had begun to spread again now a trickle of blood ran from the left side of his mouth as well And he supposed he understood Rolands silence This was Eddie Deans job Because he knew Tower inside as well as out didnt he Knew him very well Once upon a time not so long ago hadnt he himself thought everything in the world but heroin pale and unimportant Hadnt he believed everything in the world that wasnt heroin up for barter or sale Had he not come to a point when he would literally have pimped his own mother in order to get the next fix Wasnt that why he was so angry That lot on the corner of Second Avenue and Fortysixth Street was never yours Eddie said Not your fathers or his fathers all the way back to Stefan Toren You were only custodians the same way Im custodian of the gun I wear I deny that Do you Aaron asked How strange Ive heard you speak of that piece of land in almost those exact words   Aaron shut up   many times Deepneau finished calmly There was a pop Eddie jumped sending a fresh throb of pain up his leg from the hole in his shin It was a match Roland was lighting another cigarette The filter lay on the oilcloth covering the table with two others They looked like little pills Here is what you said to me Eddie said and all at once he was calm The rage was out of him like poison drawn from a snakebite Roland had let him do that much and despite his bleeding tongue and bleeding palms he was grateful Anything I saidI was under stressI was afraid you might kill me yourself You said you had an envelope from March of  You said there was a sheet of paper in the envelope and a name written on the paper You said   I deny   You said that if I could tell you the name written on that piece of paper youd sell me the lot For one dollar And with the understanding that youd be getting a great deal more  millions  between now and lets say Tower barked a laugh Why not offer me the Brooklyn Bridge while youre at it You made a promise And now your father watches you attempt to break it Calvin Tower shriekedI DENY EVERY WORD YOU SAY Deny and be damned Eddie said And now Im going to tell you something Cal something I know from my own beatup but still beating heart Youre eating a bitter meal You dont know that because someone told you it was sweet and your own tastebuds are numb I have no idea what youre talking about Youre crazy No Aaron said Hes not Youre the one whos crazy if you dont listen to him I thinkI think hes giving you a chance to redeem the purpose of your life Give it up Eddie said Just once listen to the better angel instead of to the other one That other one hates you Cal It only wants to kill you Believe me I know Silence in the cabin From the pond came the cry of a loon From across it came the less lovely sound of sirens Calvin Tower licked his lips and said Are you telling the truth about Andolini Is he really in this town Yes Eddie said Now he could hear thewhuppawhuppawhup of an approaching helicopter A TV news chopper Wasnt this still about five years too early for such things especially up here in the boondocks The bookstore owners eyes shifted to Roland Tower had been surprised and hed been guilttripped with a vengeance but the man was already regaining some of his composure Eddie could see it and he reflected not for the first time on how much simpler life would be if people would stay in the pigeonholes where you originally put them He did not want to waste time thinking of Calvin Tower as a brave man or as even second cousin to the good guys but maybe he was both those things Damn him Youre truly Roland of Gilead Roland regarded him through rising membranes of cigarette smoke You say true I say thank ya Roland of the Eld Yes Son of Steven Yes Grandson of Alaric Rolands eyes flickered with what was probably surprise Eddie himself was surprised but what he mostly felt was a kind of tired relief The questions Tower was asking could mean only two things First more had been passed down to him than just Rolands name and trade of hand Second he was coming around Of Alaric aye Roland said him of the red hair I dont know anything about his hair but I know why he went to Garlan Do you To slay a dragon And did he No he was too late The last in that part of the world had been slain by another king one who was later murdered Now to Eddies even greater surprise Tower haltingly addressed Roland in a language that was a second cousin to English at best What Eddie heard was something likeHad heet Roluh fa heet gun fa heet hak fahad gun Roland nodded and replied in the same tongue speaking slowly and carefully When he was finished Tower sagged against the wall and dropped his bag of books unheeded to the floor Ive been a fool he said No one contradicted him Roland would you step outside with me I needIneed Tower began to cry He said something else in that notEnglish language once more ending on a rising inflection as if asking a question Roland got up without replying Eddie also got up wincing at the pain in his leg There was a slug in there all right he could feel it He grabbed Rolands arm pulled him down and whispered in the gunslingers ear Dont forget that Tower and Deepneau have an appointment at the Turtle Bay Washateria four years from now Tell him Fortyseventh Street between Second and First He probably knows the place Tower and Deepneau werearewill bethe ones who save Don Callahans life Im almost sure of it Roland nodded then crossed to Tower who initially cringed away and then straightened with a conscious effort Roland took his hand in the way of the Calla and led him outside When they were gone Eddie said to Deepneau Draw up the contract Hes selling Deepneau regarded him skeptically You really think so Yeah Eddie said I really do Seven Drawing the contract didnt take long Deepneau found a pad in the kitchen there was a cartoon beaver on top of each sheet and the legend DAM IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO  and wrote it on that pausing every now and then to ask Eddie a question When they were finished Deepneau looked at Eddies sweatshiny face and said I have some Percocet tablets Would you like some You bet Eddie said If he took them now he thought  hoped  he would be ready for what he wanted Roland to do when Roland got back The bullet was still in there in there for sure and it had to come out How about four Deepneaus eyes measured him I know what Im doing Eddie said Then added Unfortunately Eight Aaron found a couple of childrens BandAids in the cabins medicine chest Snow White on one Bambi on another and put them over the hole in Eddies arm after pouring another shot of disinfectant into the wounds entry and exit points Then while drawing a glass of water to go with the painkillers he asked Eddie where he came from Because he said although you wear that gun with authority you sound a lot more like Cal and me than you do him Eddie grinned Theres a perfectly good reason for that I grew up in Brooklyn CoOp City And thoughtSuppose I were to tell you that Im there right now as a matter of fact Eddie Dean the worlds horniest fifteenyearold running wild in the streets For that Eddie Dean the most important thing in the world is getting laid Such things as the fall of the Dark Tower and some ultimate baddie named the Crimson King wont bother me for another  Then he saw the way Aaron Deepneau was looking at him and came out of his own head in a hurry What Have I got a booger hanging out of my nose or something CoOp Citys not in Brooklyn Deepneau said He spoke as one does to a small child CoOp Citys in the Bronx Always has been Thats   Eddie began meaning to addridiculous but before he could get it out the world seemed to waver on its axis Again he was overwhelmed by that sense of fragility that sense of the entire universe or an entirecontinuum of universes made of crystal instead of steel There was no way to speak rationally of what he was feeling because there was nothing rational about what was happening There are more worlds than these he said That was what Jake told Roland just before he died Go then  there are other worlds than these And he must have been right because he came back Mr Dean Deepneau looked concerned I dont understand what youre talking about but youve come over very pale I think you should sit down Eddie allowed himself to be led back into the cabins combination kitchen and sitting room Did he himself understand what he was talking about Or how Aaron Deepneau  presumably a lifelong New Yorker  could assert with such casual assurance that CoOp City was in the Bronx when Eddie knew it to be in Brooklyn Not entirely but he understood enough to scare the hell out of him Other worlds Perhaps an infinite number of worlds all of them spinning on the axle that was the Tower All of them were similar but therewere differences Different politicians on the currency Different makes of automobiles  Takuro Spirits instead of Datsuns for instance  and different major league baseball teams In these worlds one of which had been decimated by a plague called the superflu you could timehop back and forth past and future Because Because in some vital way they arent the real world Or if theyre real theyre not the key world Yes that felt closer He had come from one of those other worlds he was convinced of it So had Susannah And Jakes One and Two the one who had fallen and the one who had been literally pulled out of the monsters mouth and saved But this world was the key world And he knew it because he was a keymakerby tradeDadachum dadachee not to worry youve got the key Beryl Evans Not quite real Claudia y Inez Bachman Real World with CoOp City in Brooklyn Not quite real World with CoOp City in the Bronx Real hard as it was to swallow And he had an idea that Callahan had crossed over from the real world to one of the others long before he had embarked on his highways in hiding had crossed without even knowing it Hed said something about officiating at some little boys funeral and how after that After that he said everything changed Eddie said as he sat down Thateverything changed  Yes yes Aaron Deepneau said patting him on the shoulder Sit quietly now Pere went from a seminary in Boston to Lowell real Salems Lot not real Made up by a writer named   Im going to get a cold compress for your forehead Good idea Eddie said closing his eyes His mind was whirling Real not real Live Memorex John Cullums retired professor friend was right the column of truthdid have a hole in it Eddie wondered if anyone knew how deep that hole went Nine It was a different Calvin Tower who came back to the cabin with Roland fifteen minutes later a quiet and chastened Calvin Tower He asked Deepneau if Deepneau had written a bill of sale and when Deepneau nodded Tower said nothing only nodded back He went to the fridge and returned with several cans of Blue Ribbon beer and handed them around Eddie refused not wanting to put alcohol on top of the Percs Tower did not offer a toast but drank off half his beer at a single go It isnt every day I get called the scum of the earth by a man who promises to make me a millionaire and also to relieve me of my hearts heaviest burden Aaron will this thing stand up in court Aaron Deepneau nodded Rather regretfully Eddie thought All right then Tower said Then after a pause All right lets do it But still he didnt sign Roland spoke to him in that other language Tower flinched then signed his name in a quick scrawl his lips tucked into a line so narrow his mouth seemed almost not to be there Eddie signed for the Tet Corporation marveling at how strange the pen felt in his hand  he couldnt remember when last he had held one When the thing was done sai Tower reverted  looked at Eddie and cried in a cracked voice that was almost a shriek There Im a pauper Give me my dollar Im promised a dollar I feel a need to take a shit coming on and I need something to wipe my ass with Then he put his hands over his face He sat like that for several seconds while Roland folded the signed paper Deepneau had witnessed both signatures and put it in his pocket When Tower lowered his hands again his eyes were dry and his face was composed There even seemed to be a touch of color in his formerly ashy cheeks I think I actually do feel a little better he said He turned to Aaron Do you suppose these twocockuhs might be right I think its a real possibility Aaron said smiling Eddie meanwhile had thought of a way to find out for sure if it really was these two men who would save Callahan from the Hitler Brothers  or almost for sure One of them had said Listen he said Theres a certain phrase Yiddish I thinkGai cocknif en yom Do you know what it means Either of you Deepneau threw back his head and laughed Yeah its Yiddish all right My Ma used to say it all the time when she was mad at us It means go shit in the ocean Eddie nodded at Roland In the next couple of years one of these men  probably Tower  would buy a ring with the wordsEx Libris carved into it Maybe  how crazy wasthis  because Eddie Dean himself had put the idea into Cal Towers head And Tower  selfish acquisitive miserly bookgreedy Calvin Tower  would save Father Callahans life while that ring was on his finger He was going to be shitscared Deepneau too but he was going to do it And  At that point Eddie happened to look at the pen with which Tower had signed the bill of sale a perfectly ordinary Bic Clic and the enormous truth of what had just happened struck home They owned it They owned the vacant lotThey not the Sombra CorporationThey owned the rose He felt as if hed just taken a hard shot to the head The rose belonged to the Tet Corporation which was the firm of Deschain Dean Dean Chambers  Oy It was now their responsibility for better or for worse This round they had won Which did not change the fact that he had a bullet in his leg Roland he said theres something you have to do for me Ten Five minutes later Eddie lay on the cabins linoleum floor in his ridiculous kneelength Calla Bryn Sturgis underbritches In one hand he held a leather belt which had spent its previous life holding up various pairs of Aaron Deepneaus pants Beside him was a basin filled with a dark brown fluid The hole in his leg was about three inches below his knee and a little bit to the right of the shinbone The flesh around it had risen up in a hard little cone This miniature volcanos caldera was currently plugged with a shiny redpurple clot of blood Two folded towels had been laid beneath Eddies calf Are you going to hypnotize me he asked Roland Then he looked at the belt he was holding and knew the answer Ah shit youre not are you No time Roland had been rummaging in the junkdrawer to the left of the sink Now he approached Eddie with a pair of pliers in one hand and a paring knife in the other Eddie thought they made an exceedingly ugly combo The gunslinger dropped to one knee beside him Tower and Deepneau stood in the living area side by side watching with big eyes There was a thing Cort told us when we were boys Roland said Will I tell it to you Eddie If you think itll help sure Pain rises From the heart to the head pain rises Double up sai Aarons belt and put it in your mouth Eddie did as Roland said feeling very foolish and very scared In how many Western movies had he seen a version of this scene Sometimes John Wayne bit a stick and sometimes Clint Eastwood bit a bullet and he believed that in some TV show or other Robert Culp had actually bitten a belt But of course we have to remove the bulletEddie thoughtNo story of this type would be complete without at least one scene where  A sudden memory shocking in its brilliance struck him and the belt tumbled from his mouth He actually cried out Roland had been about to dip his rude operating instruments in the basin which held the rest of the disinfectant Now he looked at Eddie concerned What is it For a moment Eddie couldnt reply His breath was quite literally gone his lungs as flat as old inner tubes He was remembering a movie the Dean boys had watched one afternoon on TV in their apartment the one in Brooklyn the Bronx CoOp City Henry mostly got to pick what they watched because he was bigger and older Eddie didnt protest too often or too much he idolized his big brother When hedid protest too much he was apt to get the old Indian Rope Burn or maybe a Dutch Rub up the back of his neck What Henry liked was Westerns The sort of movies where sooner or later some character had to bite the stick or belt or bullet Roland he said His voice was just a faint wheeze to start with Roland listen I hear you very well There was a movie I told you about movies right Stories told in moving pictures Sometimes Henry and I used to stay in and watch them on TV Televisions basically a home moviemachine A shitmachine some would say Tower put in Eddie ignored him One of the movies we watched was about these Mexican peasants  folkenif it does ya  who hired some gunslingers to protect them from thebandidos who came every year to raid their village and steal their crops Does any of this ring a bell Roland looked at him with gravity and what might have been sadness Yes Indeed it does And the name of Tians village I always knew it sounded familiar but I didnt know why Now I do The movie was calledThe Magnificent Seven and just by the way Roland how many of us were in the ditch that day waiting for the Wolves Would you boys mind telling us what youre talking about Deepneau asked But although he asked politely both Roland and Eddie ignored him too Roland took a moment to cull his memory then said You me Susannah Jake Margaret Zalia and Rosa There were more  the Tavery twins and Ben Slightmans boy  but seven fighters Yes And the link I couldnt quite make was to the movies director When youre making a movie you need a director to run things Hes the dinh Roland nodded The dinh ofThe Magnificent Seven was a man named John Sturges Roland sat a moment longer thinking Then he said Ka Eddie burst out laughing He simply couldnt help it Roland always had the answer Eleven In order to catch the pain Roland said you have to clamp down on the belt at the instant you feel it Do you understandThe very instant Pin it with your teeth Gotcha Just make it quick Ill do the best I can Roland dipped first the pliers and then the knife into the disinfectant Eddie waited with the belt in his mouth lying across his teeth Yes once you saw the basic pattern you couldnt unsee it could you Roland was the hero of the piece the grizzled old warrior whod be played by some grizzled but vital star like Paul Newman or maybe Eastwood in the Hollywood version He himself was the young buck played by the hot young boy star of the moment Tom Cruise Emilio Estevez Rob Lowe someone like that And heres a set we all know a cabin in the woods and a situation weve seen many times before but still relish Pulling the Bullet All that was missing was the ominous sound of drums in the distance And Eddie realized probably the drums were missing because theyd already been through the Ominous Drums part of the story the goddrums They had turned out to be an amplified version of a ZZ Top song being broadcast through streetcorner speakers in the City of Lud Their situation was becoming ever harder to denythey were characters in someones story This whole world  I refuse to believe that I refuse to believe that I was raised in Brooklyn simply because of some writers mistake something that will eventually be fixed in the second draft Hey Pere Im with you  I refuse to believe Im acharacterThis is my fucking life Go on Roland he said Get that thing outta me The gunslinger poured some of the disinfectant from the bowl over Eddies shin then used the tip of the knife to flick the clot out of the wound With that done he lowered the pliers Be ready to bite the pain Eddie he murmured and a moment later Eddie did Twelve Roland knew what he was doing had done it before and the bullet hadnt gone deep The whole thing was over in ninety seconds but it was the longest minute and a half in Eddies life At last Roland tapped the pliers on one of Eddies closed hands When Eddie managed to unroll his fingers the gunslinger dropped a flattened slug into it Souvenir he said Stopped right on the bone That was the scraping that you heard Eddie looked at the mashed piece of lead then flicked it across the linoleum floor like a marble Dont want it he said and wiped his brow Tower ever the collector picked up the castoff slug Deepneau meanwhile was examining the toothmarks in his belt with silent fascination Cal Eddie said getting up on his elbows You had a book in your case   I want those books back Tower said immediately You better be taking care of them young man Im sure theyre in great condition Eddie said telling himself once more to bite his tongue if he had toOr grab Aarons belt and bite that again if your tongue wont do They better be young man now theyre all I have left Yes along with the forty or so in your various safe deposit boxes Aaron Deepneau said completely ignoring the vile look his friend shot him The signedUlysses is probably the best but there are several gorgeous Shakespeare folios a complete set of signed Faulkners   Aaron would you please be quiet   and aHuckleberry Finn that you could turn into a MercedesBenz sedan any day of the week Deepneau finished In any case one of them was a book calledSalems Lot  Eddie said By a man named   Stephen King Tower finished He gave the slug a final look then put it on the kitchen table next to the sugarbowl Ive been told he lives close to here Ive picked up two copies ofLot and also three copies of his first novelCarrie I was hoping to take a trip to Bridgton and get them signed I suppose now that wont happen I dont understand what makes it so valuable Eddie said and then Ouch Roland that hurts Roland was checking the makeshift bandage around the wound in Eddies leg Be still he said Tower paid no attention to this Eddie had turned him once more in the direction of his favorite subject his obsession his darling What Eddie supposed Gollum in the Tolkien books would have called his precious Do you remember what I told you when we were discussingThe Hogan Mr Dean OrThe Dogan if you prefer I said that the value of a rare book  like that of a rare coin or a rare stamp  is created in different ways Sometimes its just an autograph   Your copy ofSalems Lot isnt signed No because this particular author is very young and not very well known He may amount to something one day or he may not Tower shrugged almost as if to say that was up to ka But this particular bookwell the first edition was only seventyfive hundred copies and almost all of them sold in New England Why Because the guy who wrote it is from New England Yes As so often happens the books value was created entirely by accident A local chain decided to promote it heavily They even produced a TV commercial which is almost unheardof at the local retail level And it worked Bookland of Maine ordered five thousand copies of the first edition  almost seventy per cent  and sold nearly every single one Also as withThe Hogan there were misprints in the front matter Not the title in this case but on the flap You can tell an authentic first ofSalems Lot by the clipped price  at the last minute Doubleday decided to raise the price from sevenninetyfive to eightninetyfive  and by the name of the priest in the flap copy Roland looked up What about the name of the priest In the book its Father Callahan But on the flap someone wrote FatherCody which is actually the name of the towns doctor And thats all it took to bump the price of a copy from nine bucks to nine hundred and fifty Eddie marveled Tower nodded Thats all  scarcity clipped flap misprint But theres also an element of speculation in collecting rare editions which I findquite exciting Thats one word for it Deepneau said dryly For instance suppose this man King becomes famous or critically acclaimed I admit the chances are small but suppose that did happen Available first editions of his second book are so rare that instead of being worth seven hundred and fifty dollars my copy might be worth ten times that He frowned at Eddie So youd better be taking good care of it Im sure itll be fine Eddie said and wondered what Calvin Tower would think if he knew that one of the books characters had it on a shelf in his arguably fictional rectory Said rectory in a town that was the fraternal twin of one in an old movie starring Yul Brynner as Rolands twin and introducing Horst Buchholz as Eddies Hed think you were crazy thats what hed think Eddie got to his feet swayed a little and gripped the kitchen table After a few moments the world steadied Can you walk on it Roland asked I was before wasnt I No one was digging around in there before Eddie took a few experimental steps then nodded His shin flared with pain each time he shifted his weight to his right leg but yes  he could walk on it Ill give you the rest of my Percocet Aaron said I can get more Eddie opened his mouth to say yeah sure bring it on and then saw Roland looking at him If Eddie said yes to Deepneaus offer the gunslinger wouldnt speak up and cause Eddie to lose facebut yes his dinh was watching Eddie thought of the speech hed made to Tower all that poetic stuff about how Calvin was eating a bitter meal It was true poetic or not But that apparently wouldnt stop Eddie from sitting back down to that same dinner himself First a few Percodan then a few Percocet Both of them too much like horse for comfort So how long would it be before he got tired of kissing his sister and started looking for somereal pain relief I think Ill skip the Percs Eddie said Were going to Bridgton   Roland looked at him surprised We are We are I can pick up some aspirin on the way Astin Roland said with unmistakable affection Are you sure Deepneau asked Yeah Eddie said I am He paused then added Say sorry Thirteen Five minutes later the four of them stood in the needlecarpeted dooryard listening to sirens and looking at the smoke which had now begun to thin Eddie was bouncing the keys to John Cullums Ford impatiently in one hand Roland had asked him twice if this trip to Bridgton was necessary and Eddie had told him twice that he was almost sure it was The second time hed added almost hopefully that as dinh Roland could overrule him if he wished No If you think we should go see this talespinner we will I only wish you knewwhy  I think that when we get there well both understand Roland nodded but still looked dissatisfied I know youre as anxious as I am to leave this world  this level of the Tower For you to want to go against that your intuition must be strong It was but there was something else as well hed heard from Susannah again the message once more coming from her version of the Dogan She was a prisoner in her own body  at least Eddiethought that was what she was trying to tell him  but she was in the year  and she was all right This had happened while Roland was thanking Tower and Deepneau for their help Eddie was in the bathroom Hed gone in to take a leak but suddenly forgot all about that and simply sat on the toilets closed lid head bent eyes closed Trying to send a message back to her Trying to tell her to slow Mia down if she possibly could Hed gotten the sense of daylight from her  New York in the afternoon  and that was bad Jake and Callahan had gone through the Unfound Door into New York at night this Eddie had seen with his own eyes They might be able to help her but only if she could slow Mia down Burn up the dayhe sent to Susannahor tried toYou have to burn up the day before she takes you to wherever shes supposed to have the kid Do you hear me Suze do you hear me Answer if you hear me Jake and Pere Callahan are coming and you have to hold on Junea sighing voice had repliedJune of  The girls walk around with their bellies showing and  Then came Rolands knock on the bathroom door and Rolands voice asking if Eddie was ready to roll Before the day was over theyd make their way to Turtleback Lane in the town of Lovell  a place where walkins were common according to John Cullum and reality was apt to be correspondingly thin  but first they were going to make a trip to Bridgton and hopefully meet the man who seemed to have created Donald Callahan and the town of Salems Lot Be a hoot if King was out in California writing the movie version or somethingEddie thought but he didnt believe that was going to be the case They were still on the Path of the Beam in the way of ka So presumably was sai King You boys want to take it very easy Deepneau told them There are going to be a lot of cops around Not to mention Jack Andolini and whatever remains of his merry band Speaking of Andolini Roland said I think the time has come for the two of you to go somewhere he isnt Tower bristled Eddie could have predicted it Gonow You must be joking I have a list of almost a dozen people in the area who collect books  buy sell trade Some know what theyre doing but others He made a clipping gesture as if shearing an invisible sheep Therell be people selling old books out of their barns over in Vermont too Eddie said And you want to remember how easy it was for us to find you It was you who made it easy Cal Hes right Aaron said and when Calvin Tower made no reply only turned his sulky face down to regard his shoes Deepneau looked at Eddie again But at least Cal and I have drivers licenses to show should we be stopped by the local or the state police Im guessing neither of you do That would be correct Eddie said And I very much doubt if you could show a permit to carry those frighteningly large handguns either Eddie glanced down at the big  and incredibly ancient  revolver riding just below his hip then looked back up at Deepneau amused That would also be correct he said Then be careful Youll be leaving East Stoneham so youll probably be okay if you are Thanks Eddie said and stuck out his hand Long days and pleasant nights Deepneau shook Thats a lovely thing to say son but Im afraid my nights havent been especially pleasant just lately and if things on the medical front dont take a turn for the better soon my days arent apt to be especially long either Theyre going to be longer than you might think Eddie said I have good reason to believe youve got at least another four years in you Deepneau touched a finger to his lips then pointed at the sky From the mouth of man to the ear of God Eddie swung to Calvin Tower while Roland shook hands with Deepneau For a moment Eddie didnt think the bookstore owner was going to shake with him but at last he did Grudgingly Long days and pleasant nights sai Tower You did the right thing I was coerced and you know it Tower said Store goneproperty goneabout to be run off the first real vacation Ive had in ten years Microsoft Eddie said abruptly And then Lemons Tower blinked Beg pardon Lemons Eddie repeated and then he laughed out loud Fourteen Toward the end of his mostly useless life the great sage and eminent junkie Henry Dean had enjoyed two things above all others getting stoned getting stoned and talking about how he was going to make a killing in the stock market In investment matters he considered himself a regular E F Hutton One thing I would most definitelynot invest in bro Henry told him once when they were up on the roof Not long before Eddies trip to the Bahamas as a cocaine mule this had been One thing I would most applesolutelynot sink my money into is all this computer shit Microsoft Macintosh Sanyo Sankyo Pentium all that Seems pretty popular Eddie had ventured Not that hed much cared but what the hell it was a conversation Microsoft especially The coming thing Henry had laughed indulgently and made jackingoff gestures My prick thats the coming thing But   Yeah yeah I know peoplereflocking to that crap Driving all the prices up And when I observe that action do you know what I see No what Lemons Lemons Eddie had asked Hed thought he was following Henry but he guessed he was lost after all Of course the sunset had been amazing that evening and he had been most colossally fucked up You heard me Henry had said warming to the subject Fuckin lemons Didnt they teach you anything in school bro Lemons are these little animals that live over in Switzerland or someplace like that And every now and then  I think its every ten years Im not sure  they get suicidal and throw themselves over the cliffs Oh Eddie said biting hard on the inside of his cheek to keep from bursting into mad cackles Thoselemons I thought you meant the ones you use to make lemonade Fuckin wank Henry said but he spoke with the indulgent good nature the great and eminent sometimes reserve for the small and uninformed Anyway mypoint is that all these people who are flockin to invest in Microsoft and Macintosh and I dont know fuckin Nervous Norvus Speed Dial Chips all theyre gonna do is make Bill Fuckin Gates and Steve Fuckin Jobsarino rich This computer shit is gonna crash and burn by  all the experts say so and the people investin in it Fuckin lemons throwin themselves over the cliffs and into the fuckin ocean Just fuckin lemons Eddie agreed and sprawled back on the stillwarm roof so Henry wouldnt see how close he was to losing it entirely He was seeing billions of Sunkist lemons trotting toward these high cliffs all of them wearing red jogging shorts and little white sneakers like MMs in a TV ad Yeah but I wish Id gotten into that fuckin Microsoft in  Henry said Do you realize that shares that were sellin for fifteen bucks back then are now sellin for thirtyfive Oh man Lemons Eddie had said dreamily watching the sunsets colors begin to fade At that point hed had less than a month to live in his world  the one where CoOp City was in Brooklyn and always had been  and Henry had less than a month to live period Yeah Henry had said lying down beside him but man I wish I coulda gotten in back in  Fifteen Now still holding Towers hand he said Im from the future You know that dont you I know thathe says you are yes Tower jerked his head toward Roland then tried to pull his hand free Eddie held on Listen to me Cal If you listen and then act on what I tell you you can earn what that vacant lot of yours would be worth on the real estate market five maybe even ten times over Big talk from a man who isnt even wearing socks Tower said and once again tried to pull his hand free Again Eddie held it Once he supposed he wouldnt have been able to do that but his hands were stronger now So was his will Big talk from a man whos seen the future he corrected And the future is computers Cal The future is Microsoft Can you remember that Ican Aaron said Microsoft Never heard of it Tower said No Eddie agreed I dont think it even exists yet But it will soon and its going to be huge Computers okay Computers for everybody or at least that was the planWill be the plan The guy in charge is Bill Gates Always Bill never William It occurred to him briefly that since this world was different from the one in which he and Jake had grown up  the world of Claudia y Inez Bachman instead of Beryl Evans  that maybe the big computer genius herewouldnt be Gates could be someone named Chin Ho Fuk for all Eddie knew But he also knew that wasnt likely This world was very close to his same cars same brand names Coke and Pepsi rather than NozzALa same people on the currency He thought he could count on Bill Gates not to mention Steve Jobsarino showing up when he was supposed to In one way he didnt even care Calvin Tower was in many respects a total shithead On the other hand Tower had stood up to Andolini and Balazar for as long as he had to Hed held onto the vacant lot And now Roland had the bill of sale in his pocket They owed Tower a fair return for what hed sold them It had nothing to do with how much or how little they liked the guy which was probably a good thing for old Cal This Microsoft stuff Eddie said you can pick it up for fifteen dollars a share in  By   which is when I sort of went on permanent vacation  those shares will be worth thirtyfive apiece Thats a hundred per cent gain A little more Says you Tower said and finally succeeded in pulling his hand free If he says so Roland said its the truth Say thanks Eddie said It occurred to him that he was suggesting that Tower take a fairly big leap based on a stone junkies observations but he thought that in this case he could do that Come on Roland said and made that twirling gesture with his fingers If were going to see the writer lets go Eddie slid behind the wheel of Cullums car suddenly sure that he would never see either Tower or Aaron Deepneau again With the exception of Pere Callahan none of them would The partings had begun Do well he said to them May ya do well And you Deepneau said Yes Tower said and for once he didnt sound a bit grudging Good luck to you both Long days and happy nights or whatever it is There was just room to turn around without backing and Eddie was glad  he wasnt quite ready for reverse at least not yet As Eddie drove back toward the Rocket Road Roland looked over his shoulder and waved This was highly unusual behavior for him and the knowledge must have shown on Eddies face Its the endgame now Roland said All Ive worked for and waited for all the long years The end is coming I feel it Dont you Eddie nodded It was like that point in a piece of music when all the instruments begin rushing toward some inevitable crashing climax Susannah Roland asked Still alive Mia Still in control The baby Still coming And Jake Father Callahan Eddie stopped at the road looked both ways then made his turn No he said From them I havent heard What about you Roland shook his own head From Jake somewhere in the future with just an exCatholic priest and a billybumbler for protection there was only silence Roland hoped the boy was all right For the time being he could do no more STAVE Commalamemine You have to walk the line When you finally get the thing you need It makes you feel so fine RESPONSE Commalacomenine It makes ya feel fine But if youd have the thing you need You have to walk the line One John Fitzgerald Kennedy died this afternoon at Parkland Memorial Hospital This voice this grieving voice Walter Cronkites voice in a dream Americas last gunslinger is dead O Discordia Two As Mia left room of the New York Plaza  Park soon to be the Regal UN Plaza a SombraNorth Central project O Discordia Susannah fell into a swoon From a swoon she passed into a savage dream filled with savage news Three The next voice is that of Chet Huntley coanchor ofThe HuntleyBrinkley Report Its also  in some way she cannot understand  the voice of Andrew her chauffeur Diem and Nhu are dead says that voice Now do slip the dogs of war the tale of woe begins from here the way to Jericho Hill is paved with blood and sin Ah Discordia Charyou tree Come reap Where am I She looks around and sees a concrete wall packed with a jostling intaglio of names slogans and obscene drawings In the middle where anyone sitting on the bunk must see it is this greeting HELLO NIGGER WELCOME TO OXFORD DON  T LET THE SUN SET ON YOU HERE The crotch of her slacks is damp The underwear beneath is downright soaked and she remembers why although the bail bondsman was notified well in advance the cops held onto them as long as possible cheerfully ignoring the increasing chorus of pleas for a bathroom break No toilets in the cells no sinks not even a tin bucket You didnt need to be a quizkid onTwentyone to figure it out they weresupposed to piss in their pants supposed to get in touch with their essential animal natures and eventually she hadshe Odetta Holmes  Noshe thinksI am Susannah Susannah Dean Ive been taken prisoner again jailed again but I am still I She hears voices from beyond this wing of jail cells voices which for her sum up the present Shes supposed to think theyre coming from a TV out in the jails office she assumes but its got to be a trick Or some ghouls idea of a joke Why else would Frank McGee be saying President Kennedys brother Bobby is dead Why would Dave Garroway from theToday show be saying that the Presidents littleboy is dead that JohnJohn has been killed in a plane crash What sort of awful lie is that to hear as you sit in a stinking southern jail with your wet underpants clinging to your crotch Why is Buffalo Bob Smith of theHowdy Doody show yelling Cowabunga kids Martin Luther King is dead And the kids all screaming back CommalacomeYayWe love the things ya say Only good niggers a dead nigger so kill a coontoday  The bail bondsman will be here soon Thats what she needs to hold ontothat She goes to the bars and grips them Yes this is Oxford Town all right Oxford all over again two men dead by the light of the moon somebody better investigate soon But shes going to get out and shell fly away fly away fly away home and not long after that there will be an entirely new world to explore with a new person to love and a new person tobe Commalacomecome the journeys just begun Oh but thats a lie The journey is almost over Her heart knows this Down the hall a door opens and footsteps come clicking toward her She looks in that direction  eagerly hoping for the bondsman or a deputy with a ring of keys  but instead its a black woman in a pair of stolen shoes Its her old self Its Odetta Holmes Didnt go to Morehouse but did go to Columbia And to all those coffee houses down in the Village And to the Castle on the Abyss that house too Listen to me Odetta says No one can get you out of this but yourself girl You want to enjoy those legs while you got em honey The voice she hears coming out of her mouth is rough and confrontational on top scared underneath The voice of Detta Walker You goan lose em fore long They goan be cut off by the A train That fabled A train Man named Jack Mort goan push you off the platform in the Christopher Street station Odetta looks at her calmly and says The A train doesnt stop there Itsnever stopped there What the fuck youtalkin about bitch Odetta is not fooled by the angry voice or the profanity She knows who shes talking to And she knows what shes talking about The column of truth has a hole in it These are not the voices of the gramophone but those of our dead friends There are ghosts in the rooms of ruin Go back to the Dogan Susannah And remember what I say only you can save yourself Only you can lift yourself out of Discordia Four Now its the voice of David Brinkley saying that someone named Stephen King was struck and killed by a minivan while walking near his home in Lovell a small town in western Maine King was fiftytwo he says the author of many novels most notablyThe Stand The Shining andSalems Lot Ah Discordia Brinkley says the world grows darker Five Odetta Holmes the woman Susannah once was points through the bars of the cell and past her She says it again Only you can save yourself But the way of the gun is the way of damnation as well as salvation in the end there is no difference Susannah turns to look where the finger is pointing and is filled with horror at what she sees The blood Dear God theblood There is a bowl filled with blood and in it some monstrous dead thing a dead baby thats not human and has she killed it herself No she screams No I will neverI will NEVER  Then the gunslinger will die and the Dark Tower will fall says the terrible woman standing in the corridor the terrible woman who is wearing Trudy Damascuss shoes Discordia indeed Susannah closes her eyes Can shemake herself swoon Can she swoon herself right out of this cell this terrible world She does She falls forward into the darkness and the soft beeping of machinery and the last voice she hears is that of Walter Cronkite telling her that Diem and Nhu are dead astronaut Alan Shepard is dead Lyndon Johnson is dead Richard Nixon is dead Elvis Presley is dead Rock Hudson is dead Roland of Gilead is dead Eddie of New York is dead Jake of New York is dead the world is dead theworlds the Tower is falling a trillion universes are merging and all is Discordia all is ruin all is ended Six Susannah opened her eyes and looked around wildly gasping for breath She almost fell out of the chair in which she was sitting It was one of those capable of rolling back and forth along the instrument panels filled with knobs and switches and blinking lights Overhead were the blackandwhite TV screens She was back in the Dogan Oxford Diem and Nhu are dead had only been a dream A dream within a dream if you pleased This was another but marginally better Most of the TV screens which had been showing pictures of Calla Bryn Sturgis the last time shed been here were now broadcasting either snow or testpatterns On one however was the nineteenthfloor corridor of the Plaza  Park Hotel The camera rolled down it toward the elevators and Susannah realized that these were Mias eyes she was looking through My eyesshe thought Her anger was thin but she sensed it could be fed Wouldhave to be fed if she was ever to regard the unspeakable thing shed seen in her dream The thing in the corner of her Oxford jail cell The thing in the bowl of blood Theyre my eyes She hijacked them thats all Another TV screen showed Mia arriving in the elevator lobby examining the buttons and then pushing the one marked with the DOWN arrowWere off to see the midwife Susannah thought looking grimly up at the screen and then barked a short humorless laughOh were off to see the midwife the wonderful midwife of Oz Because because because because beCAUZZZBecause of the wonderful things she does Here were the dials shed reset at some considerable inconvenience  hellpain EMOTIONAL TEMP still at  The toggleswitch marked CHAP still turned to ASLEEP and in the monitor above it the chap thus still in blackandwhite like everything else no sign of those disquieting blue eyes The absurd LABOR FORCE ovendial was still at  but she saw that most of the lights which had been amber the last time shed been in this room had now turned red There were more cracks in the floor and the ancient dead soldier in the corner had lost his head the increasingly heavy vibration of the machinery had toppled the skull from the top of its spine and it now laughed up at the fluorescent lights in the ceiling The needle on the SUSANNAHMIO readout had reached the end of the yellow zone as Susannah watched it edged into the red Danger danger Diem and Nhu are dead Papa Doc Duvalier is dead Jackie Kennedy is dead She tried the controls one after another confirming what she already knew they were locked in place Mia might not have been able to change the settings in the first place but locking things up once those settings were to her liking That much she had been able to do There was a crackle and squall from the overhead speakers loud enough to make her jump Then coming to her through heavy bursts of static Eddies voice SuzeayEar me Burnay Do it beforeeverposedid Do you hear me On the screen she thought of as MiaVision the doors of the central elevator car opened The hijacking mommybitch got on Susannah barely noticed She snatched up the microphone and pushed the toggleswitch on the side Eddie she shouted Im in  The girls walk around with their bellies showing and their brastraps   Christ what was she blathering on about She made a mighty effort to sweep her mind clear Eddie I dont understand you Say it again sugar For a moment there was nothing but more static plus the occasional spooky wail of feedback She was about to try the mike again when Eddies voice returned this time a little clearer Burn upday JakePere Calhold on Burnbefore sheto wherever shehave the kid If youknowledge I hear you I acknowledge that much she cried She was clutching the silver mike so tightly that it trembled in her grasp Im in  June of  But Im not understanding you as well as I need to sug Say again and tell me if youre all right But Eddie was gone After calling for him half a dozen times and getting nothing but that blur of static she set the microphone down again and tried to figure out what he had been trying to tell her Trying also to set aside her joy just in knowing that Eddie could still try to tell heranything Burn up day she said That part at least had come through loud and clear Burn upthe day As in kill some time She thought that almost had to be right Eddie wanted Susannah to slow Mia down Maybe because Jake and Pere Callahan were coming About that part she wasnt so sure and she didnt much like it anyway Jake was a gunslinger all right but he was also only a kid And Susannah had an idea that the Dixie Pig was full of very nasty people Meanwhile on MiaVision the elevator doors were opening again The hijacking mommybitch had reached the lobby For the time being Susannah put Eddie Jake and Pere Callahan out of her mind She was recalling how Mia had refused tocome forward even when their SusannahMio legs were threatening to disappear right out from under their shared SusannahMio body Because she was to misquote some old poem or other alone and afraid in a world she never made Because she wasshy And my goodness things in the lobby of the Plaza  Park had changed while the hijacking mommybitch had been upstairs waiting for her phone call They had changed alot Susannah leaned forward with her elbows propped on the edge of the Dogans main instrument panel and her chin propped on the palms of her hands This might be interesting Seven Mia stepped out of the elevator then attempted to step right back in She thumped against the doors instead and hard enough to make her teeth come together with a little ivory click She looked around bewildered at first not sure how it was that the little descending room had disappeared Susannah What happened to it No answer from the darkskinned woman whose face she now wore but Mia discovered she didnt actually need one She could see the place where the door slid in and out If she pushed the button the door would probably open again but she had to conquer her sudden strong desire to go back up to Room  Her business there was done Herreal business was somewhere beyond the lobby doors She looked toward those doors with the sort of lipbiting dismay which may escalate into panic at a single rough word or angry look Shed been upstairs for a little over an hour and during that time the lobbys earlyafternoon lull had ended Half a dozen taxis from La Guardia and Kennedy had pulled up in front of the hotel at roughly the same time so had a Japanese tourbus from Newark Airport The tour had originated in Sapporo and consisted of fifty couples with reservations at the Plaza  Park Now the lobby was rapidly filling with chattering people Most had dark slanted eyes and shiny black hair and were wearing oblong objects around their necks on straps Every now and then one would raise one of these objects and point it at someone else There would be a brilliant flash laughter and cries ofDomo Domo There were three lines forming at the desk The beautiful woman whod checked Mia in during quieter times had been joined by two other clerks all of them working like mad The highceilinged lobby echoed with laughter and mingled conversation in some strange tongue that sounded to Mia like the twittering of birds The banks of mirrorglass added to the general confusion by making the lobby seem twice as full as it actually was Mia cringed back wondering what to do Front yelled a desk clerk and banged a bell The sound seemed to shoot across Mias confused thoughts like a silver arrow Front please A grinning man  black hair slicked against his skull yellow skin slanting eyes behind round spectacles  came rushing up to Mia holding one of the oblong flashthings Mia steeled herself to kill him if he attacked Ahyoo takea pickcha me and my wife Offering her the flashthing Wanting her to take it from him Mia cringed away wondering if it ran on radiation if the flashes might hurt her baby Susannah What do I do No answer Of course not she really couldnt expect Susannahs help after what had just happened but The grinning man was still thrusting the flashmachine at her He looked a trifle puzzled but mostly undaunted Yooo takeah pickcha preese And put the oblong thing in her hand He stepped back and put his arm around a lady who looked exactly like him except for her shiny black hair which was cut across her forehead in what Mia thought of as a wenchclip Even the round glasses were the same No Mia said No cry pardonno The panic was very close now and very bright whirling and gibbering right in front of her yooo takeah pickcha we killah baby and Mias impulse was to drop the oblong flasher on the floor That might break it however and release the deviltry that powered the flashes She put it down carefully instead smiling apologetically at the astonished Japanese couple the man still had his arm around his wife and hurried across the lobby in the direction of the little shop Even the piano music had changed instead of the former soothing melodies it was pounding out something jagged and dissonant a kind of musical headache I need a shirt because theres blood on this one Ill get the shirt and then Ill go to the Dixie Pig Sixtyfirst and LexingworthLexingtonI mean Lexing tonand then Ill have my baby Ill have my baby and all this confusion will end Ill think of how I was afraid and Ill laugh But the shop was also full Japanese women examined souvenirs and twittered to each other in their birdlanguage while they waited for their husbands to get them checked in Mia could see a counter stacked with shirts but there were women all around it examining them And there was another line at the counter Susannah what should I do Youve got to help me No answer She was in there Mia could feel her but she would not helpAnd really she thoughtwould I if I were in her position Well perhaps she would Someone would have to offer her the right inducement of course but  The only inducement I want from you is the truthSusannah said coldly Someone brushed against Mia as she stood in the door to the shop and she turned her hands coming up If it was an enemy or some enemy of her chap she would claw his eyes out Solly said a smiling blackhaired woman Like the man she was holding out one of the oblong flashthings In the middle was a circular glass eye that stared at Mia She could see her own face in it small and dark and bewildered You take pickcha preese Take pickcha me and my fliend Mia had no idea what the woman was saying or what she wanted or what the flashmakers were supposed to do She only knew that there were too many people they were everywhere this was a madhouse Through the shop window she could see that the front of the hotel was likewise thronged There were yellow cars and long black cars with windows you couldnt look into although the people inside could doubtless look out and a huge silver conveyance that sat rumbling at the curb Two men in green uniforms were in the street blowing silver whistles Somewhere close by something began to rattle loudly To Mia who had never heard a jackhammer it sounded like a speedshooter gun but no one outside was throwing himself to the sidewalk no one even looked alarmed How was she supposed to get to the Dixie Pig on her own Richard P Sayre had said he was sure Susannah could help her find it but Susannah had fallen stubbornly silent and Mia herself was on the verge of losing control entirely Then Susannah spoke up again If I help you a little now  get you to a quiet place where you can catch your breath and at least do something about your shirt  will you give me some straight answers About what About the baby Mia And about the mother About you I did I dont think so I dont think youre any more elemental thanwell than I am I want the truth Why I want the truthSusannah repeated and then fell silent refusing to respond to any more of Mias questions And when yet another grinning little man approached her with yet another flashthing Mias nerve broke Right now just getting across the hotel lobby looked like more than she could manage on her own how was she supposed to get all the way to this Dixie Pig place After so many years in Fedic Discordia the Castle on the Abyss to be among so many people made her feel like screaming And after all why not tell the darkskinned woman what little she knew She  Mia daughter of none mother of one  was firmly in charge What harm in a little truthtelling All rightshe saidIll do as you ask Susannah or Odetta or whoever you are Just help me Get me out of here Susannah Deancame forward Eight There was a womens restroom adjacent to the hotel bar around the corner from the piano player Two of the yellowskinned blackhaired ladies with the tipped eyes were at the basins one washing her hands the other fixing her hair both of them twittering in their birdylingo Neither paid any attention to thekokujin lady who went past them and to the stalls A moment later they left her in blessed silence except for the faint music drifting down from the overhead speakers Mia saw how the latch worked and engaged it She was about to sit down on the toilet seat when Susannah saidTurn it inside out What The shirt woman Turn it inside out for your fathers sake For a moment Mia didnt She was too stunned The shirt was a roughwoven callumka the sort of simple pullover favored by both sexes in the ricegrowing country during cooler weather It had what Odetta Holmes would have called a boatneck No buttons so yes it could very easily be turned inside out but  Susannah clearly impatientAre you going to stand there commalamoon all day Turn it inside out And tuck it into your jeans this time WWhy Itll give you a different lookSusannah replied promptly but that wasnt the reason What she wanted was a look at herself below the waist If her legs were Mias then they were quite probably white legs She was fascinated and a little sickened by the idea that she had become a kind of tutone halfbreed Mia paused a moment longer fingertips rubbing the rough weave of the shirt above the worst of the bloodstains which was over her left breast Over her heart Turn it inside out In the lobby a dozen halfbaked ideas had gone through her head using the scrimshaw turtle to fascinate the people in the shop had probably been the only one even close to workable but simply turning the damned thing inside out hadnt been one of them Which only showed she supposed how close to total panic she had been But now Did she need Susannah for the brief time she would be in this overcrowded and disorienting city which was so different from the quiet rooms of the castle and the quiet streets of Fedic Just to get from here to Sixtyfirst Street and Lexingworth Lexington said the woman trapped inside herLexing tonYou keep forgetting that dont you Yes Yes she did And there was no reason to forget such a simple thing maybe she hadnt been to Morehouse Morehouse or no house but she wasnt stupid So why  Whatshe demanded suddenlyWhat are you smiling about Nothingsaid the woman insidebut she was still smiling Almost grinning Mia could feel it and she didnt like it Upstairs in Room  Susannah had been screaming at her in a mixture of terror and fury accusing Mia of betraying the man she loved and the one she followed Which had been true enough to make Mia ashamed She didnt enjoy feeling that way but shed liked the woman inside better when she was howling and crying and totally discombobulated The smile made her nervous This version of the brownskinned woman was trying to turn the tables on her maybe thought shehad turned the tables Which was impossible of course she was under the protection of the King but Tell me why youre smiling Oh it dont amount to muchSusannah said only now she sounded like the other one whose name was Detta Mia did more than dislike that one She was a little afraid of that oneIts just that there was this fella named Sigmund Freud honeychile  honky muhfuh but not stupid And he said that when someone always be fgittin sumpin might be because that person wantto be fgittin it Thats stupidMia said coldly Beyond the stall where she was having this mental conversation the door opened and two more ladies came in  no at least three and maybe four  twittering in their birdylanguage and giggling in a way that made Mia clamp her teeth togetherWhy would I want to forget the place where theyre waiting to help me have my baby Well dis Freud  dis smart cigarsmoking Viennese honky muhfuh  he claim dat we got dis

at the basins the birdywomen laughed so shrilly that Mia felt her eyeballs shiver and threaten to liquefy in their sockets She wanted to rush out and seize their heads and drive them into the mirrors wanted to do it again and again until their blood was splashed all the way up to the ceiling and theirbrains  Temper tempersaid the woman inside and now it sounded like Susannah again She lies That bitch LIES NoSusannah replied and the conviction in that single short word was enough to send an arrow of fear into Mias heartShe says whats on her mind no argument there but she doesnt lie Go on Mia turn your shirt inside out With a final eyewatering burst of laughter the birdywomen left the bathroom Mia pulled the shirt off over her head baring Susannahs breasts which were the color of coffee with just the smallest splash of milk added in Her nipples which had always been as small as berries were now much larger Nipples craving a mouth There were only the faintest maroon spots on the inside of the shirt Mia put it back on then unbuttoned the front of her jeans so she could tuck it in Susannah stared fascinated at the point just above her pubic thatch Here her skin lightened to a color that might have been milk with the smallest splash of coffee added in Below were the white legs of the woman shed met on the castle allure Susannah knew that if Mia lowered her jeans all the way shed see the scabbed and scratched shins she had already observed as Mia  thereal Mia  looked out over Discordia toward the red glow marking the castle of the King Something about this frightened Susannah terribly and after a moments consideration it took no longer the reason came to her If Mia had only replaced those parts of her legs that Odetta Holmes had lost to the subway train when Jack Mort pushed her onto the tracks she would have been white only from the knees or so down But herthighs were white too and her groin area was turning What strange lycanthropy was this De bodystealin kindDetta replied cheerfullyPretty soon you be havin a white bellywhite breasswhite neckwhite cheeks Stop itSusannah warned but when had Detta Walker ever listened to her warnings Hers or anybodys And den las of all you have a whitebraingirl A Mia brain And wont dat be fahn Sho You be all Mia den Nobody give you no shit if you want to ride right up front on de bus Then the shirt was drawn over her hips the jeans were again buttoned up Mia sat down on the toilet ring that way In front of her scrawled on the door was this graffito BANGO SKANK AWAITS THE KING Who is this Bango SkankMia asked I have no idea I thinkIt was hard but Mia forced herselfI think I owe you a word of thanks Susannahs response was cold and immediateThank me with the truth First tell me why youd help me at all after I This time Mia couldnt finish She liked to think of herself as brave  as brave as she had to be in the service of her chap at least  but this time she couldnt finish After you betrayed the man I love to men who are when you get right down to it footsoldiers of the Crimson King After you decided it would be all right for them to kill mine so long as you could keep yours Is that what you want to know Mia hated to hear it spoken of that way but bore itHad to bear it Yes lady if you like It was the other one who replied this time in that voice  harsh cawing laughing triumphant and hateful  that was even worse than the shrill laughter of the birdywomen Worse by far Because mah boys got away dass why Fucked those honkies mos righteous The ones dey didnt shoot all blowed to smithereens Mia felt a deep stirring of unease Whether it was true or not the bad laughing woman clearlybelieved it was true And if Roland and Eddie Dean were still out there wasnt it possible the Crimson King wasnt as strong as allpowerful as she had been told Wasnt it even possible that shehad been misled about  Stop it stop it you cant think that way Theres another reason I helpedThe harsh one was gone and the other was back At least for now What Its my baby tooSusannah saidI dont want it killed I dont believe you But she did Because the woman inside was right Mordred Deschain of Gilead and Discordia belonged to both of them The bad one might not care but the other Susannah clearly felt the chaps tidal pull And if she was right about Sayre and whoever waited for her at the Dixie Pigif they were liars and cozeners Stop it Stop I have nowhere else to go but to them You doSusannah said quicklyWith Black Thirteen you can go anywhere You dont understand Hed follow me Followit Youre right Idontunderstand She actually did orthought she did butBurn up the dayhed said All right Ill try to explain I dont understand everything myself  there are things I dont know  but Ill tell you what I can Thank y  Before she could finish Susannah was falling again like Alice down the rabbithole Through the toilet through the floor through the pipes beneath the floor and into another world Nine No castle at the end of her drop not this time Roland had told them a few stories of his wandering years  the vampire nurses and little doctors of Eluria the walking waters of East Downe and of course the story of his doomed first love  and this was a little like falling into one of those tales Or perhaps into one of the oatoperas adult Westerns as they were called on the still relatively new ABCTV networkSugarfoot with Ty HardinMaverick with James Garner or  Odetta Holmess personal favorite  Cheyennestarring Clint Walker Odetta had once written a letter to ABC programming suggesting they could simultaneously break new ground and open up a whole new audience if they did a series about a wandering Negro cowboy in the years after the Civil War She never got an answer She supposed writing the letter in the first place had been ridiculous a waste of time There was a livery stable with a sign out front reading TACK MENDED CHEAP  The sign over the hotel promised QUIET ROOMS GUD BEDS  There were at least five saloons Outside one of them a rusty robot that ran on squalling treads turned its bulb head back and forth blaring a comeon to the empty town from the hornshaped speaker in the center of its rudimentary face Girls girlsgirls Some are humie and some are cybie but who cares you cant tell the difference they do what you want without complaint wont is not in their voCABulary they give satisfaction with every action Girls girls girls Some are cybie some are real you cant tell the difference when you cop a feel They do what you want They want whatyou want Walking beside Susannah was the beautiful young white woman with the swollen belly scratched legs and shoulderlength black hair Now as they walked below the gaudy false front of THE FEDIC GOODTIME SALOON BAR AND DANCE EMPORIUM  she was wearing a faded plaid dress which advertised her advanced state of pregnancy in a way that made it seem freakish almost a sign of the apocalypse Thehuaraches of the castle allure had been replaced by scuffed and battered shorboots Both of them were wearing shorboots and the heels clumped hollowly on the boardwalk From one of the deserted barrooms farther along came the herkyjerky jazz of a jagtime tune and a snatch of some old poem came to SusannahA bunch of the boys were whooping it up in the Malamute Saloon She looked over the batwing doors and was not in the least surprised to see the words SERVICES MALAMUTE SALOON  She slowed long enough to peer over the batwing doors and saw a chrome piano playing itself dusty keys popping up and down just a mechanical musicbox no doubt built by the everpopular North Central Positronics entertaining a room that was empty except for a dead robot and in the far corner two skeletons working through the process of final decomposition the one that would take them from bone to dust Farther along at the end of the towns single street loomed the castle wall It was so high and so wide it blotted out most of the sky Susannah abruptly knocked her fist against the side of her head Then she held her hands out in front of her and snapped her fingers What are you doing Mia asked Tell me I beg Making sure Im here Physically here You are So it seems But how can that be Mia shook her head indicating that she didnt know On this at least Susannah was inclined to believe her There was no dissenting word from Detta either This isnt what I expected Susannah said looking around Its not what I expected at all Nay asked her companion and without much interest Mia was moving in that awkward but strangely endearing duckfooted waddle that seems to best suit women in the last stages of their carry And what was it ye did expect Susannah Something more medieval I guess More like that She pointed at the castle Mia shrugged as if to say take it or leave it and then said Is the other one with you The nasty one Detta she meant Of course Shes always with me Shes a part of me just as your chap is a part of you Although how Mia could be pregnant when it had been Susannah who caught the fuck was something Susannah was still dying to know Ill soon be delivered of mine Mia said Will ya never be delivered of yours I thought I was Susannah said truthfully She came back Mostly I think to deal with you I hate her I know And Susannah knew more Mia feared Detta as well Feared her bigbig If she speaks our palaver ends Susannah shrugged She comes when she comes and speaks when she speaks She doesnt ask my permission Ahead of them on this side of the street was an arch with a sign above it FEDIC STATION MONO PATRICIA DISCONTINUED THUMBPRINT READER INOPERATIVE SHOW TICKET NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS THANKS YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE The sign didnt interest Susannah as much as the two things that lay on the filthy station platform beyond it a childs doll decayed to little more than a head and one floppy arm and beyond it a grinning mask Although the mask appeared to be made of steel a good deal of it seemed to have rotted like flesh The teeth poking out of the grin were canine fangs The eyes were glass Lenses Susannah felt sure no doubt also crafted by North Central Positronics Surrounding the mask were a few shreds and tatters of green cloth what had undoubtedly once been this things hood Susannah had no trouble putting together the remains of the doll and the remains of the Wolf her mamma as Detta sometimes liked to tell folks especially horny boys in roadhouse parking lots didnt raise no fools This is where they brought them she said Where the Wolves brought the twins they stole from Calla Bryn Sturgis Where they  what  operated on them Not just from Calla Bryn Sturgis Mia said indifferently but aye And once the babbies were here they were taken there A place youll also recognize Ive no doubt She pointed across Fedics single street and farther up The last building before the castle wall abruptly ended the town was a long Quonset hut with sides of filthy corrugated metal and a rusty curved roof The windows running along the side Susannah could see had been boarded up Also along that side was a steel hitching rail To it were tied what looked like seventy horses all of them gray Some had fallen over and lay with their legs sticking straight out One or two had turned their heads toward the womens voices and then seemed to freeze in that position It was very unhorselike behavior but of course these werent real horses They were robots or cyborgs or whichever one of Rolands terms you might like to use Many of them seemed to have run down or worn out In front of this building was a sign on a rusting steel plate It read NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS LTD Fedic Headquarters Arc  Experimental Station Maximum Security VERBAL ENTRY CODE REQUIRED EYEPRINT REQUIRED Its another Dogan isnt it Susannah asked Well yes and no Mia said Its the Dogan of all Dogans actually Where the Wolves brought the children Aye and will bring them again Mia said For the Kings work will go forward after this disturbance raised by your friend the gunslinger is past I have no doubt of it Susannah looked at her with real curiosity How can you speak so cruel and yet be so serene she asked They bring children here and scoop out their heads likelike gourds Children whove harmed nobody What they send back are great galumphing idiots who grow to their full size in agony and often die in much the same way Would you be so sanguine Mia ifyour child was borne away across one of those saddles shrieking for you and holding out his arms Mia flushed but was able to meet Susannahs gaze Each must follow the road upon which ka has set her feet Susannah of New York Mine is to bear my chap and raise him and thus end your dinns quest And his life Its wonderful how everyone seems to think they know just what ka means for them Susannah said Dont you think thats wonderful I think youre trying to make jest of me because you fear Mia said levelly If such makes you feel better than aye have on She spread her arms and made a little sarcastic bow over her great belly They had stopped on the boardwalk in front of a shop advertising MILLINERY  LADIES WEAR and across from the Fedic Dogan Susannah thoughtBurn up the day dont forget thats the other part of your job here Kill time Keep the oddity of a body we now seem to share in that womens restroom just as long as you possibly can Im not making fun Susannah said Im only asking you to put yourself in the place of all those other mothers Mia shook her head angrily her inky hair flying around her ears and brushing at her shoulders I did not make their fate lady nor did they make mine Ill save my tears thank you Would you hear my tale or not Yes please Then let us sit for my legs are sorely tired Ten In the GinPuppie Saloon a few rickety storefronts back in the direction from which theyd come they found chairs which would still bear their weight but neither woman had any taste for the saloon itself which smelled of dusty death They dragged the chairs out to the boardwalk where Mia sat with an audible sigh of relief Soon she said Soon you shall be delivered Susannah of New York and so shall I Maybe but I dont understand any of this Least of all why youre rushing to this guy Sayre when you must know he serves the Crimson King Hush Mia said She sat with her legs apart and her huge belly rising before her looking out across the empty street Twas a man of the King who gave me a chance to fulfill the only destiny ka ever left me Not Sayre but one much greater than he Someone to whom Sayre answers A man named Walter Susannah started at the name of Rolands ancient nemesis Mia looked at her gave her a grim smile You know the name I see Well maybe thatll save some talk Gods know theres been far too much talk for my taste already its not what I was made for I was made to bear my chap and raise him no more than that And no less Susannah offered no reply Killing was supposedly her trade killing time her current chore but in truth she had begun to find Mias singlemindedness a trifle tiresome Not to mention frightening As if picking this thought up Mia said I am what I am and I am content wi it If others are not whats that to me Spit on em Spoken like Detta Walker at her feistiestSusannah thought but made no reply It seemed safer to remain quiet After a pause Mia went on Yet Id be lying if I didnt say that being here brings backcertain memories Yar And unexpectedly she laughed Just as unexpectedly the sound was beautiful and melodic Tell your tale Susannah said This time tell me all of it We have time before the labor starts again Do you say so I do Tell me For a few moments Mia just looked out at the street with its dusty cover of oggan and its air of sad and ancient abandonment As Susannah waited for storytime to commence she for the first time became aware of the still shadeless quality to Fedic She could see everything very well and there was no moon in the sky as on the castle allure but she still hesitated to call this daytime Itsnotime a voice inside her whispered  she knew not whoseThis is a place between Susannah a place where shadows are cancelled and time holds its breath Then Mia told her tale It was shorter than Susannah had expected shorter than she wanted given Eddies abjuration to burn up the day but it explained a great deal More actually than Susannah had hoped for She listened with growing rage and why not She had been more than raped that day in the ring of stones and bones it seemed She had been robbed as well  the strangest robbery to which any woman had ever been subject And it was still going on Eleven Look out there may it do ya fine said the bigbellied woman sitting beside Susannah on the boardwalk Look out and see Mia before she gained her name Susannah looked into the street At first she saw nothing but a castoff waggonwheel a splintered and longdry watering trough and a starry silver thing that looked like the lost rowel from some cowpokes spur Then slowly a misty figure formed It was that of a nude woman Her beauty was blinding  even before she had come fully into view Susannah knew that Her age was any Her black hair brushed her shoulders Her belly was flat her navel a cunning cup into which any man who ever loved women would be happy to dip his tongue Susannah or perhaps it was Detta thoughtHell I could dip my own Hidden between the ghostwomans thighs was a cunning cleft Here was a different tidal pull Thats me when I came here said the pregnant version sitting beside Susannah She spoke almost like a woman who is showing slides of her vacationThats me at the Grand Canyon thats me in Seattle thats me at Grand Coulee Dam thats me on the Fedic high street do it please ya The pregnant woman was also beautiful but not in the same eerie way as the shade in the street The pregnant woman looked a certain age for instance  late twenties  and her face had been marked by experience Much of it painful I said I was an elemental  the one who made love to your dinh  but that was a lie As I think you suspected I lied not out of hope of gain but onlyI dont knowfrom a kind of wishfulness I suppose I wanted the baby to be mine that way too   Yours from the start Aye from the start  you say true They watched the nude woman walk up the street arms swinging muscles of her long back flexing hips swaying from side to side in that eternal breathless clock of motion She left no tracks on the oggan I told you that the creatures of the invisible world were left behind when thePrim receded Most died as fishes and seaanimals will when cast up on a beach and left to strangle in the alien air But there are always some who adapt and I was one of those unfortunates I wandered far and wide and whenever I found men in the wastes I took on the form you see Like a model on a runway one who has forgotten to actually put on the latest Paris fashion shes supposed to be displaying the woman in the street pivoted on the balls of her feet buttocks tensing with lovely silken ease creating momentary crescentshaped hollows She began to walk back the eyes just below the straight cut of her bangs fixed on some distant horizon her hair swinging beside ears that were without other ornament When I found someone with a prick I fucked him Mia said That much I had in common with the demon elemental who first tried to have congress with your soh and then did have congress with your dinh and that also accounts for my lie I suppose And I found your dinh passing fair The tiniest bit of greed roughened her voice as she said this The Detta in Susannah found it sexy The Detta in Susannah bared her lips in a grin of gruesome understanding I fucked them and if they couldnt break free I fucked them to death MatteroffactAfter the Grand Coulee we went to Yosemite Would you tell your dinh something for me Susannah If you see him again Aye if you like Once he knew a man  a bad man  named Amos Depape brother of the Roy Depape who ran with Eldred Jonas in Mejis Your dinh believes Amos Depape was stung to death by a snake and in a way he wasbut the snake was me Susannah said nothing I didnt fuck them for sex I didnt fuck them to kill them although I didnt care when they died and their pricks finally wilted out of me like melting icicles In truth I didnt knowwhy I was fucking them until I came here to Fedic In those early days there were still men and women here the Red Death hadnt come do ye ken The crack in the earth beyond town was there but the bridge over it still stood strong and true Those folk were stubborn trying not to let go even when the rumors that Castle Discordia was haunted began The trains still came although on no regular schedule   The children Susannah asked The twins She paused The Wolves Nay all of that was two dozen centuries later Or more But hear me now there was one couple in Fedic who had ababy Youve no idea Susannah of New York how rare and wonderful that was in those days when most folk were as sterile as the elementals themselves and those who werent more often than not produced either slow mutants or monsters so terrible they were killed by their parents if they took more than a single breath Most of them didnt Butthis baby She clasped her hands Her eyes shone It was round and pink and unblemished by so much as a portwine stain  perfect  and I knew after a single look what Id been made for I wasnt fucking for the sex of it or because in coitus I was almost mortal or because it brought death to most of my partners but to have a baby like theirs Like their Michael She lowered her head slightly and said I would have taken him you know Would have gone to the man fucked him until he was crazy then whispered in his ear that he should kill his molly And when shed gone to the clearing at the end of the path I would have fucked him dead and the baby  that beautiful little pink baby  would have been mine Dyou see Yes Susannah said She felt faintly sick In front of them in the middle of the street the ghostly woman made yet another turn and started back again Farther down the hucksterrobot honked out his seemingly eternal spielGirls girls girls Some are humie and some are cybie but who cares you cant tell the difference I discovered I couldnt go near them Mia said It was as though a magic circle had been drawn around them It was the baby I suppose Then came the plague The Red Death Some folks said something had been opened in the castle some jar of demonstuff that should have been left shut forever Others said the plague came out of the crack  what they called the Devils Arse Either way it was the end of life in Fedic life on the edge of Discordia Many left on foot or in waggons Baby Michael and his parents stayed hoping for a train Each day I waited for them to sicken  for the red spots to show on the babys dear cheeks and fat little arms  but they never did none of the three sickened Perhaps theywere in a magic circle I think they must have been And a train came It was Patricia The mono Do ya ken   Yes Susannah said She knew all she wanted to about Blaines companion mono Once upon a time her route must have taken her over here as well as to Lud Aye They got on I watched from the station platform weeping my unseen tears and wailing my unseen cries They got on with their sweet wee oneonly by then he was three or four years old walking and talking And they went I tried to follow them and Susannah I could not I was a prisoner here Knowing my purpose was what made me so Susannah wondered about that but decided not to comment Years and decades and centuries went by In Fedic there were by then only the robots and the unburied bodies left over from the Red Death turning to skeletons then to dust Then men came again but I didnt dare go near them because they werehis men She paused Itsmen The Crimson Kings Aye they with the endlessly bleeding holes on their foreheads They went there She pointed to the Fedic Dogan  the Arc  Experimental Station And soon their accursed machines were running again just as if they still believed that machines could hold up the world Not ye ken that holding it up is what they want to do No no not they They brought in beds   Beds Susannah said startled Beyond them the ghostly woman in the street rose once more on the balls of her feet and made yet one more graceful pirouette Aye for the children although this was still long years before the Wolves began to bring em here and long before you were part of your dinhs story Yet that time did draw nigh and Walter came to me Can you make that woman in the street disappear Susannah asked abruptly and rather crossly I know shes a version of you I get the idea but she makes meI dont knownervous Can you make her go away Aye if you like Mia pursed her lips and blew The disturbingly beautiful woman  the spirit without a name  disappeared like smoke For several moments Mia was quiet once more gathering the threads of her story Then she said Waltersaw me Not like other men Even the ones I fucked to death only saw what they wanted to see Or whatI wanted them to see She smiled in unpleasant reminiscence I made some of them die thinking they were fucking their own mothers You should have seen their faces Then the smile faded But Waltersaw me What did he look like Hard to tell Susannah He wore a hood and inside it he grinned  such a grinning man he was  and he palavered with me There She pointed toward the Fedic GoodTime Saloon with a finger that trembled slightly No mark on his forehead though Nay Im sure not for hes not one of what Pere Callahan calls the low men Their job is the Breakers The Breakers and no more Susannah began to feel the anger then although she tried not to show it Mia had access to all her memories which meant all the inmost workings and secrets of their katet It was like discovering youd had a burglar in the house who had tried on your underwear as well as stealing your money and going through your most personal papers It was awful Walter is I suppose what youd call the Crimson Kings Prime Minister He often travels in disguise and is known in other worlds under other names but always he is a grinning laughing man   I met him briefly Susannah said under the name of Flagg I hope to meet him again If you truly knew him youd wish for no such thing The Breakers you spoke of  where are they WhyThunderclap doee not know The shadowlands Why do you ask No reason but curiosity Susannah said and seemed to hear EddieAsk any question shell answer Burn up the day Give us a chance to catch up She hoped Mia couldnt read her thoughts when they were separated like this If she could they were all likely up shit creek without a paddle Lets go back to Walter Can we speak of him a bit Mia signaled a weary acceptance that Susannah didnt quite believe How long had it been since Mia had had an ear for any tale she might care to tell The answer Susannah guessed was probably never And the questions Susannah was asking the doubts she was articulatingsurely some of them must have passed through Mias own head Theyd be banished quickly as the blasphemies they were but still come on this was not a stupid woman Unless obsessionmade you stupid Susannah supposed a case could be made for that idea Susannah Bumbler got your tongue No I was just thinking what a relief it must have been when he came to you Mia considered that then smiled Smiling changed her made her look girlish and artless and shy Susannah had to remind herself that wasnt a look she could trust Yes It was Of course it was After discovering your purpose and being trapped here by itafter seeing the Wolves getting ready to store the kids and then operate on themafter all that Walter comes The devil in fact but at least he can see you At least he can hear your sad tale And he makes you an offer He said the Crimson King would give me a child Mia said and put her hands gently against the great globe of her belly My Mordred whose time has come round at last Twelve Mia pointed again at the Arc  Experimental Station What she had called the Dogan of Dogans The last remnant of her smile lingered on her lips but there was no happiness or real amusement in it now Her eyes were shiny with fear and  perhaps  awe Thats where they changed me made me mortal Once there were many such places  there must have been  but Id set my watch and warrant thats the only one left in all of InWorld MidWorld or EndWorld Its a place both wonderful and terrible And it was there I was taken I dont understand what you mean Susannah was thinking of her Dogan Which was of course based onJakes Dogan It was certainly a strange place with its flashing lights and multiple TV screens but not frightening Beneath it are passages which go under the castle Mia said At the end of one is a door that opens on the Calla side of Thunderclap just under the last edge of the darkness Thats the one the Wolves use when they go on their raids Susannah nodded That explained a lot Do they take the kiddies back the same way Nay lady do it please you like many doors the one that takes the Wolves from Fedic to the Calla side of Thunderclap goes in only one direction When youre on the other side its no longer there Because its not amagic door right Mia smiled and nodded and patted her knee Susannah looked at her with mounting excitement Its another twinthing Do you say so Yes Only this time Tweedledum and Tweedledee are science and magic Rational and irrational Sane and insane No matter what terms you pick thats a doubledamned pair if ever there was one Aye Do you say so YesMagic doors  like the one Eddie found and you took me through to New York  go both ways The doors North Central Positronics made to replace them when thePrim receded and the magic fadedthey go only one way Have I got that right I think so aye Maybe they didnt have time to figure out how to make teleportation a twolane highway before the world moved on In any case the Wolves go to the Calla side of Thunderclap by door and come back to Fedic by train Right Mia nodded Susannah no longer thought she was just trying to kill time This information might come in handy later on And after the Kings men Peres low men have scooped the kids brains what then Back through the door with them I suppose  the one under the castle Back to the Wolves staging point And a train takes them the rest of the way home Aye Why do they bother takin em back at all Lady I know not Then Mias voice dropped Theres another door under Castle Discordia Another door in the rooms of ruin One that goes She licked her lips That goes todash TodashI know the word but I dont understand whats so bad   There are endless worlds your dinh is correct about that but even when those worlds are close together  like some of the multiple New Yorks  there are endless spaces between Think ya of the spaces between the inner and outer walls of a house Places where its always dark But just because a place is always dark doesnt mean its empty Does it Susannah There are monsters in the todash darkness Who had said that Roland She couldnt remember for sure and what did it matter She thought she understood what Mia was saying and if so it was horrible Rats in the walls SusannahBats in the walls All sorts of sucking biting bugs in the walls Stop it I get the picture That door beneath the castle  one of their mistakes I have no doubt  goes tonowhere at all Into the darkness between worlds Todashspace But not empty space Her voice lowered further That door is reserved for the Red Kings most bitter enemies Theyre thrown into a darkness where they may exist  blind wandering insane  for years But in the end something always finds them and devours them Monsters beyond the ability of such minds as ours to bear thought of Susannah found herself trying to picture such a door and what waited behind it She didnt want to but couldnt help it Her mouth dried up In that same low and somehow horrible tone of confidentiality Mia said There were many places where the old people tried to join magic and science together but yon may be the only one left She nodded toward the Dogan It was there that Walter took me to make me mortal and take me out ofPrim s way forever To make me like you Thirteen Mia didnt know everything but so far as Susannah could make out WalterFlagg had offered the spirit later to be known as Mia the ultimate Faustian bargain If she was willing to give up her nearly eternal but discorporate state and become a mortal woman then she could become pregnant and bear a child Walter was honest with her about how little she would actually be getting for all shed be giving up The baby wouldnt grow as normal babies did  as Baby Michael had done before Mias unseen but worshipful eyes  and she might only have him for seven years but oh what wonderful years they could be Beyond this Walter had been tactfully silent allowing Mia to form her own pictures how she would nurse her baby and wash him not neglecting the tender creases behind the knees and ears how she would kiss him in the honeyspot between the unfledged wings of his shoulderblades how she would walk with him holding both of his hands in both of hers as he toddled how she would read to him and point out Old Star and Old Mother in the sky and tell him the story of how Rustie Sam stole the widows best loaf of bread how she would hug him to her and bathe his cheek with her grateful tears when he spoke his first word which would of course beMama Susannah listened to this rapturous account with a mixture of pity and cynicism Certainly Walter had done one hell of a job selling the idea to her and as ever the best way to do that was to let the mark sell herself Hed even proposed a properly Satanic period of proprietorship seven yearsJust sign on the dotted line madam and please dont mind that whiff of brimstone I just cant seem to get the smell out of my clothes Susannah understood the deal and still had trouble swallowing it This creature had given up immortality for morning sickness swollen and achy breasts and in the last six weeks of her carry the need to pee approximately every fifteen minutes And wait folks theres more Two and a half years of changing diapers soaked with piss and loaded with shit Of getting up in the night as the kid howls with the pain of cutting his first tooth and cheer up Mom only thirtyone to go That first magic spitup That first heartwarming spray of urine across the bridge of your nose when the kid lets go as youre changing his clout And yes there would be magic Even though shed never had a child herself Susannah knew there would be magic even in the dirty diapers and the colic if the child were the result of a loving union But to have the child and then have him taken away from you just when it was getting good just as the child approached what most people agreed was the age of reason responsibility and accountability To then be swept over the Crimson Kings red horizon That was an awful idea And was Mia so besotted by her impending motherhood that she didnt realize the little shehad been promised was now being whittled away WalterFlagg had come to her in Fedic Scenic Aftermath of the Red Death and promised her seven years with her son On the telephone in the PlazaPark however Richard Sayre had spoken of a mere five In any case Mia had agreed to the dark mans terms And really how much sport could there have been in getting her to do that Shed been made for motherhood had arisen from thePrim with that imperative had known it herself ever since seeing her first perfect human baby the boy Michael How could she have said no Even if the offer had only been for three years or for one how Might as well expect a longtime junkie to refuse a loaded spike when it was offered Mia had been taken into the Arc  Experimental Station Shed been given a tour by the smiling sarcastic and undoubtedly frightening Walter who sometimes called himself Walter of EndWorld and sometimes Walter of AllWorld Shed seen the great room filled with beds awaiting the children who would come to fill them at the head of each was a stainlesssteel hood attached to a segmented steel hose She did not like to think what the purpose of such equipment might be Shed also been shown some of the passages under the Castle on the Abyss and had been in places where the smell of death was strong and suffocating She  there had been a red darkness and she  Were you mortal by then Susannah asked It sounds as though maybe you were I was on my way she said It was a process Walter calledbecoming  All right Go on But here Mias recollections were lost in a dark fugue  not todash but far from pleasant A kind of amnesia and it wasred A color Susannah had come to distrust Had the pregnant womans transition from the world of the spirit to the world of the flesh  her trip to Mia  been accomplished through some other kind of doorway She herself didnt seem to know Only that there had been a time of darkness  unconsciousness she supposed  and then she had awakened as you see me Only not yet pregnant of course According to Walter Mia could not actually make a baby even as a mortal woman Carry yes Conceive no So it came to pass that one of the demon elementals had done a great service for the Crimson King taking Rolands seed as female and passing it on to Susannah as male And there had been another reason as well Walter hadnt mentioned it but Mia had known Its the prophecy she said looking into Fedics deserted and shadowless street Across the way a robot that looked like Andy of the Calla stood silent and rusting in front of the Fedic Caf which promisedGOOD MEELS CHEEP  What prophecy Susannah asked  He who ends the line of Eld shall conceive a child of incest with his sister or his daughter and the child will be marked by his red heel shall you know him It is he who shall stop the breath of the last warrior  WomanIm not Rolands sister or his daughter either You maybe didnt notice a small but basic difference in the color of our hides namely his beingwhite and mine beingblack  But she thought she had a pretty good idea of what the prophecy meant just the same Families were made in many ways Blood was only one of them Did he not tell you what dinh means Mia asked Of course It means leader If he was in charge of a whole country instead of just three scruffyass gunpuppies itd mean king Leader and king you say true Now Susannah will you tell me that such words arent just poor substitutes for another Susannah made no reply Mia nodded as though she had then winced when a fresh contraction struck It passed and she went on The sperm was Rolands I believe it may have been preserved somehow by the old peoples science while the demon elemental turned itself inside out and made man from woman but that isnt the important part The important part is that it lived and found the rest of itself as ordained by ka My egg Your egg When I was raped in the ring of stones Say true Susannah sat musing Finally she looked up Seem to me that its what I said before You didnt like it then not apt to like it now but  girl you just the babysitter There was no rage this time Mia only smiled Who went on having her periods even when she was being sick in the mornings You did And whos got the full belly todayI do If there was a babysitter Susannah of New York it was you How can that be Do you know Mia did Fourteen The baby Walter had told her would betransmitted to Mia sent to her cell by cell just as a fax is sent line by line Susannah opened her mouth to say she didnt know what a fax was then closed it again She understood thegist of what Mia was saying and that was enough to fill her with a terrible combination of awe and rage Shehad been pregnant She was in a real sense pregnant right this minute But the baby was being faxed sent to Mia Was this a process that had started fast and slowed down or started slow and speeded up The latter she thought because as time passed shed felt less pregnant instead of more The little swelling in her belly had mostly flattened out again And now she understood how both she and Mia could feel an equal attachment to the chap it did in fact belong to both of them Had been passed on like aa blood transfusion Only when they want to take your blood and put it into someone else they ask your permission If theyre doctors that is and not one of Pere Callahans vampires Youre a lot closer to one of those Mia arent you Science or magic Susannah asked Which one was it that allowed you to steal my baby Mia flushed a little at that but when she turned to Susannah she was able to meet Susannahs eyes squarely I dont know she said Likely a mixture of both And dont be so selfrighteous Its inme not you Its feeding off my bones and my blood not yours So what Do you think that changes anything You stole it with the help of some filthy magician Mia shook her head vehemently her hair a storm around her face No Susannah asked Then how comeyou werent the one eating frogs out of the swamp and shoats out of the pen and God knows what other nasty things How come you needed all that makebelieve nonsense about the banquets in the castle where you could pretend to be the one eating In short sugarpie how come your chaps nourishment had to go downmy throat Becausebecause Mias eyes Susannah saw were filling with tears Because this is spoiled land Blasted land The place of the Red Death and the edge of the Discordia Id not feed my chap from here It was a good answer Susannah reckoned but not thecomplete answer And Mia knew it too Because Baby Michael perfect Baby Michael had been conceived here had thrived here had been thriving when Mia last saw him And if she was so sure why were those tears standing in her eyes Mia theyre lying to you about your chap You dont know that so dont be hateful Ido know it And she did But there wasnt proof gods damn it How did you prove a feeling even one as strong as this Flagg  Walter if you like that better  he promised you seven years Sayre says you can have five What if they hand you a card GOOD FOR THREE YEARS OF CHILDREARING WITH STAMP when you get to this Dixie Pig Gonna go with that too That wont happen Youre as nasty as the other one Shut up You got a nerve callingme nasty Cant wait to give birth to a child supposed to murder his Daddy I dont care Youre all confused girl between what you want to happen and whatwill happen How do you know they arent gonna kill him before he can cry out his first breath and grind him up and feed him to these Breaker bastards Shutup Kind of a superfood Finish the job all at once Shutup I saidshut UP  Point is you dont know You dont know anything You just the babysitter just the au pair You know they lie you know they trick and never treat and yet you go on And you wantme to shut up YesYes  I wont Susannah told her grimly and seized Mias shoulders They were amazingly bony under the dress but hot as if the woman were running a fever I wont because its really mine and you know it Cat can have kittens in the oven girl but that wont ever make em muffins All right they had made it back to allout fury after all Mias face twisted into something both horrible and unhappy In Mias eyes Susannah thought she could see the endless craving grieving creature this woman once had been And something else A spark that might be blown into belief If there was time Illshut you up Mia said and suddenly Fedics main street tore open just as the allure had Behind it was a kind of bulging darkness But not empty Oh no not empty Susannah felt that very clearly They fell toward it Miapropelled them toward it Susannah tried to hold them back with no success at all As they tumbled into the dark she heard a singsong thought running through her head running in an endless worrycircleOh SusannahMio divided girl of mine Done parked her RIG Fifteen in the DIXIE PIG In the year of  Before this annoying but ever so important jingle could finish its latest circuit through SusannahMios head the head in question struck something and hard enough to send a galaxy of bright stars exploding across her field of vision When they cleared she saw very large in front of her eyes NK AWA She pulled back and saw BANGO SKANK AWAITS THE KING It was the graffito written on the inside of the toilet stalls door Her life was haunted by doors  had been it seemed ever since the door of her cell had clanged closed behind her in Oxford Mississippi  but this one was shut Good She was coming to believe that shut doors presented fewer problems Soon enough this one would open and the problems would start again MiaI told you all I know Now are you going to help me get to the Dixie Pig or do I have to do it on my own I can if I have to especially with the turtle to help me SusannahIll help Although how much or how little help Mia got from her sort of depended on what time it was right now How long had they been in here Her legs felt completely numb from the knees down  her butt too  and she thought that was a good sign but under these fluorescent lights Susannah supposed it was always halfpast anytime What does it matter to youMia asked suspiciousWhat does it matter to you what time it is Susannah scrambled for an explanation The baby You know that what I did will keep it from coming only for so long dont you Of course I do Thats why I want to get moving All right Lets see the cash our old pal Mats left us Mia took out the little wad of bills and looked at them uncomprehendingly Take the one that says Jackson IEmbarrassmentI cant read Let mecome forward Illread it No All right all right calm down Its the guy with the long white hair combed back kind of like Elvis I dont know this Elvis  Never mind its that one right on top Good Now put the rest of the cash back in your pocket nice and safe Hold the twenty in the palm of your hand Okay were blowing this popstand Whats a popstand Mia shut up Sixteen When they reentered the lobby  walking slowly on legs that tingled with pins and needles  Susannah was marginally encouraged to see that it was dusk outside She hadnt succeeded in burning up the entire day it seemed but shed gotten rid of most of it The lobby was busy but no longer frantic The beautiful Eurasian girl whod checked herthem in was gone her shift finished Under the canopy two new men in green monkeysuits were whistling up cabs for folks many of whom were wearing tuxedos or long sparkly dresses Going out to partiesSusannah saidOr maybe the theater Susannah I care not Do we need to get one of the yellow vehicles from one of the men in the green suits No Well get a cab on the corner Do you say so Oh quit with the suspicion Youre taking your kid to either its death or yours Im sure of that but I recognize your intention to do well and Ill keep my promise Yes I do say so All right Without another word  certainly none of apology  Mia left the hotel turned right and began walking back toward Second Avenue  Hammarskjld Plaza and the beautiful song of the rose Seventeen On the corner of Second and Fortysixth a metal waggon of faded red was parked at the curb The curb was yellow at this point and a man in a blue suit  a Guard o the Watch by his sidearm  seemed to be discussing that fact with a tall whitebearded man Inside of her Mia felt a flurry of startled movement Susannah What is it That man The Guard o the Watch Him No the one with the beard He looks almost exactly like Henchick Henchick of the Manni Do you not see Mia neither saw nor cared She gathered that although parking waggons along the yellow curb was forbidden and the man with the beard seemed to understand this he still would not move He went on setting up easels and then putting pictures on them Mia sensed this was an old argument between the two men Im gonna have to give you a ticket Rev Do what you need to do Officer Benzyck God loves you Good Delighted to hear it As for the ticket youll tear it up Right Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars render unto God those things that are Gods So says the Bible and blessed be the Lords Holy Book I can get behind that said Benzyck o the Watch He pulled a thick pad of paper from his back pocket and began to scribble on it This also had the feel of an old ritual But let me tell you something Harrigan  sooner or later City Hall is gonna catch up to your action and theyre gonna render unto your scofflaw holyrollinassI only hope Im there when it happens He tore a sheet from his pad went over to the metal waggon and slipped the paper beneath a black windowslider resting on the waggons glass front Susannah amusedHes gettin a ticket Not the first one either from the sound Mia momentarily diverted in spite of herselfWhat does it say on the side of his waggon Susannah There was a slight shift as Susannacame partwayforward and the sense of a squint It was a strange sensation for Mia like having a tickle deep in her head Susannah still sounding amusedIt says CHURCH OF THE HOLY GODBOMB Rev Earl Harrigan It also says YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE REWARDED IN HEAVEN Whats heaven Another name for the clearing at the end of the path Ah Benzyck o the Watch was strolling away with his hands clasped behind his back his considerable ass bunching beneath his blue uniform trousers his duty done The Rev Harrigan meanwhile was adjusting his easels The picture on one showed a man being let out of jail by a fellow in a white robe The whiterobes head was glowing The picture on the other showed the whiterobe turning away from a monster with red skin and horns on his head The monster with the horns looked pissed like a bear at sai Whiterobe Susannah is that red thing how the folk of this world see the Crimson King SusannahI guess so Its Satan if you care  lord of the underworld Have the godguy get you a cab why dont you Use the turtle Again suspicious Mia apparently couldnt help itDo you say so Say true Aye Say Jesus Christ woman All right all rightMia sounded a bit embarrassed She walked toward Rev Harrigan pulling the scrimshaw turtle out of her pocket Eighteen What she needed to do came to Susannah in a flash She withdrew from Mia if the woman couldnt get a taxi with the help of that magic turtle she was hopeless and with her eyes squeezed shut visualized the Dogan When she opened them she was there She grabbed the microphone shed used to call Eddie and depressed the toggle Harrigan she said into the mike Reverend Earl Harrigan Are you there Do you read me sugarDo you read me  Nineteen Rev Harrigan paused in his labors long enough to watch a black woman  one finestruttin honey too praise God  get into a cab The cab drove off He had a lot to do before beginning his nightly sermon  his little dance with Officer Benzyck was only the opening gun  but he stood there watching the cabs taillights twinkle and dwindle just the same Had something just happened to him Had Was it possible that Rev Harrigan fell to his knees on the sidewalk quite oblivious of the pedestrians passing by just as most were oblivious of him He clasped his big old praiseGod hands and raised them to his chin He knew the Bible said that praying was a private thing best done in ones closet and hed spent plenty of time getting kneebound in his own yes Lord but he also believed God wanted folks to see what a praying man looked like from time to time because most of them  sayGawd  had forgotten what that looked like And there was no better nonicer place to speak with God than right here on the corner of Second and Fortysixth There was a singing here clean and sweet It uplifted the spirit clarified the mindand just incidentally clarified the skin as well This wasnt the voice of God and Rev Harrigan was not so blasphemously stupid as to think it was but he had an idea that it was angels Yes sayGawd sayGawdbomb the voice of the seraphim God did you just drop a little Godbomb on me I want to ask was that voice I just heard yours or mine own No answer So many times there was no answer He would ponder this In the meantime he had a sermon to prepare for A show to do if you wanted to be perfectly vulgar about it Rev Harrigan went to his van parked at the yellow curb as always and opened the back doors Then he took out the pamphlets the silkcovered collection plate which hed put beside him on the sidewalk and the sturdy wooden cube The soapbox upon which he would stand could you raise up high and shout hallelujah And yes brother while you were right at it could you give amen STAVE Commalacomeken Its the other one again You may know her name and face But that dont make her your friend RESPONSE Commalacometen She is not your friend If you let her get too close Shell cut you up again One By the time they reached the little shopping center in the town of Bridgton a supermarket a laundry and a surprisingly large drugstore  both Roland and Eddie sensed it not just the singing but the gathering power It lifted them up like some crazy wonderful elevator Eddie found himself thinking of Tinkerbells magic dust and Dumbos magic feather This was like drawing near the rose and yet not like that There was no sense of holiness or sanctification in this little New England town butsomething was going on here and it was powerful Driving here from East Stoneham following the signs to Bridgton from back road to back road Eddie had sensed something else as well the unbelievablecrispness of this world The summergreen depths of the pine forests had a validity he had never encountered before never even suspected The birds which flew across the sky fair stopped his breath for wonder even the most common sparrow The very shadows on the ground seemed to have a velvety thickness as if you could reach down pick them up and carry them away under your arm like pieces of carpet if you so chose At some point Eddie asked Roland if he felt any of this Yes Roland said I feel it see it hear itEddie Itouch it Eddie nodded He did too This world was real beyond reality It wasantitodash That was the best he could do And they were very much in the heart of the Beam Eddie could feel it carrying them on like a river rushing down a gorge toward a waterfall But Im afraid Roland said I feel as though were approaching the center of everything  the Tower itself mayhap Its as if after all these years the quest itself has become the point for me and the end is frightening Eddie nodded He could get behind that Certainly he was afraid If it wasnt the Tower putting out that stupendous force then it was some potent and terrible thing akin to the rose But not quite the same Atwin to the rose That could be right Roland looked out at the parking lot and the people who came and went beneath a summer sky filled with fat slowfloating clouds seemingly unaware that the whole world was singing with power around them and that all the clouds flowed along the same ancient pathway in the heavens They were unaware of their own beauty The gunslinger said I used to think the most terrible thing would be to reach the Dark Tower and find the top room empty The God of all universes either dead or nonexistent in the first place But nowsuppose thereis someone there Eddie Someone in charge who turns out to be He couldnt finish Eddie could Someone who turns out to be just another bumhug Is that it God not dead but feebleminded and malicious Roland nodded This was not in fact precisely what he was afraid of but he thought Eddie had at least come close How can that be Roland Considering what we feel Roland shrugged as if to say anything could be In any case what choice do we have None Roland said bleakly All things serve the Beam Whatever the great and singing force was it seemed to be coming from the road that ran west from the shopping center back into the woods Kansas Road according to the sign and that made Eddie think of Dorothy and Toto and Blaine the Mono He dropped the transmission of their borrowed Ford into Drive and started rolling forward His heart was beating in his chest with slow exclamatory force He wondered if Moses had felt like this when he approached the burning bush which contained God He wondered if Jacob had felt like this awakening to find a stranger both radiant and fair in his camp  the angel with whom he would wrestle He thought that they probably had He felt sure that another part of their journey was about to come to an end  another answer lay up ahead God living on Kansas Road in the town of Bridgton Maine It should have sounded crazy but didnt Just dont strike me deadEddie thought and turned westI need to get back to my sweetheart so please dont strike me dead whoever or whatever you are Man Im so scared he said Roland reached out and briefly grasped his hand Two Three miles from the shopping center they came to a dirt road which struck off into the pine trees on their left There had been other byways which Eddie had passed without slowing from the steady thirty miles an hour he had been maintaining but at this one he stopped Both front windows were down They could hear the wind in the trees the grouchy call of a crow the nottoodistant buzz of a powerboat and the rumble of the Fords engine Except for a hundred thousand voices singing in rough harmony those were the only sounds The sign marking the turnoff said no more than PRIVATE DRIVE Nevertheless Eddie was nodding This is it Yes I know Hows your leg Hurts Dont worry about it Are we gonna do this Wehave to Roland said You were right to bring us here Whats here is the other half ofthis  He tapped the paper in his pocket the one conveying ownership of the vacant lot to the Tet Corporation You think this guy King is the roses twin You say true Roland smiled at his own choice of words Eddie thought hed rarely seen one so sad Weve picked up the Calla way of talking havent we Jake first then all of us But that will fall away Further to go Eddie said It wasnt a question Aye and it will be dangerous Stillmaybe nothing so dangerous as this Shall we roll In a minute Roland do you remember Susannah mentioning a man named Moses Carver A stemwhich is to say a man of affairs He took over her fathers business when sai Holmes died am I correct Yeah He was also Suzes godfather She said he could be trusted completely Remember how mad she got at Jake and me when we suggested he might have stolen the companys money Roland nodded I trust her judgment Eddie said What about you Yes If Carveris honest we might be able to put him in charge of the things we need to accomplish in this world None of this seemed terribly important compared to the force Eddie felt rising all around him but he thought it was They might only have one chance to protect the rose now and ensure its survival later They had to do it right and Eddie knew that meant heeding the will of destiny In a word ka Suze says Holmes Dental was worth eight or ten million when you snatched her out of New York Roland If Carvers as good as I hope he is the company might be worth twelve or fourteen million by now Thats a lot Delah Eddie said tossing his open hand at the horizon and Roland nodded It sounds funny to talk about using the profits from some kind of dental process to save the universe but thats just what Iam talking about And the money the toothfairy left her may only be the beginning Microsoft for instance Remember me mentioning that name to Tower Roland nodded Slow down EddieCalm down I beg Im sorry Eddie said and pulled in a deep breath Its this place The singing Thefaces do you see the faces in the trees In the shadows I see them very well It makes me feel a little crazy Bear with me What Im talking about is merging Holmes Dental and the Tet Corporation then using our knowledge of the future to turn it into one of the richest combinations in the history of the world Resources to equal those of the Sombra Corporationor maybe North Central Positronics itself Roland shrugged then lifted a hand as if to ask how Eddie could talk about money while in the presence of the immense force flowing along the barrel of the Beam and through them lifting the hair from the napes of their necks making their sinuses tingle turning every woodsy shadow into a watching faceas if a multitude had gathered here to watch them play out a crucial scene in their drama I know how you feel but itmatters  Eddie insisted Believe me it does Suppose for instance we were to grow fast enough to buy out North Central Positronics before it can rise as a force in this world Roland we might be able to turn it the way you can turn even the biggest river with no more than a single spade up in its headwaters where its only a trickle At this Rolands eyes gleamed Take it over he said Turn its purpose from the Crimson Kings to our own Yes that might be possible Whether it is or isnt we have to remember that were not just playing for  or  where I came from or  where Suze went In that world Eddie realized Calvin Tower might be dead and Aaron Deepneau would be for sure their final action in the Dark Towers drama  saving Donald Callahan from the Hitler Brothers  long finished Swept from the stage both of them Into the clearing at the end of the path along with Gasher and Hoots Benny Slightman Susan Delgado Calla Callahan Susan Susannah and the TickTock Man even Blaine and Patricia Roland and his katet would also pass into that clearing be it early or late In the end  if they were fantastically lucky and suicidally brave  only the Dark Tower would stand If they could nip North Central Positronics in the bud they might be able to save all the Beams that had been broken Even if they failed at that two Beams might be enough to hold the Tower in place the rose in New York and a man named Stephen King in Maine Eddies head had no proof that this was indeed the casebut his heart believed it What were playing for Roland is the ages Roland made a fist and thumped it lightly on the dusty dashboard of John Cullums old Ford and nodded Anything can go on that lot you realize thatAnything A building a park a monument The National Gramophone Institute As long as the rose stays This guy Carver can make the Tet Corporation legal maybe working with Aaron Deepneau   Yes Roland said I liked Deepneau He had a true face Eddie thought so too Anyway they can draw up legal papers that take care of the rose  the rose always stays no matter what And Ive got a feeling that it will    hell the year I think itll always be there Because it may be fragile but I think its also immortal We have to do it right while we have the chance though Because this is the key world In this one you never get a chance to whittle a little more if the key doesnt turn In this world I dont think there are any doovers Roland considered this then pointed to the dirt road leading into the trees Into a forest of watching faces and singing voices A harmonium of all that filled life with worth and meaning that held to the truth that acknowledged the White And what about the man who lives at the end of this road Eddie If heis a man I think he is and not just because of what John Cullum said Its what I feel here Eddie patted his chest above the heart So do I Do you say so Roland Aye I do Ishe immortal do you think Because Ive seen much in my years and heard rumors of much more but never of a man or woman who lived forever I dont think he needs to be immortal I think all he needs to do is write the right story Because some storiesdo live forever Understanding lit up Rolands eyesAt last Eddie thoughtAt last he sees it But how long had it taken him to see it himself and then to swallow it God knew he should have been able to after all the other wonders hed seen and yet still this last step had eluded him Even discovering that Pere Callahan had seemingly sprung alive and breathing from a fiction calledSalems Lot hadnt been enough to take him that last crucial step What had finally done it was finding out that CoOp City was in the Bronx not Brooklyn In this world at least Which was the only world that mattered Maybe hes not at home Roland said as around them the whole world waited Maybe this man who made us is not at home You know he is Roland nodded And the old light had dawned in his eyes light from a fire that had never gone out the one that had lit his way along the Beam all the way from Gilead Then drive on he cried hoarsely Drive on for your fathers sake If hes God  our God  Id look Him in the eye and ask Him the way to the Tower Would you not ask him the way to Susannah first As soon as the question was out of his mouth Eddie regretted it and prayed the gunslinger would not answer it Roland didnt He only twirled the remaining fingers on his right handGo go Eddie put the gearshift of Cullums Ford into Drive and turned onto the dirt road He drove them into a great singing force that seemed to go through them like a wind turning them into something as insubstantial as a thought or a dream in the head of some sleeping god Three A quarter of a mile in the road forked Eddie took the lefthand branch although the sign pointing that way said ROWDEN not KING The dust raised by their passage hung in the rearview mirror The singing was a sweet din pouring through him like liquor His hair was still standing up at the roots and his muscles were trembling Called upon to draw his gun Eddie thought he would probably drop the damned thing Even if he managed to hold onto it aiming would be impossible He didnt know how the man they were looking for could live so close to the sound of that singing and eat or sleep let alone write stories But of course King wasnt justclose to the sound if Eddie had it right King was thesource of the sound But if he has a family what about them And even if he doesnt what about the neighbors Here was a driveway on the right and  Eddie stop It was Roland but not sounding the least bit like himself His Calla tan was thin paint over an immense pallor Eddie stopped Roland fumbled at the doorhandle on his side couldnt make it work levered himself out the window all the way to his waist instead Eddie heard the chink his belt buckle made on the chrome strip which faced the windowwell and then vomited onto the oggan When he fell back into the seat he looked both exhausted and exalted The eyes which rolled to meet Eddies were blue ancient glittering Drive on Roland are you sure   Roland only twirled his fingers looking straight out through the Fords dusty windshieldGo go For your fathers sake Eddie drove on Four It was the sort of house realestate agents call a ranch Eddie wasnt surprised Whatdid surprise him a little was how modest the place was Then he reminded himself that not every writer was arich writer and that probably went double foryoung writers Some sort of typo had apparently made his second novel quite the catch among bibliomaniacs but Eddie doubted if King ever saw a commission on that sort of thing Or royalties if that was what they called it Still the car parked in the turnaround driveway was a newlooking Jeep Cherokee with a nifty Indian stripe running up the side and that suggested Stephen King wasnt exactly starving for his art either There was a wooden jungle gym in the front yard with a lot of plastic toys scattered around it Eddies heart sank at the sight of them One lesson which the Calla had taught exquisitely was that kids complicated things The ones living here werelittle kids from the look of the toys And to them comes a pair of men wearing hard calibers Men who were not at this point in time strictly in their right minds Eddie cut the Fords engine A crow cawed A powerboat  bigger than the one theyd heard earlier from the sound  buzzed Beyond the house bright sun glinted on blue water And the voices sangCome come comecomecommala There was a clunk as Roland opened his door and got out slewing a little as he did so bad hip dry twist Eddie got out on legs that felt as numb as sticks Tabby That you This from around the right side of the house And now running ahead of the voice and the man who owned the voice came a shadow Never had Eddie seen one that so filled him with terror and fascination He thought and with absolute certaintyYonder comes my maker Yonder is he aye say true And the voices sangCommalacomethree he who made me Did you forget something darling Only the last word came out in a downeast drawldaaalin the way John Cullum would have said it And then came the man of the house then came he He saw them and stopped He sawRoland and stopped The singing voices stopped with him and the powerboats drone seemed to stop as well For a moment the whole world hung on a hinge Then the man turned and ran Not however before Eddie saw the terrible thunderstruck look of recognition on his face Roland was after him in a flash like a cat after a bird Five But sai King was a man not a bird He couldnt fly and there was really nowhere to run The side lawn sloped down a mild hill broken only by a concrete pad that might have been the well or some kind of sewagepumping device Beyond the lawn was a postage stamp  sized bit of beach littered with more toys After that came the lake The man reached the edge of it splashed into it then turned so awkwardly he almost fell down Roland skidded to a stop on the sand He and Stephen King regarded each other Eddie stood perhaps ten yards behind Roland watching both of them The singing had begun again and so had the buzzing drone of the powerboat Perhaps they had never stopped but Eddie believed he knew better The man in the water put his hands over his eyes like a child Youre not there he said I am sai Rolands voice was both gentle and filled with awe Take your hands from your eyes Stephen of Bridgton Take them down and see me very well Maybe Im having a breakdown said the man in the water but he slowly dropped his hands He was wearing thick glasses with severe black frames One bow had been mended with a bit of tape His hair was either black or a very dark brown The beard was definitely black the first threads of white in it startling in their brilliance He was wearing bluejeans below a teeshirt that said THE RAMONES and ROCKET TO RUSSIA and GABBAGABBAHEY He looked like starting to run to middleaged fat but he wasnt fat yet He was tall and as ashypale as Roland Eddie saw with no real surprise that Stephen Kinglooked like Roland Given the age difference they could never be mistaken for twins but father and son Yes Easily Roland tapped the base of his throat three times then shook his head It wasnt enough It wouldnt do Eddie watched with fascination and horror as the gunslinger sank to his knees amid the litter of bright plastic toys and put his curled hand against his brow Hile talespinner he said Comes to you Roland Deschain of Gilead that was and Eddie Dean of New York Will you open to us if we open to you King laughed Given the power of Rolands words Eddie found the sound shocking Iman this cant be happening And then to himself Can it Roland still on his knees went on as if the man standing in the water had neither laughed nor spoken Do you see us for what we are and what we do Youd be gunslingers if you were real King peered at Roland through his thick spectacles Gunslingers seeking the Dark Tower Thats itEddie thought as the voices rose and the sun shimmered on the blue waterThat nails it You say true sai We seek aid and succor Stephen of Bridgton Willee give it Mister I dont know who your friend is but as for youman Imade you You cant be standingthere because the only place you really exist ishere  He thumped a fist to the center of his forehead as if in parody of Roland Then he pointed to his house His ranchstyle house And in there Youre in there too I guess In a desk drawer or maybe a box in the garage Youre unfinished business I havent thought of you inin His voice had grown thin Now he began to sway like someone who hears faint but delicious music and his knees buckled He fell Roland Eddie shouted at last plunging forward Mans had a fucking heart attack Already knowing or perhaps only hoping better Because the singing was as strong as ever The faces in the trees and shadows as clear The gunslinger was bending down and grasping King  who had already begun to thrash weakly  under the arms Hes but fainted And who could blame him Help me get him into the house Six The master bedroom had a gorgeous view of the lake and a hideous purple rug on the floor Eddie sat on the bed and watched through the bathroom door as King took off his wet sneakers and outer clothes stepping between the door and the tiled bathroom wall for a moment to swap his wet undershorts for a dry pair He hadnt objected to Eddie following him into the bedroom Since coming to  and hed been out for no more than thirty seconds  he had displayed an almost eerie calm Now he came out of the bathroom and crossed to the bureau Is this a practical joke he asked rummaging for dry jeans and a fresh teeshirt To Eddie Kings house said money  some at least God knew what the clothes said Is it something Mac McCutcheon and Floyd Calderwood dreamed up I dont know those men and its no joke Maybe not but that man cant be real King stepped into the jeans He spoke to Eddie in a reasonable tone of voice I mean Iwrote about him Eddie nodded I kind of figured that But hes real just the same Ive been running with him for   How long Eddie didnt know   for awhile he finished You wrote about him but not me Do you feel left out Eddie laughed but in truth hedid feel left out A little anyway Maybe King hadnt gotten to him yet If that was the case he wasnt exactly safe was he This doesntfeel like a breakdown King said but I suppose they never do Youre not having a breakdown but I have some sympathy for how you feel sai That man   Roland Roland ofGilead You say true I dont know if I had the Gilead part or not King said Id have to check the pages if I could find them But its good As in There is no balm in Gilead  Im not following you Thats okay neither am I King found cigarettes Pall Malls on the bureau and lit one Finish what you were going to say He dragged me through a door between this world and his world I also felt like I was having a breakdown It hadnt been this world from which Eddie had been dragged close but no cigar and hed been jonesing for heroin at the time  jonesing bigtime  but the situation was complicated enough without adding that stuff Still there was one question he had to ask before they rejoined Roland and the real palaver began Tell me something sai King  do you know where CoOp City is King had been transferring his coins and keys from his wet jeans to the dry ones right eye squinted shut against the smoke of the cigarette tucked in the corner of his mouth Now he stopped and looked at Eddie with his eyebrows raised Is this a trick question No And you wont shoot me with that gun youre wearing if I get it wrong Eddie smiled a little King wasnt an unlikable cuss for a god Then he reminded himself that God had killed his little sister using a drunk driver as a tool and his brother Henry as well God had made Enrico Balazar and burned Susan Delgado at the stake His smile faded But he said No ones getting shot here sai In that case I believe CoOp Citys in Brooklyn Where you come from judging by your accent So do I win the FairDay Goose Eddie jerked like someone whos been poked with a pin What Just a thing my mother used to say When my brother Dave and I did all our chores and got em right the first time shed say You boys win the FairDay Goose It was a joke So do I win the prize Yes Eddie said Sure King nodded then butted out his cigarette Youre an okay guy Its your pal I dont much care for And never did I think thats part of the reason I quit on the story That startled Eddie again and he got up from the bed to cover it Quiton it YeahThe Dark Tower it was called It was gonna be myLord of the Rings myGormenghast my younameit One thing about being twentytwo is that youre never short of ambition It didnt take me long to see that it was just too big for my little brain TooI dont knowoutr Thats as good a word as any I guess Also he added dryly I lost the outline You didwhat  Sounds crazy doesnt it But writing can be a crazy deal Did you know that Ernest Hemingway once lost a whole book of short stories on a train Really Really He had no backup copies no carbons Just poof gone Thats sort of what happened to me One fine drunk night  or maybe I was done up on mescaline I can no longer remember  I did a complete outline for this fiveor tenthousandpage fantasy epic It was a good outline I think Gave the thing some form Some style And then I lost it Probably flew off the back of my motorcycle when I was coming back from some fucking bar Nothing like that ever happened to me before Im usually careful about my work if nothing else Uhhuh Eddie said and thought of askingDid you happen to see any guys in loud clothes the sort of guys who drive flashy cars around the time you lost it Low men not to put too fine a point on it Anyone with a red mark on his or her forehead The sort of thing that looks a little like a circle of blood Any indications in short that someone stoleyour outline Someone who might have an interest in making sure The Dark Towernever gets finished Lets go out to the kitchen We need to palaver Eddie just wished he knew what they were supposed to palaverabout Whatever it was they had better get it right because this was the real world the one in which there were no doovers Seven Roland had no idea of how to stock and then start the fancy coffeemaker on the counter but he found a battered coffee pot on one of the shelves that was not much different from the one Alain Johns had carried in his gunna long ago when three boys had come to Mejis to count stock Sai Kings stove ran on electricity but a child could have figured out how to make the burners work When Eddie and King came into the kitchen the pot was beginning to get hot I dont use coffee myself King said and went to the coldbox giving Roland a wide berth And I dont ordinarily drink beer before five but I believe that today Ill make an exception Mr Dean Coffeell do me fine Mr Gilead Its Deschain sai King Ill also have the coffee and say thank ya The writer opened a can by using the builtin ring in the top a device that struck Roland as superficially clever and almost moronically wasteful There was a hiss followed by the pleasant smell commalacomecome of yeast and hops King drank down at least half the can at a go wiped foam out of his mustache then put the can on the counter He was still pale but seemingly composed and in possession of his faculties The gunslinger thought he was doing quite well at least so far Was it possible that in some of the deeper ranges of his mind and heart King had expected their visit Had been waiting for them You have a wife and children Roland said Where are they Tabbys folks live up north near Bangor My daughters been spending the last week with her nanna and poppa Tabby took our youngest  Owen hes just a baby  and headed that way about an hour ago Im supposed to pick up my other son  Joe  in He checked his watch In just about an hour I wanted to finish my writing so this time were taking both cars Roland considered It might be true It was almost certainly Kings way of telling them that if anything happened to him he would be missed in short order I cant believe this is happening Have I said that enough to be annoying yet In any case its too much like one of my own stories to be happening LikeSalems Lot for instance Eddie suggested King raised his eyebrows So you know about that Do they have the Literary Guild wherever you came from He downed the rest of his beer He drank Roland thought like a man with a gift for it A couple of hours ago there were sirens way over on the other side of the lake plus a big plume of smoke I could see it from my office At the time I thought it was probably just a grassfire maybe in Harrison or Stoneham but now I wonder Did that have anything to do with you guys It did didnt it Eddie said Hes writing it Roland Or was He says he stopped But its calledThe Dark Tower So he knows King smiled but Roland thought he looked really deeply frightened for the first time Setting aside that initial moment when hed come around the corner of the house and seen them that was When hed seen his creation Is that what I am His creation It felt wrong and right in equal measure Thinking about it made Rolands head ache and his stomach feel slippery all over again  He knows  King said I dont like the sound of that boys In a story when someone says He knows the next line is usually Well have to kill him  Believe me when I tell you this Roland said He spoke with great emphasis Killing you is the last thing wed ever want to do sai King Your enemies are our enemies and those who would help you along your way are our friends Amen Eddie said King opened his coldbox and got another beer Roland saw a great many of them in there standing to frosty attention More cans of beer than anything else In that case he said you better call me Steve Eight Tell us the story with me in it Roland invited King leaned against the kitchen counter and the top of his head caught a shaft of sun He took a sip of his beer and considered Rolands question Eddie saw it then for the first time very dim  a contrast to the sun perhaps A dusty black shadow something swaddled around the man Dim Barely there But there Like the darkness you saw hiding behind things when you traveled todash Was that it Eddie didnt think so Barely there But there You know King said Im not much good at telling stories That sounds like a paradox but its not its the reason I write them down Is it Roland he talks like or meEddie wondered He couldnt tell Much later on hed realize that King talked likeall of them even Rosa Munoz Pere Callahans woman of work in the Calla Then the writer brightened Tell you what why dont I see if I can find the manuscript Ive got four or five boxes of busted stories downstairsDark Tower s got to be in one of themBusted Busted stories Eddie didnt care for the sound of that at all You can read some of it while I go get my little boy He grinned displaying big crooked teeth Maybe when I get back youll be gone and I can get to work on thinking you were never here at all Eddie glanced at Roland who shook his head slightly On the stove the first bubble of coffee blinked in the pots glass eye Sai King   Eddie began Steve Steve then We ought to transact our business now Matters of trust aside were in a ripping hurry Sure sure right racing against time King said and laughed The sound was charmingly goofy Eddie suspected that the beer was starting to do its work and he wondered if the man was maybe a juicehead Impossible to tell for sure on such short acquaintance but Eddie thought some of the signs were there He didnt remember a whole hell of a lot from high school English but he did recall some teacher or other telling him that writersreally liked to drink Hemingway Faulkner Fitzgerald The Raven guy Writers liked to drink Im not laughing at you guys King said Its actually against my religion to laugh at men who are toting guns Its just that in the sort of books I write people are almost always racing against time Would you like to hear the first line ofThe Dark Tower  Sure if you remember it Eddie said Roland said nothing but his eyes gleamed bright under brows that were now threaded with white Oh I remember it It may be the best opening line I ever wrote King set his beer aside then raised his hands with the first two fingers of each held out and bent as if making quotation marks  The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed The rest might have been puff and blow but man that was clean He dropped his hands and picked up his beer For the fortythird time is this really happening Was the man in blacks name Walter Roland asked Kings beer tilted shy of his mouth and he spilled some down his front wetting his fresh shirt Roland nodded as if that was all the answer he needed Dont faint on us again Eddie said a trifle sharply Once was enough to impress me King nodded took another sip of his beer seemed to take hold of himself at the same time He glanced at the clock Are you gentlemen really going to let me pick up my son Yes Roland said You King paused to consider then smiled Do you set your watch and your warrant on it With no smile in return Roland said So I do Okay thenThe Dark Tower Readers Digest Condensed Book version Keeping in mind that oral storytelling isnt my thing Ill do the best I can Nine Roland listened as if worlds depended on it as he was quite sure they did King had begun his version of Rolands life with the campfires which had pleased the gunslinger because they confirmed Walters essential humanity From there King said the story went back to Rolands meeting with a kind of shirttail farmer on the edge of the desert Brown his name had been Life for your cropRoland heard across an echo of years andLife for your own Hed forgotten Brown and Browns pet raven Zoltan but this stranger had not What I liked King said was how the story seemed to be going backward From a purely technical standpoint it was very interesting I start with you in the desert then slip back a notch to you meeting Brown and Zoltan Zoltan was named after a folksinger and guitarist I knew at the University of Maine by the way Anyway from the dwellers hut the story slips back another notch to you coming into the town of Tullnamed after a rock group   Jethro Tull Eddie said Goddam of course Iknew that name was familiar What about ZZ Top Steve Do you know them Eddie looked at King saw the incomprehension and smiled I guess its not their when quite yet Or if it is you havent found out about them Roland twirled his fingersGo on go on And gave Eddie a look that suggested he stop interrupting Anyway from Roland coming into Tull the story slips back another notch to tell how Nort the weedeater died and was resurrected by Walter You see what buzzed me about it dont you The early part of it was all told in reverse gear It was bassackwards Roland had no interest in the technical aspects that seemed to fascinate King this was his life they were talking about after all hislife and to him it had all been moving forward At least until hed reached the Western Sea and the doors through which he had drawn his traveling companions But Stephen King knew nothing of the doors it seemed He had written of the way station and Rolands meeting with Jake Chambers he had written of their trek first into the mountains and then through them he had written of Jakes betrayal by the man he had come to trust and to love King observed the way Roland hung his head during this part of the tale and spoke with odd gentleness No need to look so ashamed Mr Deschain After all I was the one who made you do it But again Roland wondered about that King had written of Rolands palaver with Walter in the dusty golgotha of bones the telling of the Tarot and the terrible vision Roland had had of growing right through the roof of the universe He had written of how Roland had awakened following that long night of fortunetelling to find himself years older and Walter nothing but bones Finally King said hed written of Roland going to the edge of the water and sitting there You said I loved you Jake  Roland nodded matteroffactly I love him still You speak as though he actually exists Roland looked at him levelly Do I exist Do you King was silent What happened then Eddie asked Thenseor I ran out of story  or got intimidated if you like that better  and stopped Eddie also wanted to stop He could see the shadows beginning to lengthen in the kitchen and wanted to get after Susannah before it was too late He thought both he and Roland had a pretty good idea of how to get out of this world suspected Stephen King himself could direct them to Turtleback Lane in Lovell where reality was thin and  according to John Cullum at least  the walkins had been plentiful of late And King would be happy to direct them Happy to get rid of them But they couldnt go just yet and in spite of his impatience Eddie knew it You stopped because you lost your lineout Roland said Outline And no not really King had gone after his third beer and Eddie thought it was no wonder the man was getting pudgy in the middle hed already consumed the caloric equivalent of a loaf of bread and was starting on Loaf  I hardly ever work from an outline In factdont hold me to this but that might have been the only time And it got too big for me Too strange Alsoyou became a problem sir or sai or whatever you call yourself King grimaced Whatever form of address that is I didnt make it up Not yet anyway Roland remarked You started as a version of Sergio Leones Man With No Name In the Spaghetti Westerns Eddie said Jesus of course I watched a hundred of em at the Majestic with my brother Henry when Henry was still at home I went by myself or with this friend of mine Chuggy Coter when Henry was in the Nam Those wereguy flicks King was grinning Yeah he said but my wife went ape for em so go figure Cool on her Eddie exclaimed Yeah Tabs a cool kitty King looked back at Roland As The Man With No Name  a fantasy version of Clint Eastwood  you were okay A lot of fun to partner up with Is that how you think of it Yes But then you changed Right under my hand It got so I couldnt tell if you were the hero the antihero or no hero at all When you let the kid drop that was the capper You said you made me do that Looking Roland straight in the eyes  blue meeting blue amid the endless choir of voices  King said I lied brother Ten There was a little pause while they all thought that over Then King said You started to scare me so I stopped writing about you Boxed you up and put you in a drawer and went on to a series of short stories I sold to various mens magazines He considered then nodded Things changed for me after I put you away my friend and for the better I started to sell my stuff Asked Tabby to marry me Not long after that I started a book calledCarrie It wasnt my first novel but it was the first one I sold and it put me over the top All that after saying goodbye Roland so long happy trails to you Then what happens I come around the corner of my house one day six or seven years later and see you standing in my fucking driveway big as Billybedamned as my mother used to say And all I can say now is that thinking youre a hallucination brought on by overwork is the most optimistic conclusion I can draw And I dont believe it How can I Kings voice was rising becoming reedy Eddie didnt mistake it for fear this was outrage How can I believe it when I see the shadows you cast the blood on your leg   He pointed to Eddie And the dust on your face This time to Roland Youve taken away my goddam options and I can feel my mindI dont knowtipping Is that the word I think it is Tipping You didnt just stop Roland said ignoring this last completely for the selfindulgent nonsense it probably was No I think telling stories is like pushing something Pushing against uncreation itself maybe And one day while you were doing that you felt something pushing back King considered this for what seemed to Eddie like a very long time Then he nodded You could be right It was more than the usual goingdry feeling for sure Im used to that although it doesnt happen as often as it used to ItsI dont know one day you just start having less fun while youre sitting there tapping the keys Seeing less clearly Getting less of a buzz from tellingyourself the story And then to make things worse you get anew idea one thats all bright and shiny fresh off the showroom floor not a scratch on her Completely unfuckedup by you at least as of yet Andwell And you felt something pushing back Roland spoke in the same utterly flat tone Yeah Kings voice had dropped so low Eddie could barely hear him N O TRESPASSING D O NOT ENTER H IGH VOLTAGE  He paused Maybe even DANGER OF DEATH  You wouldnt like that faint shadow I see swirling around youEddie thoughtThat black nimbus No sai I dont think youd like that at all and what am I seeing The cigarettes The beer Something else addictive you maybe have a taste for A car accident one drunk night And how far ahead How many years He looked at the clock over the Kings kitchen table and was dismayed to see that it was quarter to four in the afternoon Roland its getting late This mans got to get his kidAnd weve got to find my wife before Mia has the baby they seem to be sharing and the Crimson King has no more use for the Susannah part of her Roland said Just a little more And lowered his head without saying anything Thinking Trying to decide which questions were the right questions Maybe just one right question And it was important Eddie knew it was because theyd never be able to return to the ninth day of July in the year  They might be able to revisit that day in some other world but not in this one And would Stephen King exist in any of those other worlds Eddie thought maybe notProbably not While Roland considered Eddie asked King if the name Blaine meant anything special to him No Not particularly What about Lud As in Luddites They were some sort of machinehating religious sect werent they Nineteenth century I think or they might have started even earlier If Ive got it right the ones in the nineteenth century would break into factories and bash the machinery to pieces He grinned displaying those crooked teeth I guess they were the Greenpeace of their day Beryl Evans That name ring a bell No Henchick Henchick of the Manni No What are the Manni Too complicated to go into What about Claudia y Inez Bachman That one mean anyth   King burst out laughing startling Eddie Startling King himself judging from the look on his face Dickys wife he exclaimed How in the hell do you know about that I dont Whos Dicky Richard Bachman Ive started publishing some of my earliest novels as paperback originals under a pseudonym Bachman is it One night when I was pretty drunk I made up a whole author bio for him right down to how he beat adultonset leukemia hooray Dickie Anyway Claudias his wife Claudia Inez Bachman They part thoughthat I dont know about Eddie felt as if a huge invisible stone had suddenly rolled off his chest and out of his lifeClaudia Inez Bachman only had eighteen letters So something had added they and why To make nineteen of course Claudia Bachman was just a name Claudia y Inez Bachman thoughshewas katet Eddie thought theyd just gotten one of the things theyd come here for Yes Stephen King had created them At least hed created Roland Jake and Father Callahan The rest he hadnt gotten to yet And he had moved Roland like a piece on a chessboard go to Tull Roland sleep with Allie Roland chase Walter across the desert Roland But even as he moved his main character along the board so hadKing himself been moved That one letter added to the name of his pseudonyms wife insisted upon it Something had wanted to make Claudia Bachmannineteen So  Steve Yes Eddie of New York King smiled selfconsciously Eddie could feel his heart beating hard in his chest What does the number nineteen mean to you King considered Outside the wind soughed in the trees the powerboats whined and the crow  or another  cawed Soon along this lake would come the hour of barbecues and then maybe a trip to town and a band concert on the square all in this best of all possible worlds Or just the one most real At last King shook his head and Eddie let out a frustrated breath Sorry Its a prime number but thats all I can come up with Primes sort of fascinate me have ever since Mr Soychaks Algebra I class at Lisbon High And I think its how old I was when I met my wife but she might dispute that She has a disputatious nature What about ninetynine King thought it over then ticked items off on his fingers A hell of an age to be Ninetynine years on the old rockpile A song called  I think  The Wreck of Old Ninetynine Only it might be The Wreck of theHesperus  Im thinking about Ninetynine bottles of beer on the wall we took one down and passed it all around and there were ninetyeight bottles of beer Beyond thatnada  This time it was Kings turn to look at the clock If I dont leave soon Betty Jones is going to call to see if I forgot Ihave a son And after I get Joe Im supposed to drive a hundred and thirty miles north theres that Which might be easier if I quit with the beer And that in turn might be easier if I didnt have a couple of armed spooks sitting in my kitchen Roland was nodding He reached down to his gunbelt brought up a shell and began to roll it absently between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand Just one more question if it does ya Then well go our course and let you go yours King nodded Ask it then He looked at his third can of beer then tipped it down the sink with an expression of regret Was it you wroteThe Dark Tower  To Eddie this question made no sense but Kings eyes lit up and he smiled brilliantlyNo he said And if I ever do a book on writing  and I probably could its what I taught before I retired to do this  Ill say so Not that not any of them not really I know that there are writers whodo write but Im not one of them In fact whenever I run out of inspiration and resort to plot the story Im working on usually turns to shit I dont have a clue what youre talking about Eddie said Its likehey thats neat The shell rolling back and forth between the gunslingers thumb and forefinger had jumped effortlessly to the backs of his fingers where it seemed to walk along Rolands rippling knuckles Yes Roland agreed it is isnt it Its how you hypnotized Jake at the way station How you made him remember being killed And SusanEddie thoughtHe hypnotized Susan the same way only you dont know about that yet sai King Or maybe you do Maybe somewhere inside you know all of it Ive tried hypnosis King said In fact a guy got me up onstage at the Topsham Fair when I was a kid and tried to make me cluck like a hen It didnt work That was around the time Buddy Holly died And the Big Bopper And Ritchie Valens Todana Ah Discordia He suddenly shook his head as if to clear it and looked up from the dancing shell to Rolands face Did I say something just then No sai Roland looked down at the dancing shell  back and forth it went and back and forth  which quite naturally drew Kings eyes back as well What happens when you make a story Roland inquired Mystory for instance It just comes King said His voice had grown faint Bemused It blows into me  thats the good part  and then it comes out when I move my fingers Never from the head Comes out the navel or somewhere There was an editorI think it was Maxwell Perkinswho called Thomas Wolfe   Eddie knew what Roland was doing and knew it was probably a bad idea to interrupt but he couldnt help it A rose he said A rose a stone an unfound door Kings face lighted with pleasure but his eyes never lifted from the shell dancing along the heddles of the gunslingers knuckles Actually its a stone aleaf a door he said But I like rose even better He had been entirely captured Eddie thought he could almost hear the sucking sound as the mans conscious mind drained away It occurred to him that something as simple as a ringing phone at this critical moment might change the whole course of existence He got up and  moving quietly in spite of his stiff and painful leg  went to where it hung on the wall He twisted the cord in his fingers and applied pressure until it snapped A rose a stone an unfound door King agreed That could be Wolfe all right Maxwell Perkins called him a divine windchime O lost and by the wind grieved All the forgotten faces O Discordia How does the story come to you sai Roland asked quietly I dont like the New Agersthe crystalwaversall the itdontmatter turnthepagersbut they call it channeling and thatshow it feelslike something in a channel Or on a beam Roland asked All things serve the Beam the writer said and sighed The sound was terrible in its sadness Eddie felt his back prickle up in helpless waves of gooseflesh Eleven Stephen King stood in a shaft of dusty afternoon sunlight It lit his cheek the curve of his left eye the dimple at the corner of his mouth It turned each white hair on the left side of his beard into a line of light Hestood in light and that made the faint darkness around him clearer His respiration had slowed to perhaps three or four breaths a minute Stephen King Roland said Do you see me Hile gunslinger I see you very well When did you first see me Not until today Roland looked surprised at this and a little frustrated It was clearly not the answer he had expected Then King went on I saw Cuthbert not you A pause You and Cuthbert broke bread and scattered it beneath the gallows Thats in the part thats already written Aye so we did When Hax the cook swung We were but lads Did Bert tell you that tale But King did not answer this I saw Eddie I saw him very well A pause Cuthbert and Eddie are twins Roland   Eddie began in a low voice Roland hushed him with a savage shake of the head and put the bullet hed used to hypnotize King on the table King kept looking at the place where it had been as if he still saw it there Probably he did Dust motes danced around his dark and shaggy head of hair Where were you when you saw Cuthbert and Eddie In the barn Kings voice dropped His lips had begun to tremble Auntie sent me out because we tried to run away Who Me and my brother Dave They caught us and brought us back They said we were bad bad boys And you had to go into the barn Yes and saw wood That was your punishment Yes A tear welled in the corner of Kings right eye It slipped down his cheek to the edge of his beard The chickens are dead The chickens in the barn Yes them More tears followed the first What killed them Uncle Oren says it was avian flu Their eyes are open Theyrea little scary Or perhaps more than just a little Eddie thought judging by the tears and the pallor of the mans cheeks You couldnt leave the barn Not until I saw my share of the wood David did his Its my turn There are spiders in the chickens Spiders in their guts little red ones Like specks of red pepper If they get on me Ill catch the flu and die Only then Ill come back Why Ill be a vampire Ill be a slave tohim His scribe maybe His pet writer Whose The Lord of the Spiders The Crimson King Towerpent Christ Roland Eddie whispered He was shuddering What had they found here What nest had they exposed Sai KingSteve how old were you  areyou Im seven A pause I wet my pants I dont want the spiders to bite me The red spiders But thenyou came Eddie and I went free He smiled radiantly his cheeks gleaming with tears Are you asleep Stephen Roland asked Aye Go deeper All right Ill count to three On three youll be as deep as you can go All right Onetwothree Onthree Kings head lolled forward His chin rested on his chest A line of silver drool ran from his mouth and swung like a pendulum So now we know something Roland said to Eddie Something crucial maybe He was touched by the Crimson King when he was just a child but it seems that we won him over to our side Oryou did Eddie You and my old friend Bert In any case it makes him rather special Id feel better about my heroism if I remembered it Eddie said Then You realize that when this guy was seven I wasnt even born Roland smiled Ka is a wheel Youve been turning on it under different names for a long time Cuthbert for one it seems Whats this about the Crimson King being Towerpent I have no idea Roland turned back to Stephen King How many times do you think the Lord of Discordia has tried to kill you Stephen Kill you and halt your pen Shut up your troublesome mouth Since that first time in your aunt and uncles barn King seemed to try counting then shook his head Delah he saidMany Eddie and Roland exchanged a glance And does someone always step in Roland asked Nay sai never think it Im not helpless Sometimes I step aside Roland laughed at that  the dry sound of a stick broken over a knee Do you know what you are King shook his head His lower lip had pooched out like that of a sulky child Do you know what you are The father first The husband second The writer third Then the brother After brotherhood I am silent Okay No Not ohkay Do you know what you are A long pause No I told you all I can Stop asking me Ill stop when you speak true Do you know   Yes all right I know what youre getting at Satisfied Not yet Tell me what   Im Gan orpossessed by Gan I dont know which maybe theres no difference King began to cry His tears were silent and horrible But its not Dis I turned aside from Dis Irepudiate Dis and that should be enough but its not ka is never satisfied greedy old ka thats whatshe said isnt it What Susan Delgado said before you killed her or I killed her or Gan killed her Greedy old ka how I hate it Regardless of who killed herI made her say that I for I hate it so I do I buck against kas goad and will until the day I go into the clearing at the end of the path Roland sat at the table white at the sound of Susans name And still ka comes to me comesfrom me I translate it ammade to translate it ka flows out of my navel like a ribbon I am not ka I am not the ribbon its just what comes through me and I hate it I hate it The chickens were full ofspiders do you understand that full ofspiders  Stop your snivelment Roland said with a remarkable lack of sympathy to Eddies way of thinking and King stilled The gunslinger sat thinking then raised his head Why did you stop writing the story when I came to the Western Sea Are you dumb BecauseI dont want to be Gan I turned aside from Dis I should be able to turn aside from Gan as well I love my wife I love my kids I love to write stories but I dont want to writeyour story Im always afraid He looks for me The Eye of the King But not since you stopped Roland said No since then he looks for me not he sees me not Nevertheless you must go on Kings face twisted as if in pain then smoothed out into the previous look of sleep Roland raised his mutilated right hand When you do youll start with how I lost my fingers Do you remember Lobstrosities King said Bit them off And how do you know that King smiled a little and made a gentlewissshhh ing sound The wind blows said he Gan bore the world and moved on Roland replied Is that what you mean to say Aye and the world would have fallen into the abyss if not for the great turtle Instead of falling it landed on his back So were told and we all say thank ya Start with the lobstrosities biting off my fingers Dadajum dadajingers goddam lobsters bit off your fingers King said and actually laughed Yes Would have saved me a lot of trouble if youd died Roland son of Steven I know Eddie and my other friends as well A ghost of a smile touched the corners of the gunslingers mouth Then after the lobstrosities   Eddie comes Eddie comes King interrupted and made a dreamy little flapping gesture with his right hand as if to say he knew all that and Roland shouldnt waste his time The Prisoner the Pusher the Lady of Shadows The butcher the baker the candlemistaker He smiled Thats how my son Joe says it When Roland blinked caught by surprise When whenwhen  King raised his hand and Eddie watched with surprise as the toaster the waffle maker and the drainer full of clean dishes rose and floated in the sunshine Are you asking me when you should start again Yes yesyes  A knife rose out of the floating dish drainer and flew the length of the room There it stuck quivering in the wall Then everything settled back into place again Roland said Listen for the song of the Turtle the cry of the Bear Song of Turtle cry of Bear Maturin from the Patrick OBrian novels Shardik from the Richard Adams novel Yes If you say so Guardians of the Beam Yes Ofmy Beam Roland looked at him fixedly Do you say so Yes Then let it be so When you hear the song of the Turtle or the cry of the Bear then you must start again When I open my eye to your world he sees me A pauseIt I know Well try to protect you at those times just as we intend to protect the rose King smiled I love the rose Have you seen it Eddie asked Indeed I have in New York Up the street from the UN Plaza Hotel It used to be in the deli Tom and Jerrys In the back Now its in the vacant lot where the deli was Youll tell our story until youre tired Roland said When you cant tell any more when the Turtles song and the Bears cry grow faint in your ears then will you rest And when you can begin again youwill begin again You   Roland Sai King Ill do as you say Ill listen for the song of the Turtle and each time I hear it Ill go on with the tale If I live But you must listen too Forher song Whose Susannahs The baby will kill her if you arent quick And your ears must be sharp Eddie looked at Roland frightened Roland nodded It was time to go Listen to me sai King Were wellmet in Bridgton but now we must leave you Good King said and he spoke with such unfeigned relief that Eddie almost laughed You will stay here right where you are for ten minutes Do you understand Yes Then youll wake up Youll feel very well You wont remember that we were here except in the very deepest depths of your mind In the mudholes The mudholes do ya On top youll think you had a nap A wonderful refreshing nap Youll get your son and go to where youre supposed to go Youll feel fine Youll go on with your life Youll write many stories but every one will be to some greater or lesser degree about this story Do you understand Yar King said and he sounded so much like Roland when Roland was gruff and tired that Eddies back pricked up in gooseflesh again Because whats seen cant be unseen Whats known cant be unknown He paused Save perhaps in death Aye perhaps Every time you hear the song of the Turtle  if thats what it sounds like to you  youll start on our story again The only real story you have to tell And well try to protect you Im afraid I know but well try   Its notthat Im afraid of not being able to finish His voice lowered Im afraid the Tower will fall and Ill be held to blame That is up to ka not you Roland said Or me Ive satisfied myself on that point And now   He nodded to Eddie and stood up Wait King said Roland looked at him eyebrows raised I am allowed mail privileges but only once Sounds like a guy in a POW campEddie mused And aloud Who allows you mail privileges SteveO Kings brow wrinkled Gan he asked Is it Gan Then like the sun breaking through on a foggy morning his brow smoothed out and he smiled I think itsme  he said I can send a letter to myselfperhaps even a small packagebut only once His smile broadened into an engaging grin All of thissort of like a fairytale isnt it Yes indeed Eddie said thinking of the glass palace theyd come to straddling the Interstate in Kansas What would you do Roland asked To whom would you send mail To Jake King said promptly And what would you tell him Kings voice became Eddie Deans voice It wasnt an approximation it wasexact The sound turned Eddie cold Dadachum dadachee King lilted not to worry youve got the key They waited for more but it seemed there was no more Eddie looked at Roland and this time it was the younger mans turn to twirl his fingers in the letsgo gesture Roland nodded and they started for the door That was fuckingA creepy Eddie said Roland didnt reply Eddie stopped him with a touch on the arm One other thing occurs to me Roland While hes hypnotized maybe you ought to tell him to quit drinking and smoking Especially the ciggies Hes a fiend for them Did you see this place Fuckin ashtrays everywhere Roland looked amused Eddie if one waits until the lungs are fully formed tobacco prolongs life not shortens it Its the reason why in Gilead everyone smoked but the very poorest and even they had their shuckies like as not Tobacco keeps away illsick vapors for one thing Many dangerous insects for another Everyone knows this The Surgeon General of the United States would be delighted to hear what everyone in Gilead knows Eddie said dryly What about the booze then Suppose he rolls his Jeep over some drunk night or gets on the Interstate going the wrong way and headons someone Roland considered it then shook his head Ive meddled with his mind  and ka itself  as much as I intend to As much as Idare to Well have to keep checking back over the years in anywhy do you shake your head at me The tale spins fromhim  Maybe so but we wont be able to check on him for twentytwo years unless we decide to abandon Susannahand Ill never do that Once we jump ahead to  theres no coming back Not in this world For a moment Roland made no reply just looked at the man leaning his behind against his kitchen counter asleep on his feet with his eyes open and his hair tumbled on his brow Seven or eight minutes from now King would awaken with no memory of Roland and Eddiealways assuming they were gone that was Eddie didnt seriously believe the gunslinger would leave Suze hung out on the linebut hed let Jake drop hadnt he Let Jake drop into the abyss once upon a time Then hell have to go it alone Roland said and Eddie breathed a sigh of relief Sai King Yes Roland Remember  when you hear the song of the Turtle you must put aside all other things and tell this story I will At least Ill try Good Then the writer said The ball must be taken off the board and broken Roland frowned Which ball Black Thirteen If it wakes it will become the most dangerous thing in the universe And its waking now In some other place Some other where and when Thank you for your prophecy sai King Dadashim dadashower Take the ball to the double Tower To this Roland shook his head in silent bewilderment Eddie put a fist to his forehead and bent slightly Hile wordslinger King smiled faintly as if this were ridiculous but said nothing Long days and pleasant nights Roland told him You dont need to think about the chickens anymore An expression of almost heartbreaking hope spread across Stephen Kings bearded face Do you really say so I really do And may we meet again on the path before we all meet in the clearing The gunslinger turned on his bootheel and left the writers house Eddie took a final look at the tall rather stooped man standing with his narrow ass propped against the counter He thoughtThe next time I see you Stevie  if I do  your beard will be mostly white and therell be lines around your faceand Ill still be young Hows your bloodpressure sai Good to go for the next twentytwo years Hope so What about your ticker Does cancer run in your family and if it does how deep There was time for none of these questions of course Or any others Very soon the writer would be waking up and going on with his life Eddie followed his dinh out into the latening afternoon and closed the door behind him He was beginning to think that when ka had sent them here instead of to New York City it had known what it was doing after all Twelve Eddie stopped on the drivers side of John Cullums car and looked across the roof at the gunslinger Did you see that thing around him That black haze The todana yes Thank your father that its still faint Whats a todana Sounds like todash Roland nodded Its a variation of the word It means deathbag Hes been marked Jesus Eddie said Its faint I tell you But there Roland opened his door We can do nothing about it Ka marks the time of each man and woman Lets move Eddie But now that they were actually ready to get rolling again Eddie was queerly reluctant to go He had a sense of things unfinished with sai King And he hated the thought of that black aura What about Turtleback Lane and the walkins I meant to ask him   We can find it Are you sure Because I think we need to go there I think so too Come on Weve got a lot of work ahead of us Thirteen The taillights of the old Ford had hardly cleared the end of the driveway before Stephen King opened his eyes The first thing he did was look at the clock Almost four He should have been rolling after Joe ten minutes ago but the nap hed taken had done him good He felt wonderful Refreshed Cleaned out in some weird way He thoughtIf every nap could do that taking them would be a national law Maybe so but Betty Jones was going to be seriously worried if she didnt see the Cherokee turning into her yard by fourthirty King reached for the phone to call her but his eyes fell to the pad on the desk below it instead The sheets were headed CALLING ALL BLOWHARDS A little something from one of his sistersinlaw Face going blank again King reached for the pad and the pen beside it He bent and wrote Dadachum dadachee not to worry youve got the key He paused looking fixedly at this then wrote Dadachud dadached see it Jake The key is red He paused again then wrote Dadachum dadachee give this boy a plastic key He looked at what he had written with deep affection Almost love God almighty but he felt fine These lines meant nothing at all and yet writing them afforded a satisfaction so deep it was almost ecstasy King tore off the sheet Balled it up Ate it It stuck for a moment in his throat and then  ulp  down it went Good deal He snatched the adachee key to the Jeep off the wooden keyboard which was itself shaped like a key and hurried outside Hed get Joe theyd come back here and pack theyd grab supper at Mickey Kees in South Paris Correction MickeyDeesHe felt he could eat a couple of Quarter Pounders all by himself Fries tooDamn but he felt good When he reached Kansas Road and turned toward town he flipped on the radio and got the McCoys singing Hang On Sloopy  always excellent His mind drifted as it so often did while listening to the radio and he found himself thinking of the characters from that old storyThe Dark Tower Not that there were many left as he recalled hed killed most of them off even the kid Didnt know what else to do with him probably That was usually why you got rid of characters because you didnt know what else to do with them What had his name been Jack No that was the haunted Dad inThe Shining TheDark Tower kid had beenJake Excellent choice of name for a story with a Western motif something right out of Wayne D Overholser or Ray Hogan Was it possible Jake could come back into that story maybe as a ghost Of course he could The nice thing about tales of the supernatural King reflected was that nobody had toreally die They could always come back like that guy Barnabas onDark Shadows Barnabas Collins had been a vampire Maybe thekid comes back as a vampire King said and laughed Watch out Roland dinner is served and dinner be you But that didnt feel right What then Nothing came but that was all right In time something might Probably when he least expected it while feeding the cat or changing the baby or just walking dully along as Auden said in that poem about suffering No suffering today Today he feltgreat Yar just call me Tony the Tiger On the radio the McCoys gave way to Troy Shondell singing This Time ThatDark Tower thing had been sort of interesting actually King thoughtMaybe when we get back from up north I ought to dig it out Take a look at it Not a bad idea STAVE Commalacomecall We hail the One who made us all Who made the men and made the maids Who made the great and small RESPONSE Commalacomecall He made the great and small And yet how great the hand of fate That rules us one and all One Don Callahan had had many dreams of returning to America Usually they began with him waking up under a high fair desert sky full of the puffy clouds baseball players call angels or in his own rectory bed in the town of Jerusalems Lot Maine No matter which locale it happened to be hed be nearly overwhelmed with relief his first instinct for prayerOh thank God Thank God it was only a dream and finally I am awake He was awake now no question of that He turned a complete circle in the air and saw Jake do exactly the same in front of him He lost one of his sandals He could hear Oy yapping and Eddie roaring in protest He could hear taxi horns that sublime New York street music and something else as well a preacher Really cruising along by the sound of him Third gear at least Maybe overdrive One of Callahans ankles clipped the side of the Unfound Door as he went through and there was a burst of terrific pain from that spot Then the ankle and the area around it went numb There was a speedy riffle of todash chimes like a thirtythreeandathird record played at fortyfive rpm A buffet of conflicting air currents hit him and suddenly he was smelling gasoline and exhaust instead of the Doorway Caves dank air First street music now street perfume For a moment there weretwo preachers Henchick behind roaringBehold the door opens and another one ahead bellowingSay GAWD brotha thats right say GAWD on Second Avenue More twinsCallahan thought there was time for that  and then the door behind him blammed shut and the only Godshouter was the one on Second Avenue Callahan also had time to thinkWelcome home you sonofabitch welcome back to America and then he landed Two It was quite an allout crash but he came down hard on his hands and knees His jeans protected the latter parts to some degree although they tore but the sidewalk scraped what felt like an acre of skin from his palms He heard the rose singing powerfully and undisturbed Callahan rolled over onto his back and looked up at the sky snarling with pain holding his bleeding buzzing hands in front of his face A drop of blood from the left one splashed onto his cheek like a tear Where the fuck didyou come from my friend asked an astounded black man in gray fatigues He seemed to have been the only one to mark Don Callahans dramatic reentry into America He was staring down at the man on the sidewalk with wide eyes Oz Callahan said and sat up His hands stung fiercely and now his ankle was back complaining in loudyowpyowpyowp bursts of pain that were in perfect synch with his elevated heartbeat Go on fella Get out of here Im okay so twentythree skidoo Whatever you say bro Later The man in the gray fatigues  a janitor just offshift was Callahans guess  started walking He favored Callahan with one final glance  still amazed but already beginning to doubt what hed seen  and then skirted the little crowd listening to the street preacher A moment later he was gone Callahan got to his feet and stood on one of the steps leading up to Hammarskjld Plaza looking for Jake He didnt see him He looked the other way for the Unfound Door but that was gone too Now listen my friends Listen I say God I say GodsloveI say gimme hallelujah Hallelujah said a member of the street preachers crowd not really sounding all that into it I say amen thank you brotha Now listen because this is Americas time of TESTING and America is FAILING her TEST This country needs a BOMB not a newkewlar one but a GAWDBOMB can you say hallelujah Jake Callahan shouted Jake where are you Jake OyThat was Jake his voice raised in a screamOy LOOK OUT There was a yapping excited bark Callahan would have recognized anywhere Then the scream of locked tires The blare of a horn And the thud Three Callahan forgot about his bashed ankle and sizzling palms He ran around the preachers little crowd it had turned as one to the street and the preacher had quit his rant in midflow and saw Jake standing in Second Avenue in front of a Yellow Cab that had slewed to a crooked stop no more than an inch from his legs Blue smoke was still drifting up from its rear tires The drivers face was a pallid craning O of shock Oy was crouched between Jakes feet To Callahan the bumbler looked freaked out but otherwise all right The thud came again and yet again It was Jake bringing his balledup fist down on the hood of the taxiAsshole Jake yelled at the pallid O on the other side of the windshieldThud Why dont you   Thud   watch where   THUD   the fuck youre GOING THUDTHUD You give it to im Cholly yelled someone from across the street where perhaps three dozen people had stopped to watch the fun The taxis door opened The long tall helicopter who stepped out was wearing what Callahan thought was called a dashiki over jeans and huge mutant sneakers with boomerangs on the sides There was a fez on his head which probably accounted somewhat for the impression of extreme height but not entirely Callahan guessed the guy was at least six and a half feet tall fiercely bearded and scowling at Jake Callahan started toward this developing scene with a sinking heart barely aware that one of his feet was bare slapping the pavement with every other step The street preacher was also moving toward the developing confrontation Behind the taxi stopped in the intersection another driver interested in nothing but his own scheduled evening plans laid on his horn with both hands  WHEEEOOOONNNNNNK  and leaned out his window hollering Move it Abdul youre blockin the box Jake paid no attention He was in a total fury This time he brought both fists down on the hood of the taxi like Ratso Rizzo inMidnight Cowboy  THUD You almost ran my friend down you asshole did you even LOOK   THUD   where you were GOING Before Jake could bring his fists down on the hood of the taxi again  which he obviously meant to do until he was satisfied  the driver grabbed his right wrist Stop doing that you little punk he cried in an outraged and strangely high voice I am telling you   Jake stepped back breaking free of the tall taxi drivers grip Then in a liquid motion too quick for Callahan to follow the kid yanked the Ruger from the dockers clutch under his arm and pointed it at the drivers nose Tell mewhat  Jake raged at him Tell mewhat That you were driving too fast and almost ran down my friend That you dont want to die here in the street with a hole in your head Tell meWHAT  A woman on the far side of Second Avenue either saw the gun or caught a whiff of Jakes homicidal fury She screamed and started hurrying away Several more followed her example Others gathered at the curb smelling blood Incredibly one of them  a young man wearing his hat turned around backward  shouted Go on kid Ventilate that cameljockey The driver backed up two steps his eyes widening He held up his hands to his shoulders Do not shoot me boy Please Then say youre sorry Jake raved If you want to live you cry my pardon And his Andhis  Jakes skin was dead pale except for tiny red spots of color high up on his cheekbones His eyes were huge and wet What Don Callahan saw most clearly and liked least was the way the barrel of the Ruger was trembling Say youre sorry for the way you were driving you careless motherfucker Do it nowDo it now  Oy whined uneasily and said Ake Jake looked down at him When he did the taxi driver lunged for the gun Callahan hit him with a fairly respectable right cross and the driver sprawled against the front of his car his fez tumbling from his head The driver behind him had clear lanes on either side and could have swung around but continued to lay on his horn instead yellingMove it buddy move it Some of the spectators on the far side of Second were actually applauding like spectators at a Madison Square Garden fight and Callahan thoughtWhy this place is a madhouse Did I know that before and forget or is it something I just learned The street preacher a man with a beard and long white hair that descended to his shoulders was now standing beside Jake and when Jake started to raise the Ruger again the preacher laid a gentle unhurried hand on the boys wrist Holster it boy he said Stick it away praise Jesus Jake looked at him and saw what Susannah had seen not long before a man who looked eerily like Henchick of the Manni Jake put the gun back into the dockers clutch then bent and picked up Oy The bumbler whined stretched his face toward Jakes on his long neck and began to lick the boys cheek Callahan meanwhile had taken the drivers arm and was leading him back toward his hack He fished in his pocket and palmed a tendollar bill which was about half the money theyd managed to put together for this little safari All over he said to the driver speaking in what he hoped was a soothing voice No harm no foul you go your way he goes his   And then past the hackie yelling at the relentless hornhonker Horn works you nimrod so why not give it a rest and try your lights That little bastard was pointing the gun at me said the taxi driver He felt on his head for his fez and didnt find it Its only a model Callahan said soothingly The kind of thing you build from a kit doesnt even fire pellets I assure y   Hey pal cried the street preacher and when the taxi driver looked the preacher underhanded him the faded red fez With this back on his head the driver seemed more willing to be reasonable More willing yet when Callahan pressed the ten into his hand The guy behind the cab was driving an elderly whale of a Lincoln Now he laid on his horn again You may be biting my crank Mr Monkeymeat the taxi driver yelled at him and Callahan almost burst out laughing He started toward the guy in the Lincoln When the taxi driver tried to join him Callahan put his hands on the mans shoulders and stopped him Let me handle this Im a religious Making the lion lie down with the lamb is my job The street preacher joined them in time to hear this Jake had retired to the background He was standing beside the street preachers van and checking Oys legs to make sure he was uninjured Brother the street preacher addressed Callahan May I ask your denomination Your I say hallelujah yourview of theAlmighty  Im a Catholic Callahan said Therefore I view the Almightys a guy The street preacher held out a large gnarled hand It produced exactly the sort of fervent justshortofcrushing grip Callahan had expected The mans cadences combined with his faint Southern accent made Callahan think of Foghorn Leghorn in the Warner Bros cartoons Im Earl Harrigan the preacher said continuing to wring Callahans fingers Church of the Holy GodBomb Brooklyn and America A pleasure to meet you Father Im sort of semiretired Callahan said If you have to call me something make it Pere Or just Don Don Callahan Praise Jesus Father Don Callahan sighed and supposed Father Don would have to do He went to the Lincoln The cab driver meanwhile scooted away with his OFF DUTY light on Before Callahan could speak to the Lincolns driver that worthy got out on his own It was Callahans night for tall men This one went about sixthree and was carrying a large belly Its all over Callahan told him I suggest you get back in your car and drive out of here It aint over until I say its over Mr Lincoln demurred I got Abduls medallion number what I want from you Sparky is the name and address of that kid with the dog I also want a closer look at the pistol he just  ow ow OWW OWWWWW Quit it Reverend Earl Harrigan had seized one of Mr Lincolns hands and twisted it behind his back Now he seemed to be doing something creative to the mans thumb Callahan couldnt see exactly what it was The angle was wrong God loves you so much Harrigan said speaking quietly into Mr Lincolns ear And what He wants in return you loudmouth shithead is for you to give me hallelujah and then go on your way Can you give me hallelujah OWW OWWW let go Police POLEECE Only policeman apt to be on this block around now would be Officer Benzyck and hes already given me my nightly ticket and moved on By now hell be in Denniss having a pecan waffle and double bacon praise God so I want you to think about this There came a cracking sound from behind Mr Lincolns back that set Callahans teeth on edge He didnt like to think Mr Lincolns thumb had made that sound but didnt know what else it could have been Mr Lincoln cocked his head skyward on his thick neck and let out a long exhalation of pure pain  Yaaaahhhhhhh You want to give me hallelujah brother advised Rev Harrigan or youll be praise God carrying your thumb home in your breast pocket Hallelujah whispered Mr Lincoln His complexion had gone an ocher shade Callahan thought some of that might be attributable to the orangey streetlamps which at some point had replaced the fluorescents of his own time Probably not all of it though Good Now say amen Youll feel better when you do AAmen Praise God Praise Jeeeeeeeeesus Let me golet go of mythumb   Are you going to get out of here and stop blocking this intersection if I do Yes Without any more fiddlededee or hideyho praise Jesus Yes Harrigan leaned yet closer to Mr Lincoln his lips stopping less than half an inch from a large plug of yelloworange wax caught in the cup of Mr Lincolns ear Callahan watched this with fascination and complete absorption all other unresolved issues and unfulfilled goals for the time being forgotten The Pere was more than halfway to believing that if Jesus had had Earl Harrigan on His team it probably would have been old Pontius who ended up on the cross My friend bombs will soon begin to fall Godbombs And you have to choose whether you want to be among those who are praise Jesus up in the skydropping those bombs or those who are in the villages below getting blown to smithereens Now I sense this isnt the time or place for you to make a choice for Christ but will you at least think about these things sir Mr Lincolns response must have been a tad slow for Rev Harrigan because that worthy did something else to the hand he had pinned behind Mr Lincolns back Mr Lincoln uttered another high breathless scream I said will youthink about these things Yes Yes Yes Then get in your car and drive away and God bless you and keep you Harrigan released Mr Lincoln Mr Lincoln backed away from him eyes wide and got back into his car A moment later he was driving down Second Avenue  fast Harrigan turned to Callahan and said Catholics are going to Hell Father Don Idolators each and every one of them they bow to the Cult of Mary And the Pope Dont get me started onhim Yet I have known some fine Catholic folks and have no doubt youre one of them It may be I can pray you through to a change of faith Lacking that I may be able to pray you through the flames He looked back at the sidewalk in front of what now seemed to be called Hammarskjld Plaza I believe my congregation has dispersed Sorry about that Callahan said Harrigan shrugged Folks dont come to Jesus in the summertime anyway he said matteroffactly They do a little windowshopping and then go back to their sinning Winters the time for serious crusadinggot to get you a little storefront where you can give em hot soup and hot scripture on a cold night He looked down at Callahans feet and said You seem to have lost one of your sandals my mackerelsnapping friend A new horn blared at them and a perfectly amazing taxi  to Callahan it looked like a newer version of the old VW Microbuses  went swerving past with a passenger yelling something out at them It probably wasnt happy birthday Also if we dont get out of the street faith may not be enough to protect us Four Hes all right Jake said setting Oy down on the sidewalk I flipped didnt I Im sorry Perfectly understandable the Rev Harrigan assured him What an interesting dog Ive never seen one that looked quite like that praise Jesus And he bent to Oy Hes a mixed breed Jake said tightly and he doesnt like strangers Oy showed how much he disliked and distrusted them by raising his head to Harrigans hand and flattening his ears in order to improve the stroking surface He grinned up at the preacher as if they were old old pals Callahan meanwhile was looking around It was New York and in New York people had a tendency to mind their business and let you mind yours but still Jake had drawn a gun Callahan didnt know how many folks had seen it but hedid know it would only take one to report it perhaps to this Officer Benzyck Harrigan had mentioned and put them in trouble when they could least afford it He looked at Oy and thoughtDo me a favor and dont say anything okay Jake can maybe pass you off as some new kind of Corgi or Border Collie hybrid but the minute you start talking that goes out the window So do me a favor and dont Good boy said Harrigan and after Jakes friend miraculously didnot respond by saying Oy the preacher straightened up I have something for you Father Don Just a minute Sir we really have to   I have something for you too son  praise Jesus say dear Lord But firstthis wont take but a second Harrigan ran to open the side door of his illegally parked old Dodge van ducked inside rummaged Callahan bore this for awhile but the sense of passing seconds quickly became too much Sir Im sorry but   Herethey are Harrigan exclaimed and backed out of the van with the first two fingers of his right hand stuck into the heels of a pair of battered brown loafers If youre less than a size twelve we can stuff em with newspaper More and I guess youre out of luck A twelve is exactly what I am Callahan said and ventured a praiseGod as well as a thankyou He was actually most comfortable in size eleven and a half shoes but these were close enough and he slipped them on with genuine gratitude And now we   Harrigan turned to the boy and said The woman youre after got into a cab right where we had our little dustup and no more than half an hour ago He grinned at Jakes rapidly changing expression  first astonishment then delight She said the other one is in charge that youd know who the other one was and where the other one is taking her Yeah to the Dixie Pig Jake said Lex and Sixtyfirst Pere we might still have time to catch her but only if we go right now She   No Harrigan said The woman who spoke to me  inside my head she spoke to me and clear as a bell praise Jesus  said you were to go to the hotel first Which hotel Callahan asked Harrigan pointed down Fortysixth Street to the Plaza  Park Hyatt Thats the only one in the neighborhoodand thats the direction she came from Thank you Callahan said Did she say why we were to go there No Harrigan said serenely I believe right around then the other one caught her blabbing and shut her up Then into the taxi and away she went Speaking of moving on   Jake began Harrigan nodded but also raised an admonitory finger By all means but remember that the Godbombs are going to fall Never mind the showers of blessing  thats for Methodist wimps and Episcopalian scuzzballs Thebombs are gonna fall And boys They turned back to him I know you fellas are as much Gods human children as I am for Ive smelled your sweat praise Jesus But what about the lady The laydeesfor in truth I blieve there were two of em What aboutthem  The woman you mets with us Callahan said after a brief hesitation Shes okay I wonder about that Harrigan said The Book says  praise God and praise His Holy Word  to beware of the strange woman for her lips drip as does the honeycomb but her feet go down to death and her steps take hold on hell Remove thy way from her and come not nigh the door of her house He had raised one lumpy hand in a benedictory gesture as he offered this Now he lowered it and shrugged That aint exact I dont have the memory for scripture that I did when I was younger and Bibleshoutin down south with my Daddy but I think you get the drift Book of Proverbs Callahan said Harrigan nodded Chapter five sayGawd  Then he turned and contemplated the building which rose into the night sky behind him Jake started away but Callahan stayed him with a touchalthough when Jake raised his eyebrows Callahan could only shake his head No he didnt know why All he knew was that they werent quite through with Harrigan yet This is a city stuffed with sin and sick with transgression the preacher said at last Sodom on the halfshell Gomorrah on a graham cracker ready for the Godbomb that will surely fall from the skies say hallelujah say sweet Jesus and gimme amen But this right here is a good place Agood place Can you boys feel it Yes Jake said Can youhear it Yes Jake and Callahan said together Amen I thought it would all stop when they tore down the little deli that stood here years and years ago But it didnt Those angelic voices   So speaks Gan along the Beam Jake said Callahan turned to him and saw the boys head cocked to one side his face wearing the calm look of entrancement Jake said So speaks Gan and in the voice of the can calah which some call angels Gan denies the can toi with the merry heart of the guiltless he denies the Crimson King and Discordia itself Callahan looked at him with wide eyes  frightened eyes  but Harrigan nodded matteroffactly as if he had heard it all before Perhaps he had There was a vacant lot after the deli and then they built this Two Hammarskjld Plaza And I thought Wellthatll end it and then Ill move on for Satans grip is strong and his hoof prints leave deep tracks in the ground and there no flower will bloom and no grain will grow Can you saysee lah He raised his arms his gnarly old mans hands trembling with the outriders of Parkinsons turned upward to the sky in that open immemorial gesture of praise and surrender Yet still it sings he said and dropped them Selah Callahan murmured You say true we say thank ya Itis a flower Harrigan said for once I went in there to see In the lobby somebody say hallelujah I say in thelobby between the doors to the street and the elevators to those upper floors where God knows how much dollarbill fuckery is done theres a little garden growing in the sun which falls through the tall windows a garden behind velvet ropes and the sign says GIVEN BY THE TET CORPORATION IN HONOR OF THE BEAME FAMILY AND IN MEMORY OF GILEAD  Does it Jake said and his face lit with a glad smile Do you say so sai Harrigan Boy if Im lyin Im dyinGawd bomb And in the middle of all those flowers there grows a single wild rose so beautiful that I saw it and wept as those by the waters of Babylon the great river that flows by Zion And the men coming and going in that place them with their briefcases stuffed full of Satans piecework many ofthem wept too Wept and went right on about their whores business as if they didnt even know They know Jake said softly You know what I think Mr Harrigan I think the rose is a secret their hearts keep and that if anyone threatened it most of them would fight to protect it Maybe to the death He looked up at Callahan Pere we have to go Yes Not a bad idea Harrigan agreed for mine eyes can see Officer Benzyck headed back this way and it might be well if you were gone when he gets here Im glad your furry little friend wasnt hurt son Thanks Mr Harrigan Praise God hes no more a dog than I am is he No sir Jake said smiling widely Beware that woman boys She put a thought in my head I call that witchcraft And she wastwo  Twinssaytwim aye Callahan said and then without knowing he meant to do it until it was done he sketched the sign of the cross in front of the preacher Thank you for your blessing heathen or not Earl Harrigan said clearly touched Then he turned toward the approaching NYPD patrolman and called cheerfully Officer Benzyck Good to see you and theres some jam right there on your collar praise God And while Officer Benzyck was studying the jam on his uniform collar Jake and Callahan slipped away Five Whooeee Jake said under his breath as they walked toward the brightly underlit hotel canopy A white limousine easily twice the size of any Jake had seen before and hed seen his share once his father had even taken him to the Emmys was offloading laughing men in tuxedos and women in evening dresses They came out in a seemingly endless stream Yes indeed Callahan said Its like being on a roller coaster isnt it Jake said Were not even supposed tobe here This was Roland and Eddies job We were just supposed to go see Calvin Tower Something apparently thought different Well it should have thought twice Jake said gloomily A kid and a priest with one gun between them Its a joke What are our chances if the Dixie Pig is full of vampires and low men unwinding on their day off Callahan did not respond to this although the prospect of trying to rescue Susannah from the Dixie Pig terrified him What was that Gan stuff you were spouting Jake shook his head I dont know  I can barely remember what I said I think its part of the touch Pere And do you know where I think I got it Mia The boy nodded Oy trotted neatly at his heel his long snout not quite touching Jakes calf And Im getting something else as well I keep seeing this black man in a jail cell Theres a radio playing telling him all these people are dead  the Kennedys Marilyn Monroe George Harrison Peter Sellers Itzak Rabin whoeverhe is I think it might be the jail in Oxford Mississippi where they kept Odetta Holmes for awhile But this is aman you see Not Susannah but aman  Yes with a toothbrush mustache and he wears funny little goldrimmed glasses like a wizard in a fairytale They stopped just outside the radiance of the hotels entrance A doorman in a green swallowtail coat blew an earsplitting blast on his little silver whistle hailing down a Yellow Cab Is it Gan do you think Is the black man in the jail cell Gan I dont know Jake shook his head with frustration Theres something about the Dogan too all mixed in And this comes from the touch Yes but its not from Mia or Susannah or you or me I think Jakes voice lowered I think I better figure out who that black man is and what he means to us because I think that what Im seeing comes from the Dark Tower itself He looked at Callahan solemnly In some ways were getting very close to it and thats why its so dangerous for the katet to be broken like it is In some ways were almost there Six Jake took charge smoothly and completely from the moment he stepped out of the revolving doors with Oy in his arms and then put the billybumbler down on the lobbys tile floor Callahan didnt think the kid was even aware of it and probably that was all to the good If he got selfconscious his confidence might crumble Oy sniffed delicately at his own reflection in one of the lobbys green glass walls then followed Jake to the desk his claws clicking faintly on the black and white marble squares Callahan walked beside him aware that he was looking at the future and trying not to goggle at it too obviously She was here Jake said Pere I can almost see her Both of them her and Mia Before Callahan could reply Jake was at the desk Cry pardon maam he said My name is Jake Chambers Do you have a message for me or a package or something Itd be either from Susannah Dean or maybe from a Miss Mia The woman peered down doubtfully at Oy for a moment Oy looked up at her with a cheery grin that revealed a great many teeth Perhaps these disturbed the clerk because she turned away from him with a frown and examined the screen of her computer Chambers she asked Yes maam Spoken in his best gettingalongwithgrownups voice It had been awhile since hed needed to use that one but it was still there Jake found and within easy reach I have something for you but its not from a woman Its from someone named Stephen King She smiled I dont suppose its the famous writer Do you know him No maam Jake said and snuck a sidewards glance at Callahan Neither of them had heard of Stephen King until recently but Jake understood why the name might give his current traveling companion the chills Callahan didnt look particularly chilly at the moment but his mouth had thinned to a single line Well she said I suppose its a common enough name isnt it Probably there arenormal Stephen Kings all over the United States who wish hed justI dont knowgive it arest  She voiced a nervous little laugh and Callahan wondered what had set her on edge Oy who got less doggy the longer you looked at him Maybe but Callahan thought it was more likely something in Jake something that whispereddanger Perhaps evengunslinger Certainly there was something in him that set him apart from other boysFar Callahan thought of him pulling the Ruger from the dockers clutch and sticking it under the unfortunate taxi drivers noseTell me that you were driving too fast and almost ran down my friend hed screamed his finger already white on the triggerTell me that you dont want to die here in the street with a hole in your head Was that the way an ordinary twelveyearold reacted to a nearmiss accident Callahan thought not He thought the desk clerk was right to be nervous As for himself Callahan realized he felt a little better about their chances at the Dixie Pig Not a lot but a little Seven Jake perhaps sensing something a little offkilter flashed the clerk his best gettingalongwithgrownups smile but to Callahan it looked like Oys too many teeth Just a moment she said turning away from him Jake gave Callahan a puzzled whats upwithherlook Callahan shrugged and spread his hands The clerk went to a cabinet behind her opened it looked through the contents of a box stored inside and returned to the desk with an envelope bearing the Plaza  Parks logo Jakes name  and something else  had been written on the front in what looked like halfscript and halfprinting Jake Chambers This is the Truth She slid it across the desk to him careful that their fingers should not touch Jake took it and ran his fingers down the length of it There was a piece of paper inside Something else as well A hard narrow strip He tore open the envelope and pulled out the paper Folded inside it was the slim white plastic rectangle of a hotel MagCard The note had been written on a cheeky piece of stationery headed CALLING ALL BLOWHARDS The message itself was only three lines long Dadachum dadachee not to worry youve got the key Dadachud dadached see it Jake The key is red Jake looked at the MagCard and watched color abruptly swirl into it turning it the color of blood almost instantly Couldnt be red until the message was readJake thought smiling a little at the ideas riddleish quality He looked up to see if the clerk had seen the MagCards transformation but she had found something which required her attention at the far end of the desk And Callahan was checking out a couple of women whod just come strolling in from the street He might be a Pere Jake reflected but his eye for the ladies still seemed to be in proper working order Jake looked back at the paper and was just in time to read the last line Dadachum dadachee give this boy a plastic key A couple of years before his mother and father had given him a Tyco Chemistry Set for Christmas Using the instruction booklet hed whipped up a batch of invisible ink The words written in the stuff had faded almost as quickly as these words were fading now only if you looked very closely you could still read the message written in chemistry set ink This one however was authenticallygone and Jake knew why Its purpose had been served There was no more need for it Ditto the line about the key being red and sure enough that was fading as well Only the first line remained as if he needed reminding Dadachum dadachee not to worry youve got the key HadStephen King sent this message Jake doubted it More likely one of the other players in the game  perhaps even Roland or Eddie  had used the name to get his attention Still hed run upon two things since arriving here that encouraged him enormously The first was the continued singing of the rose It was stronger than ever really even though a skyscraper had been built on the vacant lot The second was that Stephen King was apparently still alive twentyfour years after creating Jakes traveling companion And no longer just a writer but afamous writer Great For now things were still rattling precariously along the right set of tracks Jake grabbed Father Callahans arm and led him toward the gift shop and tinkling cocktail piano Oy followed padding at Jakes knee Along the wall they found a line of house phones When the operator answers Jake said tell her you want to talk to your friend Susannah Dean or toher friend Mia Shell ask me what room Callahan said Tell her you forgot but its on the nineteenth floor How do you   Itll be the nineteenth just trust me I do Callahan said The phone rang twice and then the operator asked how she could help Callahan told her He was connected and in some room on the nineteenth floor a telephone began to ring Jake watched the Pere begin to speak then subside into listening again with a small bemused smile on his face After a few moments he hung up Answering machine he said They have amachine that takes guests calls and then tapes messages What a wonderful invention Yeah Jake said Anyway we know for sure that shes out and for pretty sure she didnt leave anyone behind to watch her gunna But just in case He patted the front of his shirt which now concealed the Ruger As they crossed the lobby to the elevator bank Callahan said What do we want in her room I dont know Callahan touched him on the shoulder I think you do The doors of the middle elevator popped open and Jake got on with Oy still at heel Callahan followed but Jake thought he was all at once dragging his feet a little Maybe Jake said as they started up And maybe you do too Callahans stomach suddenly felt heavier as if hed just finished a large meal He supposed the added weight was fear I thought I was rid of it he said When Roland took it out of the church I really thought I was rid of it Some bad pennies just keep turning up Jake said Eight He was prepared to try his unique red key in every door on the nineteenth floor if he had to but Jake knew  was right even before they reached it Callahan did too and a sheen of sweat broke on his forehead It felt thin and hot Feverish Even Oy knew The bumbler whined uneasily Jake Callahan said We need to think this over That thing is dangerous Worse itsmalevolent  Thats why we gotta take it Jake said patiently He stood in front of  drumming the MagCard between his fingers From behind the door  and under it and through it  came a hideous drone like the singing voice of some apocalyptic idiot Mixed in was the sound of jangling outoftune chimes Jake knew the ball had the power to send you todash and in those dark and mostly doorless spaces it was all too possible to become lost forever Even if you found your way to another version of Earth it would have a queer darkness to it as if the sun were always on the verge of total eclipse Have you seen it Callahan asked Jake shook his head I have Callahan said dully and armed sweat from his forehead His cheeks had gone leaden Theres an Eye in it I think its the Crimson Kings eye I think its a part of him thats trapped in there forever and insane Jake taking that ball to a place where there are vampires and low men  servants of the King  would be like giving Adolf Hitler an Abomb for his birthday Jake knew perfectly well that Black Thirteen was capable of doing great perhaps illimitable damage But he knew something else as well Pere if Mia left Black Thirteen in this room and shes now going to wherethey are theyll know about it soon enough And theyll be after it in one of their big flashy cars before you can say Jack Robinson Cant we leave it for Roland Callahan asked miserably Yes Jake said Thats a good idea just like taking it to the Dixie Pig is a bad one But we cant leave it for himhere  Then before Callahan could say anything else Jake slid the bloodred MagCard into the slot above the doorknob There was a loud click and the door swung open Oy stay right here outside the door Ake He sat down curling his cartoon squiggle of a tail around his paws and looked at Jake with anxious eyes Before they went in Jake laid a cold hand on Callahans wrist and said a terrible thing Guard your mind Nine Mia had left the lights on and yet a queer darkness had crept into Room  since her departure Jake recognized it for what it was todash darkness The droning song of the idiot and the muffled jangling chimes were coming from the closet Its awakehe thought with mounting dismayIt was asleep before  dozing at least  but all this moving around woke it up What do I do Are the box and the bowling bag enough to make it safe Do I have anything that will make it safer Any charm any sigul As Jake opened the closet door Callahan found himself exerting all the force of his will  which was considerable  just to keep from fleeing That atonal humming and the occasional jangling chimes beneath it offended his ears and mind and heart He kept remembering the way station and how he had shrieked when the hooded man had opened the box Howslick the thing inside had been It had been lying on red velvetand it hadrolled Hadlooked at him and all the malevolent madness of the universe had been in that disembodied leering gaze I will not run Iwill notIf the boy can stay I can stay Ah but the boy was agunslinger and that made a difference He was more than kas child he was Roland of Gileads child as well his adopted son Dont you see how pale he is Hes as scared as you are for Christs sake Now get hold of yourself man Perhaps it was perverse but observing Jakes extreme pallor steadied him When an old bit of nonsense song occurred to him and he began to sing under his breath he steadied yet more Round and round the mulberry bush he sang in a whisper the monkey chased the weaselthe monkey thought twas all in fun Jake eased open the closet There was a room safe inside He tried  and nothing happened He paused to let the safe mechanism reset itself wiped sweat from his forehead with both hands they were shaking and tried again This time he punched  and the safe swung open Black Thirteens droning song and the contrapuntal jangle of the todash chimes both increased The sounds were like chilly fingers prying around in their heads And it can send you placesCallahan thoughtAll you have to do is let down your guard a little bitopen the bagopen the boxand thenoh the places youll go Pop goes the weasel True though he knew this to be part of himwanted to open the boxLusted to Nor was he the only one as he watched Jake knelt before the safe like a worshipper at an altar Callahan reached to stop him from lifting the bag out with an arm that seemed incredibly heavy It doesnt matter if you do or donta voice whispered in his mind It was sleepinducing that voice and incredibly persuasive Nonetheless Callahan kept reaching He grasped Jakes collar with fingers from which all feeling seemed to have departed No he said Dont His voice sounded draggy dispirited depressed When he pulled Jake to one side the boy seemed to go as if in slow motion or underwater The room now seemed lit by the sick yellow light that sometimes falls over a landscape before a ruinous storm As Callahan fell onto his own knees before the open safe he seemed to descend through the air for at least a full minute before touching down he heard the voice of Black Thirteen louder than ever It was telling him to kill the boy to open the boys throat and give the ball a refreshing drink of his warm lifes blood Then Callahan himself would be allowed to leap from the rooms window All the way down to Fortysixth Street you will praise meBlack Thirteen assured him in a voice both sane and lucid Do it Jake sighed Oh yes do it who gives a damn Ake Oy barked from the doorwayAke They both ignored him As Callahan reached for the bag he found himself remembering his final encounter with Barlow the king vampire  the Type One in Callahans own parlance  who had come to the little town of Salems Lot Found himself remembering how hed confronted Barlow in Mark Petries house with Marks parents lying lifeless on the floor at the vampires feet their skulls crushed and their ohsorational brains turned to jelly While you fall Ill let you whisper the name ofmyking Black Thirteen whisperedThe Crimson King As Callahan watched his hands grasp the bag  whatever had been there before NOTHING BUT STRIKES AT MIDWORLD LANES was now printed on the side  he thought of how his crucifix had first glared with some otherworldly light driving Barlow backand then had begun to darken again Open it Jake said eagerly Open it I want to see it Oy was barking steadily now Down the hall someone yelled Shut that dog up and was likewise ignored Callahan slipped the ghostwood box from the bag  the box that had spent such a blessedly quiet time hidden beneath the pulpit of his church in Calla Bryn Sturgis Now he would open it Now he would observe Black Thirteen in all its repellent glory And then die Gratefully Ten Sad to see a mans faith failthe vampire Kurt Barlow had said and then hed plucked Don Callahans dark and useless cross from his hand Why had he been able to do that Because  behold the paradox consider the riddle  Father Callahanhad failed to throw the cross away himself Because he had failed to accept that the cross was nothing but one symbol of a far greater power one that ran like a river beneath the universe perhaps beneath a thousand universes  I need no symbolCallahan thought and thenIs that why God let me live Was He giving me a second chance to learn that It was possible he thought as his hands settled on the lid of the box Second chances were one of Gods specialties Folks you got to shut your dogup  The querulous voice of a hotel maid but very distant Then it said Madre de Dioswhys it sodark in here Whats thatwhats thatnn Perhaps she was trying to saynoise If so she never finished Even Oy now seemed resigned to the spell of the humming singing ball for he gave up his protests and his post at the door to come trotting into the room Callahan supposed the beast wanted to be at Jakes side when the end came The Pere struggled to still his suicidal hands The thing in the box raised the volume of its idiots song and the tips of his fingers twitched in response Then they stilled againI have that much of a victory Callahan thought NemineIll do it The voice of the maid drugged and avid I want to see itDios I want tohold it Jakes arms seemed to weigh a ton but he forced them to reach out and grab the maid a middleaged Hispanic lady who couldnt have weighed more than a hundred and five pounds As he had struggled to still his hands so Callahan now struggled to pray God not my will but Thine Not the potter but the potters clay If I cant do anything else help me to take it in my arms and jump out the window and destroy the godsdamned thing once and for all But if it be Your will to help me make it still instead  to make it go back to sleep  then send me Your strength And help me to remember Drugged by Black Thirteen he might have been but Jake still hadnt lost his touch Now he plucked the rest of the thought out of the Peres mind and spoke it aloud only changing the word Callahan used to the one Roland had taught them I need no sigul Jake said Not the potter but the potters clayand I need no sigul  God Callahan said The word was as heavy as a stone but once it was out of his mouth the rest of them came easier God if Youre still there if You still hear me this is Callahan Please still this thing Lord Please send it back to sleep I ask it in the name of Jesus In the name of the White Jake said IteOy yapped Amen said the maid in a stoned bemused voice For a moment the droning idiots song from the box rose another notch and Callahan understood it was hopeless that not even God Almighty could stand against Black Thirteen Then it fell silent God be thanked he whispered and realized his entire body was drenched with sweat Jake burst into tears and picked up Oy The chambermaid also began to weep but had no one to comfort her As Pere Callahan slid the meshy and oddly heavy material of the bowling bag back around the ghostwood box Jake turned to her and said You need to take a nap sai It was the only thing he could think of and it worked The maid turned and walked across to the bed She crawled up on it pulled her skirt down over her knees and appeared to fall unconscious Will it stay asleep Jake asked Callahan in a low voice BecausePerethat was too close for comfort Perhaps but Callahans mind suddenly seemed free  freer than it had been in years Or perhaps it was his heart that had been freed In any case his thoughts seemed very clear as he lowered the bowling bag to the folded drycleaning bags on top of the safe Remembering a conversation in the alley behind Home He and Frankie Chase and Magruder out on a smokebreak The talk had turned to protecting your valuables in New York especially if you had to go away for awhile and Magruder had said the safest storage in New Yorkthe absolute safest storage Jake theres also a bag of plates in the safe Orizas Yes Get them While he did Callahan went to the maid on the bed and reached into the left skirt pocket of her uniform He brought out a number of plastic MagCards a few regular keys and a brand of mints hed never heard of  Altoids He turned her over It was like turning a corpse Whatre you doing Jake whispered He had put Oy down so he could sling the silklined reed pouch over his shoulder It was heavy but he found the weight comforting Robbing her what does it look like the Pere replied angrily Father Callahan of the Holy Roman Catholic Church is robbing a hotel maid Or would if she had anyah In the other pocket was the little roll of bills hed been hoping for She had been performing turndown service when Oys barking had distracted her This included flushing the john pulling the shades turning down the bed and leaving what the maids called pillow candy Sometimes patrons tipped for the service This maid was carrying two tens three fives and four ones Ill pay you back if our paths cross Callahan told the unconscious maid Otherwise just consider it your service to God Whiiiitethe maid said in the slurred whisper of one who talks and yet sleeps Callahan and Jake exchanged a look Eleven In the elevator going back down Callahan held the bag containing Black Thirteen and Jake carried the one with the Rizas inside He also carried their money It now came to a total of fortyeight dollars Will it be enough It was his only question after hearing the Peres plan for disposing of the ball a plan which would necessitate another stop I dont know and I dont care Callahan replied They were speaking in the low voices of conspirators although the elevator was empty save for them If I can rob a sleeping chambermaid stiffing a cab driver should be a leadpipe cinch Yeah Jake said He was thinking that Roland had done more than rob a few innocent people during his quest for the Tower hed killed a good many as well Lets just get this done and then find the Dixie Pig You dont have to worry so much you know Callahan said If the Tower falls youll be among the very first to know Jake studied him After a moment or two of this Callahan cracked a smile He couldnt help it Not that funny sai Jake said and they went out into the dark of that early summers night in the year of  Twelve It was quarter to nine and there was still a residue of light across the Hudson when they arrived at the first of their two stops The taximeters tale was nine dollars and fifty cents Callahan gave the cabbie one of the maids tens Mon dont hurt yosef the driver said in a powerful Jamaican accent I dreadful fraid you might leave yosefshote  Youre lucky to get anything at all son Callahan said kindly Were seeing New York on a budget My woman got a budget too said the cabbie and then drove away Jake meanwhile was looking up Wow he said softly I guess I forgot howbig all this is Callahan followed his glance then said Lets get it done And as they hurried inside What are you getting from Susannah Anything Man with a guitar Jake said SingingI dont know And I should It was another one of those coincidences that arent coincidences like the owner of the bookstore being named Tower or Balazars joint turning out to be The Leaning Tower Some songI should know Anything else Jake shook his head Thats the last thing I got from her and it was just after we got into the taxi outside the hotel I think shes gone into the Dixie Pig and now shes out of touch He smiled faintly at the unintentional pun Callahan veered toward the building directory in the center of the huge lobby Keep Oy close to you Dont worry It didnt take Callahan long to find what he was looking for Thirteen The sign read LONGTERM STORAGE    MOS USE TOKENS TAKE KEY MANAGEMENT ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOST PROPERTY Below in a framed box was a list of rules and regulations which they both scanned closely From beneath their feet came the rumble of a subway train Callahan who hadnt been in New York for almost twenty years had no idea what train it might be where it might go or how deep in the citys intestine it might run Theyd already come down two levels by escalator first to the shops and then to here The subway station was deeper still Jake shifted the bag of Orizas to his other shoulder and pointed out the last line on the framed notice Wed get a discount if we were tenants he said Count Oy cried sternly Aye laddie Callahan agreed and if wishes were horses beggars would ride We dont need a discount Nor did they After walking through a metal detector no problem with the Orizas and past a rentacop dozing on a stool Jake determined that one of the smallest lockers  those on the far lefthand side of the long room  would accommodate the MIDWORLD LANES bag and the box inside To rent the box for the maximum length of time would cost twentyseven dollars Pere Callahan fed bills into the various slots of the tokendispensing machine carefully prepared for a malfunction of all the wonders and horrors hed seen during their brief time back in the city the latter including a twodollar taxi dropcharge this was in some ways the hardest to accept A vending machine that accepted paper currency A lot of sophisticated technology had to lie behind this machine with its dull brown finish and its sign commanding patrons to INSERT BILLS FACE UP The picture accompanying the command showed George Washington with the top of his head facing to the left but the bills Callahan fed into the machine seemed to work no matter which way the head was facing Just as long as the picture was on top Callahan was almost relieved when the machinedid malfunction once refusing to accept an old and wrinkled dollar bill The relatively crisp fives it gobbled up without a murmur dispensing little showers of tokens into the tray beneath Callahan gathered up twentyseven dollars worth of these started back toward where Jake was waiting and then turned around again curious about something He looked on the side of the amazing amazing to him at least it was currencyeating vending machine Toward the bottom on a series of little plaques was the information hed been looking for This was a ChangeMakR  manufactured in Cleveland Ohio but a lot of companies had chipped in General Electric DeWalt Electronics Showrie Electric Panasonic and at the bottom smallest of all but very much there North Central Positronics The snake in the gardenCallahan thoughtThis guy Stephen King who supposedly thought me up may only exist in one world but what do you bet North Central Positronics exists in all of them Sure because thats the Crimson Kings rig just like Sombras his rig and he only wants what any powermad despot in history has wanted to be everywhere own everything and basically control the universe Or bring it to darkness he murmured Pere Jake called impatientlyPere Im coming he said and hurried across to Jake with his hands full of shiny gold tokens Fourteen The key came out of Locker  after Jake had inserted nine of the tokens but he went on putting them in until all twentyseven were gone At this point the small glass porthole under the lockernumber turned red Maxed out Jake said with satisfaction They were still talking in those low mustntwakethebaby tones and this long cavernous room was indeed very quiet Jake guessed it would be bedlam at eight in the morning and five in the afternoon on working days with folks coming and going from the subway station below some of them storing their gear in the shortterm coinop lockers Now there was just the ghostly sound of conversation drifting down the escalator well from the few shops still open in the arcade and the rumble of another approaching train Callahan slid the bowling bag into the narrow opening Slid it back as far as it would go with Jake watching anxiously Then he closed the locker and Jake turned the key Bingo Jake said putting the key in his pocket Then with anxiety Will it sleep I think so Callahan said Like it did in my church If another Beam breaks it might wake up and work mischief but then if another Beam lets go   If another Beam lets go a little mischief wont matter Jake finished for him Callahan nodded The only thing iswell you know where were going And you know what were apt to find there Vampires Low men Other servants of the Crimson King maybe Possibly Walter the hooded man in black who sometimes shifted his shape and form and called himself Randall Flagg Possibly even the Crimson King himself Yes Jake knew If you have the touch Callahan continued we have to assume that some of them do too Its possible they could pick this place  and the lockernumber  out of our minds Were going to go in there and try to get her but we have to recognize that the chances of failure are fairly high Ive never fired a gun in my life and youre not  forgive me Jake but youre not exactly a battlehardened veteran Ive got one or two under my belt Jake said He was thinking about his time with Gasher And about the Wolves of course This is apt to be different Callahan said Im just saying it might be a bad idea for us to be taken alive If it comes to that Do you understand Dont worry Jake said in a tone of chilling comfort Dont worry about that Pere We wont be Fifteen Then they were outside again looking for another cab Thanks to the maids tipmoney Jake reckoned they had just about enough remaining cash to take them to the Dixie Pig And he had an idea that once they entered the Pig their need for ready cash  or anything else  would cease Heres one Callahan said and waved his arm in a flagging gesture Jake meanwhile looked back at the building from which they had just emerged Youre sure itll be safe there he asked Callahan as the cab swerved toward them honking relentlessly at a slowpoke between him and his fares According to my old friend sai Magruder thats the safest storage area in Manhattan Callahan said Fifty times safer than the coinop lockers in Penn Station and Grand Central he saidand of course here youve got the longterm storage option There are probably other storage places in New York but well be gone before they open  one way or the other The cab pulled over Callahan held the door for Jake and Oy hopped unobtrusively in right behind him Callahan spared one final glance at the twin towers of the World Trade Center before getting in himself Its good to go until June of two thousand and two unless someone breaks in and steals it Or if the building falls down on top of it Jake said Callahan laughed although Jake hadnt quite sounded as if he were joking Never happen And if it didwell one glass ball under a hundred and ten stories of concrete and steel Even a glass ball filled with deep magic Thatd be one way to take care of the nasty thing I guess Sixteen Jake had asked the cabbie to drop them off at Lexington and Fiftyninth just to be on the safe side and after looking to Callahan for approval he gave the sai all but their last two dollars On the corner of Lex and Sixtieth Jake pointed to a number of cigarette ends mashed into the sidewalk This is where he was he said The man playing the guitar He bent down picked up one of the butts and held it in his palm for a moment or two Then he nodded smiled cheerlessly and readjusted the strap on his shoulder The Orizas clanked faintly inside the rush bag Jake had counted them in the back of the cab and hadnt been surprised to find there were exactly nineteen No wonder she stopped Jake said dropping the butt and wiping his hand on his shirt And suddenly he sang low but perfectly on pitch I am a manof constant sorrowIve seen troubleall my daysIm bound to ridethat Northern railroadPerhaps Ill takethe very next train Callahan keyed up already felt his nerves crank yet tighter Of course he recognized the song Only when Susannah had sung it that night on the Pavilion  the same night Roland had won the hearts of the Calla by dancing the fiercest commala many had ever seen  shed substituted maid for man She gave him money Jake said dreamily And she said He stood with his head down biting his lip thinking hard Oy looked up at him raptly Nor did Callahan interrupt Understanding had come to him he and Jake were going to die in the Dixie Pig They would go down fighting but they were going to die there And he thought dying would be all right It was going to break Rolands heart to lose the boyyet he would go on As long as the Dark Tower stood Roland would go on Jake looked up She said Remember the struggle  Susannah did Yes Shecame forward Mia let her And the song moved Mia She wept Say true True Mia daughter of none mother of one And while Mia was distractedher eyes blind with tears Jake looked around Oy looked around with him likely not searching for anything but only imitating his beloved Ake Callahan was remembering that night on the Pavilion The lights The way Oy had stood on his hind legs and bowed to thefolken Susannah singing The lights The dancing Roland dancing the commala in the lights the colored lights Roland dancing in the white Always Roland and in the end after the others had fallen murdered away one by one in these bloody motions Roland would remain I can live with thatCallahan thoughtAnd die with it She left something but itsgone  Jake said in a distressed almostcrying voice Someone must have found itor maybe the guitarplayer saw her drop it and took itthis fucking city Everyone steals everything Ahshit  Let it go Jake turned his pale tired frightened face up to Callahans She left us something and weneed it Dont you understand how thin our chances are Yes If you want to back off Jake now would be the time The boy shook his head with no doubt nor the slightest hesitation and Callahan was fiercely proud of him Lets go Pere he said Seventeen On the corner of Lex and Sixtyfirst they stopped again Jake pointed across the street Callahan saw the green awning and nodded It was imprinted with a cartoon porker that was grinning blissfully in spite of having been roasted a bright and smoking red T HE DIXIE PIG was written on the awnings overhang Parked in a row in front of it were five long black limousines with their accent lights glowing a slightly blurred yellow in the dark Callahan realized for the first time that a mist was creeping down the Avenue Here Jake said and handed him the Ruger The boy rummaged in his pockets and came up with two big handfuls of cartridges They gleamed dully in the pervasive orange glow of the streetlamps Put em all in your breast pocket Pere Easier to get at that way all right Callahan nodded Ever shot a gun before No Callahan said Have you ever fired one of those plates Jakes lips parted in a grin Benny Slightman and I snuck a bunch of the practice dishes out to the riverbank and had a match one night He wasnt much good but Let me guess You were Jake shrugged then nodded He had no words to express how fine the plates had felt in his hands how savagely right But perhaps that was natural Susannah had also taken quickly and naturally to throwing the Oriza That Pere Callahan had seen for himself All right whats our plan Callahan asked Now that he had decided to go through it all the way to the end he was more than willing to give leadership over to the boy Jake was after all the gunslinger The boy shook his head Thereis none he said not really I go in first You right behind me Once were through the door we spread apart Ten feet between us any time we have ten feet to give Pere  do you understand So that no matter how many there are or howclose they are no one of them can get both of us at the same time This was Rolands teaching and Callahan recognized it as such He nodded Ill be able to follow her by touch and Oy will be able to by scent Jake said Move with us Shoot whatever asks to be shot and without hesitation do you understand Aye If you kill something that has what looks like a useful weapon take it If you can scoop it up on the move that is We have to keep moving We have to keep taking it to them We have to be relentless Can you scream Callahan considered it then nodded Scream at them Jake said Ill be doing the same And Ill be moving Maybe running more likely at a good fast walk Make sure that every time I look on my right I see the side of your face Youll see it Callahan said and thoughtUntil one of them drops me at least After we bring her out of there Jake am I a gunslinger Jakes grin was wolfish all his doubts and fears put behind him Khef ka and katet he said Look theres the WALK light Lets cross Eighteen The drivers seat of the first limo was empty There was a fellow in a cap and a uniform behind the wheel of the second but to Pere Callahan the sai looked asleep Another man in cap and uniform was leaning against the sidewalk side of the third limo The coal of a cigarette made a lazy arc from his side to his mouth and then back down again He glanced their way but with no appreciable interest What was there to see A man going on elderly a boy going on teenage and a scurrying dog Big deal When they gained the other side of Sixtyfirst Callahan saw a sign on a chrome stand in front of the restaurant CLOSED FOR PRIVATE FUNCTION What exactly did you call tonights function at the Dixie Pig Callahan wondered A baby shower A birthday party What about Oy he asked Jake in a low voice Oy stays with me Only four words but they were enough to convince Callahan Jake knew what he did this was their night to die Callahan didnt know if theyd manage to go out in a blaze of glory but they would be going out all three of them The clearing at the end of the path was now hidden from their view by only a single turn they would enter it three abreast And little as he wanted to die while his lungs were still clear and his eyes could still see Callahan understood that things could have been much worse Black Thirteen had been stuffed away in another dark place where it would sleep and if Roland did indeed remain standing when the hurlyburly was done the battle lost and won then he would track it down and dispose of it as he saw fit Meanwhile  Jake listen to me a second This is important Jake nodded but he looked impatient Do you understand that you are in danger of death and do you ask forgiveness for your sins The boy understood he was being given last rites Yes he said Are you sincerely sorry for those sins Yes Repent of them Yes Pere Callahan sketched the sign of the cross in front of himIn nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus   Oy barked Just once but with excitement And it was a bit muffled that bark for he had found something in the gutter and was holding it up to Jake in his mouth The boy bent and took it What Callahan asked What is it Its what she left for us Jake said He sounded enormously relieved almost hopeful again What she dropped while Mia was distracted and crying about the song Oh man  we might have a chance Pere We might just have a chance after all He put the object in the Peres hand Callahan was surprised by its weight and then struck almost breathless by its beauty He felt the same dawning of hope It was probably stupid but it was there all right He held the scrimshaw turtle up to his face and ran the pad of his index finger over the questionmarkshaped scratch on its shell Looked into its wise and peaceful eyes How lovely it is he breathed Is it the Turtle Maturin It is isnt it I dont know Jake said Probably She calls it theskldpadda and it may help us but it cant kill the harriers that are waiting for us in there He nodded toward the Dixie Pig Only we can do that Pere Will you Oh yes Callahan said calmly He put the turtle theskldpadda into his breast pocket Ill shoot until the bullets are gone or Im dead If I run out of bullets before they kill me Ill club them with the gunbutt Good Lets go givethem some last rites They walked past the CLOSED sign on its chrome post Oy trotting between them his head up and his muzzle wearing that toothy grin They mounted the three steps to the double doors without hesitating At the top Jake reached into the pouch and brought out two of the plates He tapped them together nodded at the dull ringing sound and then said Lets see yours Callahan lifted the Ruger and held the barrel beside his right cheek like a duelist Then he touched his breast pocket which bulged and drooped with shells Jake nodded satisfied Once were in we stay together Always together with Oy between On three And once we start we dont stop until were dead Never stop Right Are you ready Yes Gods love on you boy And on you Pere Onetwothree Jake opened the door and together they went into dim light and the sweet tangy smell of roasting pork STAVE Commalacomeki Theres a time to live and one to die With your back against the final wall Ya gotta let the bullets fly RESPONSE Commalacome ki Let the bullets fly Dont ee mourn for me my lads When it comes my day to die One Ka might have put that downtown bus where it was when Mias cab pulled up or it might only have been coincidence Certainly its the sort of question that provokes argument from the humblest streetpreacher can you give me hallelujah all the way up to the mightiest of theological philosophers can you give me a Socratic amen Some might consider it almost frivolous the mighty issues that loom their shadows behind the question however are anything but One downtown bus half empty But if it hadnt been there on the corner of Lex and Sixtyfirst Mia likely would never have noticed the man playing the guitar And had she not stopped to listen to the man playing the guitar who knows how much of what followed might have been different Two Awwwwman wouldja lookadat the cab driver exclaimed and lifted his hand to his windshield in an exasperated gesture A bus was parked on the corner of Lexington and Sixtyfirst its diesel engine rumbling and its taillights flashing what Mia took to be some kind of distress code The bus driver was standing by one of the rear wheels looking at the dark cloud of diesel smoke pouring from the buss rear vent Lady said the cab driver you mind getting off on the corner of Sixtieth Thabe all right Is itMia askedWhat should I say SureSusannah replied absentlySixtieths fine Mias question had called her back from her version of the Dogan where shed been trying to get in touch with Eddie Shed had no luck doing that and was appalled at the state of the place The cracks in the floor now ran deep and one of the ceiling panels had crashed down bringing the fluorescent lights and several long snarls of electrical cable with it Some of the instrument panels had gone dark Others were seeping tendrils of smoke The needle on the SUSANNAHMIO dial was all the way over into the red Below her feet the floor was vibrating and the machinery was screaming And saying that none of this was real it was all only a visualization technique kind of missed the whole point didnt it Shed shut down a very powerful process and her body was paying a price The Voice of the Dogan had warned her that what she was doing was dangerous that it wasnt in the words of a TV ad nice to fool Mother Nature Susannah had no idea which of her glands and organs were taking the biggest beating but she knew that theywere hers Not Mias It was time to call a halt to this madness before everything went skyhigh First though shed tried to get in touch with Eddie yelling his name repeatedly into the mike with NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS stamped on it Nothing Yelling Rolands name also brought no result If they were dead she would have known it She was sure of that But not to be able to get in touch with them atall what did that mean It mean you once mo been fucked mos righteous honeychileDetta told her and cackledThis what you get fo messin wit honkies I can get out hereMia was asking shy as a girl arriving at her first danceReally Susannah would have slapped her own brow had she had one God when it was about anything but her baby the bitch was so goddamtimid Yes go ahead Its only a single block and on the avenues the blocks are short The driverhow much should I give the driver Give him a ten and let him keep the change Here hold it out for me Susannah sensed Mias reluctance and reacted with weary anger This was not entirely without amusement Listen to me sweetheart I wash my hands of you Okay Give him any fucking bill you want No no its all rightHumble now FrightenedI trust you Susannah And she held up the remaining bills from Mats fanned out in front of her eyes like a hand of cards Susannah almost refused but what was the point Shecame forward took control of the brown hands holding the money selected a ten and gave it to the driver Keep the change she said Thanks lady Susannah opened the curbside door A robot voice began to speak when she did startling her  startling both of them It was someone named Whoopi Goldberg reminding her to take her bags For SusannahMia the question of her gunna was moot There was only one piece of baggage which concerned them now and of this Mia would soon be delivered She heard guitar music At the same time she felt her control over the hand stuffing money back into her pocket and the leg swinging out of the cab begin to ebb Mia taking over again now that Susannah had solved another of her little New York dilemmas Susannah began to struggle against this usurpation mybody goddammit mineat least from the waist up and that includes the head and the brain inside it  and then quit What was the use Mia was stronger Susannah had no idea why that should be but she knew that it was A kind of queerBushido fatalism had come over Susannah Dean by this point It was the sort of calmness that cloaks the drivers of cars skidding helplessly toward bridge overpasses the pilots of planes that heel over into their final dives their engines deadand gunslingers driven to their final cave or draw Later she might fight if fighting seemed either worthwhile or honorable She would fight to save herself or the baby but not Mia  this was her decision Mia had forfeited any chance of rescue she might once have deserved in Susannahs eyes For now there was nothing to do except maybe to turn the LABOR FORCE dial back to  She thought she would be allowed that much control Before that thoughthe music The guitar It was a song she knew and knew well She had sung a version of it to thefolken the night of their arrival in Calla Bryn Sturgis After all she had been through since meeting Roland hearing Man of Constant Sorrow on this New York streetcorner did not strike her as coincidental in the least And it was a wonderful song wasnt it Perhaps the vertex of all the folk songs she had so loved as a younger woman the ones that had seduced her step by step into activism and had led her finally to Oxford Mississippi Those days were gone  she felt ever so much older than she had then  but this songs sad simplicity still appealed to her The Dixie Pig was less than a block from here Once Mia had transported them through its doors Susannah would be in the Land of the Crimson King She had no doubts or illusions about that She did not expect to return from there did not expect to see either her friends or her beloved again and had an idea she might have to die with Mias cheated howls for companybut none of that had to interfere with her enjoyment of this song now Was it her deathsong If so fine Susannah daughter of Dan reckoned there could have been far worse Three The busker had set up shop in front of a caf called Blackstrap Molasses His guitar case was open in front of him its purple velvet interior exactly the same shade as the rug in sai Kings Bridgton bedroom can you say amen scattered with change and bills just so any unusually innocent passersby would know the right thing to do He was sitting on a sturdy wooden cube which looked exactly like the one upon which the Rev Harrigan stood to preach There were signs that he was almost through for the night He had put on his jacket which bore a New York Yankees patch on the sleeve and a hat withJOHN LENNON LIVES printed above the bill There had apparently been a sign in front of him but now it was back in his instrument case wordsside down Not that Mia would have known what was writ upon it in any case not she He looked at her smiled and quit his fingerpicking She raised one of the remaining bills and said Ill give you this if youll play that song again All of it this time The young man looked about twenty and while there was nothing very handsome about him with his pale spotty complexion the gold ring in one of his nostrils and the cigarette jutting from the corner of his mouth he had an engaging air His eyes widened as he realized whose face was on the bit of currency she was holding Lady for fifty bucks Id play every Ralph Stanley song I knowand I know quite a few of em Just this one will do us fine Mia said and tossed the bill It fluttered into the buskers guitar case He watched its prankish descent with disbelief Hurry Mia said Susannah was quiet but Mia sensed her listening My time is short Play And so the guitarplayer sitting on the box in front of the caf began to play a song Susannah had first heard in The Hungry i a song she had herself sung at God only knew how many hootenannies a song shed once sung behind a motel in Oxford Mississippi The night before they had all been thrown in jail that had been By then those three young voterregistration boys had been missing almost a month gone into the black Mississippi earth somewhere in the general vicinity of Philadelphia they were eventually found in the town of Longdale can you give me hallelujah can you please say amen That fabled White Sledgehammer had begun once more to swing in the redneck toolies but they had sung anyway Odetta Holmes  Det they called her in those days  had begun this particular song and then the rest of them joined in the boys singingman and the girls singingmaid Now rapt within the Dogan which had become her gulag Susannah listened as this young man unborn in those terrible old days sang it again The cofferdam of her memory broke wide open and it was Mia unprepared for the violence of these recollections who was lifted upon the wave Four In the Land of Memory the time is alwaysNow In the Kingdom of Ago the clocks tickbut their hands never move There is an Unfound Door O lost and memory is the key which opens it Five Their names are Cheney Goodman Schwerner these are those who fall beneath the swing of the White Sledgehammer on the th of June  O Discordia Six Theyre staying at a place called the Blue Moon Motor Hotel on the Negro side of Oxford Mississippi The Blue Moon is owned by Lester Bambry whose brother John is pastor of the First AfroAmerican Methodist Church of Oxford can you give me hallelujah can you say amen It is July th of  a month to the day after the disappearance of Cheney Goodman and Schwerner Three days after they disappeared somewhere around Philadelphia there was a meeting at John Bambrys church and the local Negro activists told the three dozen or so remaining white northerners that in light of what was now happening they were of course free to go home And some of themhavegone home praise God but Odetta Holmes and eighteen others stay Yes They stay at the Blue Moon Motor Hotel And sometimes at night they go out back and Delbert Anderson brings his guitar and they sing I Shall Be Released they sing and John Henry they sing gonna whop the steel on down great Gawd say Gawdbomb and they sing Blowin in the Wind and they sing Hesitation Blues by the Rev Gary Davis all of them laughing at the amiably risqu verses a dollar is a dollar and a dime is a dime I got a houseful of chillun aint none of em mine and they sing I Aint Marchin Anymore and they sing in the Land of Memory and the Kingdom of Ago they sing in the bloodheat of their youth in the strength of their bodies in the confidence of their minds they sing to deny Discordia to deny the can toi in affirmation of Gan the Maker Gan the Eviltaker they dont know these names they know all these names the heart sings what it must sing the blood knows what the blood knows on the Path of the Beam our hearts know all the secrets and they sing sing Odetta begins and Delbert Anderson plays she sings I am a maid of constant sorrowIve seen trouble all my daysI bid farewellto old Kentucky Seven So Mia was ushered through the Unfound Door and into the Land of Memory transported to the weedy yard behind Lester Bambrys Blue Moon Motor Hotel and so she heard  hears Eight Mia hears the woman who will become Susannah as she sings her song She hears the others join in one by one until they are all singing together in a choir and overhead is the Mississippi moon raining its radiance down on their faces  some black some white  and upon the cold steel rails of the tracks which run behind the hotel tracks which run south from here which run out to Longdale the town where on August th of  the badly decomposed bodies of their amigos will be found  James Cheney twentyone Andrew Goodman twentyone Michael Schwerner twentyfour O Discordia And to you who favor darkness give you joy of the red Eye that shines there She hears them sing All thro this Earth Im bound to rambleThro storm and wind thro sleet and rainIm bound to ride that Northern railroad Nothing opens the eye of memory like a song and it is Odettas memories that lift Mia and carry her as they sing together Det and her kamates under the silvery moon Mia sees them walking hence from here with their arms linked singing oh deep in my heartI do believe another song the one they feel defines them most clearly The faces lining the street and watching them are twisted with hate The fists being shaken at them are callused The mouths of the women who purse their lips to shoot the spit that will clabber their cheeks dirty their hair stain their shirts are paintless and their legs are without stockings and their shoes are nothing but runover lumps There are men in overalls Oshkoshbygosh someone say hallelujah There are teenage boys in clean white sweaters and flattop haircuts and one of them shouts at Odetta carefully articulating each wordWe Will Kill Every Goddam Nigger Who Steps Foot On The Campus Of Ole Miss And the camaraderie in spite of the fearBecause of the fear The feeling that they are doing something incredibly important something for the ages They will change America and if the price is blood why then they will pay it Say true say hallelujah praise God give up your loud amen Then comes the white boy named Darryl and at first he couldnt he was limp and he couldnt and then later on he could and Odettas secret other  the screaming laughing ugly other  never came near Darryl and Det lay together until morning slept spoons until morning beneath the Mississippi moon Listening to the crickets Listening to the owls Listening to the soft smooth hum of the Earth turning on its gimbals turning and turning ever further into the twentieth century They are young their blood runs hot and they never doubt their ability to change everything Its fare you well my own true lover This is her song in the weeds behind the Blue Moon Motor Hotel this is her song beneath the moon Ill never see your face again Its Odetta Holmes at the apotheosis of her life and Mia isthere She sees it feels it is lost in its glorious and some would say stupid hope ah but I say hallelujah we all say Gawdbomb She understands how being afraid all the time makes ones friends more precious how it makes every bite of every meal sweet how it stretches time until every day seems to last forever leading on to velvet night and theyknow James Cheney is dead say true theyknow Andrew Goodman is dead say hallelujah theyknow Michael Schwerner  oldest of them and still just a baby at twentyfour  is dead Give up your loudest amen They know that any of them is also eligible to wind up in the mud of Longdale or PhiladelphiaAt any time The night after this particular hoot behind the Blue Moon most of them Odetta included will be taken to jail and her time of humiliation will begin But tonight shes with her friends with her lover and they are one and Discordia has been banished Tonight they sing swaying with their arms around each other The girls singmaid the boys singman Mia is overwhelmed by their love for one another she is exalted by the simplicity of what they believe At first too stunned to laugh or to cry she can only listen amazed Nine As the busker began the fourth verse Susannah joined in at first tentatively and then  at his encouraging smile  with a will harmonizing above the young mans voice For breakfast we had bulldog gravy For supper we had beans and bread The miners dont have any dinner And a tick of straw they call a bed Ten The busker quit after that verse looking at SusannahMia with happy surprise I thought I was the only one who knew that one he said Its the way the Freedom Riders used to   No Susannah said quietly Not them It was the voterregistration people who sang the bulldoggravy verse The folks who came down to Oxford in the summer of  When those three boys were killed Schwerner and Goodman he said I cant remember the name of the   James Cheney she said quietly He had the most beautifulhair  You talk as though you knew him he said but you cant be much overthirty Susannah had an idea she looked a good deal older than thirty especially tonight but of course this young man had fifty dollars more in his guitar case now than had been there a single song ago and it had perhaps affected his eyesight My mother spent the summer of  in Neshoba County Susannah said and with two spontaneously chosen words  my mother  did her captor more damage than she could have imagined Those words flayed open Mias heart Cool on Mom the young man exclaimed and smiled Then the smile faded He fished the fifty out of the guitar case and held it up to her Take it back It was a pleasure just to sing with you maam I really couldnt Susannah said smiling Remember the struggle thatd be enough for me And remember Jimmy Andy and Michael if it does ya I know it would do me just fine Please the young man persisted He was smiling again but the smile was troubled and he might have been any of those young men from the Land of Ago singing in the moonlight between the slumped assends of the Blue Moons shacky little units and the doublehammered heatless moonlight gleam of the railroad tracks he could have been any in his beauty and the careless flower of his youth and how in that moment Mia loved him Even her chap seemed secondary in that glow She knew it was in many ways a false glow imparted by the memories of her hostess and yet she suspected that in other ways it might be real She knew one thing for sure only a creature such as herself whod had immortality and given it up could appreciate the raw courage it took to stand against the forces of Discordia To risk that fragile beauty by putting beliefs before personal safety Make him happy take it backshe told Susannah but would notcome forward and make Susannah do so Let it be her choice Before Susannah could reply the alarm in the Dogan went off flooding their shared mind with noise and red light Susannah turned in that direction but Mia grabbed her shoulder in a grip like a claw before she could go Whats happening Whats gone wrong Let me loose Susannah twisted free And before Mia could grab her again she was gone Eleven Susannahs Dogan pulsed and flared with red paniclight A Klaxon hammered an audio tattoo from the overhead speakers All but two of the TV screens  one still showing the busker on the corner of Lex and Sixtieth the other the sleeping baby  had shorted out The cracked floor was humming under Susannahs feet and throwing up dust One of the control panels had gone dark and another was in flames This looked bad As if to confirm her assessment the Blainelike Voice of the Dogan began to speak again WARNING it cried SYSTEM OVERLOAD WITHOUT POWER REDUCTION IN SECTION ALPHA TOTAL SYSTEM SHUTDOWN WILL OCCUR IN  SECONDS Susannah couldnt remember any Section Alpha from her previous visits to the Dogan but wasnt surprised to now see a sign labeled just that One of the panels near it suddenly erupted in a gaudy shower of orange sparks setting the seat of a chair on fire More ceiling panels fell trailing snarls of wiring WITHOUT POWER REDUCTION IN SECTION ALPHA TOTAL SYSTEM SHUTDOWN WILL OCCUR IN  SECONDS What about the EMOTIONAL TEMP dial Leave it alone she muttered to herself Okay CHAP What about that one After a moments thought Susannah flipped the toggle from ASLEEP to AWAKE and those disconcerting blue eyes opened at once staring into Susannahs with what looked like fierce curiosity Rolands childshe thought with a strange and painful mixture of emotionsAnd mine As for Mia Girl you nothing but a kamai Im sorry for you Kamai yes Not just a fool but kas fool  a fool of destiny WITHOUT POWER REDUCTION IN SECTION ALPHA TOTAL SYSTEM SHUTDOWN WILL OCCUR IN  SECONDS So waking the baby hadnt done any good at least not in terms of preventing a complete system crash Time for Plan B She reached out for the absurd LABOR FORCE controlknob the one that looked so much like the ovendial on her mothers stove Turning the dial back to  had been difficult and had hurt like a bastard Turning it the other way was easier and there was no pain at all What she felt was aneasing somewhere deep in her head as if some network of muscles which had been flexed for hours was now letting go with a little cry of relief The blaring pulse of the Klaxon ceased Susannah turned LABOR FORCE to  paused there then shrugged What the hell it was time to go for broke get this over with She turned the dial all the way to  The moment it was there a great glossy pain hardened her stomach and then rolled lower gripping her pelvis She had to tighten her lips against a scream POWER REDUCTION IN SECTION ALPHA HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED said the voice and then it dropped into a John Wayne drawl that Susannah knew all too well THANKS A WHOLE HEAP LIL COWGIRL She had to tighten her lips against another scream  not pain this time but outright terror It was all very well to remind herself Blaine the Mono was dead and this voice was coming from some nasty practical joker in her own subconscious but that didnt stop the fear LABORHAS COMMENCED said the amplified voice dropping the John Wayne imitation LABORHAS COMMENCED Then in a horrible and nasal Bob Dylan drawl that set her teeth on edge the voice sang HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUBABEHAPPY BIRTHDAYTO YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAYDEAR MORDREDHAPPY BIRTHDAYTO YOU Susannah visualized a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall behind her and when she turned it was of course right there she had not imagined the little sign reading ONLY YOU AND SOMBRA CAN HELP PREVENT CONSOLE FIRES however  that along with a drawing of Shardik o the Beam in a Smokey the Bear hat was some other jokers treat As she hurried across the cracked and uneven floor to get the extinguisher skirting the fallen ceiling panels another pain ripped into her lighting her belly and thighs on fire making her want to double over and bear down on the outrageous stone in her womb Not going to take longshe thought in a voice that was part Susannah and part DettaNo maam This chap comin in on the express train But then the pain let up slightly She snatched the extinguisher off the wall when it did trained the slim black horn on the flaming control panel and pressed the trigger Foam billowed out coating the flames There was a baleful hissing sound and a smell like burning hair THE FIREIS OUT the Voice of the Dogan proclaimed THE FIREIS OUT And then changing quick as a flash to a plummy British Lord HawHaw accent I SAYJOLLY GOOD SHOW SEWZANNAH ABSOLUTELYBRILLLLIANT  She lurched across the minefield of the Dogans floor again seized the microphone and pressed the transmit toggle Above her on one of the TV screens still operating she could see that Mia was on the move again crossing Sixtieth Then Susannah saw the green awning with the cartoon pig and her heart sank Not Sixtieth but SixtyfirstThe hijacking mommybitch had reached her destination Eddie she shouted into the microphone Eddie or Roland And what the hell she might as well make it a clean sweep Jake Pere Callahan Weve reached the Dixie Pig and were going to have this damn baby Come for us if you can but be careful She looked up at the screen again Mia was now on the Dixie Pig side of the street peering at the green awning Hesitating Could she read the words DIXIE PIG Probably not but she could surely understand the cartoon The smiling smoking pig And she wouldnt hesitate long in any case now that her labor had started Eddie I have to go I love you sugar Whatever else happens you remember that Never forget itI love you This is Her eye fell on the semicircular readout on the panel behind the mike The needle had fallen out of the red She thought it would stay in the yellow until the labor was over then subside into the green Unless something went wrong that was She realized she was still gripping the mike This is SusannahMio signing off God be with you boys God and ka She put the microphone down and closed her eyes Twelve Susannah sensed the difference in Mia immediately Although shed reached the Dixie Pig and her labor had most emphatically commenced Mias mind was for once elsewhere It had turned to Odetta Holmes in fact and to what Michael Schwerner had called the Mississippi Summer Project What the Oxford rednecks had calledhim was The Jewboy The emotional atmosphere to which Susannah returned wasfraught like still air before a violent September storm Susannah Susannah daughter of Dan Yes Mia I agreed to mortality So you said And certainly Mia had looked mortal in Fedic Mortal andterribly pregnant Yet Ive missed most of what makes the shorttime life worthwhile Havent IThe grief in that voice was awful the surprise was even worseAnd theres no time for you to tell me Not now Go somewhere elseSusannah said with no hope at allHail a cab go to a hospital Well have it together Mia Maybe we can even raise it toge  If I have it anywhere but here it will die and well die with itShe spoke with utter certaintyAnd I willhave it Ive been cheated of all but my chap and I willhave it ButSusannahbefore we go inyou spoke of your mother I lied It was me in Oxford Lying was easier than trying to explain time travel and parallel worlds Show me the truth Show me your mother Show me I beg There was no time to debate this request pro and con it was either do it or refuse on the spur of the moment Susannah decided to do it Lookshe said Thirteen In the Land of Memory the time is alwaysNow There is an Unfound Door O lost and when Susannah found it and opened it Mia saw a woman with her dark hair pulled back from her face and startling gray eyes There is a cameo brooch at the womans throat Shes sitting at the kitchen table this woman in an eternal shaft of sun In this memory it is always ten minutes past two on an afternoon in October of  the Big War is over Irene Daye is on the radio and the smell is always gingerbread Odetta come and sit with me says the woman at the table she who is mother Have something sweet You lookgood girl And she smiles O lost and by the wind grieved ghost come back again Fourteen Prosaic enough you would say so you would A young girl comes home from school with her bookbag in one hand and her gymbag in the other wearing her white blouse and her pleated St Anns tartan skirt and the kneesocks with the bows on the side orange and black the school colors Her mother sitting at the kitchen table looks up and offers her daughter a piece of the gingerbread that just came out of the oven It is only one moment in an unmarked million a single atom of event in a lifetime of them But it stole Mias breath you lookgoodgirl  and showed her in a concrete way she had previously not understood how rich motherhood could beifthat was it was allowed to run its course uninterrupted The rewards Immeasurable In the endyou could be the woman sitting in the shaft of sunYou could be the one looking at the child sailing bravely out of childhoods harbor You could be the wind in that childs unfurled sails You Odetta come and sit with me Mias breath began to hitch in her chest Have something sweet Her eyes fogged over the smiling cartoon pig on the awning first doubling then quadrupling You lookgoodgirl Some time was better than no time at all Even five years  or three  was better than no time at all She couldnt read hadnt been to Morehouse hadnt been tono house but she could do that much math with no trouble three  better than none Even one  better than none Oh Oh but Mia thought of a blueeyed boy stepping through a door one that was found instead of lost She thought of saying to himYou look goodson She began to weep What have I donewas a terrible questionWhat else couldI have done was perhaps even worse O Discordia Fifteen This was Susannahs one chance to do something now while Mia stood at the foot of the steps leading up to her fate Susannah reached into the pocket of her jeans and touched the turtle theskldpadda Her brown fingers separated from Mias white leg by only a thin layer of lining closed around it She pulled it out and flipped it behind her casting it into the gutter From her hand into the lap of ka Then she was carried up the three steps to the double doors of the Dixie Pig Sixteen It was very dim inside and at first Mia could see nothing but murky reddishorange lights Electricflambeaux of the sort that still lit some of the rooms in Castle Discordia Her sense of smell needed no adjusting however and even as a fresh labor pain clamped her tight her stomach reacted to the smell of roasting pork and cried out to be fed Herchap cried out to be fed Thats not pork MiaSusannah said and was ignored As the doors were closed behind her  there was a man or a manlike being standing at each of them  she began to see better She was at the head of a long narrow dining room White napery shone On each table was a candle in an orangetinted holder They glowed like foxeyes The floor here in the foyer was black marble but beyond thematre d s stand there was a rug of darkest crimson Beside the stand was a sai of about sixty with white hair combed back from a lean and rather predatory face It was the face of an intelligent man but his clothes  the blaring yellow sportcoat the red shirt the black tie  were those of a usedcar salesman or a gambler who specializes in rooking smalltown rubes In the center of his forehead was a red hole about an inch across as if he had been shot at close range It swam with blood that never overflowed onto his pallid skin At the tables in the dining room stood perhaps fifty men and half again as many women Most of them were dressed in clothes as loud or louder than those of the whitehaired gent Big rings glared on fleshy fingers diamond eardrops sparked back orange light from theflambeaux There were also some dressed in more sober attire  jeans and plain white shirts seemed to be the costume of choice for this minority Thesefolken were pallid and watchful their eyes seemingly all pupil Around their bodies swirling so faintly that they sometimes disappeared were blue auras To Mia these pallid auraenclosed creatures looked quite a bit more human than the low men and women They were vampires  she didnt have to observe the sharpened fangs which their smiles disclosed to know it  but still they looked more human than Sayres bunch Perhaps because they once hadbeen human The others though Their faces are only masksshe observed with growing dismayBeneath the ones the Wolves wear lie the electric men  the robots  but what is beneath these The dining room was breathlessly silent but from somewhere nearby came the uninterrupted sounds of conversation laughter clinking glasses and cutlery against china There was a patter of liquid  wine or water she supposed  and a louder outburst of laughter A low man and a low woman  he in a tuxedo equipped with plaid lapels and a red velvet bow tie she in a strapless silver lam evening dress both of startling obesity  turned to look with obvious displeasure toward the source of these sounds which seemed to be coming from behind some sort of swaggy tapestry depicting knights and their ladies at sup When the fat couple turned to look Mia saw their cheeks wrinkle upward like clingy cloth and for a moment beneath the soft angle of their jaws she saw something dark red and tufted with hair Susannah was thatskin Mia askedDear God was it their skin Susannah made no reply not evenI told you so orDidnt I warn you Things had gone past that now It was too late for exasperation or any of the milder emotions and Susannah felt genuinely sorry for the woman who had brought her here Yes Mia had lied and betrayed yes she had tried her best to get Eddie and Roland killed But what choice had she ever had Susannah realized with dawning bitterness that she could now give the perfect definition of a kamai one who has been given hope but no choices Like giving a motorcycle to a blindmanshe thought Richard Sayre  slim middleaged handsome in a fulllipped broadbrowed way  began to applaud The rings on his fingers flashed His yellow blazer blared in the dim light Hile Mia he cried Hile Miathe others responded Hile Mother Hile Motherthe vampires and low men and low women cried and they too began to applaud The sound was certainly enthusiastic enough but the acoustics of the room dulled it and turned it into the rustle of batwings A hungry sound one that made Susannah feel sick to her stomach At the same time a fresh contraction gripped her and turned her legs to water She reeled forward yet almost welcomed the pain which partially muffled her trepidation Sayre stepped forward and seized her by the upper arms steadying her before she could fall She had thought his touch would be cold but his fingers were as hot as those of a cholera victim Farther back she saw a tall figure come out of the shadows something that was neither low man nor vampire It wore jeans and a plain white shirt but emerging from the shirts collar was the head of a bird It was covered with sleek feathers of dark yellow Its eyes were black It patted its hands together in polite applause and she saw  with evergrowing dismay  that those hands were equipped with talons rather than fingers Half a dozen bugs scampered from beneath one of the tables and looked at her with eyes that hung on stalks Horribly intelligent eyes Their mandibles clicked in a sound that was like laughter Hile Miashe heard in her head An insectile buzzingHile Mother And then they were gone back into the shadows Mia turned to the door and saw the pair of low men who blocked it And yes thosewere masks this close to the doorguards it was impossible not to see how their sleek black hair had been painted on Mia turned back to Sayre with a sinking heart Too late now Too late to do anything but go through with it Seventeen Sayres grip had slipped when she turned Now he reestablished it by taking her left hand At the same moment her right hand was seized She turned that way and saw the fat woman in the silver lam dress Her huge bust overflowed the top of her gown which struggled gamely to hold it back The flesh of her upper arms quivered loosely giving off a suffocating scent of talcum powder On her forehead was a red wound that swam but never overflowed Its how they breatheMia thoughtThats how they breathe when theyre wearing their  In her growing dismay she had largely forgotten about Susannah Dean and completely about Detta So when Detta Walkercame forward  hell when sheleaped forward  there was no way Mia could stop her She watched her arms shoot out seemingly of their own accord and saw her fingers sink into the plump cheek of the woman in the silver lam gown The woman shrieked but oddly the others Sayre included laughed uproariously as if this were the funniest thing theyd ever seen in their lives The mask of humanity pulled away from the low womans startled eye then tore Susannah thought of her final moments on the castle allure when everything had frozen and the sky had torn open like paper Detta ripped the mask almost entirely away Tatters of what looked like latex hung from the tips of her fingers Beneath where the mask had been was the head of a huge red rat a mutie with yellow teeth growing up the outside of its cheeks in a crust and what looked like white worms dangling from its nose Naughty girl said the rat shaking a roguish finger at SusannahMio Its other hand was still holding hers The things mate  the low man in the garish tuxedo  was laughing so hard he had doubled over and when he did Mia saw something poking out through the seat of his pants It was too bony to be a tail but she supposed it was all the same Come Mia Sayre said drawing her forward And then he leaned toward her peering earnestly into her eyes like a lover Or is it you Odetta It is isnt it Itsyou you pestering overeducated troublesome Negress No it beme you ratface honky mahfah Detta crowed and then spat into Sayres face Sayres mouth opened in a gape of astonishment Then it snapped shut and twisted into a bitter scowl The room had gone silent again He wiped the spit from his face  from the mask he woreover his face  and looked at it unbelievingly Mia he asked Mia you let her do this tome Me who would stand as your babys godfather You aint jack shit Detta cried You suck yo kadaddys cock while you diddle yo fuckfinger up his poopchute and thass all you good fo You   Get RID of herSayre thundered And before the watching audience of vampires and low men in the Dixie Pigs front dining room Mia did just that The result was extraordinary Dettas voice began todwindle as if she were being escorted out of the restaurant by the bouncer and by the scruff of the neck She quit trying to speak and only laughed raucously but soon enough that too was gone Sayre stood with his hands clasped before him looking solemnly at Mia The others were also staring Somewhere behind the tapestry of the knights and their ladies at feast the low laughter and conversation of some other group continued Shes gone Mia said at last The bad one is gone Even in the rooms quiet she was hard to hear for she spoke in little more than a whisper Her eyes were timidly cast down and her cheeks had gone deathly white Please Mr SayresaiSayrenow that Ive done as you ask please say youve told me the truth and I may have the raising of my chap Please say so If you do youll never hear from the other one again I swear it on my fathers face and my mothers name so I do You had neither Sayre said He spoke in a tone of distant contempt The compassion and mercy for which she begged owned no space in his eyes And above them the red hole in the center of his forehead filled and filled but never spilled Another pain this one the greatest so far sank its teeth into her Mia staggered and this time Sayre didnt bother steadying her She went to her knees before him put her hands on the rough gleaming surface of his ostrichskin boots and looked up into his pale face It looked back at her from above the violent yellow scream of his sports jacket Please she said Please I beg youkeep your promise to me I may he said or I may not Do you know I have never had my boots licked Can you imagine To have lived as long as I have and never to have had a single good oldfashioned bootlicking Somewhere a woman tittered Mia bent forward No Mia thee mustntSusannah moaned but Mia made no reply Nor did the paralyzing pain deep in her vitals stop her She stuck her tongue out between her lips and began licking the rough surface of Richard Sayres boots Susannah could taste them at a great distance It was a husky dusty leathery taste full of rue and humiliation Sayre let her go on so for a bit then said Stop it Enough He pulled her roughly to her feet and stood with his unsmiling face not three inches from her own Now that shed seen them it was impossible to unsee the masks he and the rest of them wore The taut cheeks were almost transparent and whorls of dark scarlet hair were faintly visible beneath Or perhaps you called it fur when it covered the whole face Your beggary does you no credit he said although I must admit the sensation was extraordinary You promised she cried attempting to pull back and out of his grip Then another contraction struck and she doubled over trying only not to shriek When it eased a little she pressed on You said five yearsor maybe sevenyes seventhe best of everything for my chap you said   Yes Sayre said I do seem to recall that Mia He frowned as one does when presented with an especially pernicious problem then brightened The area of mask around one corner of his mouth wrinkled up for a moment when he smiled revealing a yellow snag of tooth growing out of the fold where his lower lip met his upper He let go of her with one hand in order to raise a finger in the gesture pedagogical The best of everything yes Question is do you fill that particular bill Appreciative murmurs of laughter greeted this sally Mia recalled them calling her Mother and saluting herhile but that seemed distant now like a meaningless fragment of dream You was good enough to tote him though wasnt youDetta asked from someplace deep inside  from the brig in fact Yassuh You us good enough to do datsho I was good enough to carry him wasnt I Mia almost spat at him Good enough to send the other one into the swamp to eat frogs her all the time thinking they were caviarI was good enough forthat wasnt I Sayre blinked clearly startled by so brisk a response Mia softened again Sai think of all I gave up Pish you hadnothing  Sayre replied What were you but a meaningless spirit whose existence revolved around no more than fucking the occasional saddletramp Slut of the winds isnt that what Roland calls your kind Then think of the other one Mia said She who calls herself Susannah I have stolen all her life and purpose for my chap and at your bidding Sayre made a dismissive gesture Your mouth does you no credit Mia Therefore close it He nodded to his left A low man with a wide bulldoggy face and a luxuriant head of curly gray hair came forward The red hole in his brow had an oddly slanted Chinese look Walking behind him was another of the birdthings this one with a fierce dark brown hawks head protruding from the round neck of a teeshirt with DUKE BLUE DEVILS printed on it They took hold of her The birdthings grip was repulsive  scaly and alien You have been an excellent custodian Sayre said on that much we can surely agree But we must also remember that it was Roland of Gileads jilly who actually bred the child mustnt we Thats a lieshe screamedOh that is a filthyLIE He went on as if hed not heard her And different jobs require different skills Different strokes for different folks as they say PLEASEMia shrieked The hawkman put its taloned hands to the sides of its head and then rocked from side to side as if deafened This witty pantomime drew laughter and even a few cheers Susannah dimly felt warmth gush down her legs  Miaslegs  and saw her jeans darken at the crotch and thighs Her water had finally broken Letsgooooooo and have aBABY  Sayre proclaimed in gameshowhost tones of excitement There were too many teeth in that smile a double row both top and bottom After that well see I promise you that your request will be taken under consideration In the meantimeHile Mia Hile Mother Hile Mia Hile Motherthe rest cried and Mia suddenly found herself borne toward the back of the room the bulldogfaced low man gripping her left arm and the hawkman gripping her right Hawkman made a faint and unpleasant buzzing sound in his throat each time he exhaled Her feet barely touched the rug as she was carried toward the birdthing with the yellow feathers Canaryman she thought him Sayre brought her to a stop with a single handgesture and spoke to Canaryman pointing toward the Dixie Pigs street door as he did Mia heard Rolands name and also Jakes The Canaryman nodded Sayre pointed emphatically at the door again and shook his headNothing gets in that headshake saidNothing The Canaryman nodded again and then spoke in buzzing chirps that made Mia feel like screaming She looked away and her gaze happened on the mural of the knights and their ladies They were at a table she recognized  it was the one in the banqueting hall of Castle Discordia Arthur Eld sat at the head with his crown on his brow and his ladywife at his right hand And his eyes were a blue she knew from her dreams Ka might have chosen that particular moment to puff some errant draft across the dining room of the Dixie Pig and twitch aside the tapestry It was only for a second or two but long enough for Mia to see there was another dining room  aprivate dining room  behind it Sitting at a long wooden table beneath a blazing crystal chandelier were perhaps a dozen men and women their appledoll faces twisted and shrunken with age and evil Their lips had burst back from great croggled bouquets of teeth the days when any of these monstrosities could close their mouths were long gone Their eyes were black and oozing some sort of noisome tarry stuff from the corners Their skin was yellow scaled with teeth and covered with patches of diseasedlooking fur What are theyMia screamedWhat in the name of the gods are they MutantsSusannah saidOr perhaps the word is hybrids And it doesnt matter Mia You saw what matters didnt you She had and Susannah knew it Although the velvet swag had been twitched aside but briefly it had been long enough for both of them to see the rotisserie which had been set in the middle of that table and the headless corpse twirling upon it skin browning and puckering and sizzling fragrant juices No the smell in the air hadnt been pork The thing turning on the spit brown as a squab was a human baby The creatures around it dipped delicate china cups into the drippings beneath toasted each otherand drank The draft died The tapestry settled back into place And before the laboring woman was once more taken by the arms and hustled away from the dining room and deeper into this building that straddled many worlds along the Beam she saw the joke of that picture It wasnt a drumstick Arthur Eld was lifting to his lips as a first casual glance might have suggested it was a babys leg The glass Queen Rowena had raised in toast was not filled with wine but with blood Hile Mia Sayre cried again Oh he was in the best of spirits now that the homing pigeon had come back to the cote Hile Miathe others screamed back It was like some sort of crazy football cheer Those from behind the mural joined in although their voices were reduced to little more than growls And their mouths of course were stuffed with food Hile Mother This time Sayre offered her a mocking bow to go with the mockery of his respect Hile Motherthe vampires and the low men responded and on the satiric wave of their applause she was carried away first into the kitchen then into the pantry and then down the stairs beyond Ultimately of course there was a door Eighteen Susannah knew the kitchen of the Dixie Pig by the smell of obscene cookery not pork after all but certainly what the pirates of the eighteenth century had calledlong pork For how many years had this outpost served the vampires and low men of New York City Since Callahans time in the seventies and eighties Since her own in the sixties Almost certainly longer Susannah supposed there might have been a version of the Dixie Pig here since the time of the Dutch they who had bought off the Indians with sacks of beads and planted their murderous Christian beliefs ever so much more deeply than their flag A practical folk the Dutch with a taste for spareribs and little patience for magic either white or black She saw enough to recognize the kitchen for the twin of the one she had visited in the bowels of Castle Discordia That was where Mia had killed a rat that had been trying to claim the last remaining food in the place a porkroast in the oven Except there was no oven and no roastshe thoughtHell no kitchen There was a piglet out behind the barn one of Tian and Zalia Jaffordss And I was the one who killed it and drank its hot blood not she By then she mostly had me although I still didnt know it I wonder if Eddie  As Mia took her away for the last time tearing her free from her thoughts and sending her atumble into the dark Susannah realized how completely the needy terrible bitch had possessed her life She knew why Mia had done it  because of the chap The question was why she Susannah Dean had allowed it to happen Because shed been possessed before Because she was as addicted to the stranger inside as Eddie had been to heroin She feared it might be true Swirling dark And when she opened her eyes again it was upon that savage moon hanging above the Discordia and the flexing red glow forge of the King on the horizon Over here cried a womans voice just as it had cried before Over here out of the wind Susannah looked down and saw she was legless and sitting in the same rude dogcart as on her previous visit to the allure The same woman tall and comely with black hair streaming in the wind was beckoning to her Mia of course and all this no more real than Susannahs vague dreammemories of the banquet room She thoughtFedic though was real Mias body is there just as mine is at this very moment being hustled through the kitchen behind the Dixie Pig where unspeakable meals are prepared for inhuman customers The castle allure is Mias dreamplace her refuge her Dogan To me Susannah of MidWorld and away from the Red Kings glow Come out of the wind and into the lee of this merlon Susannah shook her head Say what you have to say and be done Mia Weve got to have a baby  aye somehow between us  and once its out were quits Youve poisoned my life so you have Mia looked at her with desperate intensity her belly blooming beneath the serape her hair harried backward at the winds urging Twas you who took the poison Susannah Twas you who swallowed it Aye when the child was still a seed unbloomed in your belly Was it true And if it was which of them had invited Mia in like the vampire she truly was Had it been Susannah or Detta Susannah thought neither She thought it might actually have been Odetta Holmes Odetta who would never have broken the nasty old blue ladys forspecial plate Odetta who loved her dolls even though most of them were as white as her plain cotton panties What do you want with me Mia daughter of none Say and have finished with it Soon well be together  aye really and truly lying together in the same childbed And all I ask is that if a chance comes for me to get away with my chap youll help me take it Susannah thought it over In the wilderness of rocks and gaping crevasses the hyenas cackled The wind was numbing but the pain that suddenly clamped her midsection in its jaws was worse She saw that same pain on Mias face and thought again how her entire existence seemed to have become a wilderness of mirrors In any case what harm could such a promise do The chance probably wouldnt come but if it did was she going to let the thing Mia wanted to call Mordred fall into the hands of the Kings men Yes she said All right If I can help you get away with him Iwill help you Anywhere Mia cried in a harsh whisper Even She stopped Swallowed Forced herself to go on Even into the todash darkness For if I had to wander forever with my son by my side that would be no condemnation Maybe not foryousister Susannah thought but said nothing In truth she was fed up with Mias megrims And if theres no way for us to be free Mia said kill us Although there was no sound up here but the wind and the cackling hyenas Susannah could sense her physical body still on the move now being carried down a flight of stairs All that realworld stuff behind the thinnest of membranes For Mia to have transported her to this world especially while in the throes of childbirth suggested a being of great power Too bad that power couldnt be harnessed somehow Mia apparently mistook Susannahs continued silence for reluctance for she rushed around the allures circular walkway in her sturdyhuaraches and almost ran to where Susannah sat in her gawky balky cart She seized Susannahs shoulders and shook her Yarshe cried vehemently Kill us Better we be together in death than to She trailed off then spoke in a dull and bitter voice Ive been cozened all along Havent I And now that the moment had come Susannah felt neither vindication nor sympathy nor sorrow She only nodded Do they mean to eat him To feed those terrible elders with his corpse Im almost sure not Susannah said And yet cannibalism was in it somewhere her heart whispered it was so They dont care about me at all Mia said Just the babysitter isnt that what you called me And they wont even let me havethat will they I dont think so Susannah said You might get six months to nurse him but even that She shook her head then bit her lip as a fresh contraction gusted into her turning all the muscles in her belly and thighs to glass When it eased a little she finished I doubt it Then kill us if it comes to that Say you will Susannah do ya I beg And if I do for you Mia what will you do for me Assuming I could believe any word out of your liars mouth Id free you if chance allows Susannah thought it over and decided that a poor bargain was better than no bargain at all She reached up and took the hands which were gripping her shoulders All right I agree Then as at the end of their previous palaver in this place the sky tore open and the merlon behind them and the very air between them Through the rip Susannah saw a moving hallway The image was dim blurry She understood she was looking through her own eyes which were mostly shut Bulldog and Hawkman still had her They were bearing her toward the door at the end of the hallway  always since Roland had come into her life there was another door  and she guessed they must think shed passed out or fainted She supposed that in a way she had Then she fell back into the hybrid body with the white legsonly who knew how much of her previously brown skin was now white She thought that situation at least was about to end and she was delighted She would gladly swap those white legs strong though they might be for a little peace of mind A little peacein her mind Nineteen Shes coming around someone growled The one with the bulldog face Susannah thought Not that it mattered underneath they all looked like humanoid rats with fur growing out of their bonecrusty flesh Good deal That was Sayre walking behind them She looked around and saw that her entourage consisted of six low men Hawkman and a trio of vampires The low men wore pistols in dockers clutchesonly she supposed that in this world you had to call them shoulder holsters When in Rome dear do ya as the Romans do Two of the vampires had bahs the crossbow weapon of the Callas The third was carrying a bitterly buzzing electric sword of the sort the Wolves had wielded Tentoone oddsSusannah thought coollyNot goodbut it could be worse Can you  Mias voice from somewhere inside Shut upSusannah told herTalkings done Ahead on the door they were approaching she saw this NORTH CENTRAL POSITRONICS LTD New YorkFedic Maximum Security VERBAL ENTRY CODE REQUIRED It was familiar and Susannah instantly knew why Shed seen a sign similar to this during her one brief visit to Fedic Fedic where the real Mia  the being who had assumed mortality in what might be historys worst bargain  was imprisoned When they reached it Sayre pushed past her on Hawkmans side He leaned toward the door and spoke something guttural deep in his throat some alien word Susannah never could have pronounced herselfIt doesnt matter Mia whisperedI can say it and if I need to I can teach you another that you can say But nowSusannah Im sorry for everything Fare you well The door to the Arc  Experimental Station in Fedic came open Susannah could hear a ragged humming sound and could smell ozone No magic powered this door between the worlds this was the work of the old people and failing Those whod made it had lost their faith in magic had given up their belief in the Tower In the place of magic was this buzzing dying thing This stupid mortal thing And beyond it she saw a great room filled with beds Hundreds of them Its where they operate on the children Where they take from them whatever it is the Breakers need Now only one of the beds was occupied Standing at its foot was a woman with one of those terrible rats heads A nurse perhaps Beside her was a human  Susannah didnt think he was a vampire but couldnt be sure as the view through the door was as wavery as the air over an incinerator He looked up and saw them Hurry he shouted Move your freight We have to connect them and finish it or shell die They both will The doctor  surely no one but a doctor could have mustered such illtempered arrogance in the presence of Richard P Sayre  made impatient beckoning gestures Get her in here Youre late goddam you Sayre pushed her rudely through the door She heard a humming deep in her head and a brief jangle of todash chimes She looked down but was too late Mias borrowed legs were already gone and she went sprawling to the floor before Hawkman and Bulldog could come through behind her and catch her She braced on her elbows and looked up aware that for the first time in God knew how long  probably since shed been raped in the circle of stones  she belonged only to herself Mia was gone Then as if to prove this wasnt so Susannahs troublesome and newly departed guest let out a scream Susannah added her own cry  the pain was now too huge for silence  and for a moment their voices sang of the babys imminence in perfect harmony Christ said one of Susannahs guards  whether vampire or low man she didnt know Are my ears bleeding Theyfeel like they must be   Pick her up Haber Sayre snarled Jey Grab hold Get her off the floor for your fathers sakes Bulldog and Hawkman  or Haber and Jey if you liked that better  grabbed her beneath the arms and quickly carried her down the aisle of the ward that way past the rows of empty beds Mia turned toward Susannah and managed a weak exhausted smile Her face was wet with sweat and her hair was plastered to her flushed skin Wellmetand ill she managed Push the next bed over the doctor shouted Hurry up gods damn you Why are you so Christingslow  Two of the low men whod accompanied Susannah from the Dixie Pig bent over the nearest empty bed and shoved it next to Mias while Haber and Jey continued to hold her up between them There was something on the bed that looked like a cross between a hairdryer and the sort of space helmet you saw in the oldFlash Gordon serials Susannah didnt much care for the look of it It had a brainsucking look The rathead nurse meanwhile was bending between her patients splayed legs and peering under the hikedup hospital gown Mia now wore She patted Mias right knee with a plump hand and made a mewling sound It was almost surely meant to comfort but Susannah shuddered Dont just stand there with your thumbs up your butts you idiots the doctor cried He was a stoutish man with brown eyes flushed cheeks and black hair swept back against his skull where each track of the comb seemed as wide as a gutter He wore a labcoat of white nylon over a tweed suit His scarlet cravat had an eye figured into it This sigul did not surprise Susannah in the slightest We wait your word said Jey the Hawkman He spoke in a queer inhuman monotone as unpleasant as the rathead nurses mewl but perfectly understandable You shouldntneed my word the doctor snapped He flapped his hands in a Gallic gesture of disgust Didnt your mothers have any children that lived I   Haber began but the doc went right over him He was on a roll How long have we been waiting for this hmmm How many times have we rehearsed the procedure Why must you be so fuckingstupid so Christingslow Put her down on the b   Sayre moved with a speed Susannah wasnt sure even Roland could have equaled At one moment he was standing beside Haber the low man with the bulldog face At the next hed battened on the doctor digging his chin into the docs shoulder and grabbing his arm twisting it high behind his back The docs expression of petulant fury vanished in a heartbeat and he began to scream in a childish breaking treble Spit spilled over his lower lip and the crotch of his tweed trousers darkened as his urine let go Stophe howledIm no good to you if you break my arm Oh stop that HURRRTS If I shd break your arm Scowther Id just drag some other pillpusher in off the street to finish this and kill him later Why not Its a woman having a baby not brainsurgery for Gans sake Yet he relaxed his hold a little bit Scowther sobbed and wriggled and moaned as breathlessly as someone having sexual intercourse in a hot climate And when it was done and you had no part in it Sayre continued Id feed you tothem  He gestured with his chin Susannah looked that way and saw that the aisle from the door to the bed where Mia lay was now covered with the bugs shed glimpsed in the Dixie Pig Their knowing greedy eyes were fixed on the plump doctor Their mandibles clicked Whatsai what must I do Cry my pardon CCry pardon And now these others for yeve insulted them as well so you have Sirs IIccry   Doctor the rathead nurse broke in Her speaking voice was thick but understandable She was still bent between Mias legs The babys crowning Sayre let go of Scowthers arm Go on Dr Scowther Do your duty Deliver the child Sayre bent forward and stroked Mias cheek with extraordinary solicitude Be of good cheer and good hope ladysai he said Some of your dreams may yet come true She looked up at him with a tired gratitude that wrung Susannahs heartDont believe him his lies are endless she tried to send but for the nonce their contact was broken She was tossed like a sack of grain onto the bed which had been pushed next to Mias She was unable to struggle as one of the hoods was fitted over her head another labor pain had gripped her and once again the two women shrieked together Susannah could hear Sayre and the others murmuring From below and behind them she could also hear the unpleasant clittering of the bugs Inside the helmet round metal protuberances pressed against her temples almost hard enough to hurt Suddenly a pleasant female voice said Welcome to the world of North Central Positronics part of the Sombra Group Sombra where progress never stops Stand by for uplink A loud humming began At first it was in Susannahs ears but then she could feel it boring in on both sides She visualized a pair of glowing bullets moving toward each other Dimly as if from the other side of the room instead of right next to her she heard Mia screamOh no dont that hurts The left hum and the right hum joined in the center of Susannahs brain creating a piercing telepathic tone that would destroy her ability to think if it kept up for long It was excruciating but she kept her lips shut tight She would not scream Let them see the tears oozing out from beneath her closed lids but she was a gunslinger and they would not make her scream After what seemed an eternity the hum cut out Susannah had a moment or two in which to enjoy the blessed silence in her head and then the next labor pain struck this one very low down in her belly and with the force of a typhoon With this pain shedid allow herself to scream Because it was different somehow to scream with the babys coming was an honor She turned her head and saw a similar steel hood had been fitted over Mias sweaty black hair The segmented steel hoses from the two helmets were connected in the middle These were the gadgets they used on the stolen twins but now they were being put to some other purpose What Sayre leaned down to her close enough so she could smell his cologne Susannah thought it was English Leather To accomplish the final labor and actually push the baby out we need this physical link he said Bringing you here to Fedic was absolutely vital He patted her shoulder Good luck It wont be long now He smiled at her winsomely The mask he wore wrinkled upward revealing some of the red horror which lay beneath Then we can kill you The smile broadened And eat you of course Nothing goes to waste at the Dixie Pig not even such an arrogant bitch as yourself Before Susannah could reply the female voice in her head spoke again Please speak your name slowly and distinctly Fuck you Susannah snarled back Fuk Yu does not register as a valid name for a nonAsian said the pleasant female voice We detect hostility and apologize in advance for the following procedure For a moment there was nothing and then Susannahs mind lit up with pain beyond anything she had ever been called upon to endure More than she had suspected could exist Yet her lips remained closed as it raved through her She thought of the song and heard it true even through the thunder of the painI am a maidof constant sorrowIve seen trials all my days At last the thunder ceased Please speak your name slowly and distinctly said the pleasant female voice in the middle of her head or this procedure will be intensified by a factor of ten No need of thatSusannah sent the female voiceIm convinced Suuuuzaaaanahhh she said Suuuzannnahhh They stood watching her all of them except for Ms Rathead who was peering ecstatically up to where the babys downcovered head had once again appeared between the withdrawing lips of Mias vagina Miiiiaaaahhhh Suuuuzaaa Miiii annnahhh By the time the next contraction began Dr Scowther had seized a pair of forceps The voices of the women became one uttering a word a name that was neitherSusannah norMia but some combination of both The link said the pleasant female voice has been established A faintclick Repeat the link has been established Thank you for your cooperation This is it people Scowther said His pain and terror appeared forgotten he sounded excited He turned to his nurse It may cry Alia If it does let it alone for your fathers sake If it doesnt swab out its mouth at once Yes doctor The things lips quivered back revealing a double set of fangs Was that a grimace or a smile Scowther looked around at them with a touch of his previous arrogance All of you stay exactly where you are until I say you can move he said None of us knows exactly what weve got here We only know that the child belongs to the Crimson King himself   Mia screamed at that In pain and in protest Oh you idiot Sayre said He drew back a hand and slapped Scowther with enough force to make his hair fly and send blood spraying against the white wall in a pattern of fine droplets No Mia cried She tried to struggle up onto her elbows failed fell back No you said I should have the raising of him Oh pleaseif only for a little while I beg Then the worst pain yet rolled over Susannah  over both of them burying them They screamed in tandem and Susannah didnt need to hear Scowther who was commanding her topush topush NOW Its coming doctor the nurse cried in nervous ecstasy Susannah closed her eyes and bore down and as she felt the pain begin to flow out of her like water whirlpooling its way down a dark drain she also felt the deepest sorrow she had ever known For it was Mia the baby was flowing into the last few lines of the living message Susannahs body had somehow been made to transmit It was ending Whatever happened next this part was ending and Susannah Dean let out a cry of mingled relief and regret a cry that was itself like a song And on the wings of that song Mordred Deschain son of Roland and one other O can you say Discordia came into the world STAVE Commalacomekass The child has come at last Sing your song O sing it well The child has come to pass RESPONSE Commalacomekass The worst has come to pass The Tower trembles on its ground The child has come at last Coda Pages from a Writers Journal July th  Man its good to be back in Bridgton They always treat us well in what Joe still calls Nanatown but Owen fussed almost nonstop Hes better since we got back home We only stopped once in Waterville to grab grub at the Silent Woman Ive had better meals there I must add Anyway I kept my promise to myself and went on a grand hunt for that Dark Tower story as soon as I got back Id almost given up when I found the pages in the farthest corner of the garage under a box of Tabs old catalogues There was a lot of spring thaw drip over there and those funny blue pages smell all mildewy but the copy is perfectly readable I finished going over it then sat down and added a small section to the Way Station material where the gunslinger meets the boy Jake I thought it would be kind of fun to put in a water pump that runs on an atomic slug and so I did so without delay Usually working on an old story is about as appetizing as eating a sandwich made with moldy bread but this felt perfectly naturallike slipping on an old shoe What exactly was this story supposed to be about I cant remember only that it first came to me a long long time ago Driving back from up north with my entire family snoozing I got thinking about that time David and I ran away from Aunt Ethelyns We were planning to go back to Connecticut I think The grups ie grownups caught us of course and put us to work in the barn sawing wood Punishment Detail Uncle Oren called it It seems to me that something scary happened to me out there but Ill be damned if I can remember what it was only that it was red And I thought up a hero a magic gunslinger to keep me safe from it There was something about magnetism too or Beams of Power Im pretty sure that was the genesis of this story but its strange how blurry it all seems Oh well who remembers all the nasty little nooks of their childhood Who wants to Not much else happening Joe and Naomi made Playground and Tabbys plans for her trip to England are pretty much complete Boy that story about the gunslinger wont get out of my head Tell you what ole Roland needs some friends July th  I went to see Star Wars on my motorcycle tonight and I think itll be the last time I climb on the bike until things cool off a little I ate a ton of bugs Talk about protein I kept thinking about Roland my gunslinger from the Robert Browning poem with a tip of Hatlos Hat to Sergio Leone of course while I rode The manuscript is a novel no doubt  or a piece of one  but it occurs to me that the chapters also stand on their own Or almost I wonder if I could sell them to one of the fantasy mags Maybe even to Fantasy and Science Fiction which is of course the genres Holy Grail Probably a stupid idea Otherwise not much doing but the AllStar Game National League  American League  I was pretty hammered before it was over Tabby not pleased August th  Kirby McCauley sold the first chapter of that old Dark Tower story of mine to Fantasy and Science Fiction Man I can hardly believe it That is just so cool Kirby sez he thinks Ed Ferman the Edinchief there will probably run everything of the DT story that Ive got Hes going to call the first bit The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed etc etc blahblah bangbang The Gunslinger which makes sense Not bad for an old story that was moldering away forgotten in a wet corner of the garage last year Ferman told Kirby that Roland has a feel of reality thats missing in a lot of fantasy fiction and wanted to know if there might be even more adventures Im sure there are even more adventures or were  or will be  whats the proper tense when youre talking about unwritten tales but I have no idea what they might be Only that John Jake Chambers would have to come back into it A rainy muggy day by the lake No Playground for the kids Tonight we had Andy Fulcher sit the big kids while Tab  I  Owen went to the Bridgton DriveIn Tabby thought the film  The Other Side of Midnight from last year  actually was a piece of shit but I didnt hear her begging to be taken home As for me I found my mind drifting off to that damn Roland guy again This time to questions of his lost love Susan lovely girl at the window Who pray be she September   Got my first copy of the October issue with The Gunslinger in it Man this looks fine Burt Hatlen called today Hes talking about me maybe doing a year at the University of Maine as writer in residence Only Burt would be ballsy enough to think of a hack like me in connection w a job like that Sort of an interesting idea though October   Well shit drunk again I can barely see the goddam page but suppose I better put down something before I go staggering off to bed Got a letter from Ed Ferman at FSF today Hes going to do the second chapter of The Dark Tower  the part where Roland meets the kid  as The Way Station He really wants to publish the entire run of stories and Im agreeable enough I just wish there was more Meanwhile theres The Stand to think about  and of course The Dead Zone All of this doesnt seem to mean much to me just now I hate being here in Orrington  hate being on such a busy road for one thing Owen damned near got creamed by one of those Cianbro trucks today Scared the hell out of me Also gave me an idea for a story having to do with that odd little pet cemetery out in back of the housePET SEMATARY is what the sign sez isnt that weird Funny but also creepy Almost a Vault of Horror type of thing June th  Just got off the phone with Kirby McCauley He got a call from Donald Grant who publishes lots of fantasy stuff under his own imprint Kirby likes to joke that Don Grant is the man who made Robert E Howard infamous Anyway Don would like to publish my gunslinger stories and under their original title The Dark Tower subtitle The Gunslinger  Isnt that neat My own limited edition Hed do  copies plus  signed and numbered I told Kirby to go ahead and make the deal Anyway it looks like my teaching career is over and I got pretty well baked to celebrate Took out the Pet Sematary ms and looked it over Good God is that grim Readers would lynch me if I published it I think Thats one book thatll never see the light of day July th  Publishers Weekly our son Owen calls it Pudlishers Weakness which is actually sorta accurate reviewed the latest Richard Bachman bookand once more baby I got roasted They implied it was boring and that my friend it aint Oh well thinking about it made it that much easier to go to North Windham and pick up those  kegs of beer for the party Got em at Discount Beverage Im smoking again too so sue me Ill quit the day I turn  and thats a promise Oh and Pet Sematary is published exactly two months from today Then my career really will be over jokeat least I hope its a joke After some thought I added The Dark Tower to the authors adcard at the front of the book In the end I thought why not Yes I know its sold out  there were only  copies to start with fa Chrissake  but it was a real book and Im proud of it I dont suppose Ill ever go back to ole Roland the GunToting Knight Errant but yes Im proud of that book Good thing I remembered the beer run February st  Man I got this crazy call from Sam Vaughn at Doubleday this afternoon he edited Pet Sem you will remember I knew there were some fans who want The Dark Tower and are pissed off they cant get it because I also get letters But Sam sez they have gotten over THREE THOUSAND letters And why you ask Because I was dumb enough to put The Dark Tower on the Pet Sematary author adcard I think Sams a little pissed at me and I suppose hes got a point He says listing a book that fans want  cant get is a little like holding out a piece of meat to a hungry dog and then yanking it back saying No no you cant have it harhar On the other hand God  the Man Jesus people are so fucking spoiled They just assume that if theres a book anywhere in the world they want then they have a perfect right to that book This would be news indeed to those folks in the Middle Ages who might have heard rumors of books but never actually saw one paper was valuable which would be a good thing to put in the next GunslingerDark Tower novel if I ever get around to it and books were treasures you protected with your life I love being able to make my living writing stories but anyone who sez theres no dark side to it is full of shit Someday Im going to do a novel about a psychotic rare book dealer Joke Meanwhile today was Owens birthday Hes seven The age of reason I can hardly believe my youngest is seven and my daughter is thirteen a lovely young woman August th  NYC Just got back from a meeting with Elaine Koster from NAL and my agent the ole Kirboo Both of them pitched me on doing The Gunslinger as a tradesized paperback but I passed Maybe someday but I wont give that many people a chance to read something so unfinished unlessuntil I go back to work on the story Which I probably never will Meantime I have this other idea for a long novel about a clown thats really the worst monster in the world Not a bad idea clowns are scary To me at least Clowns  chickens go figure November th  I had a dream last night that I think breaks the creative logjam on It Suppose theres a kind of Beam holding the Earth or even multiple Earths in place And that the Beams generator rests on the shell of a turtle I could make that part of the books climax I know it sounds crazy but Im sure I read somewhere that in Hindu mythology theres a great turtle that bears us all on his shell and that he serves Gan the creative overforce Also I remember an anecdote where some lady sez to some famous scientist This evolution stuff is ridiculous Everyone knows that a turtle holds up the universe To which the scientist wish I could remember his name but I cant replies That may be madam but what holds up the turtle Scornful laugh from the lady who says Oh you cant fool me Its turtles all the way down Ha Take that ye rational men of science Anyway I keep a blank book by my bed and have gotten so I write down a lot of dreams and dream elements wo even fully waking up This morning Id written Remember the Turtle And this See the TURTLE of enormous girth On his shell he holds the earth His thought is slow but always kind he holds us all within his mind Not great poetry I grant you but not bad for a guy who was threequarters asleep when he wrote it Tabby has been on my case about drinking too much again I suppose shes right but June th  LovellTurtleback Lane Man am I glad we bought this house I was scared of the expense to begin with but Ive never written better than I have here And  this is scary but its true  I think I want to go back to work on The Dark Tower story In my heart I thought I never would but last night when I was going to the Center General for beer I could almost hear Roland saying There are many worlds and many tales but not much time I ended up turning around and coming back to the house Cant remember the last time I spent a totally sober night but this is one of that dying breed It actually feels fucked up not to be fucked up Thats pretty sad I guess June th  I woke up in the middle of the night hungover and needing to pee While I was standing at the bowl it was almost as if I could see Roland of Gilead Telling me to start with the lobstrosities I will I know just what they are June th  Started the new book today Cant believe Im actually writing about old long tall and ugly again but it felt right from the first page Hell from the first word Ive decided itll be almost like the classic fairytales in structure Roland walks along the beach of the Western Sea getting sicker  sicker as he goes and theres a series of doors to our world Hell draw a new character from behind each one The first one will be a stone junkie named Eddie Dean July th  I cant believe this I mean Ive got the manuscript on the desk right in front of me so I sorta have to but I still cant I have written  PAGES in the last month and the copy is so clean its positively squeaky Ive never felt like one of those writers who can actually take credit for their work who say they plot every move and incident but Ive also never had a book that seemed to flow through me like this one has Its pretty much taken over my life from Day One And do you know it seems to me that a lot of the other things Ive written especially It  are like practice shots for this story Certainly Ive never picked something up after it lay fallow for fifteen years I mean sure I did a little work on the stories Ed Ferman published in FSF and I did a little more when Don Grant published The Gunslinger but nothing like what Im up to now I even dream about this story I have days when I wish I could quit drinking but Ill tell you something Im almost scared to stop I know inspiration doesnt flow from the neck of a bottle but theres something Im scared okay I feel like theres something  Something  that doesnt want me to finish this book That didnt even want me to start it Now I know thats crazy Like something out of a Stephen King story harhar but at the same time it seems very real Probably a good thing no onell ever read this diary very likely theyd put me away if they did Anyone want to buy a used fruitcake Im going to call it The Drawing of the Three I think September th  Its done The Drawing of the Three is done I got drunk to celebrate Stoned too And whats next Well It will be published in a month or so and in two days Ill be thirtynine Man I can hardly believe it Seems just about a week ago that we were living in Bridgton and the kids were babies Ah fuck Time to quit The writers gettin maudlin June th  Got my first authors copy of Drawing from Donald Grant today Its a beautiful package Ive also decided to let NAL go ahead and do both Dark Tower books in paperback  give the people what they want Why the hell not Of course I got drunk to celebrateonly these days who needs an excuse Its a good book but in many ways it seems like I didnt write the damn thing at all that it just flowed out of me like the umbilical cord from a babys navel What Im trying to say is that the wind blows the cradle rocks and sometimes it seems to me that none of this stuff is mine that Im nothing but Roland of Gileads fucking secretary I know thats stupid but a part of me sort of believes it Only maybe Rolands got his own boss Ka I do tend to get depressed when I look at my life the booze the drugs the cigarettes As if Im actually trying to kill myself Or something else is October th  Im in Lovell tonight the house on Turtleback Lane Came down here to think about the way Im living my life Somethings got to change man because otherwise I might as well just cut to the chase and blow my brains out Somethings got to change The following item from the North Conway NHMountain Earwas pasted into the writers journal marked April th  LOCAL SOCIOLOGIST DISMISSES WALKIN TALES By Logan Merrill For at least  years the White Mountains have resounded with tales of WalkIns creatures who may be aliens from space time travelers or even beings from another dimension In a lively lecture last night at the North Conway Public Library local sociologist Henry K Verdon author of Peer Groups and MythMaking used the WalkIn phenomenon as an illustration of just how myths are created and how they grow He said that the WalkIns were probably originally created by teenagers in the border towns between Maine and New Hampshire He also speculated that sightings of illegal aliens who cross over the northern border from Canada and then into the New England states may have played a part in kindling this myth which has become so prevalent I think we all know Professor Verdon said that there is no Santa Claus no Tooth Fairy and no actual beings called WalkIns Yet these tales Continued on P  The rest of the article is missing Nor is there any explanation as to why King may have included it in his journal June th  I just got back from my oneyear Alcoholix Anonymous anniversary An entire year wo drugs or booze I can hardly believe it No regrets sobering up undoubtedly saved my life and probably my marriage but I wish it wasnt so hard to write stories in the aftermath People in the Program say dont push it itll come but theres another voice I think of it as the Voice of the Turtle telling me to hurry up and get going time is short and I have to sharpen my tools For what For The Dark Tower of course and not just because letters keep coming in from people who read The Drawing of the Three and want to know what happens next Something in me wants to go back to work on the story but Ill be damned if I know how to get back July th  There are some amazing treasures on the bookshelves down here in Lovell Know what I found this morning while I was looking for something to read Shardik by Richard Adams Not the story about the rabbits but the one about the giant mythological bear I think Ill read it over again Am still not writing much of interest September   Okay this is relatively weird so prepare yourself Around  AM while I was writing while I was staring at the word processor and dreaming about how great it would be to have an icecold keg of Bud at least the doorbell rang It was a guy from Bangor House of Flowers with a dozen roses Not for Tab either but for me The card read Happy Birthday from the Mansfields  Dave Sandy and Megan I had totally forgotten but today Im the Big FourTwo Anyway I took one of the roses out and I kind of got lost in it I know how strange that sounds believe me but I did I seemed to hear this sweet humming and I just went down  down following the curves of the rose kind of splashing thru these drops of dew that seemed as big as ponds And all the time that humming sound got louder  sweeter and the rose gotwell rosier And I found myself thinking of Jake from the first Dark Tower story and Eddie Dean and a bookstore I even remember the name The Manhattan Restaurant of the Mind Then boom I feel a hand on my shoulder I turn around and its Tabby She wanted to know who sent me the roses She also wanted to know if Id fallen asleep I said no but I kind of did right there in the kitchen You know what it was like That scene at the Way Station in the The Gunslinger where Roland hypnotizes Jake with a bullet Im immune to hypnosis myself A guy got me up on stage at the Topsham Fair when I was a kid and tried it on me but it didnt work As I remember my brother Dave was quite disappointed He wanted me to cluck like a chicken Anyway I think I want to go back to work on The Dark Tower I dont know if Im ready for anything that complex  after some of the failures of the last couple of years lets say Im dubious  but I want to give it a shot just the same I hear those makebelieve people calling to me And who knows There might even be a place in this one for a giant bear like Shardik in the Richard Adams novel October th  I started the next Dark Tower book today and  as with The Drawing of the Three  I finished my first session wondering why in Gods name I waited so long Being with Roland Eddie and Susannah is like a drink of cool water Or meeting old friends after a long absence And once again there is a sense that Im not telling the story but only providing a conduit for it And you know what Thats okiefine with me I sat at the word processor for four hours this morning and did not once think of a drink or any sort of mindaltering drug I think Ill call this one The Wastelands October th  No  Waste Lands  words as in the T S Eliot poem his is actually The Waste Land I think January th  Finished The Waste Lands tonight after a marathon hour session People are going to hate the way it ends w no conclusion to the riddle contest and I thought the story would go on longer myself but I cant help it I heard a voice speak up clearly in my head as always it sounds like Rolands saying Youre done for now  close thy book wordslinger Cliffhanger ending aside the story seems fine to me but as always not much like the other ones I write The manuscript is a brick over  pages long and I created said brick in just a little over three months Unfuckingreal Once again hardly any strikeovers or retakes There are a few continuity glitches but considering the length of the book I can hardly believe how few Nor can I believe how when I needed some sort of inspiration the right book seemed to fly into my hand time after time Like The Quincunx by Charles Palliser with all the wonderful growly thcentury slang Aye so ye do and So ye will and my cully That argot sounded perfect coming out of Gashers mouth to me at least And how cool it was to have Jake come back into the story the way he did Only thing that worries me is whats going to happen to Susannah Dean who used to be DettaOdetta Shes pregnant and Im afraid of who or what the father might be Some demon I dont think so exactly Maybe I wont have to deal w that until a couple of books further down the line In any case my experience is that in a long book whenever a woman gets pregnant and nobody knows who the father is that story is headed down the tubes Dunno why but as a plotthickener pregnancy just naturally seems to suck Oh well maybe it doesnt matter For the time being Im tired of Roland and his katet I think it may be awhile before I get back to them again although the fans are going to howl their heads off about that cliffhanger ending on the train out of Lud Mark my words Im glad I wrote it tho and to me the ending seems just right In many ways Waste Lands feels like the high point of my makebelieve life Even better than The Stand maybe November th  Remember me saying that Id get bitched at about the ending of Waste Lands Look at this Letter follows from John T Spier of Lawrence Kansas November   Dear Mr King Or should I just cut to the chase and say Dear Asshole I cant believe I paid such big bucks for a Donald Grant Edition of your GUNSLINGER book The Waste Lands and this is what I got It had the right title anyway for it was a true WASTE I mean the story was all right dont get me wrong great in fact but how could you tack on an ending like that It wasnt an ending at all but just a case of you getting tired and saying Oh well what the fuck I dont need to strain my brain to write an ending those slobs who buy my books will swallow anything I was going to send it back but will keep it because I at least liked the pictures especially Oy But the story was a cheat Can you spell CHEAT Mr King MOON that spells CHEAT Sincerely yours in criticism John T Spier Lawrence Kansas March   In a way this one makes me feel even worse Letter follows from Mrs Coretta Vele of Stowe Vermont March th  Dear Stephen King I dont know if this letter will actually reach you but one can always hope I have read most of your books and have loved them all I am a yrsyoung gramma from your sister state of Vermont and I especially like your Dark Tower stories Well to the point Last month I went to see a team of Oncologists at Mass General and they tell me that the brain tumor I have looks to be malignant after all at st they said Dont worry Coretta its benine Now I know you have to do what you have to do Mr King and follow your muse but what theyre saying is that I will be fortunate to see the th of July this year I guess Ive read my last Dark Tower yarn So what Im wondering is Can you tell me how the Dark Tower story comes out at least if Roland and his KaTet actually get to the Dark Tower And if so what they find there I promise not to tell a soul and you will be making a dying woman very happy Sincerely Coretta Vele Stowe Vt I feel like such a shit when I think of how blithe I was concerning the ending of Waste Lands I gotta answer Coretta Veles letter but I dont know how to Could I make her believe I dont know any more than she does about how Rolands story finishes I doubt it and yet that is the truth as Jake sez in his Final Essay I have no more idea whats inside that damned Tower thanwell than Oy does I didnt even know it was in a field of roses until it came off my fingertips and showed up on the screen of my new Macintosh computer Would Coretta buy that What would she say if I told her Cory listen The wind blows and the story comes Then it stops blowing and all I can do is wait same as you They think Im in charge every one of them from the smartest of the critics to the most mentally challenged reader And thats a real hoot Because Im not September   The Grant edition of The Waste Lands is sold out and the paperback edition is doing very well I should be happy and guess I am but Im still getting a ton of letters about the cliffhanger ending They fall into  major categories People who are pissed off people who want to know when the next book in the series is coming out and pissedoff people who want to know when the next book in the series is coming out But Im stuck The wind from that quarter just isnt blowing Not just now anyway Meanwhile I have an idea for a novel about a lady who buys a picture in a pawnshop and then kind of falls into it Hey maybe itll be MidWorld she falls into and shell meet Roland July th  Tabby and I dont fight much since I quit drinking but oboy this morning we had a dilly Were at the Lovell house of course and as I was getting ready to leave on my morning walk she showed me a story from todays Lewiston Sun It seems that a Stoneham man Charles Chip McCausland was struck and killed by a hitandrun driver while walking on Route  Which is the road I walk on of course Tabby tried to persuade me to stay on Turtleback Lane I tried to persuade her that I had as much right to use Route  as anyone else and honest to God I only do half a mile on the blacktop and things went downhill from there Finally she asked me to at least stop walking on Slab City Hill where the sightlines are so short and theres nowhere to jump if someone happens to get off the road and onto the shoulder I told her Id think about it it would have been noon before I got out of the house if we kept on talking but in truth Ill be damned if Ill live my life in fear that way Besides it seems to me that this poor guy from Stoneham has made the odds of me getting hit while out walking about a million to one I told this to Tabby and she said The odds of you ever being as successful at writing as you have been are even higher Youve said so yourself To that Im afraid I had no comeback June th  Bangor Tabby and I just got back from the Bangor Auditorium where our youngest and about four hundred of his classmates finally got a diploma Hes now officially a high school graduate Bangor High and the Bangor Rams are behind him Hell be starting college in the fall and then Tab and I will have to start dealing w the everpopular Empty Nest Syndrome Everybody sez it all goes by in the wink of an eye and you say yeah yeah yeah and then it does Fuck Im sad Feel lost Whats it all for anyway Whats it all about Alfie haha What just a big scramble from the cradle to the grave The clearing at the end of the path Jesus thats grim Meantime were headed down to Lovell and the house on Turtleback Lane this afternoon  Owen will join us in a day or two he sez Tabby knows I want to write by the lake and boy shes so intuitive its scary When we were coming back from the graduation exercises she asked me if the wind was blowing again In fact it is and this time its blowing a gale I cant wait to start the next volume of the DT series Time to find out what happens in the riddling contest that Eddie blows Blaines computerized mind with silly questions  ie riddles  is something Ive known for several months now but I dont think thats the major story I have to tell this time I want to write about Susan Rolands first love and I want to set their cowboy romance in a fictional part of MidWorld called Mejis ie Mexico Time to saddle up and take another ride w the Wild Bunch Meantime the other kids are doing well although Naomi had some kind of allergic reaction maybe to shellfish July th  Turtleback Lane Lovell As on my previous expeditions to MidWorld I feel like somebody whos just spent a month on a jetpropelled rocketsled While stoned on hallucinatory happygas I thought this book would be tougher to get into much but in fact it was once more as easy as slipping into a pair of comfortable old shoes or those Westernstyle shortboots I got from Ballys in New York  or  years ago and cannot bear to give up Ive already got over  pages and was delighted to find Roland and his friends investigating the remains of the superflu seeing evidence of both Randall Flagg and Mother Abagail I think Flagg may turn out to be Walter Rolands old nemesis His real name is Walter oDim and he was just a country boy to start with It makes perfect sense in a way I can see now how to a greater or lesser degree every story Ive ever written is about this story And you know I dont have a problem with that Writing this story is the one that always feels like coming home Why does it always feel dangerous as well Why should I be so convinced that if Im ever found slumped over my desk dead of a heart attack or wiped out on my Harley probably on Route  it will be while working on one of these Weird Westerns I guess because I know so many people are depending on me to finish the cycle And I want to finish it God yes No Canterbury Tales or Mystery of Edwin Drood in my portfolio if I can help it thank you very much And yet I always feel as if some anticreative force is looking around for me and that I am easier to see when Im working on these stories Well enough w the heebiejeebies Im off on my walk September   Im expecting the book to be done in another five weeks This one has been more challenging but still the story comes to me in wonderful rich details Watched Kurosawas The Seven Samurai last nite and wonder if that might not be the right direction for Vol  The Werewolves of EndWorld or some such I probably ought to see if any of the little sideotheroad video rental places around here have got The Magnificent Seven which is the Americanized version of the Kurosawa film Speaking of sideotheroad I almost had to dive into the ditch this afternoon to avoid a guy in a van  swerving from side to side pretty obviously drunk  on the last part of Route  before I turn back into the relatively sheltered environs of Turtleback Lane I dont think Ill mention this to Tabby shed go nuclear Anyway Ive had my one pedestrian scare and Im just glad it didnt happen on the Slab City Hill portion of the road October th  Took me a little longer than I thought but I finished Wizard and Glass tonight August th  Tabby and I just said goodbye to Joe and his good wife theyre on their way back to New York I was glad I could give them a copy of Wizard and Glass The first bunch of finished books came today What looks  smells better than a new book especially one w your name on the title page This is the worlds best job Ive got real people pay me real money to hang out in my imagination Where I should add the only ones who feel completely real to me are Roland and his katet I think the CRs are really going to like this one and not just because it finishes the story of Blaine the Mono I wonder if the Vermont Gramma with the brain tumor is still alive I spoze not but if she was Id be happy to send her a copy July th  Tabby Owen Joe and I went to Oxford tonight to see the film Armageddon I liked it more than I expected in part because I had my family w me The movie is sfxdriven endoftheworld stuff Got me thinking about the Dark Tower and the Crimson King Probably not surprising I wrote for awhile this morning on my Vietnam story switching over from longhand to my PowerBook so I guess Im serious about it I like the way Sully John reappeared Question Will Roland Deschain and his friends ever meet Bobby Garfields pal Ted Brautigan And just who are those low men chasing the old Tedster anyway More and more my work feels like a slanted trough where everything eventually drains into MidWorld and EndWorld The Dark Tower is my uber story no question about that When its done I plan to ease back Maybe retire completely August   Took my usual walk this afternoon and tonight I took Fred Hauser with me to the AA meeting in Fryeburg On the way home he asked me to sponsor him and I said yes I think hes finally getting serious about sobering up Good for him Anyhow he got talking about the socalled WalkIns He says there are more of them around the Seven Towns than ever and all sorts of folks are gossiping about them How come I never hear anything then I asked him To which I got no answer but an extremely funny look I kept prodding and finally Fred sez People dont like to talk about them around you Steve because there have been two dozen reported on Turtleback Lane in the last  months and you claim not to have seen a single one To me this seemed like a non sequitur and I made no reply It wasnt until after the meeting  and after Id dropped my new pigeon off  that I realized what he was saying people dont talk about the WalkIns around me because they think that in some crazy way IM RESPONSIBLE I thought I was pretty well used to being Americas boogeyman but this is actually sort of outrageous January   Boston Owen and I are at the Hyatt Harborside tonight and head off to Florida tomorrow Tabby and I are talking about buying a place there but havent told the kids I mean theyre only   and   maybe when theyre old enough to understand such things haha Earlier we met Joe and saw a film called Hurlyburly from the play by David Rabe Very odd Speaking of odd I had some sort of New Years Night nightmare before leaving Maine Cant remember exactly what it was but when I woke up this morning Id written two things in my dreambook One was Baby Mordred like something out of a Chas Addams cartoon That I sort of understand it must refer to Susannahs baby in the Dark Tower stories Its the other thing that puzzles me It says  O Discordia Discordia also sounds like something out of the DT stories but its not anything I have invented As for  thats a date right Meaning what June th of this year Tabby and I should be back at the Turtleback Lane house by then but so far as I can remember its not anybodys birthday Maybe its the date Im going to meet my first walkin June   Its wonderful to be back at the lake Ive decided to take  days off then finally return to work on the howtowrite book Im curious about Hearts in Atlantis will folks want to know if Bobby Garfields friend Ted Brautigan plays a part in the Tower saga The truth is I really dont know the answer to that In any case readership of the Tower stories has fallen off a lot lately  the figures are really disappointing compared to that of my other books except for Rose Madder which was a real tankjob at least in the sales sense But it doesnt matter at least to me and if the series ever gets done sales may go up Tabby and I had another argument about my walking route she asked me again to quit going out on the main road Also she asked me Is the wind blowing yet Meaning am I thinking about the next Dark Tower story I said no commalacomecome the tale has not begun But it will and theres a dance called the commala in it Thats the one thing I see clearly Roland dancing Why or for whom I dont know Anyway I asked T why she wanted to know about the Dark Tower and she said Youre safer when youre with the gunslingers Joking I suppose but an odd joke for T Not much like her June   Talked with Rand Holston and Mark Carliner tonight They both sound excited about moving on from Storm of the Century to Rose Red or Kingdom Hospital  but either one would fill my plate up again I dreamed of my walk last night  woke up crying The Tower will fall I thought O Discordia the world grows dark  Headline from the PortlandPressHeraldJune   WALKIN PHENOMENON IN WESTERN MAINE CONTINUES TO RESIST EXPLANATION June   This is like one of those times when all the planets line up except in this case its my family all lined up here on Turtleback Lane Joe and his family arrived around noon their little boy is really cute Say true Sometimes I look in the mirror and say You are a grandfather And the Steve in the mirror just laughs because the idea is so ridiculous The Steve in the mirror knows Im still a college sophomore going to classes and protesting the war in Viet Nam by day drinking beer down at Pats Pizza with Flip Thompson and George McLeod by night As for my grandson the beautiful Ethan He just tugs on the balloon tied to his toe and laughs Daughter Naomi and son Owen got here late last night We had a great Fathers Day dinner people saying things to me that were so nice I had to check to make sure I wasnt dead God Im lucky to have family lucky to have more stories to tell lucky to still be alive The worst thing to happen this week I hope will be my wifes bed collapsing under the weight of our son and daughterinlaw  the idiots were wrestling on it You know what Ive been thinking of going back to Rolands story after all As soon as I finish the book on writing  On Writing would actually not be a bad title  its simple and to the point But right now the sun is shining the day is beautiful and what Im going to do is take a walk More later maybe From the Portland SundayTelegramJune   STEPHEN KING DIES NEAR LOVELL HOME POPULAR MAINE WRITER KILLED WHILE TAKING AFTERNOON WALK INSIDER CLAIMS MAN DRIVING LETHAL VAN TOOK

all the foes of men and rose Rise with the setting sun Constant Readers Wordslingers Note Id once more like to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of Robin Furth who read this novel in manuscript  and those preceding it  with great and sympathetic attention to detail If this increasingly complex tale hangs together Robin should get most of the credit And if you dont believe it check out herDark Tower concordance which makes fascinating reading in and of itself Thanks are also due to Chuck Verrill who has edited the final five novels in the Tower cycle and to the three publishers two large and one small who cooperated to make this massive project a reality Robert Wiener Donald M Grant Publisher Susan Petersen Kennedy and Pamela Dorman Viking Susan Moldow and Nan Graham Scribner Special thanks to Agent Moldow whose irony and bravery have saved many a bleak day There are others plenty of them but Im not going to annoy you with the whole list After all this aint the fucking Academy Awards is it Certain geographical details in this book and in the concluding novel of the Tower cycle have been fictionalized The real people mentioned in these pages have been used in a fictional way And to the best of my knowledge there were never coinop storage lockers in the World Trade Center As for you Constant Reader One more turn of the path and then we reach the clearing Come along with me will ya not Stephen King May   Tell God thank ya
