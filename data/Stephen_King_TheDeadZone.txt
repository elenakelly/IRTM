By the time he graduated from college John Smith had forgotten all about the bad fall he took on the ice that January day in In fact he would have been hard put to remember it by the time he graduated from grammar school And his mother and father never knew about it at all They were skating on a cleared patch of Runaround Pond in Durham The bigger boys were playing hockey with old taped sticks and using a couple of potato baskets for goals The little kids were just farting around the way little kids have done since time immemorial  their ankles bowing comically in and out their breath puffing in the frosty twentydegree air At one corner of the cleared ice two rubber tires burned sootily and a few parents sat nearby watching their children The age of the snowmobile was still distant and winter fun still consisted of exercising your body rather than a gasoline engine Johnny had walked down from his house just over the Pownal line with his skates hung over his shoulder At six he was a pretty fair skater Not good enough to join in the big kids hockey games yet but able to skate rings around most of the other first graders who were always pinwheeling their arms for balance or sprawling on their butts Now he skated slowly around the outer edge of the clear patch wishing he could go backward like Timmy Benedix listening to the ice thud and crackle mysteriously under the snow cover farther out also listening to the shouts of the hockey players the rumble of a pulp truck crossing the bridge on its way to US Gypsum in Lisbon Falls the murmur of conversation from the adults He was very glad to be alive on that cold fair winter day Nothing was wrong with him nothing troubled his mind he wanted nothing  except to be able to skate backward like Timmy Benedix He skated past the fire and saw that two or three of the grownups were passing around a bottle of booze Gimme some of that he shouted to Chuck Spier who was bundled up in a big lumberjack shirt and green flannel snowpants Chuck grinned at him Get outta here kid I hear your mother callin you Grinning sixyear old Johnny Smith skated on And on the road side of the skating area he saw Timmy Benedix himself coming down the slope with his father behind him Timmy he shouted Watch this He turned around and began to skate clumsily backward Without realising it he was skating into the area of the hockey game Hey kid someone shouted Get out the way Johnny didnt hear He was doing it I He was skating backward He had caught the rhythm  all at once It was in a kind of sway of the legs He looked down fascinated to see what his legs were doing The big kids hockey puck old and scarred and gouged around the edges buzzed past him unseen One of the big kids not a very good skater was chasing it with what was almost a blind headlong plunge Chuck Spier saw it coming He rose to his feet and shouted Johnny Watch out John raised his head  and the next moment the dumsy skater all one hundred and sixty pounds of him crashed into little John Smith at full speed Johnny went flying arms out A bare moment later his head connected with the ice and he blacked out Blacked out  black ie blacked out  black ice black Black They told him he had blacked out All he was really sure of was that strange repeating thought and suddenly looking up at a circle of faces  scared hockey players worried adults curious little kids Timmy Benedix smirking Chuck Spier was holding him Black ice Black What Chuck asked Johnny you okay You took a hell of a knock Black Johnny said gutturally Black ice Dont jump it no more Chuck Chuck looked around a little scared then back at Johnny He touched the large knot that was rising on the boys forehead Im sorry the clumsey hockey player said I never even saw him Little kids are supposed to stay away from the hockey Its the rules He looked around uncertainly for support Johnny Chuck said He didnt like the look of Johnnys eyes They were dark and faraway distant and cold Are you okay Dont jump it no more Johnny said unaware of what he was saying thinking only of ice  black ice The explosion The acid Think we ought to take him to the doctor Chuck asked Bill Gendron He dont know what hes sayin Give him a minute Bill advised They gave him a minute and Johnnys head did clear Im okay he muttered Lemme up Timmy Benedix was still smirking damn him Johnny decided he would show Timmy a thing or two He would be skating rings around Timmy by the end of the week  backward and forward You come on over and sit down by the fire for a while Chuck said You took a hell of a knock Johnny let them help him over to the fire The smell of melting rubber was strong and pungent  making him feel a little sick to his stomach He had a headache He felt the lump over his left eye curiously It felt as though it stuck out a mile Can you remember who you are and everything Bill asked Sure Sure I can Im okay Whos your dad and mom Herb and Vera Herb and Vera Smith Bill and Chuck looked at each other and shrugged I think hes okay Chuck said and then for the third time but he sure took a hell of a knock didnt he Wow Kids Bill said looking fondly out at his eight year old twin girls skating hand in hand and then back at Johnny It probably would have killed a grownup Not a Polack Chuck replied and they both burst out laughing The bottle of Bushmills began making its rounds again Ten minutes later Johnny was back out on the ice his headache already fading the knotted bruise standing out on his forehead like a weird brand By the time he went home for lunch he had forgotten all about the fall and blacking out in the joy of having discovered how to skate backward Gods mercy Vera Smith said when she saw him How did you get that Fell down he said and began to slurp up Campbells tomato soup Are you all right John she asked touching it gently Sure Mom He was too except for the occasional bad dreams that came over the course of the next month or so the bad dreams and a tendency to sometimes get very dozy at times of the day when he had never been dozy before And that stopped happening at about the same time the bad dreams stopped happening He was all right In midFebruary Chuck Spier got up one morning and found that the battery of his old  De Soto was dead He tried to jump it from his farm truck As he attached the second damp to the De Sotos battery it exploded in his face showering him with fragments and corrosive battery acid He lost an eye Vera said it was Gods own mercy he hadnt lost them both Johnny thought it was a terrible tragedy and went with his father to visit Chuck in the Lewiston General Hospital a week after the accident The sight of Big Chuck lying in that hospital bed looking oddly wasted and small had shaken Johnny badly  and that night he had dreamed it was him lying there From time to time in the years afterward Johnny had hunches  he would know what the next record on the radio was going to be before the DJ played it that sort of thing  but he never connected these with his accident on the ice By then he had forgotten it And the hunches were never that startling or even very frequent It was not until the night of the county fair and the mask that anything very startling happened Before the second accident Later he thought of that often The thing with the Wheel of Fortune had happened before the second accident Like a warning from his own childhood The travelling salesman crisscrossed Nebraska and Iowa tirelessly under the burning sun in that summer of  He sat behind the wheel of a  Mercury sedan that already had better than seventy thousand miles on it The Merc was developing a marked wheeze in the valves He was a big man who still had the look of a cornfed midwestern boy on him in that summer of  only four months after his Omaha housepainting business had gone broke Greg Stilison was only twentytwo years old The trunk and the back seat of the Mercury were filled with cartons and the cartons were filled with books Most of them were Bibles They came in all shapes and sizes There was your basic item The American TruthWay Bible illustrated with sixteen color plates bound with airplane glue for i  and sure to hold together for at least ten months then for the poorer pocketbook there was The American TruthWay New Testament for sixtyfive cents with no color plates but with the words of Our Lord Jesus printed in red and for the big spender there was The American TruthWay Deluxe Word of God for  bound in imitation white leather the owners name to be stenciled in gold leaf on the front cover twentyfour color plates and a section in the middle to note down births marriages and burials And the Deluxe Word of God might remain in one piece for as long as two years There was also a carton of paperbacks entitled America the Truth Way The CommunistJewish Conspiracy Against Our United States Greg did better with this paperback printed on cheap pulp stock than with all the Bibles put together It told all about how the Rothschilds and the Roosevelts and the Greenblatts were taking over the US economy and the US government There were graphs showing how the Jews related directly to the CommunistMarxistLeninistTrotskyite axis and from there to the Antichrist Itself The days of McCarthyism were not long over in Washington in the Midwest Joe McCarthys star had not yet set and Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was known as that bitch for her famous Declaration of Conscience In addition to the stuff about Communism Greg Stillsons rural farm constituency seemed to have a morbid interest in the idea that the Jews were running the world Now Greg turned into the dusty driveway of a farmhouse some twenty miles west of Ames Iowa It had a deserted shutup look to it  the shades down and the barn doors closed  but you could never tell until you tried That motto had served Greg Stillson well in the two years or so since he and his mother had moved up to Omaha from Oklahoma The housepainting business had been no great shakes but he had needed to get the taste of Jesus out of his mouth for a little while you should pardon the small blasphemy But now he had come back home  not on the pulpit or revival side this time though and it was something of a relief to be out of the miracle business at last He opened the car door and as he stepped out into the dust of the driveway a big mean farm dog advanced out of the barn its ears laid back It volleyed barks Hello pooch Greg said in his low pleasant but carrying voice  at twentytwo it was already the voice of a trained spellbinder The pooch didnt respond to the friendliness in his voice It kept coming big and mean intent on an early lunch of traveling salesman Greg sat back down in the car closed the door and honked the horn twice Sweat rolled down his face and turned his white linen suit darker gray in circular patches under his arms and in a branching treeshape up his back He honked again but there was no response The clodhoppers had loaded themselves into their International Harvester or their Stud baker and gone into town Greg smiled Instead of shifting into reverse and backing out of the driveway he reached behind him and produced a Flit gun  only this one was loaded with ammonia instead of Flit Pulling back the plunger Greg stepped out of the car again smiling easily The dog which had settled down on its haunches immediately got up again and began to advance on him growling Greg kept smiling Thats right poochie he said in that pleasant carrying voice You just come on Come on and get it He hated these ugly farm dogs that ran their halfacre of dooryard like arrogant little Caesars they told you something about their masters as well Fucking bunch of clodhoppers he said under his breath He was still smiling Come on doggie The dog came It tensed its haunches down to spring at him In the barn a cow mooed and the wind rustled tenderly through the corn As it leaped Gregs smile turned to a hard and bitter grimace He depressed the Flit plunger and sprayed a stinging cloud of ammonia drops lets directly into the dogs eyes and nose Its angry barking turned immediately to short agonized yips and then as the bite of ammonia really settled in to howls of pain It turned tail at once a watchdog no longer but only a vanquished cur Greg Stilisons face had darkened His eyes had drawn down to ugly slits He stepped forward rapidly and administered a whistling kick to the dogs haunches with one of his StrideKing airtip shoes The dog gave a high wailing sound and driven by its pain and fear it sealed its own doom by turning around to give battle to the author of its misery rather than running for the barn With a snarl it struck out blindly snagged the right cuff of Gregs white linen pants and tore it You sonofabitch he cried out in startled anger and kicked the dog again this time hard enough to send it rolling in the dust He advanced on the dog once more kicked it again still yelling Now the dog eyes watering nose in fiery agony one rib broken and another badly sprung realized its danger from this madman but it was too late Greg Stillson chased it across the dusty farmyard panting and shouting sweat rolling down his cheeks and kicked the dog until it was screaming and barely able to drag itself along through the dust It was bleeding in half a dozen places It was dying Shouldnt have bit me Greg whispered You hear You hear me You shouldnt have bit me you dipshit dog No one gets in my way You hear No one He delivered another kick with one bloodspattered airtip but the dog could do no more than make a low choking sound Not much satisfaction in that Gregs head ached It was the sun Chasing the dog around in the hot sun Be lucky not to pass out He closed his eyes for a moment breathing rapidly the sweat rolling down his face like tears and nestling in his crewcut like gems the broken dog dying at his feet Colored specks of light pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat floated across the darkness behind his lids His head ached Sometimes he wondered if he was going crazy Like now He had meant to give the dog a burst from the ammonia Flit gun drive it back into the barn so he could leave his business card in the crack of the screen door Come back some other time and make a sale Now look Look at this mess Couldnt very well leave his card now could he He opened his eyes The dog lay at his feet panting rapidly drizzling blood from its snout As Greg Stillson looked down it licked his shoe humbly as if to acknowledge that it had been bested and then it went back to the business of dying Shouldnt have torn my pants he said to it Pants cost me five bucks you shitpoke dog He had to get out of here Wouldnt do him any good if Clem Kadiddlehopper and his wife and their six kids came back from town now in their Studebaker and saw Fido dying out here with the bad old salesman standing over him Hed lose his job The American TruthWay Company didnt hire salesmen who killed dogs that belonged to Christians Giggling nervously Greg went back to the Mercury got in and backed rapidly out of the driveway He turned east on the dirt road that ran straight as a string through the corn and was soon cruising along at sixtyfive leaving a dust plume two miles long behind him He most assuredly didnt want to lose the job Not yet He was making good money  in addition to the wrinkles the American TruthWay Company knew about Greg had added a few of his own that they didnt know about He was making it now Besides traveling around he got to meet a lot of people a lot of girls It was a good life except Except he wasnt content He drove on his head throbbing No he just wasnt content He felt that he was meant for bigger things than driving around the Midwest and selling Bibles and doctoring the commission forms in order to make an extra two bucks a day He felt that he was meant for   for  For greatness Yes that was it that was surely it A few weeks ago he had taken some girl up in the hayloft her folks had been in Davenport selling a truckload of chickens she had started off by asking if he would like a glass of lemonade and one thing had just led to another and after hed had her she said it was almost like getting diddled by a preacher and he had slapped her he didnt know why He had slapped her and then left Well no Actually he had slapped her three or four times Until she had cried and screamed for someone to come and help her and then he had stopped and somehow  he had had to use every ounce of the charm God had given him  he had made it up with her His head had been aching then too the pulsing specks of brightness shooting and caroming across his field of vision and he tried to tell himself it was the heat the explosive heat in the hayloft but it wasnt just the heat that made his head ache It was the same thing he had felt in the dooryard when the dog tore his pants something dark and crazy Im not crazy he said aloud in the car He unrolled the window swiftly letting in summer heat and the smell of dust and corn and manure He turned on the radio loud and caught a Patti Page song His headache went back a little bit It was all a matter of keeping yourself under control and  and keeping your record dean If you did those things they couldnt touch you And he was getting better at both of those things He no longer had the dreams about his father so often the dreams where his father was standing above him with his hard hat cocked back on his head bellowing Youre no good runt Youre no fucking good He didnt have the dreams so much because they just werent true He wasnt a runt anymore Okay he had been sick a lot as a kid not much size but he had gotten his growth he was taking care of his mother And his father was dead His father couldnt see He couldnt make his father eat his words because he had died in an oilderrick blowout and he was dead and once just once Greg would like to dig him up and scream into his mouldering face You were wrong dad you were wrong about me and then give him a good kick the way The way he had kicked the dog The headache was back lowering Im not crazy he said again below the sound of the music His mother had told him often he was meant for something big something great and Greg believed it It was just a matter of getting things  like slapping the girl or kicking the dog  under control and keeping his record dean Whatever his greatness was he would know it when it came to him Of that he felt quite sure He thought of the dog again and this time the thought brought a bare crescent of a smile without humor or compassion His greatness was on the way It might still be years ahead  he was young sure nothing wrong with being young as long as you understood you couldnt have everything all at once As long as you believed it would come eventually He did believe that And God and Sonny Jesus help anyone that got in his way Greg Stillson cocked a sunburned elbow out the window and began to whistle along with the radio He stepped on the gopedal walked that old Mercury up to seventy and rolled down the straight Iowa farm road toward whatever future there might be The two things Sarah remembered about that night later were his run of luck at the Wheel of Fortune and the mask But as time passed years of it it was the mask she thought about when she could bring herself to think about that horrible night at all He lived in an apartment house in Cleaves Mills Sarah got there at quarter to eight parking around the corner and buzzing up to be let in They were taking her car tonight because Johnnys was laid up at Tibbets Garage in Hampden with a frozen wheel bearing or something like that Something expensive Johnny had told her over the phone and then he had laughed a typical Johnny Smith laugh Sarah would have been in tears if it had been her car  her pocketbook Sarah went through the foyer to the stairs past the bulletin board that hung there It was dotted with file cards advertising motorbikes stereo components typing services and appeals from people who needed rides to Kansas or California people who were driving to Florida and needed riders to share the driving and help pay for the gas But tonight the board was dominated by a large placard showing a clenched fist against an angry red background suggesting fire The one word on the poster was STRIKE  It was late October of  Johnny had the front apartment on the second floor the penthouse he called it  where you could stand in your tux like Ramon Navarro a big slug of Ripple wine in a balloon glass and look down upon the vast beating heart of Cleaves Mills its hurrying aftershow crowds its bustling taxis its neon signs There are almost seven thousand stories in the naked city This has been one of them Actually Cleaves Mills was mostly a main street with a stop and go light at the intersection it turned into a blinker after  PM about two dozen stores and a small moccasin factory Like most of the towns surrounding Orono where the University of Maine was its real industry was supplying the things students consumed beer wine gas rock n roll music fast food dope gro ceries housing movies The movie house was The Shade It showed art films and S nostalgia flicks when school was in In the summertime it reverted to Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns Johnny and Sarah were both out of school a year and both were teaching at cleaves Mills High one of the few high schools in the area that had not consolidated into a threeor fourtown district University faculty and administration as well as university students used Cleaves as their bedroom and the town had an enviable tax base It also had a fine high school with a brandnew media wing The townies might bitch about the university crowd with their smart talk and their Commie marches to end the war and their meddling in town politics but they had never said no to the tax dollars that were paid annually on the gracious faculty homes and the apartment buildings in the area some students called Fudgey Acres and others called Sleaze Alley Sarah rapped on his door and Johnnys voice oddly muffled called Its open Sarah Frowning a little she pushed the door open Johnnys apartment was in total darkness except for the fitful yellow glow of the blinker half a block up the street The furniture was so many humped black shadows Johnny Wondering if a fuse had blown or something she took a tentative step forward  and then the face appeared before her floating in the darkness a horrible face out of a nightmare It glowed a spectral rotting green One eye was wide open seeming to stare at her in wounded fear The other was squeezed shut in a sinister leer The left half of the face the half with the open eye appeared to be normal But the right half was the face of a monster drawn and inhuman the thick lips drawn back to reveal snaggle teeth that were also glowing Sarah uttered a strangled little shriek and took a stumblestep backward Then the lights came on and it was just Johnnys apartment again instead of some black limbo Nixon on the wall trying to sell used cars the braided rug Johnnys mother had made on the floor the wine bottles made into candle bases The face stopped glowing and she saw it was a dimestore Halloween mask nothing more Johnnys blue eye was twinkling out of the open eyehole at her He stripped it off and stood smiling amiably at her dressed in faded jeans and a brown sweater Happy Halloween Sarah he said Her heart was still racing He had really frightened her Very funny she said and turned to go She didnt like being scared like that He caught her in the doorway Hey Im sorry Well you ought to be She looked at him coldly  or tried to Her anger was already melting away You just couldnt stay mad at Johnny that was the thing Whether she loved him or not  a thing she was still trying to puzzle out  it was impossible to be unhappy with him for very long or to harbor a feeling of resentment She wondered if anyone had ever succeeded in harboring a grudge against Johnny Smith and the thought was so ridiculous she just had to smile There thats better Man I thought you were going to walk out on me Im not a man He cast his eyes upon her So Ive noticed She was wearing a bulky fur coat  imitation raccoon or something vulgar like that  and his innocent lechery made her smile again In this thing you couldnt tell Oh yeah I can tell he said He put an arm around her and kissed her At first she wasnt going to kiss back but of course she did Im sorry I scared you he said and rubbed her nose companionably with his own before letting her go He held up the mask I thought youd get a kick out of it Im gonna wear it in homeroom Friday Oh Johnny that wont be very good for discipline Ill muddle through somehow he said with a grin And the hell of it was he would She came to school every day wearing big schoolmarmish glasses her hair drawn back into bun so severe it seemed on the verge of a scream She wore her skirts just above the knee in a season when most of the girls wore them just below the edges of their underpants and my legs are better than any of theirs Sarah thought resentfully She maintained alphabetical seating charts which by the law of averages at least should have kept the troublemakers away from each other and she resolutely sent unruly pupils to the assistant principal her reasoning being that he was getting an extra five hundred a year to act as ramrod and she wasnt And still her days were a constant struggle with that freshman teacher demon Discipline More disturbing she had begun to sense that there was a collective unspoken jury  a kind of school consciousness maybe  that went into deliberations over every new teacher and that the verdict being returned on her was not so good Johnny on the face of it appeared to be the antithesis of everything a good teacher should be He ambled from dass to dass in an agreeable sort of daze often showing up tardy because he had stopped to chat with someone between bells He let the kids sit where they wanted so that the same face was never in the same seat from day to day and the class thuds invariably gravitated to the back of the room Sarah would not have been able to learn their names that way until March but Johnny seemed to have them down pat already He was a tall man who had a tendency to slouch and the kids called him Frankenstein Johnny seemed amused rather than outraged by this And yet his classes were mostly quiet and wellbehaved there were few skippers Sarah had a constant problem with kids cutting class and that same jury seemed to be coming back in his favor He was the sort of teacher who in another ten years would have the school yearbook dedicated to him She just wasnt And sometimes wondering why drove her crazy You want a beer before we go Glass of wine Anything No but I hope youre going wellheeled she said taking his arm and deciding not to be mad anymore I always eat at least three hot dogs Especially when its the last county fair of the year They were going to Esty twenty miles north of Cleave Mills a town whose only dubious claim to fame was that it held ABSOLUTELY THE LAST AGRICULTRAL FAIR OF THE YEAR IN NEW ENGLAND The fair would close Friday night on Halloween Considering Fridays payday Im doing good I got eight bucks Oh  my  God Sarah said rolling her eyes I always knew if I kept myself pure Id meet a sugar daddy someday He smiled and nodded Us pimps make biiig money baby Just let me get my coat and were off She looked after him with exasperated affection and the voice that had been surfacing in her mind more and more often  in the shower while she was reading a book or prepping a class or making her supper for one  came up again like one of those thirtysecond publicservice spots on TV Hes a very nice man and all that easy to get along with fun he never made you cry But is that love I mean is that all there is to it Even when you learned to ride your twowheeler you had to fall off a few times and scrape both knees Call it a rite of passage And that was just a little thing Gonna use the bathroom he called to her Uhhuh She smiled a little Johnny was one of those people who invariably mentioned their nature calls God knew why She went over to the window and looked out on Main Street Kids were pulling into the parking lot next to OMikes the local pizzaandbeer hangout She suddenly wished she were back with them one of them with this confusing stuff behind her  or still ahead of her The university was safe It was a kind of nevernever land where everybody even the teachers could be a part of Peter Pans band and never grow up And there would always be a Nixon or an Agnew to play Captain Hook She had met Johnny when they started teaching in September but she had known his face from the Ed courses they had shared She had been pinned to a Delta Tau Delta and none of the judgments that applied to Johnny had applied to Dan He had been almost flawlessly handsome witty in a sharp and restless way that always made her a trifle uncomfortable a heavy drinker a passionate lover Sometimes when he drank he turned mean She rememberd a night in Bangors Brass Rail when that had happened The man in the next booth had taken joking issue with something Dan had been saying about the UMO football team and Dan had asked him if he would like to go home with his head on backward The man had apologized but Dan hadnt wanted an apology he had wanted a fight He began to make personal remarks about the woman with the other man Sarah had put her hand on Dans arm and asked him to stop Dan had shaken her hand off and had looked at her with a queer flat light in his grayish eyes that made any other words she might have spoken dry up in her throat Eventually Dan and the other guy went outside and Dan beat him up Dan had beaten him until the other man who was in his late thirties and getting a belly had screamed Sarah had never heard a man scream before she never wanted to hear it again They had to leave quickly because the bartender saw how it was going and called the police She would have gone home alone that night oh are you sure her mind asked nastily but it was twelve miles back to the campus and the buses had stopped running at six and she was afraid to hitch Dan didnt talk on the way back He had a scratch on one cheek Just one scratch When they got back to Hart Hall her dorm she told him she didnt want to see him anymore Any way you want it babe he said with an indifference that had chilled her  and the second time he called after the Brass Rail incident she had gone out with him Part of her had hated herself for that It had continued all that fall semester of her senior year He had frightened and attracted her at the same time He was her first real lover and even now two days shy of Halloween  he had been her only real lover She and Johnny had not been to bed Dan had been very good He had used her but he had been very good He would not take any precautious and so she had been forced to go to the university infirmary where she talked fumblingly about painful menstruation and got the pill Sexually Dan had dominated her all along She did not have many orgasms with him but his very roughness brought her some and in the weeks before it had ended she bad begun to feel a mature womans greediness for good sex a desire that was bewilderingly intermixed with other feelings dislike for both Dan and herself a feeling that no sex that depended so much on humiliation and domination could really be called good sex and selfcontempt for her own inability to call a halt to a relationship that seemed based on destructive feelings It had ended swiftly early this year He flunked out Where will you be going she asked him timidly sitting on his roomies bed as he threw things into two suitcases She had wanted to ask other more personal questions Will you be near here Will you take a job Take night classes Is there a place for me in your plans That question above all others she had not been able to ask Because she wasnt prepared for any answer The answer he gave to her one neutral question was shocking enough Vietnam I guess What He reached onto a shelf thumbed briefly through the papers there and tossed her a letter It was from the induction center in Bangor an order to report for his physical exam Cant you get out of it No Maybe I dont know He lit a cigarette I dont think I even want to try She had stared at him shocked Im tired of this scene College and get a job and find a little wifey Youve been applying for the little wifey spot I guess And dont think I havent thought it over It wouldnt work You know it wouldnt and so do I We dont fit Sarah She had fled then all her questions answered and she never saw him again She saw his roommate a few times He got three letters from Dan between January and June He was inducted and sent down south somewhere for basic training And that was the last the roommate had heard It was the last Sarah Bracknell heard too At first she thought she was going to be okay All those sad torchy songs the ones you always seem to hear on the car radio after midnight they didnt apply to her Or the cliches about the end of the affair or the crying jags She didnt pick up a guy on the rebound or start doing the bars Most evenings that spring she spent studying quietly in her dorm room It was a relief It wasnt messy It was only after she met Johnny  at a freshman mixer dance last month they were both chaperoning purely by luck of the draw that she realized what a horror her last semester at school had been It was the kind of thing you couldnt see when you were in it it was too much a part of you Two donkeys meet at a hitching rail in a western town One of them is a town donkey with nothing on his back but a saddle The other is a prospectors donkey loaded down with packs camping and cooking gear and four fiftypound sacks of ore His back is bent into a concertina shape from the weight The town donkey says Thats quite a load you got there And the prospector  donkey says What load In retrospect it was the emptiness that horrified her it had been five months of CheyneStokes respiration Eight months if you counted this summer when she took a small apartment on Flagg Street in Veazie and did nothing but apply for teaching jobs and read paperback novels She got up ate breakfast went out to class or to whatever job interviews she had scheduled came home ate took a nap the naps were sometimes four hours long ate again read until eleventhirty or so watched Cavett until she got sleepy went to bed She could not remember thinking during that period Life was routine Sometimes there was a vague sort of ache in her loins an unfulfilled ache she believed the lady novelists sometimes called it and for this she would either take a cold shower or a douche After a while the douches grew painful and this gave her a bitter absent sort of satisfaction During this period she would congratulate herself from time to time on how adult she was being about the whole thing She hardly ever thought about Dan  Dan Who haha Later she realized that for eight months she had thought of nothing or no one else The whole country had gone through a spasm of shudders during those eight months but she had hardly noticed The marches the cops in their crash helmets and gas masks the mounting attacks on the press by Agnew the Kent State shootings thesummer of violence as Macks and radical groups took to the streets  those things might have happened on some TV late show Sarah was totally wrapped up in how wonderfully she had gotten over Dan how well she was adjusting and how relieved she was to find that everything was just fine What load Then she had started at Cleaves Mills High and that had been a personal upheaval being on the other side of the desk after sixteen years as a professional student Meeting Johnny Smith at that mixer and with an absurd name like John Smith could he be completely for real Coming out of herself enough to see the way he was looking at her not lecherously but with a good healthy appreciation for the way she looked in the lightgray knitted dress she had worn He had asked her to go to a movie  Citizen Kane was playing at The Shade  and she said okay They had a good time and she was thinking to herself No fireworks She had enjoyed his kiss goodnight and had thought Hes sure no Errol Flynn He had kept her smiling with his line of patter which was outrageous and she had thought He wants to be Henry Youngman when he grows up Later that evening sitting in the bedroom of her apartment and watching Bette Davis play a bitchy career woman on the late movie some of these thoughts had come back to her and she paused with her teeth sunk into an apple rather shocked at her own unfairness And a voice that had been silent for the best part of a year  not so much the voice of conscience as that of perspective  spoke up abruptly What you mean is he sure isnt Dan Isnt that it No she assured herself not just rather shocked now I dont think about Dan at all anymore That  was a long time ago Diapers the voice replied that was a long time ago Dan left yesterday She suddenly realized she was sitting in an apartment by herself late at night eating an apple and watching a movie on TV that she cared nothing about and doing it all because it was easier than thinking thinking was so boring really when all you had to think about was yourself and your lost love Very shocked now She had burst into tears She had gone out with Johnny the second and third time he asked too and that was also a revelation of exactly what she had become She couldnt very well say that she had another date because it wasnt so She was a smart pretty girl and she had been asked out a lot after the affair with Dan ended but the only dates she had accepted were hamburger dates at the Den with Dans roomie and she realized now her disgust tempered with rueful humor that she had only gone on those completely innocuous dates in order to pump the poor guy about Dan What load Most of her college girl friends had dropped over the horizon after graduation Bettye Hackman was with the Peace Corps in Africa to the utter dismay of her wealthy oldline Bangor parents and sometimes Sarah wondered what the Ugandans must make of Bettye with her white impossibletotan skin and ashblonde hair and cool sorority good looks Deenie Stubbs was at grad school in Houston Rachel Jurgens had married her fella and was currently gestating somewhere in the wilds of western Massachusetts Slightly dazed Sarah had been forced to the conclusion that Johnny Smith was the first new friend she had made in a long long time  and she had been her senior high school classs Miss Popularity She had acepted dates from a couple of other Cleaves teachers just to keep things in perspective One of them was Gene Sedecki the new math man  but obviously a veteran bore The other George Rounds had immediately tried to make her She had slapped his face  and the next day hed had the gall to wink at her as they passed in the hall But Johnny was fun easy to be with And he did attract her sexually  just how strongly she couldnt honestly say at least not yet A week ago after the Friday theyd had off for the October teachers convention in Waterville he had invited her back to his apartment for a homecooked spaghetti dinner While the sauce simmered he had dashed around the corner to get some wine and had come back with two bottles of Apple Zapple Like announcing his bathroom calls it was somehow Johnnys style After the meal they had watched TV and that had turned to necking and God knew what that might have turned into if a couple of his friends instructors from the university hadnt turned up with a faculty position paper on academic freedom They wanted Johnny to look it over and see what he thought He had done so but with noticeably less good will than was usual with him She had noticed that with a warm secret delight and the ache in her own loins  the unfulfilled ache  had also delighted her and that night she hadnt killed it with a douche She turned away from the window and walked over to the sofa where Johnny had left the mask Happy Halloween she snorted and laughed a little What Johnny called out I said if you dont come pretty quick Im going without you Be right out Swell She ran a finger over the JekyllandHyde mask kindly Dr Jekyll the left half ferocious subhuman Hyde the right half Where will we be by Thanksgiving she wondered Or by Christmas The thought sent a funny excited little thrill shooting through her She liked him He was a perfectly ordinary sweet man She looked down at the mask again horrible Hyde growing out of Jekylls face like a lumpy carcinoma It had been treated with fluorescent paint so it would glow in the dark Whats ordinary Nothing nobody Not really If he was so ordinary how could he be planning to wear something like that into his homeroom and still be confident of keeping order And how can the kids call him Frankenstein and still respect and like him Whats ordinary Johnny came out brushing through the beaded curtain that divided the bedroom and bathroom off from the living room If he wants me to go to bed with him tonight l think Im going to say okay And it was a warm thought like coming home What are you grinning about Nothing she said tossing the mask back to the sofa No really Was it something good Johnny she said putting a hand on his chest and standing on tiptoe to kiss him lightly some things will never be told Come on lets go  They paused downstairs in the foyer while he buttoned his denim jacket and she found her eyes drawn again to the STRIKE poster with its clenched fist and flaming background Therell be another student strike this year he said following her eyes The war Thats only going to be part of it this time Vietnam and the fight over ROTC and Kent State have activated more students than ever before I doubt if theres ever been a time when there were so few grunts taking up space at the university What do you mean grunts Kids just studying to make grades with no interest in the system except that it provides them with a tenthousanddollar a year job when they get out A grunt is a student who gives a shit about nothing except his sheep skin Thats over Most of them are awake There are going to be some big changes Is that important to you Even though youre out He drew himself up Madam I am an alumnus Smith class of  Fill the stems to dear old Maine She smiled Come on lets go I want a ride on the whip before they shut it down for the night Very good he said taking her arm I just happen to have your car parked around the corner And eight dollars The evening fairly glitters before us The night was overcast but not rainy mild for late October Overhead a quarter moon was struggling to make it through the cloud cover Johnny slipped an arm around her and she moved closer to him You know I think an awful lot of you Sarah His tone was almost offhand but only almost Her heart slowed a little and then made speed for a dozen beats or so Really I guess this Dan guy he hurt you didnt he I dont know what he did to me she said truthfully The yellow blinker a block behind them now made their shadows appear and disappear on the concrete in front of them Johnny appeared to think this over I wouldnt want to do that he said finally No I know that But Johnny give it time Yeah he said Time Weve got that I guess And that would come back to her awake and even more strongly in her dreams in tones of inexpressible bitterness and loss They went around the corner and Johnny opened the passenger door for her He went around and got in behind the wheel You cold No she said Its a great night for it It is he agreed and pulled away from the curb Her thoughts went back to that ridiculous mask Half Jekyll with Johnnys blue eye visible behind the widenedO eyesocket of the surprised doctor  Say thats some cocktail I invented last night but l dont think theyll be able to move it in the bars  and that side was all right because you could see a bit of Johnny inside It was the Hyde part that had scared her silly because that eye was closed down to a slit It could have been anybody Anybody at all Dan for instance But by the time they reached the Esty fairgrounds where the naked bulbs of the midway twinkled in the darkness and the long spokes of the Ferris wheel neon revolved up and down she had forgotten the mask She was with her guy and they were going to have a good time  They walked up the midway hand in hand not talking much and Sarah found herself reliving the county fairs of her youth She had grown up in South Paris a paper town in western Maine and the big fair had been the one in Fryeburg For Johnny a Pownal boy it probably would have been Topsham But they were all the same really and they hadnt changed much over the years You parked your car in a dirt parking lot and paid your two bucks at the gate and when you were barely inside the fairgrounds you could smell hot dogs frying peppers and onions bacon cotton candy sawdust and sweet aromatic horseshit You heard the heavy chaindriven rumble of the baby roller coaster the one they called The Wild Mouse You heard the popping of in the shooting galleries the tinny blare of the Bingo caller from the PA system strung around the big tent filled with long tables and folding chairs from the local mortuary Rock n roll music vied with the calliope for supremacy You heard the steady cry of the barkers  two shots for two bits win one of these stuffed doggies for your baby heyheyyerhere pitch till you win It didnt change It turned you into a kid again willing and eager to be suckered Here she said stopping him The whip The whip Of course Johnny said comfortingly He passed the woman in the ticket cage a dollar bill and she pushed back two red tickets and two dimes with barely a glance up from her Photoplay What do you mean of course Why are you of coursing me in that tone of voice He shrugged His face was much too innocent It wasnt what you said John Smith It was how you said it The ride had stopped Passengers were getting off and streaming past them mostly teenagers in blue melton CPO shirts or open parkas Johnny led her up the wooden ramp and surrendered their tickets to the whips starter who looked like the most bored sentient creature in the universe Nothing he said as the starter settled them into one of the little round shells and snapped the safety bar into place Its just that these cars are on little circular tracks right Right And the little circular tracks are embedded on a large circular dish that spins around and around right Right Well when this ride is going full steam the little car were sitting in whips around on its little circular track and sometimes develops up to seven g which is only five less than the astronauts get when they lift off from Cape Kennedy And I knew this kid  Johnny was leaning solemnly over her now Oh here comes one of your big lies Sarah said uneasily When this kid was five he fell down the front steps and put a tiny hairline fracture in his spine at the top of his neck Then ten years later  he went on the whip at Topsham Fair and  He shrugged and then patted her hand sympathetically But youll probably be okay Sarah Ohhh I want to get olliff And the whip whirled them away slamming the fair and the midway into a tilted blur of lights and faces and she shrieked and laughed and began to pummel him Hairline fracture she shouted at him Ill give you a hairline fracture when we get off this you liar Do you feel anything giving in your neck yet he inquired sweetly Oh you liar They whirled around faster and faster and as they snapped past the ride starter for the  tenth fifteenth time he leaned over and kissed her and the car whistled around on its track pressing their lips together in something that was hot and exciting and skintight Then the ride was slowing down their car clacked around on its track more reluctantly and finally came to a swaying swinging stop They got out and Sarah squeezed his neck Hairline fracture you ass  she whispered A fat lady in blue slacks and penny loafers was passing them Johnny spoke to her jerking a thumb hack toward Sarah That girl is bothering me maam If you see a policeman would you tell him You young people think youre smart the fat lady said disdainfully She waddled away toward the bingo tent holding her purse more tightly under her arm Sarah was giggling helplessly Youre impossible Ill come to a bad end Johnny agreed My mother always said so They walked up the midway side by side again waiting for the world to stop making unstable motions before their eyes and under their feet Shes pretty religious your mom isnt she Sarah asked Shes as Baptist as you can get Johnny agreed But shes okay She keeps it under control She cant resist passing me a few tracts when Im at home but thats her thing Daddy and I put up with it I used to try to get on her case about it  Id ask her who the heck was in Nod for Cain to go live with if his dad and mom were the first people on earth stuff like that  but I decided it was sort of mean and quit it Two years ago I thought Eugene McCarthy could save the world and at least the Baptists dont have Jesus running for president Your fathers not religious Johnny laughed I dont know about that but hes sure no Baptist After a moments thought he added Dads a carpenter as if that explained it She smiled What would your mother think if she knew you were seeing a lapsed Catholic Ask me to bring you home Johnny said promptly so she could slip you a few tracts She stopped still holding his hand Would you like to bring me to your house she asked looking at him closely Johnnys long pleasant face became serious Yeah he said Id like you to meet them  and vice versa Why Dont you know why he asked her gently and suddenly her throat closed and her head throbbed as if she might cry and she squeezed his hand tightly Oh Johnny I do like you I like you even more than that he said seriously Take me on the Ferris wheel she demanded suddenly smiling No more talk like this until she had a chance to consider it to think where it might be leading I want to go up high where we can see everything Can I kiss you at the top Twice if youre quick He allowed her to lead him to the ticket booth where he surrendered another dollar bill As he paid he told her When I was in high school I know this kid who worked at the fair and he said most of the guys who put these rides together are dead drunk and they leave off all sorts of Co to hell she said merrily nobody lives forever But everybody tries you ever notice that he said following her into one of the swaying gondolas As a matter of fact he got to kiss her several times at the top with the October wind ruffling their hair and the midway spread out below them like a glowing clockface in the dark  After the Ferris wheel they did the carousel even though he told her quite honestly that he felt like a horses ass His legs were so long that he could have stood astride one of the plaster horses She told him maliciously that she had known a girl in high school who had had a weak heart except nobody knew she had a weak heart and she she had gotten on the carousel with her boyfriend and Someday youll be sorry he told her with quiet sincerity A relationship based on lies is no good Sarah She gave him a very moist raspberry After the carousel came the mirror maze a very good mirror maze as a matter of fact it made her think of the one in Bradburys Something Wicked This Way Comes where the littleoldlady schoolteacher almost got lost forever She could see Johnny in another part of it fumbling around waving to her Dozens of Johnnies dozens of Sarahs They bypassed each other flickered around nonEuclidian angles and seemed to disappear She made left turns right turns bumped her nose on panes of clear glass and got giggling helplessly partly in a nervous claustrophobic reaction One of the mirrors turned her into a squat Tolkein dwarf Another created the apotheoeis of teenage gangliness with shins a quarter of a mile long At last they escaped and he got them a couple of fried hot dogs and a Dixie cup filled with greasy french fries that tasted the way french fries hardly ever do once youve gotten past your fifteenth year They passed a kooch joint Three girls stood out front in sequined skirts and bras They were shimmying to an old Jerry Lee Lewis tune while the barker hawked them through a microphone Come on over baby Jerry Lee blared his piano boogying frankly across the sawdustsprinkled arcades Come on over baby baby got the bull by the horns  we aint fakin  whole lotta shakin goin on Club Playboy Johnny marveled and laughed There used to he a place like this down at Harrison Beach The barker used to swear the girls could take the glasses right off your nose with their hands tied behind their backs It sounds like an interesting way to get a social disease Sarah said and Johnny roared with laughter Behind them the barkers amplified voice grew hollow with distance counterpointed by Jerry Lees pumping piano music like some mad dented hot rod that was too tough to die rumbling out of the dead and silent fifties like an omen Come in men come on over dont be shy because these girls sure arent not in the least little bit Its all on the inside  your education isnt complete until youve seen the Club Playboy show Dont you want to go on back and finish your education she asked He smiled I finshed my basic course work on that subject some time ago I guess I can wait a while to get my PhD She glanced at her watch Hey its getting late Johnny And tomorrows a school day Yeah But at least its Friday She sighed thinking of her fifthperiod study hall and her seventhperiod New Fiction class both of them impossibly rowdy They had worked their way back to the main part of the midway The crowd was thinning The TiltAWhirl had shut down for the evening Two workmen with unfiltered cigarettes jutting from the corners of their mouths were covering the Wild Mouse with a tarpaulin The man in the PitchTilUWin was turning off his lights You doing anything Saturday he asked suddenly diffident I know its short notice but I have plans she said Oh And she couldnt bear his crestfallen expression it was really too mean to tease him about that Im doing something with you You are Oh you are Say thats good He grinned at her and she grinned back The voice in her mind which was sometimes as real to her as the voice of another human being suddenly spoke up Youre feeling good again Sarah Feeling happy Isnt it fine Yes it is she said She went up on tiptoe and kissed him quickly She made herself go on before she could chicken out It gets pretty lonely down there in Veazie sometimes you know Maybe I could sort of spend the night with you He looked at her with warm thoughtfulness and with a speculation that made her tingle deep inside Would that be what you want Sarah She nodded Very much what I want All right he said and put an arm around her Are you sure Sarah asked a little shyly Im just afraid youll change your mind I wont Johnny He hugged her tighter against him Then its my lucky night They were passing the Wheel of Fortune as he said it and Sarah would later remember that it was the only booth still open on that side of the midway for thirty yards in either direction The man behind the counter had just finished sweeping the packed dirt inside for any spare dimes that might have fallen from the playing board during the nights action Probably his last chore before closing up she thought Behind him was his large spoked wheel outlined by tiny electric bulbs He must have heard Johnnys remark because he went into his pitch more or less automatically his eyes still searching the dirt floor of his booth for the gleam of silver Heyheyhey if you feel lucky mister spin the Wheel of Fortune turn dimes into dollars Its all in the Wheel try your luck one thin dime sets this Wheel of Fortune in motion Johnny swung back toward the sound of his voice Johnny I feel lucky just like the man said He smiled down at her Unless you mind No go ahead Just dont take too long He looked at her again in that frankly speculative way that made her feel a little weak wondering how it would be with him Her stomach did a slow rollover that made her feel a bit nauseated with sudden sexual longing No not long He looked at the pitchman The midway behind them was almost completely empty now and as the overcast had melted off above them it had turned chilly The three of them were puffing white vapor as they breathed Try your luck young man Yes He had switched all his cash to his front pocket when they arrived at the fair and now he pulled out the remains of his eight dollars It came to a dollar eightyfive The playing board was a strip of yellow plastic with numbers and odds painted on it in squares It looked a bit like a roulette board but Johnny saw immediately that the odds here would have turned a Las Vegas roulette player gray A trip combination paid off at only two to one There were two house numbers zero and double zero He pointed this out to the pitchman who only shrugged You want Vegas go to Vegas What can I say But Johnnys good humor tonight was unshakable Things had gotten off to a poor start with that mask but it had been all upbeat from there In fact it was the best night he could remember in years maybe the best night ever He looked at Sarah Her color was high her eyes sparkling What do you say Sarah She shook her head Its Greek to me What do you do Play a number Or redblack Or oddeven Or a tennumber series They all pay differently He gazed at the pitchman who gazed back blandly At least they should Play black she said It is sort of exciting isnt it Black he said and dropped his odd dime on the black square The pitchman stared at the single dime on his expanse of playboard and sighed Heavy plunger He turned to the Wheel Johnnys hand wandered absently to his forehead and touched it Wait he said abruptly He pushed one of his quarters onto the square reading  That it Sure Johnny said The pitchman gave the Wheel a twist and it spun inside its circle of lights red and black merging Johnny absently rubbed at his forehead The Wheel began to slow and now they could hear the metronomelike ticktock of the small wooden clapper sliding past the pins that divided the numbers It reached   seemed about to stop on  and slipped into the  slot with a final dick and came to rest The lady loses the gentleman wins the pitchman said You won Johnny Seems like it Johnny said as the pitchman added two quarters to his original one Sarah gave a little squeal barely noticing as the pitchman swept the dime away Told you my lucky night Johnny said Twice is luck once is just a fluke the pitchman remarked Heyheyhey Go again Johnny she said All right Just as it is for me Let it ride Yes The pitchman spun the Wheel again and as it slid around Sarah murmured quietly to him Arent all these carnival wheels suppose to be fixed They used to be Now the state inspects them and they just rely on their outrageous odds system The Wheel had slowed to its final unwinding ticktock The pointer passed  and entered Johnnys trip still slowing Come on come on  Sarah cried A couple of teenagers on their way out paused to watch The wooden clapper moving very slowly now passed  and  then came to a stop on  Gentleman wins again The pitchman added six more quarters to Johnnys pile Youre rich Sarah gloated and kissed him on the cheek Youre streaking fella the pitchman agreed enthusiastically Nobody quits a hot stick Heyheyhey Should I go again Johnny asked her Why not Yeah go ahead man one of the teenagers said A button on his jacket bore the face of Jimi Hendrix That guy took me for four bucks tonight I love to see him take a beatin You too then Johnny told Sarah He gave her the odd quarter off his stack of nine After a moments hesitation she laid it down on  Single numbers paid off ten to one on a hit the board announced Youre riding the middle trip right fella Johnny looked down at the eight quarters stacked on the board and then he began to rub his forehead again as if he felt the beginnings of a headache Suddenly he swept the quarters off the board and jingled them in his two cupped hands No Spin for the lady Ill watch this one She looked at him puzzled Johnny He shrugged Just a feeling The pitchman rolled his eyes in a heavengivemestrengthtobearthese fools gesture and set his Wheel going again It spun slowed and stopped On double zero House numbah house numbah the pitchman chanted and Sarahs quarter disappeared into his apron Is that fair Johnny Sarah asked hurt Zero and double zero only pay the house he said Then you were smart to take your money off the board I guess I was You want me to spin this Wheel or go for coffee the pitchman asked Spin it Johnny said and put his quarters down in two stacks of four on the third trip As the Wheel buzzed around in its cage of lights Sarah asked Johnny never taking her eyes from the spin How much can a place like this take in on one night The teenagers had been joined by a quartet of older people two men and two women A man with the build of a construction worker said Anywheres from five to seven hundred dollars The pitchman rolled his eyes again Oh man I wish you was right he said Hey dont give me that poor mouth the man who looked like a construction worker said I used to work this scam twenty years ago Five to seven hundred a night two grand on a Saturday easy And thats running a straight Wheel Johnny kept his eyes on the Wheel which was now spinning slowly enough to read the individual numbers as they flashed past It flashed past  and  through the first trip slowing through the second trip still slowing Too much legs man one of the teenagers said Wait Johnny said in a peculiar tone of voice Sarah glanced at him and his long pleasant face looked oddly strained his blue eyes darker than usual for away distant The pointer stopped on  and came to rest Hot stick hot stick the pitchman chanted resignedly as the little crowd behind Johnny and Sarah uttered a cheer The man who looked like a construction worker clapped Johnny on the back hard enough to make him stagger a bit The pitchman reached into the RoiTan box under the counter and dropped four singles beside Johnnys eight quarters Enough Sarah asked One more Johnny said If I win this guy paid for our fair and your gas If I lose were out half a buck or so Heyheyhey the pitchman chanted He was brightening up now getting his rhythm back Get it down where you want it down Step right up you other folks This aint no spectator sport Round and round shes gonna go and where shes gonna stop aint nobody knows The man who looked like a construction worker and the two teenagers stepped up beside Johnny and Sarah After a moments consultation the teenagers produced half a buck in change between them and dropped it on the middle trip The man who looked like a construction worker who introduced himself as Steve Bernhardt put a dollar on the square marked EVEN What about you buddy the pitchman asked Johnny You gonna play it as it lays Yes Johnny said Oh man one of the teenagers said thats tempting fate I guess Johnny said and Sarah smiled at him Bernhardt gave Johnny a speculative glance and suddenly switched his dollar to his third trip What the hell sighed the teenager who had told Johnny he was tempting fate He switched the fifty cents he and his friend had come up with to the same trip All the eggs in one basket the pitchman chanted That how you want it The players stood silent and affirmative A couple of roustabouts had drifted over to watch one of them with a lady friend there was now quite a respectable little knot of people in front of the Wheel of Fortune concession in the darkening arcade The pitchman gave the Wheel a mighty spin Twelve pairs of eyes watched it revolve Sarah found herself looking at Johnny again thinking how strange his face was in this bold yet somehow furtive lighting She thought of the mask again  Jekyll and Hyde odd and even Her stomach turned over again making her feel a little weak The Wheel slowed began to tick The teenagers began to shout at it urging it onward Little more baby Steve Bernhardt cajoled it Little more honey The Wheel ticked into the third trip and came to a stop on  A cheer went up from the crowd again Johnny you did it you did it I Sarah cried The pitchman whistled through his teeth in disgust and paid off A dollar for the teenagers two for Bernhardt a ten and two ones for Johnny He now had eighteen dollars in front of him on the board Hot stick hot stick heyheyhey One more buddy This Wheels your friend tonight Johnny looked at Sarah Up to you Johnny But she felt suddenly uneasy Go on man the teenager with the Jimi Hendrix button urged I love to see this guy get a beatin Okay Johnny said last time Get it down where you want it down They all looked at Johnny who stood thoughtful for a moment rubbing his forehead His usually goodhumored face was still and serious and composed He was looking at the Wheel in its cage of lights and his fingers worked steadily at the smooth skin over his right eye As is he said finally A little speculative murmur from the crowd Oh man that is really tempting it Hes hot Bernhardt said doubtfully He glanced back at his wife who shrugged to show her complete mystification Ill tag along with you long tall and ugly The teenager with the button glanced at his friend who shrugged and nodded Okay he said turning back to the pitchman Well stick too The Wheel spun Behind them Sarah heard one of the roustabouts bet the other five dollars against the third trip coming up again Her stomach did another forward roll but this time it didnt stop it just went on somersaulting over and over and she became aware that she was getting sick Cold sweat stood out on her face The Wheel began to slow in the first trip and one of the teenagers flapped his hands in disgust But he didnt move away It ticked past    The pitchman looked happy at last Ticktocktick    Its going through Bernhardt said There was awe in his voice The pitchman looked at his Wheel as if he wished he could just reach out and stop it It clicked past   and settled to a stop in the slot marked  There was another shout of triumph from the crowd which had now grown almost to twenty All the people left at the fair were gathered here it seemed Faintly Sarah heard the roustabouts who had lost his bet grumble something about Shitass luck as he paid off Her head thumped Her legs felt suddenly horribly unsteady the muscles trembling and untrustworthy She blinked her eyes rapidly several times and got only a nauseating instant of vertigo for her pains The world seemed to tilt up at a skewed angle as if they were still on the Whip and then slowly settle back down I got a bad hot dog she thought dismally Thats what you get for trying your luck at the county fair Sarah Heyheyhey the pitchman said without much enthusiasm and paid off Two dollars for the teenagers four for Steve Bernhardt and then a bundle for Johnny three tens a five and a one The pitchman was not overjoyed but he was sanguine If the tall skinny man with the goodlooking blonde tried the third trip again the pitchman would almost surely gather back in everything he had paid out It wasnt the skinny mans money until it was off the board And if he walked Well he had cleared a thousand dollars on the Wheel just today he could afford to pay out a little tonight The word would get around that Sol Drummores Wheel had been hit and tomorrow play would be heavier than ever A winner was a good ad Lay em down where you want em down he chanted Seyeral of the others had moved up to the board and were putting down dimes and quarters But the pitchman looked only at his money player What do you say fella Want to shoot the moon Johnny looked down at Sarah What do you  hey are you all right Youre white as a ghost My stomach she said managing a smile I think it was my hot dog Can we go home Sure You bet He was gathering the wad of crinkled bills up from the board when his eyes happened on the Wheel again The warm concern for her that had been in them faded out They seemed to darken again become speculative in a cold way Hes looking at that wheel the way a little boy would look at his own private ant colony Sarah thought Just a minute he said All right Sarah answered But she felt lightheaded now as well as sick to her stomach And there were rumblings in her lower belly that she didnt like Not the backdoor trots Lord Please She thought He cant be content until hes lost it all back And then with strange certainty But hes not going to lose What do you say buddy the pitchman asked On or off in or out Shit or git one of the roustabouts said and there was nervous laughter Sarahs head swam Johnny suddenly shoved bills and quarters up to the corner of the board What are you doing the pitchman asked genuinely shocked The whole wad on  Johnny said Sarah wanted to moan and bit it back The crowd murmured Dont push it Steve Bernhardt said in Johnnys ear Johnny didnt answer He was staring at the Wheel with something like indifference His eyes seemed almost violet There was a sudden jingling sound that Sarah at first thought must be in her own ears Then she saw that the others who had put money down were sweeping it back off the board again leaving Johnny to make his play alone No She found herself wanting to shout Not like that not alone it isnt  She bit down on her lips She was afraid that she might throw up if she opened her mouth Her stomach was very bad now Johnnys pile of winnings sat alone under the naked lights Fiftyfour dollars and the singlenumber payoff was ten for one The pitchman wet his lips Mister the state says Im not supposed to take any single number bets over two dollars Come on Bernhardt growled You arent supposed to take trip bets over ten and you just let the guy bet eighteen What is it your balls starting to sweat No its just   Come on Johnny said abruptly One way or the other My girls sick The pitchman sized up the crowd The crowd looked back at him with hostile eyes It was bad They didnt understand that the guy was just throwing his money away and he was trying to restrain him Fuck it The crowd wasnt going to like it either way Let the guy do his headstand and lose his money so he could shut down for the night Well he said as long as none of youse is state inspectors  He turned to his Wheel Round and round shes gonna go and where shes gonna stop aint nobody knows He spun sending the numbers into an immediate blur For a time that seemed much longer than it actually could have been there was no sound but the whirring of the Wheel of Fortune the night wind rippling a swatch of canvas somewhere and the sick thump in Sarahs own head In her mind she begged Johnny to put his arm around her but he only stood quietly with his hands on the playing board and his eyes on the Wheel which seemed determined to spin forever At last it slowed enough for her to be able to read the numbers and she saw  the  and  painted bright red on a black background Up and down up and down The Wheels smooth whirr broke into a steady tickatickaticka that was very loud in the stillness Now the numbers marched past the pointer with slowing deliberation One of the roustabouts called out in wonder By the Jesus its gonna be close anyway Johnny stood calmly watching the Wheel and now it seemed to her although it might have been the sickness which was now rolling through her belly in gripping peristaltic waves that his eyes were almost black Jekyll and Hyde she thought and was suddenly senselessly afraid of him Tickatickaticka The Wheel clicked into second trip passed  and  clicked over  and after an instants hesitation  as well With a final tick the pointer dropped into the  slot The crowd held its breath The Wheel revolved slowly bringing the pointer up against the small pin between  and  For a quarter of a second it seemed that the pin could not hold the pointer in the  slot that the last of its dying velocity would carry it over to  Then the Wheel rebounded its force spent and came to rest For a moment there was no sound from the crowd No sound at all Then one of the teenagers soft and awed Hey man you just won five hundred and forty dollars Steve Bernhardt I never seen a run like that Never Then the crowd cheered Johnny was slapped on the back pummeled People brushed by Sarah to get at him to touch him and for the moment they were separated she felt miserable raw panic Strengthless she was butted this way and that her stomach rolling crazily A dozen afterimages of the Wheel whirled blackly before her eyes A moment later Johnny was with her and she saw with weak gladness that it really was Johnny and not the composed mannequinlike figure that had watched the Wheel on its last spin He looked confused and concerned about her Baby Im sorry he said and she loved him for that Im okay she answered not knowing if she was or not The pitchman cleared his throat The Wheels shut down he said The Wheels shut down An accepting illtempered rumble from the crowd The pitchman looked at Johnny Ill have to give you a check young gentleman I dont keep that much cash in the booth Sure anything Johnny said Just make it quick The lady here really is sick Sure a check Steve Bernhardt said with infinite contempt Hell give you a check thatll bounce as high as the WGAN Tall Tower and hell be down in Florida for the winter My dear sir the pitchman began I assure you Oh go assure your mother maybe shell believe you Bernhardt said He suddenly reached over the playing board and groped beneath the counter Hey The pitchman yelped This is robbery The crowd did not appear impressed with his claim Please Sarah muttered Her head was whirling I dont care about the money Johnny said suddenly Let us by please The ladys sick Oh man the teenager with the Jimi Hendrix button said but he and his buddy drew reluctantly aside No Johnny Sarah said although she was only holding back from vomiting by an act of will now Get your money Five hundred dollars was Johnnys salary for three weeks Pay off you cheap tinhorn Bernhardt roared He brought up the RoiTan cigar box from under the counter pushed it aside without even looking inside it groped again and this time came up with a steel lockbox painted industrial green He slammed it down on the playboard If there aint five hundred and forty bucks in there Ill eat my own shirt in front of all these people He dropped a hard heavy hand on Johnnys shoulder You just wait a minute sonny Youre gonna have your payday or my names not Steve Bernhardt Really sir I dont have that much You pay Steve Bernhardt said leaning over him or Ill see you shut down I mean that Im sincere about it The pitchman sighed and fished inside his shirt He produced a key on a finelink chain The crowd sighed Sarah could stay no longer Her stomach felt bloated and suddenly as still as death Everything was going to come up everything and at expresstrain speed She stumbled away from Johnnys side and battered through the crowd Honey you all right a womans voice asked her and Sarah shook her head blindly Sarah Johnny called You just cant hide  from Jekyll and Hyde she thought incoherently The fluorescent mask seemed to hang sickly before her eyes in the midway dark as she hurried past the merrygoround She struck a light pole with her shoulder staggered grabbed it and threw up It seemed to come all the way from her heels convulsing her stomach like a sick slick fist She let herself go with it as much as she could Smells like cotton candy she thought and with a groan she did it again then again Spots danced in front of her eyes The last heave had brought up little more than mucus and air Oh my she said weakly and clung to the light pole to keep from falling over Somewhere behind her Johnny was calling her name but she couldnt answer just yet didnt want to Her stomach was settling back down a little and for just a moment she wanted to stand here in the dark and congratulate herself on being alive on having survived her night at the fair Sarah Sarah She spat twice to clear her mouth a little Over here Johnny He came around the carousel with its plaster horses frozen in midleap She saw he was absently clutching a thick wad of greenbacks in one hand Are you all right No but better I threw up Oh Oh Jesus Lets go home He took her arm gently You got your money He glanced down at the wad of bills and then tucked it absently into his pants pocket Yeah Some of it or all of it I dont know That burly guy counted it out Sarah took a handkerchief from her purse and began rubbing her mouth with it Drink of water she thought Id sell my soul for a drink of water You ought to care she said Its a lot of money Found money brings bad luck he said darkly One of my mothers sayings She has a million of em And shes death on gambling Dyedinthewool Baptist Sarah said and then shuddered convulsively You okay he asked concerned The chills she said When we get in the car I want the heater on full blast and oh Lord Im going to do it again She turned away from him and retched up spittle with a groaning sound She staggered He held her gently but firmly Can you get back to the car Yes Im all right now But her head ached and her mouth tasted foul and the muscles of her back and belly all felt sprung out of joint strained and achey They walked slowly down the midway together scuffing through the sawdust passing tents that had been closed up and snugged down for the night A shadow glided up behind them and Johnny glanced around sharply perhaps aware of how much money he had in his pocket It was one of the teenagers  about fifteen years old He smiled shyly at them I hope you feel better he said to Sarah Its those hot dogs I bet You can get a bad one pretty easy Ag dont talk about it Sarah said You need a hand getting her to the car he asked Johnny No thanks Were fine Okay I gotta cut out anyway But he paused a moment longer his shy smile widening into a grin I love to see that guy take a beatin He trotted off into the dark Sarahs small white station wagon was the only car left in the dark parking lot it crouched under a sodium light like a forlorn forgotten pup Johnny opened the passenger door for Sarah and she folded herself carefully in He slipped in behind the wheel and started it up Itll take a few minutes for the heater he said Never mind Im hot now He looked at her and saw the sweat breaking on her face Maybe we ought to trundle you up to the emergency room at Eastern Maine Medical he said If its salmonella it could be serious No Im okay I just want to go home and go to sleep Im going to get up just long enough tomorrow morning to call in sick at school and then go back to sleep again Dont even bother to get up that long Ill call you in Sarah She looked at him gratefully Would you Sure They were headed back to the main highway now Im sorry I cant come back to your place with you Sarah said Really and truly Not your fault Sure it is I ate the bad hot dog Unlucky Sarah I love you Sarah Johnny said So it was out it couldnt be called back it hung between them in the moving car waiting for someone to do something about it She did what she could Thank you Johnny They drove on in a comfortable silence It was nearly midnight when Johnny turned the wagon into her driveway Sarah was dozing Hey he said cutting the motor and shaking her gently Were here Oh  okay She sat up and drew her coat more tightly about her How do you feel Better My stomachs sore and my back hurts but better Johnny you take the car back to Cleaves with you No I better not he said Someone would see it parked in front of the apartment house all night That kind of talk we dont need But I was going to come back with you Johnny smiled And that would have made it worth the risk even if we had to walk three blocks Besides I want you to have the car in case you change your mind about the emergency room I wont You might Can I come in and call a cab You sure can They went in and Sarah turned on the lights before being attacked by a fresh bout of the shivers The phones in the living room Im going to lie down and cover up with a quilt The living room was small and functional saved from a barracks flavor only by the splashy curtains  flowers in a psychedelic pattern and color  and a series of posters along one wall Dylan at Forest Hills Baez at Carnegie Hall Jefferson Airplane at Berkeley the Byrds in Cleveland Sarah lay down on the couch and pulled a quilt up to her chin Johnny looked at her with real concern Her face was paperwhite except for the dark circles under her eyes She looked about as sick as a person can get Maybe I ought to spend the night here he said Just in case something happens like Like a hairline fracture at the top of my spine She looked at him with rueful humor Well you know Whatever The ominous rumbling in her nether regions decided her She had fully intended to finish this night by sleeping with John Smith It wasnt going to work out that way But that didnt mean she had to end the evening with him in attendance while she threw up dashed for the wc and chugged most of a bottle of PeptoBismol Ill be okay she said It was just a bad carnival hot dog Johnny You could have just as easily gotten it yourself Give me a call during your free period tomorrow You sure Yes I am Okay kid He picked up the phone with no further argument and called his cab She closed her eyes lulled and comforted by the sound of his voice One of the things she liked most about him was that he would always really try to do the right thing the best thing with no selfserving bullshit That was good She was too tired and feeling too low to play little social games The deeds done he said hanging up Theyll have a guy over in five minutes At least youve got cab fare she said smiling And I plan to tip handsomely he replied doing a passable W C Fields He came over to the couch sat beside her held her hand Johnny how did you do it Hmmm The Wheel How could you do that It was a streak thats all he said looking a little uncomfortable Everybody has a streak once in a while Like at the race track or playing blackjack or just matching dimes No she said Huh I dont think everybody does have a streak once in a while It was almost uncanny It  scared me a little Did it Yes Johnny sighed Once in a while I get feelings thats all For as long as I can remember since I was just a little kid And Ive always been good at finding things people have lost Like that little Lisa Schumann at school You know the girl I mean Little sad mousy Lisa She smiled I know her Shes wandering in clouds of perplexity through my business grammar course She lost her class ring Johnny said and came to me in tears about it I asked her if shed checked the back corners of the top shelf in her locker Just a guess But it was there And youve always been able to do that He laughed and shook his head Hardly ever The smile slipped a little But it was strong tonight Sarah I had that Wheel  He closed his fists softly and looked at them now frowning I had it right here And it had the strangest goddam associations for me Like what Rubber he said slowly Burning rubber And cold And ice Black ice Those things were in the back of my mind God knows why And a bad feeling Like to beware She looked at him closely saying nothing and his face slowly cleared But its gone now whatever it was Nothing probably It was five hundred dollars worth of good luck anyway she said Johnny laughed and nodded He didnt talk anymore and she drowsed glad to have him there She came back to wakefulness when headlights from outside splashed across the wall His cab Ill call he said and kissed her face gently You sure you dont want me to hang around Suddenly she did but she shook her head Call me she said Period three he promised He went to the door Johnny He turned back I love you Johnny she said and his face lit up like a lamp He blew a kiss Feel better he said and well talk She nodded but it was fourandahalf years before she talked to Johnny Smith again  Do you mind if I sit up front Johnny asked the cab driver Nope Just dont bump your knee on the meter Its delicate Johnny slid his long legs under the meter with some effort and slammed the door The cabbie a middleaged man with a bald head and a paunch dropped his flag and the cab cruised up Flagg Street Where to Cleaves Mills Johnny said Main Street Ill show you where I got to ask you for fareandahalf the cabbie said I dont like to but I got to come back empty from there Johnnys hand closed absently over the lump of bills in his pants pocket He tried to remember if he had ever had so much money on him at one time before Once He had bought a twoyearold Chevy for twelve hundred dollars On a whim he had asked for cash at the savings bank just to see what all that cash looked like It hadnt been all that wonderful but the surprise on the car dealers face when Johnny pumped twelve one hundred dollar bills into his hand had been wonderful to behold But this lump of money didnt make him feel good at all just vaguely uncomfortable and his mothers axiom recurred to him Found money brings bad luck Fareandahalfs okay he told the cabbie Just as longs we understand each other the cabbie said more expansively I got over so quick on account of I had a call at the Riverside and nobody there would own up when I got over there That so Johnny asked without much interest Dark houses flashed by outside He had won five hundred dollars and nothing remotely like it had ever happened to him before That phantom smell of rubber burning  the sense of partially reliving something that had happened to him when he was very small  and that feeling of bad luck coming to balance off the good was still with him Yeah these drunks call and then they change their minds the cabbie said Damn drunks I hate em They call and decide what the hell theyll have a few more beers Or they drink up the fare while theyre waitin and when I come in and yell Who wants the cab they dont want to own up Yeah Johnny said On their left the Penobscot River flowed by dark and oily Then Sarah getting sick and saying she loved him on top of everything else Probably just caught her in a weak moment but God If she had meant it I He had been gone on her almost since the first date That was the luck of the evening not beating that Wheel But it was the Wheel his mind kept coming back to worrying at it In the dark he could still see it revolving and in his ears he could hear the slowing tickatickaticka of the marker bumping over the pins like something heard in an uneasy dream Found money brings bad luck The cabbie turned off onto Route  now welllaunched into his own monologue So I says Blow it outcha youknowwhere I mean the kid is a smartaleck right I dont have to take a load of horseshit like that from anyone including my own boy I been drivin this cab twentysix years I been held up six times I been in fenderbenders without number although I never had a major crash for which I thank Mary Mother of Jesus and Saint Christopher and God the Father Almighty know what I mean And every week no matter how thin that week was I put five bucks away for his college Ever since he was nothin but a pip squeak suckin a bottle And what for So he can come home one fine day and tell me the president of the United States is a pig Hot damn The kid probably thinks Im a pig although he knows if he ever said it Id rearrange his teeth for him So thats todays young generation for you So I says Blow it outchayouknow where Yeah Johnny said Now woods were floating by Carsons Bog was on the left They were seven miles from Cleaves Mills give or take The meter kicked over another dime One thin dime one tenth of a dollar Heyheyhey Whats your game might I ask the cabbie said I teach high school in Cleaves Oh yeah So you know what I mean What the hells wrong with these kids anyway Well they ate a bad hot dog called Vietnam and it gave them ptomaine A guy named Lyndon Johnson sold it to them So they went to this other guy see and they said Jesus mister Im sick as hell And this other guy his name was Nixon he said I know how to fix that Have a few more hot dogs And thats whats wrong with the youth of America I dont know Johnny said You plan all your life and you do what you can the cabbie said and now there was honest bewilderment in his voice a bewilderment which would not last much longer because the cabbie was embarked upon the last minute of his life And Johnny who didnt know that felt a real pity for the man a sympathy for his inability to understand Come on over baby whole lotta shakin goin on You never want nothing but the best and the kid comes home with hair down to his asshole and says the president of the United States is a pig A pig Sheeyit I dont Look out Johnny yelled The cabbie had halfturned to face him his pudgy American Legionnaires face earnest and angry and miserable in the dashlights and in the sudden glow of oncoming headlights Now he snapped forward again but too late Jeeesus  There were two cars one on each side of the white line They had been dragging side by side coming up over the hill a Mustang and a Dodge Charger Johnny could hear the revvedup whine of their engines The Charger was boring straight down at them It never tried to get out of the way and the cabbie froze at the wheel Jeeeeee Johnny was barely aware of the Mustang flashing by on their left Then the cab and the Charger met headon and Johnny felt himself getting lifted up and out There was no pain although he was marginally aware that his thighs had connected with the taximeter hard enough to rip it out of its frame There was the sound of smashing glass A huge gout of flame stroked its way up into the night Johnnys head collided with the cabs windshield and knocked it out Reality began to go down a hole Pain faint and far away in his shoulders and arms as the rest of him followed his head through the jagged windshield He was flying Flying into the October night Dim flashing thoughs Am I dying Is this going to kill me Interior voice answering Yes this is probably it Flying October stars flung across the night Racketing boom of exploding gasoline An orange glow Then darkness His trip through the void ended with a hard thump and a splash Cold wetness as he went into Carsons Bog twentyfive feet from where the Charger and the cab welded together pushed a pyre of flame into the night sky Darkness Fading Until all that was left seemed to be a giant redandblack wheel revolving in such emptiness as there may be between the stars try your luck first time fluky second time lucky heyheyhey The wheel revolved up and down red and black the marker ticking past the pins and he strained to see if it was going to come up double zero house number house spin everybody loses but the house He strained to see but the wheel was gone There was only blackness and that universal emptiness negatory good buddy el zilcho Cold limbo Johnny Smith stayed there a long long time CHAPTER THREE At some time a little past two AM on the morning of October   the telephone began to ring in the downstairs hall of a small house about a hundred and fifty miles south of Cleaves Mills Herb Smith sat up in bed disoriented dragged halfway across the threshold of sleep and left in its doorway groggy and disoriented Veras voice beside him muffled by the pillow Phone Yeah he said and swung out of bed He was a big broadshouldered man in his late forties losing his hair now dressed in blue pajama bottoms He went out into the upstairs hall and turned on the light Down below the phone shrilled away He went down to what Vera liked to call the phone nook It consisted of the phone and a strange little desktable that she had gotten with Green Stamps about three years ago Herb had refused from the first to slide his two hundred and forty pound bulk into it When he talked on the phone he stood up The drawer of the desktable was full of Upper Rooms Readers Digests and Fate magazines Herb reached for the phone then let it ring again A phone call in the middle of the night usually meant one of three things an old friend had gotten totally shitfaced and had decided youd be glad to hear from him even at two in the morning a wrong number bad news Hoping for the middle choice Herb lifted up the phone Hello A crisp male voice said Is this the Herbert Smith residence Yes To whom am I speaking please Im Herb Smith What Will you hold for a moment Yes but who  Too late There was a faint clunk in his ear as if the party on the other end had dropped one of his shoes He had been put on hold Of the many things he disliked about the telephone  bad connections kid pranksters who wanted to know if you had Prince Albert in a can operators who sounded like computers and smoothies who wanted you to buy magazine subscriptions  the thing he disliked the most was being on hold It was one of those insidious things that had crept into modern life almost unnoticed over the last ten years or so Once upon a time the fellow on the other end would simply have said Hold the phone willya and set it down At least in those days you were able to hear faraway conversations a barking dog a radio a crying baby Being on hold was a totally different proposition The line was darkly smoothly blank You were nowhere Why didnt they just say Will you hold on while I bury you alive for a little while He realized he was just a tiny bit scared Herbert He turned round the phone to his ear Vera was at the top of the stairs in her faded brown bathrobe hair up in curlers some sort of cream hardened to a castlike consistency on her cheeks and forehead Who is it I dont know yet Theyve got me on hold On hold At quarter past two in the morning Yes Its not Johnny is it Nothings happened to Johnny I dont know he said struggling to keep his voice from rising Somebody calls you at two in the morning puts you on hold you count your relatives and inventory their condition You make lists of old aunts You tot up the ailments of grandparents if you still have them You wonder if the ticker of one of your friends just stopped ticking And you try not to think that you have one son you love very much or about how these calls always seem to come at two in the morning or how all of a sudden your calves are getting stiff and heavy with tension Vera had closed her eyes and had folded her hands in the middle of her thin bosom Herb tried to control his irritation Restrained himself from saying Vera the Bible makes the strong suggestion that you go and do that in your closet That would earn him Vera Smiths Sweet Smile for Unbelieving and Hellbound Husbands At two oclock in the morning and on hold to boot he didnt think he could take that particular smile The phone clunked again and a different male voice an older one said Hello Mr Smith Yes who is this Im sorry to have kept you waiting sir Sergeant Meggs of the state police Orono branch Is it my boy Something about my boy Unaware he sagged onto the seat of the phone nook He felt weak all over Sergeant Meggs said Do you have a son named John Smith no middle initial Is he all right Is he okay Footsteps on the stairs Vera stood beside him For a moment she looked calm and then she clawed for the phone like a tigress What is it Whats happened to my Johnny Herb yanked the handset away from her splintering one of her fingernails Staring at her hard he said I am handling this She stood looking at him her mild faded blue eyes wide above the hand clapped to her mouth Mr Smith are you there Words that seemed coated with novocaine fell from Herbs mouth I have a son named John Smith no middle initial yes He lives in Cleaves Mills Hes a teacher at the high school there Hes been in a car accident Mr Smith His condition is extremely grave Im very sorry to have to give you this news The voice of Meggs was cadenced formal Oh my God Herb said His thoughts were whirling Once in the army a great mean blondhaired Southern boy named Childress had beaten the crap out of him behind an Atlanta bar Herb had felt like this then unmanned all his thoughts knocked into a useless smeary sprawl Oh my God he said again Hes dead Vera asked Hes dead Johnnys dead He covered the mouthpiece No he said Not dead Not dead Not dead she cried and fell on her knees in the phone nook with an audible thud  God we most heartily thank Thee and ask that You show Thy tender care and loving mercy to our son and shelter him with Your loving hand we ask it in the name of Thy only begotten Son Jesus and Vera shut up For a moment all three of them were silent as if considering the world and its notsoamusing ways Herb his bulk squashed into the phone nook bench with his knees crushed up against the underside of the desk and a bouquet of plastic flowers in his face Vera with her knees planted on the hallway furnace grille the unseen Sergeant Meggs was in a strange auditory way witnessing this black comedy Mr Smith YesI I apologize for the ruckus Quite understandable Meggs said My boy Johnny was he driving his Volkswagen Deathtraps deathtraps those little beetles are deathtraps Vera babbled Tears streamed down her face sliding over the smooth hard surface of the nightpack like rain on chrome He was in a Bangor  Orono Yellow Cab Meggs said Ill give you the situation as I understand it now There were three vehicles involved two of them driven by kids from Cleaves Mills They were dragging They came up over whats known as Carsons Hill on Route  headed east Your son was in the cab headed west toward Cleaves The cab and the car on the wrong side of the road collided headon The cab driver was killed and so was the boy driving the other car Your son and a passenger in that other car are at Eastern Maine Med I understand both of them are listed as critical Critical Herb said Critical Critical  Vera moaned Oh Christ we sound like one of those weird off Broadway shows Herb thought He felt embarrassed for Vera and for Sergeant Meggs who must surely be hearing Vera like some nutty Greek chorus in the background He wondered how many conversations like this Sergeant Meggs had held in the course of his job He decided he must have had a good many Possibly he had already called the cab drivers wife and the dead boys mother to pass the news How had they reacted And what did it matter Wasnt it Veras right to weep for her son And why did a person have to think such crazy things at a time like this Eastern Maine Herb said He jotted it on a pad The drawing on top of the pad showed a smiling telephone handset The phone cord spelled out the words PHONE PAL How is he hurt I beg your pardon Mr Smith Where did he get it Head Belly What Is he burned Vera shrieked Vera can you please shut UP Youd have to call the hospital for that information Meggs said carefully Im a couple of hours from having a complete report All right All right Mr Smith Im sorry to have to call you in the middle of the night with such bad news  Its bad all right he said Ive got to call the hospital Sergeant Meggs Goodbye Good night Mr Smith Herb hung up and stared stupidly at the phone Just like that it happens he thought How bout that Johnny Vera uttered another shriek and he saw with some alarm that she had grabbed her hair rollers and all and was pulling it Its a judgment A judgment on the way we live on sin on something Herb get down on your knees with me Vera I have to call the hospital I dont want to do it on my knees Well pray for him promise to do better if youd only come to church more often with me I know may be its your cigars drinking beer with those men after work  cursing taking the name of the Lord God in vain a judgment its a judgment He put his hands on her face to stop its wild uneasy whipping back and forth The feel of the night cream was unpleasant but he didnt take his hands away He felt pity for her For the last ten years his wife had been walking somewhere in a gray area between devotion to her Baptist faith and what he considered to be a mild religious mania Five years after Johnny was born the doctor had found a number of benign tumors in her uterus and vaginal canal Their removal had made it impossible for her to have another baby Five years later more tumors had necessitated a radical hysterectomy That was when it had really begun for her a deep religious feeling strangely coupled with other beliefs She avidly read pamphlets on Atlantis spaceships from heaven races of pure Christians who might live in the bowels of the earth She read Fate magazine almost as frequently as the Bible often using one to illuminate the other Vera he said Well do better she whispered her eyes pleading with him Well do better and hell live Youll see Youll Vera She fell silent looking at him Lets call the hospital and see just how bad it really is he said gently AAll right Yes Can you sit on the stairs there and keep perfectly quiet I want to pray she said childishly You cant stop me I dont want to As long as you pray to yourself Yes To myself All right Herb She went to the stairs and sat down and pulled her robe primly around her She folded her hands and her lips began to move Herb called the hospital Two hours later they were headed north on the nearly deserted Maine Turnpike Herb was behind the wheel of their  Ford station wagon Vera sat bolt upright in the passenger seat Her Bible was on her lap The telephone woke Sarah at quarter of nine She went to answer it with half her mind still asleep in bed Her back hurt from the vomiting she had done the night before and the muscles in her stomach felt strained but otherwise she felt much better She picked up the phone sure it would be Johnny Hello Hi Sarah It wasnt Johnny It was Anne Strafford from school Anne was a year older than Sarah and in her second year at Cleaves She taught Spanish She was a bubbly effervescent girl and Sarah liked her very much But this morning she sounded subdued How are you Annie Its only temporary Probably Johnny told you Carnival hot dogs I guess Oh my God you dont know You dont  The words were swallowed in odd choked sounds Sarah listened to them frowning Her initial puzzlement turned to deadly disquiet as she realized Anne was crying Anne Whats wrong Its not Johnny is it Not There was an accident Anne said She was now sobbing openly He was in a cab There was a headon collision The driver of the other car was Brad Freneau I had him in Spanish II he died his girl friend died this morning Mary Thibault she was in one of Johnnys classes I heard its horrible just horr Johnny Sarah screamed into the phone She was sick to her stomach again Her hands and feet were suddenly as cold as four gravestones What about Johnny Hes in critical condition Sarah Dave Pelsen called the hospital this morning Hes not expected  well its very bad The world was going gray Anne was still talking but her voice was far and wee as ee cummings had said about the balloon man Flocked images tumbling over and over one another none making sense The carny wheel The mirror maze Johnnys eyes strangely violet almost black His dear homely face in the harsh county fair lighting naked bulbs strung on electric wire Not Johnny she said far and wee far and wee Youre mistaken He was fine when he left here And Annes voice coming back like a fast serve her voice so shocked and unbelieving so affronted that such a thing should have happened to someone her own age someone young and vital They told Dave hed never wake up even if he survived the operation They have to operate because his head his head was Was she going to say crushed That Johnnys head had been crushed Sarah fainted then possiblyto avoid that final irrevocable word that final horror The phone spilled out of her fingers and she sat down hard in a gray world and then slipped over and the phone swung back and forth in a decreasing arc Anne Straffords voice coming out of it Sarah Sarah  Sarah  When Sarah got to Eastern Maine Medical it was quarter past twelve The nurse at the reception desk looked at her white strained face estimated her capacity for further truth and told her that John Smith was still in OR She added that Johnnys mother and father were in the waiting room Thank you Sarah said She turned right instead of left wound up in a medical closet and had to backtrack The waiting room was done in bright solid colors that gashed her eyes A few people sat around looking at tattered magazines or empty space A grayhaired woman came in from the elevators gave her visitors pass to a friend and Sat down The friend clicked away on high heels The rest of them went on sitting waiting their own chance to visit a father who had had gallstones removed  mother who had discovered a small lump under one of her breasts a bare three days ago a friend who had been struck in the chest with an invisible sledgehammer while jogging The faces of the waiters were care fully madeup with composure Worry was swept under the face like dirt under a rug Sarah felt the unreality hovering again Somewhere a soft bell was ringing Crepesoled shoes squeaked He had been fine when he left her place Impossible to think he was in one of these brick towers engaged in dying She knew Mr and Mrs Smith at once She groped for their first names and could not immediately find them They were sitting together near the back of the room and unlike the others here they hadnt yet had time to come to terms with what had happened in their lives Johnnys mom sat with her coat on the chair behind her and her Bible clutched in her hands Her lips moved as she read and Sarah remembered Johnny saying she was very religious  maybe too religious somewhere in that great middle ground between holy rolling and snakehandling she remembered him saying Mr Smith Herb it came to her his name is Herb  had one of the magazines on his knees but he wasnt looking at it He was looking out the window where New England fall burned its way toward November and winter beyond She went over to them Mr and Mrs Smith They looked up at her their faces tensed for the dreaded blow Mrs Smiths hands tightened on her Bible which was open to the Book of Job until her knuckles were white The young woman before them was not in nurses or doctors whites but that made no difference to them at this point They were waiting for the final blow Yes were the Smiths Herb said quietly Im Sarah Bracknell Johnny and I are good friends Going together I suppose youd say May I sit down Johnnys girl friend Mrs Smith asked in a sharp almost accusing tone A few of the others looked around briefly and then back at their own tattered magazines Yes she said Johnnys girl He never wrote that he had a lady friend Mrs Smith said in that same sharp tone No he never did at all Hush Mother Herb said Sit down Miss   Bracknell wasnt it Sarah she said gratefully and took a chair I No he never did Mrs Smith said sharply My boy loved God but just lately he maybe fell away just a bit The judgment of the Lord God is sudden you know Thats what makes backsliding so dangerous You know not the day nor the hour  Hush Herb said People were looking around again He fixed his wife with a stern glance She looked back defiantly for a moment but his gaze didnt waver Vera dropped her eyes She had closed the Bible but her fingers fiddled restlessly along the pages as if longing to get back to the colossal demolition derby of Jobs life enough bad luck to put her own and her sons in some sort of bitter perspective I was with him last night Sarah said and that made the woman look up again accusingly At that moment Sarah remembered the biblical connotation of being with somebody and felt herself beginning to blush It was as if the woman could read her thoughts We went to the county fair Places of sin and evil Vera Smith said clearly Ill tell you one last time to hush Vera Herb said grimly and clamped one of his hands over one of his wifes I mean it now This seems like a nice girl here and I wont have you digging at her Understand Sinful places Vera repeated stubbornly Will you hush Let me go I want to read my Bible He let her go Sarah felt confused embarrassment Vera opened her Bible and began to read again lips moving Vera is very upset Herb said Were both upset You are too from the look of you Yes Did you and Johnny have a good time last night he asked At your fair Yes she said the lie and truth of that simple word all mixed up in her mind Yes we did until well I ate a bad hot dog or something We had my car and Johnny drove me home to my place in Veazie I was pretty sick to my stomach He called a cab He said hed call me in sick at school today And thats the last time I saw him The tears started to come then and she didnt want to cry in front of them particularly not in front of Vera Smith but there was no way to stop it She fumbled a Kleenex out of her purse and held it to her face There now Herb said and put an arm around her There now She cried and it seemed to her in some unclear way that he felt better for having someone to comfort his wife had found her own dark brand of comfort in Jobs story and it didnt include him A few people turned around to gawk through the prisms of her tears they seemed like a crowd She had a bitter knowledge of what they were thinking Better her than me better all three of them than me or mine guy must be dying guy must have gotten his head crushed for her to cry like that Only a matter of time before some doctor comes down and takes them into a private room to tell them that Somehow she choked off the tears and got hold of herself Mrs Smith sat bolt upright as if startled out of a nightmare noticing neither Sarahs tears nor her husbands effort to comfort her She read her Bible Please Sarah said How bad is it Can we hope Before Herb could answer Vera spoke up Her voice was a dry bolt of certified doom Theres hope in God Missy Sarah saw the apprehensive flicker in Herbs eyes and thought He thinks its driven her crazy And maybe it has  A long afternoon stretching into evening Sometime after two PM when the schools began to let out a number of Johnnys students began to come in wearing fatigue coats and strange hats and washedout jeans Sarah didnt see many of the kids she thought of as the buttondown crowd  upwardbound collegeoriented kids clear of eye and brow Most of the kids who bothered to come in were the freaks and longhairs A few came over and asked Sarah in quiet tones what she knew about Mr Smiths condition She could only shake her head and say she had heard nothing But one of the girls Dawn Edwards who had a crush on Johnny read the depth of Sarahs fear in her face She burst into tears A nurse came and asked her to leave Im sure shell be all right Sarah said She had a protective arm around Dawns shoulders Just give her a minute or two No I dont want to stay Dawn said and left in a hurry knocking one of the hard plastic contour chairs over with a clatter A few moments later Sarah saw the girl sitting out on the steps in the cold late October sunshine with her head on her knees Vera Smith read her Bible By five oclock most of the students had left Dawn had also left Sarah had not seen her go At seven PM a young man with DR STRAWNS pinned askew to the lapel of his white coat came into the waiting room glanced around and walked toward them Mr and Mrs Smith he asked Herb took a deep breath Yes We are Vera shut her Bible with a snap Would you come with me please Thats it Sarah thought The walk down to the small private room and then the news Whatever the news is She would wait and when they came back Herb Smith would tell her what she needed to know He was a kind man Have you news of my son Vera asked in that same clear strong and nearly hysterical voice Yes Dr Strawns glanced at Sarah Are you family maam No Sarah said A friend A close friend Herb said A warm strong hand closed above her elbow just as another had closed around Veras upper arm He helped them both to their feet Well all go together if you dont mind Not at all He led them past the elevator bank and down a hallway to an office with CONFERENCE ROOM on the door He let them in and turned on the overhead fluorescent lights The room was furnished with a long table and a dozen office chairs Dr Strawns closed the door lit a cigarette and dropped the burned match into one of the ashtrays that marched up and down the table This is difficult he said as if to himself Then you had best just say it out Vera said Yes perhaps Id better It was not her place to ask but Sarah could not help it Is he dead Please dont say hes dead Hes in a coma Strawns sat down and dragged deeply on his cigarette Mr Smith has sustained serious head injuries and an undetermined amount of brain damage You may have heard the phrase subdural hematoma on one or the other of the doctor shows Mr Smith has suffered a very grave subdural hematoma which is localized cranial bleeding A long operation was necessary to relieve the pressure and also to remove bonesplinters from his brain Herb sat down heavily his face doughy and stunned Sarah noticed his blunt scarred hands and remembered Johnny telling her his father was a carpenter But God has spared him Vera said I knew he would I prayed for a sign Praise God Most High All ye here below praise His name Vera Herb said with no force In a coma Sarah repeated She tried to fit the information into some sort of emotional frame and found it wouldnt go That Johnny wasnt dead that he had come through a serious and dangerous operation on his brain  those things should have renewed her hope But they didnt She didnt like that word coma It had a sinister stealthy sound Wasnt it Latin for sleep of death Whats ahead for him Herb asked No one can really answer that now Strawns said He began to play with his cigarette tapping it nervously over the ashtray Sarah had the feeling he was answering Herbs question literally while completely avoiding the question Herb had really asked Hes on life support equipment of course But you must know something about his chances Sarah said You must know  She gestured helplessly with her hands and let them drop to her sides He may come out of it in fortyeight hours Or a week A month He may never come out of  there is a strong possibility that he may die I must tell you frankly thats the most likely His injuries grave God wants him to live Vera said I know it Herb had put his face into his hands and was scrubbing it slowly Dr Strawns looked at Vera uncomfortably I only want you to be prepared for any eventuality Would you rate his chances for coming out of it Herb asked Dr Strawns hesitated puffed nervously on his cigarette No I cant do that he said finally  The three of them waited another hour and then left It was dark A cold and gusty wind had come up and it whistled across the big parking lot Sarahs long hair streamed out behind her Later when she got home she would find a crisp yellow oak leaf caught in it Overhead the moon rode the sky a cold sailor of the night Sarah pressed a scrap of paper into Herbs hand Written on it was her address and phone number Would you call me if you hear something Anything at all Yes of course He bent suddenly and kissed her cheek and Sarah held his shoulder for a moment in the blowing dark Im very sorry if I was stiff with you earlier dear Vera said and her voice was surprisingly gentle I was upset Of course you were Sarah said I thought my boy might die But Ive prayed Ive spoken to God about it As the song says Are we weak and heavyladen Cumbered with a load of care We must never be discouraged Take it to the Lord in prayer Vera we ought to go along Herb said We ought to get some sleep and see how things look in the But now Ive heard from my God Vera said looking dreamily up at the moon Johnny isnt going to die It isnt in Gods plan for Johnny to die I listened and I heard that still small voice speaking in my heart and I am comforted Herb opened the car door Come on Vera She looked back at Sarah and smiled In that smile Sarah suddenly saw Johnnys own easy devilmaycare grin  but at the same time she thought it was the most ghastly smile she had ever seen in her life God has put his mark on my Johnny Vera said and I rejoice Good night Mrs Smith Sarah said through numb lips Good night Sarah Herb said He got in and started the car It pulled out of its space and moved across the parking lot to State Street and Sarah realized she hadnt asked where they were staying She guessed they might not know themselves yet She turned to go to her own car and paused struck by the river that ran behind the hospital the Penobscot It flowed like dark silk and the reflected moon was caught in its center She looked up into the sky standing alone in the parking lot now She looked at the moon God has put his mark on my Johnny and I rejoice The moon hung above her like a tawdry carnival toy a Wheel of Fortune in the sky with the odds all slugged in favor of the house not to mention the house numbers  zero and double zero House numbah house numbah yall pay the house heyheyhey The wind blew rattling leaves around her legs She went to her car and sat behind the wheel She felt suddenly sure she was going to lose him Terror and loneliness woke in her She began to shiver At last she started her car and drove home  There was a great outpouring of comfort and good wishes from the Cleaves Mill student body in the following week Herb Smith told her later that Johnny received better than three hundred cards Almost all of them contamed a hesitant personal note saying they hoped Johnny would be well soon Vera answered each of them with a thankyou note and a Bible verse Sarahs discipline problem in her classes disappeared Her previous feeling that some returning jury of class consciousness was bringing in an unfavorable verdict changed to just the opposite Gradually she realized that the kids were viewing her as a tragic heroine Mr Smiths lost love This idea struck her in the teachers room during her free period on the Wednesday following the accident and she went off into sudden gales of laughter that turned into a crying jag Before she was able to get herself under control she had frightened herself badly Her nights were made restless with incessant dreams of Johnny  Johnny in the Halloween JekyllandHyde mask Johnny standing at the Wheel of Fortune concession while some disembodied voice chanted Man I love to watch this guy get a beatin over and over Johnny saying Its all right now Sarah everythings fine and then coming into the room with his head gone above the eyebrows Herb and Vera Smith spent the week in the Bangor House and Sarah saw them every afternoon at the hospital waiting patiently for something to happen Nothing did Johnny lay in a room on the intensive care ward on the sixth floor surrounded by lifesupport equipment breathing with the help of a machine Dr Strawns had grown less hopeful On the Friday following the accident Herb called Sarah on the phone and told her he and Vera were going home She doesnt want to he said but Ive gotten her to see reason I think Is she all right Sarah asked There was a long pause long enough to make Sarah think she had overstepped the bounds Then Herb said I dont know Or maybe I do and I just dont want to say right out that she isnt Shes always had strong ideas about religion and they got a lot stronger after her operation Her hysterectomy Now theyve gotten worse again Shes been talking a lot about the end of the world Shes connected Johnnys accident with the Rapture somehow Just before Armageddon God is supposed to take all the faithful up to heaven in their actual bodies Sarah thought of a bumper sticker she had seen somewhere IF THE RAPTURES TODAY SOMEBODY GRAB MY STEERING WHEEL  Yes I know the idea she said Well Herb said uncomfortably some of the groups she  she corresponds with they believe that God is going to come for the faithful in flying saucers Take them all up to heaven in flying saucers that is These  sects  have proved at least to themselves that heaven is somewhere out in the constellation of Orion No dont ask me how they proved it Vera could tell you Its  well Sarah its all a little hard on me Of course it must be Herbs voice strengthened But she can still distinguish between whats real and whats not She needs time to adjust So I told her she could face whatevers coming at home as easily as here Ive He paused sounding embarrassed then cleared his throat and went on Ive got to get back to work Ive got jobs Ive signed contracts Sure of course She paused What about insurance I mean this must be costing a Denver mint It was her turn to feel embarrassed Ive talked with Mr Pelsen your assistant principal there at Cleaves Mills Herb said Johnny had the standard Blue Cross but not that new Major Medical The Blue Cross will cover some of it though And Vera and I have our savings Sarahs heart sank Vera and I have our savings How long would one passbook stand up to expenses of two hundred dollars a day or more And for what purpose in the end So Johnny could hang on like an insensible animal pissing brainlessly down a tube while he bankrupted his dad and mom So his condition could drive his mother mad with unrealized hope She felt the tears start to slip down her cheeks and for the first time  but not the last  she found herself wishing Johnny would die and be at peace Part of her revolted in horror at the thought but it remained I wish you all the best Sarah said I know that Sarah We wish you the best Will you write I sure will And come see us when you can Pownals not so far away He hesitated Looks to me like Johnny had picked himself out the right girl It was pretty serious wasnt it Yes Sarah said The tears were still coming and the past tense was not lost on her It was Goodbye honey Goodbye Herb She hung up the phone held the buttons down for a second or two and then called the hospital and asked about Johnny There had been no change She thanked the intensive care nurse and walked aimlessly back and forth through the apartment She thought about God sending out a fleet of flying saucers to pick up the faithful and buzz them off to Orion It made as much sense as anything else about a God crazy enough to scramble John Smiths brains and put him in a coma that was probably never going to end  except in an unexpected death There was a folder of freshman compositions to correct She made herself a cup of tea and sat down to them If there was any one moment when Sarah Bracknell picked up the reins of her postJohnny life again that was CHAPTER FOUR The killer was slick He sat on a bench in the town park near the bandstand smoking a Marlboro and humming a song from the Beatles white album  you dont know how lucky you are boy back in the back in the back in the USSR He wasnt a killer yet not really But it had been on his mind a long time killing had It had been itching at him and itching at him Not in a bad way no He felt quite optimistic about it The time was right He didnt have to worry about getting caught He didnt have to worry about the clothespin Because he was slick A little snow began to drift down from the sky It was November   and a hundred and sixty miles northeast of this middlesized western Maine town John Smiths sleep went on and on The killer scanned the park  the town common the tourists who came to Castle Rock and the Lakes Region liked to call it But there were no tourists now The common that was so green in the summer was now yellow balding and dead It waited for winter to cover it decently The wiremesh backstop behind the Little League home plate stood in rusty overlapping diamonds framed against the white sky The bandstand needed a fresh coat of paint It was a depressing scene but the killer was not depressed He was almost manic with joy His toes wanted to tap his fingers wanted to snap There would be no shying away this time He crushed his smoke under one boot heel and lit another immediately He glanced at his watch  PM He sat and smoked Two boys passed through the park tossing a football back and forth but they didnt see the killer because the benches were down in a dip He supposed it was a place where the nastyfuckers came at night when the weather was warmer He knew all about the nastyfuckers and the things they did His mother had told him and he had seen them Thinking about his mother made his smile fade a little He remembered a time when he had been seven she had come into his room without knocking  she never knocked  and had caught him playing with his thing She had just about gone crazy He had tried to tell her it was nothing Nothing bad It had just stood up He hadnt done anything to make it stand up it did it all on its own And he just sat there boinging it back and forth It wasnt even that much fun It was sort of boring But his mother had just about gone crazy Do you want to be one of those nastyfuckers she had screamed at him He didnt even know what that word meant  not nasty he knew that one but the other one although he had heard some of the bigger kids use it in the playyard at the Castle Rock Elementary School Do you want to be one of those nastyfuckers and get one of those diseases Do you want to have pus running out of it Do you want it to turn black Do you want it to rot off Huh Huh Huh She began to shake him back and forth then and he began to blubber with fear even then she was a big woman a dominant and overbearing ocean liner of a woman and he was not the killer then he was not slick then he was a little boy blubbering with fear and his thing had collapsed and was trying to shrivel back into his body She had made him wear a clothespin on it for two hours so he would know how those diseases felt The pain was excruciating The little snow flurry had passed He brushed the image of his mother out of his mind something he could do effortlessly when he was feeling good something he couldnt do at all when he was feeling depressed and low His thing was standing up now He glanced at his watch   He dropped his cigarette halfsmoked Someone was coming He recognized her It was Alma Alma Frechette from the Coffee Pot across the street Just coming offshift He knew Alma he had dated her up once or twice shown her a good time Took her to Serenity Hill over in Naples She was a good dancer Nastyfuckers often were He was glad it was Alma coming She was by herself Back in the US back in the US back in the USSR Alma he called and waved She started a little looked around and saw him She smiled and walked over to the bench where he sat saying hello and calling him by name He stood up smiling He wasnt worried about anyone coming He was untouchable He was Superman Why you wearing that she asked looking at him Slick isnt it he said smiling Well I wouldnt exactly You want to see something he asked On the bandstand Its the goddamnest thing What is it Come and look All right As simple as that She went with him to the bandstand If anyone had been coming he still could have called it off But no one came No one passed They had the common to themselves The white sky brooded over them Alma was a small girl with light blonde hair Dyed blonde hair he was quite sure Sluts dyed their hair He led her up onto the enclosed bandstand Their feet made hollow dead echoes on the boards An overturned music stand lay in one corner There was an empty Four Roses bottle This was a place where the nastyfuckers came all right What she asked sounding a little puzzled now A little nervous The killer smiled joyously and pointed to the left of the music stand There See She followed his finger A used condom lay on the boards like a shriveled snakeskin Almas face went tight and she turned to go so quickly that she almost got by the killer Thats not very funny He grabbed her and threw her back Where do you think youre going Her eyes were suddenly watchful and frightened Let me out of here Or youll be sorry I dont have any time for sick jokes Its no joke he said Its no joke you nastyfucker He was lightheaded with the joy of naming her naming her for what she was The world whirled Alma broke left heading for the low railing that surrounded the bandstand meaning to leap over it The killer caught the back of her cheap cloth coat at the collar and yanked her back again The cloth ripped with a low purring sound and she opened her mouth to scream He slammed his hand over her mouth mashing her lips back against her teeth He felt warm blood trickle over his palm Her other hand was beating at him now clawing for purchase but there was no purchase There was none because he he was Slick He threw her to the board floor His hand came off her mouth which was now smeared with blood and she opened her mouth to scream again but he landed on top of her panting grinning and the air was driven out of her lungs in a soundless whoosh She could feel him now rock hard gigantic and throbbing and she quit trying to scream and went on struggling Her fingers caught and slipped caught and slipped He forced her legs rudely apart and lay between them One of her hands glanced off the bridge of his nose making his eyes water You nastyfucker he whispered and his hands closed on her throat He began to throttle her yanking her head up from the bandstands board flooring and then slamming it back down Her eyes bulged Her face went pink then red then a congested purple Her struggles began to weaken Nastyfucker nastyfucker nastyfucker the killer panted hoarsely He really was the killer now Alma Frechettes days of rubbing her body all over people at Serenity Hill were done now Her eyes bugged out like the eyes of some of those crazy dolls they sold along carnival midways The killer panted hoarsely Her hands lay limp on the boards now His fingers had almost disappeared from sight He let go of her throat ready to grab her again if she stirred But she didnt After a moment he ripped her coat open with shaking hands and shoved the skirt of her pink waitress uniform up The white sky looked down The Castle Rock town common was deserted In fact no one found the strangled violated corpse of Alma Frechette until the next day The sheriffs theory was that a drifter had done it There were statewide newspaper headlines and in Castle Rock there was general agreement with the sheriffs idea Surely no hometown boy could have done such a dreadful thing Herb and Vera Smith went back to Pownal and took up the embroidery of their days Herb finished a house in Durham that December Their savings did indeed melt away as Sarah had foreseen and they applied to the state for Extraordinary Disaster Assistance That aged Herb almost as much as the accident itself had done EDA was only a fancy way of saying welfare or charity in his mind He had spent a lifetime working hard and honestly  with his hands and had thought he would never see the day when he would have to take a state dollar But here that day was Vera subscribed to three new magazines which came through the mail at irregular intervals All three were badly printed and might have been illustrated by talented children Gods Saucers The Coming Transfiguration and Gods Psychic Miracles The Upper Room which still came monthly now sometimes lay unopened for as long as three weeks at a stretch but she read these others to tatters She found a great many things in them that seemed to bear upon Johnnys accident and she read these nuggets to her tired husband at supper in a high piercing voice that trembled with exaltation Herb found himself telling her more and more frequently to be quiet and on occasion shouting at her to shut up that drivel and let him alone When he did that she would give him longsuffering compassionate and hurt glances  then slink upstairs to continue her studies She began to correspond with these magazines and to exchange letters with the contributors and with other penfriends who had had similar experiences in their lives Most of her correspondents were goodhearted people like Vera herself people who wanted to help and to ease the nearly insupportable burden of her pain They sent prayers and prayer stones they sent charms they sent promises to include Johnny in their nightly devotions Yet there were others who were nothing but conmen and women and Herb was alarmed by his wifes increasing inability to recognize these There was an offer to send her a sliver of the One True Cross of Our Lord for just  An offer to send a vial of water drawn from the spring at Lourdes which would almost certainly work a miracle when rubbed into Johnnys forehead That one was  plus postage Cheaper and more attractive to Vera was a continuously playing cassette tape of the Twentythird Psalm and the Lords Prayer as spoken by southern evangelist Billy Humbair Played at Johnnys bedside over a period of weeks it would almost certainly effect a marvelous recovery according to the pamphlet As an added blessing For A Short Time Only an autographed picture of Billy Humbarr himself would be included Herb was forced to step in more and more frequently as her passion for these pseudoreligious geegaws grew Sometimes he surreptitiously tore up her checks and simply readjusted the checkbook balance upward But when the offer specified cash and nothing but he simply had to put his foot down  and Vera began to draw away from him to view him with distrust as a sinner and an unbeliever Sarah Bracknell kept school during her days Her afternoons and evenings were not much different than they had been following the breakup with Dan she was in a kind of limbo waiting for something to happen In Paris the peace talks were stalled Nixon had ordered the bombing of Hanoi continued in spite of rising domestic and foreign protests At a press conference he produced pictures proving conclusively that American planes were surely not bombing North Vietnamese hospitals but he went everywhere by Army helicopter The investigation into the brutal rapemurder of a Castle Rock waitress was stalled following the release of a wandering sign painter who had once spent three years in the Augusta State Mental Hospital  against everyones expectations the sign painters alibi had turned out to hold water Janis Joplin was screaming the blues Paris decreed for the second year in a row that hemlines would go down but they didnt Sarah was aware of all these things in a vague way like voices from another room where some incomprehensible party went on and on The first snow fell  just a dusting  then a second dusting and ten days before Christmas there was a storm that closed area schools for the day and she sat home looking out at the snow as it filled Flagg Street Her brief thing with Johnny  she could not even properly call it an affair  was part of another season now and she could feel him beginning to slip away from her It was a panicky feeling as if a part of her was drowning Drowning in days She read a good deal about head injuries comas and brain damage None of it was very encouraging She found out there was a girl in a small Maryland town who had been in a coma for six years there had been a young man from Liverpool England who had been struck by a grappling hook while working on the docks and had remained in a coma for fourteen years before expiring Little by little this brawny young dockwalloper had severed his connections with the world wasting away losing his hair optic nerves degenerating into oatmeal behind his closed eyes body gradually drawing up into a fetal position as his ligaments shortened He had reversed time had become a fetus again swimming in the placental waters of coma as his brain degenerated An autopsy following his death had shown that the folds and convolutions of his cerebrum had smoothed out leaving the frontal and prefrontal lobes almost utterly smooth and blank Oh Johnny it just isnt fair she thought watching the snow fall outside filling the world up with blank whiteness burying fallen summer and redgold autumn It isnt fair they should let you go to whatever there is to go to There was a letter from Herb Smith every ten days to two weeks  Vera had her penfriends and he had his He wrote in a large sprawling hand using an oldfashioned fountain pen We are both fine and well Waiting to see what will happen next as you must be Yes I have been doing some reading and I know what you are too kind and thoughtful to say in your letter Sarah It looks bad But of course we hope I dont believe in God the way Vera does but I do believe in him after my fashion and wonder why he didnt take John outright if he was going to Is there a reason No one knows I guess We only hope In another letter Im having to do most of the Xmas shopping this year as Vera has decided Xmas presents are a sinful custom This is what I mean about her getting worse all the time Shes always thought it was a holy day instead of a holiday  if you see what I mean  and if she saw me calling it Xmas instead of Christmas I guess shed shoot me for a hossthief She was always saying how we should remember it is the birthday of Jesus Christ and not Santa Claus but she never minded the shopping before In fact she used to like it Now ragging against it is all she talks about seems like She gets a lot of these funny ideas from the people she writes back and forth to Golly I do wish shed stop and get back to normal But otherwise we are both fine and well Herb And a Christmas card that she had wept over a little Best to you from both of us this holiday season and if youd like to come down and spend Xmas with a couple of old fogies the spare bedroom is made up Vera and I are both fine and well Hope the New Year is better for all of us and am sure it will be Herb and Vera She didnt go down to Pownal over the Christmas vacation partly because of Veras continued withdrawal into her own world  her progress into that world could be read pretty accurately between the lines of Herbs letters  and partly because their mutual tie now seemed so strange and distant to her The still figure in the Bangor hospital bed had once been seen in closeup but now she always seemed to be looking at him through the wrong end of memorys telescope like the balloon man he was far and wee So it seemed best to keep her distance Perhaps Herb sensed it as well His letters became less frequent as  became  In one of them he came as close as he could to saying it was time for her to go on with her life and closed by saying that he doubted a girl as pretty as she was lacked for dates But she hadnt had any dates hadnt wanted them Gene Sedecki the math teacher who had once treated her to an evening that had seemed at least a thousand years long had begun asking her out indecently soon after Johnnys accident and he was a hard man to discourage but she believed that he was finally beginning to get the point It should have happened sooner Occasionally other men would ask her and one of them a law student named Walter Hazlett attracted her quite a bit She met him at Anne Straffords New Years Eve party She had meant only to make an appearance but she had stayed quite a while talking primarily to Hazlett Saying no had been surprisingly hard but she had because she understood the source of attraction too well  Walt Hazlett was a tall man with an unruly shock of brown hair and a slanted halfcynical smile and he reminded her strongly of Johnny That was no basis on which to get interested in a man Early in February she was asked out by the mechanic who worked on her car at the Cleaves Mills Chevron Again she almost said yes and then backed away The mans name was Arnie Tremont He was tall oliveskinned and handsome in a smiling predatory way He reminded her a bit of James Brolin the second banana on that Dr Welby program and even more of a certain Delta Tau Delta named Dan Better to wait Wait and see if something was going to happen But nothing did  In that summer of  Greg Stillson sixteen years older and wiser than the Bible salesman who had kicked a dog to death in a deserted Iowa dooryard sat in the back room of his newly incorporated insurance and real estate business in Ridgeway New Hampshire He hadnt aged much in the years between There was a net of wrinkles around his eyes now and his hair was longer but still quite conservative He was still a big man and his swivel chair creaked when he moved He sat smoking a Pall Mall cigarette and looking at the man sprawled comfortably in the chair opposite Greg was looking at this man the way a zoologist might look at an interesting new specimen See anything green Sonny Elliman asked Elliman topped six feet five inches He wore an ancient greasestiffened jeans jacket with the arms and buttons cut off There was no shirt beneath A Nazi iron cross black dressed in white chrome hung on his bare chest The buckle of the belt running just below his considerable beerbelly was a great ivory skull From beneath the pegged cuffs of his jeans poked the scuffed square toes of a pair of Desert Driver boots His hair was shoulderlength tangled and shining with an accumulation of greasy sweat and engine oil From one earlobe there dangled a swastika earring also black dressed in white chrome He spun a coalscuttle helmet on the tip of one blunt finger Stitched on the back of his jacket was a leering red devil with a forked tongue Above the devil was The Devils Dozen Below it Sonny Elliman Prez No Greg Stillson said I dont see anything green but I do see someone who looks suspiciously like a walking asshole Elliman stiffened a little then relaxed and laughed In spite of the dirt the almost palpable body odor and Nazi regalia his eyes a dark green were not without intelligence and even a sense of humor Rank me to the dogs and back man he said Its been done before You got the power now You recognize that do you Sure I left my guys back in the Hamptons came here alone Be it on my own head man He smiled But if we should ever catch you in a similar position you want to hope your kidneys are wearing combat boots Ill chance it Greg said He measured Elliman They were both big men He reckoned Elliman had forty pounds on him but a lot of it was beer muscle I could take you Sonny Ellimans face crinkled in amiable good humor again Maybe Maybe not But thats not the way we play it man All that good American John Wayne stuff He leaned forward as if to impart a great secret Me personally now whenever I get me a piece of moms apple pie I make it my business to shit on it Foul mouth Sonny Greg said mildly What do you want with me Sonny asked Why dont you get down to it Youll miss your Jaycees meeting No Greg said still serene The Jaycees meet Tuesday nights Weve got all the time in the world Elliman made a disgusted blowing sound Now what I thought Greg went on is that youd want something from me He opened his desk drawer and from it took three plastic Baggies of marijuana Mixed in with the weed were a number of gel capsules Found this in your sleeping bag Greg said Nasty nasty nasty Sonny Bad boy Do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollars Go directly to New Hampshire State Prison You didnt have any search warrant Elliman said Even a kiddy lawyer could get me off and you know it I dont know any such thing Greg Stillson said He leaned back in his swivel chair and cocked his loafers bought across the state line at LL Beans in Maine up on his desk Im a big man in this town Sonny I came into New Hampshire more or less on my uppers a few years back and now Ive got a nice operation here Ive helped the town council solve a couple of problems including just what to do about all these kids the chief of police catches doing dope  oh I dont mean badhats like you Sonny drifters like you we know what to do with when we catch them with a little treasure trove like that one right there on my desk  I mean the nice local kids Nobody really wants to do anything to them at all you know I figured that out for them Put them to work on community projects instead of sending them to jail I said It worked out real good Now weve got the biggest head in the town area coaching Little League and doing a real good job at it Elliman was looking bored Greg suddenly brought his feet down with a crash grabbed a vase with a UNH logo on the side and threw it past Sonny Ellimans nose It missed him by less than an inch flew end over end across the room and shattered against the file cabinets in the corner For the first time Elliman looked startled And for just a moment the face of this older wiser Greg Stillson was the face of the younger man the dogbludgeoner You want to listen when I talk he said softly Because what were discussing here is your career over the next ten years or so Now if you dont have any interest in making a career out of stamping LIVE FREE OR DIE on license plates you want to listen up Sonny You want to pretend this is the first day of school again Sonny You want to get it all right the first time Sonny Elliman looked at the smashed fragments of vase then back at Stillson His former uneasy calm was being replaced by a feeling of real interest He hadnt been really interested in anything for quite a while now He had made the run for beer because he was bored He had come by himself because he was bored And when this big guy had pulled him over using a flashing blue light on the dashboard of his station wagon Sonny Elliman had assumed that what he had to deal with was just another smalltown Deputy Dawg protecting his territory and rousting the big bad biker on the modified HarleyDavidson But this guy was something else He was was Hes crazy Sonny realized with dawning delight at the discovery Hes got two public service awards on his wall and pictures of him talking to the Rotarians and the Lions and hes vice president of this dipshit towns Jaycees and next year hell be president and hes just as crazy as a fucking bedbug Okay he said You got my attention I have had what you might call a checkered career Greg told him Ive been up but Ive also been down Ive had a few scrapes with the law What Im trying to say Sonny is that I dont have any set feelings about you Not like the other locals They read in the UnionLeader about what you and your bikie friends are doing over in the Hamptons this summer and theyd like to castrate you with a rusty Gillette razor blade Thats not the Devils Dozen Sonny said We came down on a run from upstate New York to get some beachtime man Were on vacation Were not into trashing a bunch of honkytonk bars Theres a bunch of Hells Angels tearing ass and a chapter of the Black Riders from New Jersey but you know who it is mostly A bunch of college kids Sonnys lip curled But the papers dont like to report that do they Theyd rather lay the rap on us than on Susie and Jim Youre so much more colorful Greg said mildly And William Loeb over at the UnionLeader doesnt like bike clubs That baldheaded creep Sonny muttered Greg opened his desk drawer and pulled out a flat pint of Leaders bourbon Ill drink to that he said He cracked the seal and drank half the pint at a draught He blew out a great breath his eyes watering and held the pint across the desk You Sonny polished the pint off Warm fire bellowed up from his stomach to his throat Light me up man he gasped Greg threw back his head and laughed Well get along Sonny I have a feeling well get along What do you want Sonny asked again holding the empty pint Nothing  not now But I have a feeling Gregs eyes became far away almost puzzled I told you Im a big man in Ridgeway Im going to run for mayor next time the office comes up and Ill win But thats Just the beginning Sonny prompted Its a start anyway That puzzled expression was still there I get things done People know it Im good at what I do I feel like  theres a lot ahead of me Skys the limit But Im not  quite  what I mean You know Sonny only shrugged The puzzled expression faded But theres a story Sonny A story about a mouse who took a thorn out of a lions paw He did it to repay the lion for not eating him a few years before You know that story I might have heard it when I was a kid Greg nodded Well its a few years before   whatever it is Sonny He shoved the plastic Baggies across the desk Im not going to eat you I could if I wanted to you know A kiddie lawyer couldnt get you off In this town with the riots going on in Hampton less than twenty miles away Clarence Fucking Darrow couldnt get you off in Ridgeway These good people would love to see you go up Elliman didnt reply but he suspected Greg was right There was nothing heavy in his dope stash  two Brown Bombers was the heaviest  but the collective parents of good old Susie and Jim would be glad to see him breaking rocks in Portsmouth with his hair cut off his head Im not going to eat you Greg repeated I hope youll remember that in a few years if I get a thorn in my paw  or maybe if I have a job opportunity for you Keep it in mind Gratitude was not in Sonny Ellimans limited catalogue of human feelings but interest and curiosity were He felt both ways about this man Stillson That craziness in his eyes hinted at many things but boredom was not one of them Who knows where well all be in a few years he murmured We could all be dead man Just keep me in mind Thats all Im asking Sonny looked at the broken shards of vase Ill keep you in mind he said   passed The New Hampshire beach riots blew over and the grumblings of the beachfront entrepreneurs were muted by the increased balances in their bankbooks An obscure fellow named George McGovern declared for the presidency comically early Anyone who followed politics knew that the nominee from the Democratic party in  was going to be Edmund Muskie and there were those who felt he might just wrestle the Troll of San Clemente off his feet and pin him to the mat In early June just before school let out for the summer Sarah met the young law student again She was in Days appliance store shopping for a toaster and he had been looking for a gift for his parents wedding anniversary He asked her if shed like to go to the movies with him the new Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry was in town Sarah went And the two of them had a good time Walter Hazlett had grown a beard and he no longer reminded her so much of Johnny In fact it had become increasingly difficult for her to remember just what Johnny did look like His face only came dear in her dreams dreams where he stood in front of the Wheel of Fortune watching it spin his face cold and his blue eyes darkened to that perplexing and a little fearsome dark violet shade watching the Wheel as if it were his own private game preserve She and Walt began to see a lot of each other He was easy to get along with He made no demands  or if he did they were of such a gradually increasing nature as to be unnoticeable In October he asked her if he could buy her a small diamond Sarah asked him if she could have the weekend to think it over That Saturday night she had gone to the Eastern Maine Medical Center had gotten a special redbordered pass at the desk and had gone up to intensive care She sat beside Johnnys bed for an hour Outside the fall wind howled in the dark promising cold promising snow promising a season of death It lacked sixteen days of a year since the fair the Wheel and the headon collision near the Bog She sat and listened to the wind and looked at Johnny The bandages were gone The scar began on his forehead an inch above his right eyebrow and twisted up under the hairline His hair there had gone white  making her think of that fictional detective in the th Precinct stories Cotton Hawes his name was To Sarahs eyes there seemed to have been no degeneration in him except for the inevitable weight loss He was simply a young man she barely knew fast asleep She bent over him and kissed his mouth softly as if the old fairy tale could be reversed and her kiss could wake him But Johnny only slept She left went back to her apartment in Veazie lay down on her bed and cried as the wind walked the dark world outside throwing its catch of yellow and red leaves before it On Monday she told Walt that if he really did want to buy her a diamond  a small one mind  she would be happy and proud to wear it That was Sarah Bracknells  In early  Edmund Muskie burst into tears during an impassioned speech outside the offices of the man Sonny Elliman had referred to as that baldheaded creep George McGovern upset the primary and Loeb announced gleefully in his paper that the people of New Hampshire didnt like crybabies In July McGovern was nominated In that same month Sarah Bracknell became Sarah Hazlett She and Walt were married in the First Methodist Churth of Bangor Less than two miles away Johnny Smith slept on And the thought of him came to Sarah suddenly and horribly as Walt kissed her in front of the dearly beloved there assembled for the nuptials  Johnny she thought and saw him as she had when the lights went on half Jekyll and half snarling Hyde She stiffened in Walts arms for a moment and then it was gone Memory vision whatever it had been it was gone After long thought and discussion with Walt she had invited Johnnys folks to the wedding Herb had come alone At the reception she asked him if Vera was all right He glanced around saw they were alone for the moment and rapidly downed the remainder of his Scotch and soda He had aged five years in the last eighteen months she thought His hair was thinning The lines on his face were deeper He was wearing glasses in the careful and selfconscious way of people who have just started wearing them and behind the mild corrective lenses his eyes were wary and hurt No she really isnt Sarah The truth is shes up in Vermont On a farm Waiting for the end of the world What Herb told her that six months ago Vera had begun to correspond with a group of about ten people who called themselves The American Society of the Last Times They were led by Mr and Mrs Harry L Stonkers from Racine Wisconsin Mr and Mrs Stonkers claimed to have been picked up by a flying saucer while they were on a camping trip They had been taken away to heaven which was not out in the constellation Orion but on an earthtype planet that circled Arcturus There they had communed with the society of angels and had seen Paradise The Stonkerses had been informed that the Last Times were at hand They were given the power of telepathy and had been sent back to Earth to gather a few fruitful together  for the first shuttle to heaven as it were And so the ten of them had gotten together bought a farm north of St Johnsbury and had been settled in there for about seven weeks waiting for the saucer to come and pick them up It sounds Sarah began and then closed her mouth I know how it sounds Herb said It sounds crazy The place cost them nine thousand dollars Its nothing but a crashedin farmhouse with two acres of scrubland Veras share was seven hundred dollars  all she could put up There was no way I could stop her  short of committal He paused then smiled But this is nothing to talk about at your wedding party Sarah You and your fellow are going to have all the best I know you will Sarah smiled back as best she could Thank you Herb Will you I mean do you think shell Come back Oh yes If the world doesnt end by winter I think shell be back Oh I only wish you the best she said and embraced  The farm in Vermont had no furnace and when the saucer had still not arrived by late October Vera came home The saucer had not come she said because they were not yet perfect  they had not burned away the nonessential and sinful dross of their lives But she was uplifted and spiritually exalted She had had a sign in a dream She was perhaps not meant to go to heaven in a saucer She felt more and more strongly that she would be needed to guide her boy show him the proper way when he came out of his trance Herb took her in loved her as best he could  and life went on Johnny had been in his coma for two years  Nixon was reinaugurated The American boys started coming home from Vietnam Walter Hazlett took his bar exam and was invited to take it again at a later date Sarah Hazlett kept school while he crammed for his tests The students who had been silly gawky freshmen the year she started teaching were now juniors Flatchested girls had become bosomy Shrimps who hadnt been able to find their way around the building were now playing varsity basketball The second ArabIsraeli war came and went The oil boycott came and went Bruisingly high gasoline prices came and did not go Vera Smith became convinced that Christ would return from below the earth at the South Pole This intelligence was based on a new pamphlet seventeen pages price  entitled Gods Tropical Underground The startling hypothesis of the pamphleteer was that heaven was actually below our very feet and that the easiest point of ingress was the South Pole One of the sections of the pamphlet was Psychic Experiences of the South Pole Explorers Herb pointed out to her that less than a year before she had been convinced that heaven was somewhere out There most probably circling Arcturus Id surely be more apt to believe that than this crazy South Pole stuff he told her Mter all the Bible says heavens in the sky That tropical place below the ground is supposed to be Stop it I she said sharply lips pressed into thin white lines No need to mock what you dont understand I wasnt mocking Vera he said quietly God knows why the unbeliever mocks and the heathen rages she said That blank light was in her eyes They were sitting at the kitchen table Herb with an old plumbing Jbolt in front of him Vera with a stack of old National Geographics which she had been gleaning for South Pole pictures and stories Outside restless clouds fled west to east and the leaves showered off the trees It was early October again and October always seemed to be her worst month It was the month when that blank light came more frequently to her eyes and stayed longer And it was always in October that his thoughts turned treacherously to leaving them both His possibly certifiable wife and his sleeping son who was probably already dead by any practical definition Just now he had been turning the Jbolt over in his hands and looking out the window at that restless sky and thinking I could pack up Just throw my things into the back of the pickup and go Florida maybe Nebraska California A good carpenter can make good money any damn place Just get up and go But he knew he wouldnt It was just that October was his month to think about running away as it seemed to be Veras month to discover some new pipeline to Jesus and the eventual salvation of the only child she had been able to nurture in her substandard womb Now he reached across the table and took her hand which was thin and terribly bony  an old womans hand She looked up surprised I love you very much Vera he said She smiled back and for a glimmering moment she was a great deal like the girl he had courted and won the girl who had goosed him with a hairbrush on their wedding night It was a gentle smile her eyes briefly dear and warm and loving in return Outside the sun came out again sending great shuttershadows fleeing across their back field I know you do Herbert And I love you He put his other hand over hers and clasped it Vera he said Yes Her eyes were so clear  suddenly she was with him totally with him and it made him realize how dreadfully far apart they had grown over the last three years Vera if he never does wake up  God forbid but if he doesnt  well still have each other wont we I mean She jerked her hand away His two hands which had been holding it lightly dapped on nothing Dont you ever say that Dont you ever say that Johnny isnt going to wake up All I meant was that we Of course hes going to wake up she said looking out the window to the field where the shadows still crossed and crossed Its Gods plan for him Oh yes Dont you think I know I know believe me God has great things in store for my Johnny I have heard him in my heart Yes Vera he said Okay Her fingers groped for the National Geographics found them and began to turn the pages again I know she said in a childish petulant voice Okay he said quietly She looked at her magazines Herb propped his chin in his palms and looked out at the sunshine and shadow and thought how soon winter came after golden treacherous October He wished Johnny would die He had loved the boy from the very first He had seen the wonder on his tiny face when Herb had brought a tiny tree frog to the boys carriage and had put the small living thing in the boys hands He had taught Johnny how to fish and skate and shoot He had sat up with him all night during his terrible bout with the flu in  when the boys temperature had crested at a giddy one hundred and five degrees He had hidden tears in his hand when Johnny graduated salutatorian of his high school class and had made his speech from memory without a slip So many memories of him  teaching him to drive standing on the bow of the Bolero with him when they went to Nova Scotia on vacation one year Johnny eight years old laughing and excited by the screwlike motion of the boat helping him with his homework helping him with his treehouse helping him get the hang of his Silva compass when he had been in the Scouts All the memories were jumbled together in no chronological order at all Johnny was the single unifying thread Johnny eagerly discovering the world that had maimed him so badly in the end And now he wished Johnny would die oh how he wished it that he would die that his heart would stop beating that the final low traces on the EEG would go flat that he would just flicker out like a guttering candle in a pool of wax that he would die and release them  The seller of lightning rods arrived at Cathys Roadhouse in Somersworth New Hampshire in the early afternoon of a blazing summers day less than a week after the Fourth of July in that year of  and somewhere not so far away there were perhaps storms only waiting to be born in the warm elevator shafts of summers thermal updrafts He was a man with a big thirst and he stopped at Cathys to slake it with a couple of beers not to make a sale But from force of long habit he glanced up at the roof of the low ranchstyle building and the unbroken line he saw standing against the blistering gunmetal sky caused him to reach back in for the scuffed suede bag that was his sample case Inside Cathys was dark and cool and silent except for the muted rumble of the color TV on the wall A few regulars were there and behind the bar was the owner keeping an eye on As The World Turns along with his patrons The seller of lightning rods lowered himself onto a bar stool and put his sample case on the stool to his left The owner came over Hi friend Whatll it be A Bud the lightning rod salesman said And draw another for yourself if youre of a mind Im always of a mind the owner said He returned with two beers took the salesmans dollar and left three dimes on the bar Bruce Carrick he said and offered his hand The seller of lightning rods shook it Dohay is the name he said Andrew Dohay He drained off half his beer Pleased to meet you Carrick said He wandered off to serve a young woman with a hard face another Tequila Sunrise and eventually wandered back to Dohay From out of town I am Dohay admitted Salesman He glanced around Is it always this quiet No It jumps on the weekends and I do a fair trade through the week Private parties is where we make our dough  if we make it I aint starving but neither am I driving a Cadillac He pointed a pistol finger at Dohays glass Freshen that And another for yourself Mr Carrick Bruce He laughed You must want to sell me something When Carrick returned with the beers the seller of lightning rods said I came in to lay the dust not to sell anything But now that you mention it He hauled his sample case up onto the bar with a practiced jerk Things jingled inside it Oh here it comes Carrick said and laughed Two of the afternoon regulars an old fellow with a wart on his right eyelid and a younger man in gray fatigues wandered over to see what Dohay was selling The hardfaced woman went on watching As The World Turns Dohay took out three rods a long one with a brass ball at the tip a shorter one and one with porcelain conductors What the hell Carrick said Lightning rods the old campaigner said and cackled He wants to save this ginmill from Gods wrath Brucie You better listen to what he says He laughed again the man in the gray fatigues joined him Carricks face darkened and the lightning rod salesman knew that whatever chance he had had of making a sale had just flown away He was a good salesman good enough to recognize that this queer combination of personalities and circumstances sometimes got together and queered any chance of a deal even before he had a chance to swing into his pitch He took it philosophically and went into his spiel anyway mostly from force of habit As I was getting out of my car I just happened to notice that this fine establishment wasnt equipped with lightning conductors  and that its constructed of wood Now for a very small price  and easy credit terms if you should want them  I can guarantee that That lightningll strike this place at four this afternoon the man in the gray fatigues said with a grin The old campaigner cackled Mister no offense Carrick said but you see that He pointed to a golden nail on a small wooden plaque beside the TV near the glistening array of bottles Spiked on the nail was a drift of papers All of those things are bills They got to be paid by the fifteenth of the month They get written in red ink Now you see how many people are in here drinking right now I got to be careful I got to Just my point Dohay broke in smoothly You have to be careful And the purchase of three or four lightning rods is a careful purchase Youve got a going concern here You wouldnt want it wiped out by one stroke of lightning on a summers day would you He wouldnt mind the old campaigner said Hed just collect the insurance and go down to Florida Woontchoo Brucie Carrick looked at the old man with distaste Well then lets talk about insurance the lightning rod salesman interposed The man in the gray fatigues had lost interest and had wandered away Your fire insurance premiums will go down The insurance is all lumped together Carrick said flatly Look I just cant afford the outlay Sorry Now if you was to talk to me again next year Well perhaps I will the lightning rod salesman said giving up Perhaps I will No one thought they could be struck by lightning until they were struck it was a constant fact of this business You couldnt make a fellow like this Carrick see that it was the cheapest form of fire insurance he could buy But Dohay was a philosopher After all he had told the truth when he said he came in to lay the dust To prove it and to prove there were no hard feelings he ordered another beer But this time he did not match it with one for Carrick The old campaigner slid onto the stool beside him About ten years ago there was a fella got hit by lightning out on the golf course he said Killed him just as dead as shit Now theres a man could have used a lightning rod right up on his head am I right He cackled sending out a lot of stale beerbreath into Dohays face Dohay smiled dutifully All the coins in his pockets were fused together Thats what I heard Lightnings a funny thing Sure is Now I remember one time A funny thing Dohay thought letting the old mans words flow harmlessly over him nodding in the right places out of instinct A funny thing all right because it doesnt care who or what it hits Or when He finished his beer and went out carrying his satchelful of insurance against the wrath of God  maybe the only kind ever invented  with him The heat struck him like a hammerblow but still he paused for a moment in the mostly deserted parking lot looking up at the unbroken line of roofridge   tops and the man couldnt afford the outlay Hed save seventy bucks on his combined insurance the first year but he couldnt afford the outlay  and you couldnt tell him different with those clowns standing around yukking it up Maybe some day he would be sorry The seller of lightning rods got into his Buick cranked up the air conditioning and drove away west toward Concord and Berlin his sample case on the seat beside him running ahead of whatever storms might be whistling up the wind behind  In early  Walt Hazlett passed his bar exams He and Sarah threw a party for all of his friends her friends and their mutual friends  more than forty people in all The beer flowed like water and after it was over Walt said they could count themselves damn lucky not to have been evicted When the last of the guests were seen out at three in the morning Walt had come back from the door to find Sarah in the bedroom naked except for her shoes and the diamond chip earrings he had gone into hock to give her for her birthday They had made love not once but twice before falling into sodden slumber from which they awoke at nearly noon with paralyzing hangovers About six weeks later Sarah discovered that she was pregnant Neither of them ever doubted that conception had occurred on the night of the big party In Washington Richard Nixon was being pressed slowly into a corner wrapped in a snarl of magnetic tapes In Georgia a peanut farmer exNavy man and current governor named James Earl Carter had begun talking with a number of close friends about running for the job Mr Nixon would soon be vacating In Room  of the Eastern Maine Medical Center Johnny Smith still slept He had begun to pull into a fetal shape Dr Strawns the doctor who had talked to Herb and Vera and Sarah in the conference room on the day following the accident had died of burns in late  His house had caught fire on the day after Christmas The Bangor fire department had determined that the fire had been caused by a faulty set of Christmas tree ornaments Two new doctors Weizak and Brown interested themselves in Johnnys case Four days before Nixon resigned Herb Smith fell into the foundation of a house he was building in Gray landed on a wheelbarrow and broke his leg The bone was a long time healing and it never really felt good again He limped and on wet days he began to use a cane Vera prayed for him and insisted that he wrap a cloth that had been personally blessed by the Reverend Freddy Coltsmore of Bessemer Alabama around the leg each night when he went to bed The price of the Blessed Coltsmore Cloth as Herb called it was  It did no good that he was aware of In the middle of October shortly after Gerald Ford had pardoned the expresident Vera became sure that the world was going to end again Herb realized what she was about barely in time she had made arrangements to give what little cash and savings they had recouped since Johnnys accident to the Last Times Society of America She had tried to put the house up for sale and had made an arrangement with the Goodwill which was going to send a van out in two days time to pick up all the furniture Herb found out when the realtor called him to ask if a prospective buyer could come and look at the house that afternoon For the first time he had genuinely lost his temper with Vera What in Christs name did you think you were doing he roared after dragging the last of the incredible story out of her They were in the living room He had just finished calling Goodwill to tell them to forget the van Outside rain fell in monotonous gray sheets Dont blaspheme the name of the Savior Herbert Shut up Shut up Im tired of listening to you rave about that crap She drew in a startled gasp He limped over to her his cane thumping the floor in counterpoint She flinched back a little in her chair and then looked up at him with that sweet martyrs expression that made him want God forgive him to bust her one across the head with his own damn walking stick Youre not so far gone that you dont know what youre doing he said You dont have that excuse You snuck around behind my back VeraYou I did not Thats a lie I did no such You did he bellowed Well you listen to me Vera This is where Im drawing the line You pray all you want Prayings free Write all the letters you want a stamp still only costs thirteen cents If you want to take a bath in all the cheap shitty lies those Jesusiumpers tell if you want to go on with the delusions and the makebelieve you go on But Im not a part of it Remember that Do you understand me Do you understand me You think Im crazy she shouted at him and her face crumpled and squeezed together in a terrible way She burst into the braying ugly tears of utter defeat and disillusion No he said more quietly Not yet But maybe its time for a little plain talk Vera and the truth is I think you will be if you dont pull out of this and start facing reality Youll see she said through her team Youll see God knows the truth but waits Just as long as you understand that hes not going to have our furniture while hes waiting Herb said grimly As long as we see eye to eye on that Its Last Times she told him The hour of the Apocalypse is at hand Yeah That and fifteen cents will buy you a cup of coffee Vera Outside the rain fell in steady sheets That was the year Herb turned fiftytwo Vera fifty one and Sarah Hazlett twentyseven Johnny had been in his coma for four years  The baby came on Halloween night Sarahs labor lasted nine hours She was given mild whiffs of gas when she needed them and at some point in her extremity it occurred to her that she was in the same hospital as Johnny and she called his name over and over again Afterward she barely remembered this and certainly never told Walt She thought she might have dreamed it The baby was a boy They named him Dennis Edward Hazlett He and his mother went home three days later and Sarah was teaching again after the Thanksgiving holiday Walt had landed what looked like a fine job with a Bangor firm of lawyers and if all went well they planned for Sarah to quit teaching in June of  She wasnt all that sure she wanted to She had grown to like it  On the first day of  two small boys Charlie Norton and Norm Lawson both of Otisfield Maine were in the Nortons back yard having a snowball fight Charlie was eight Norm was nine The day was overcast and drippy Sensing that the end of the snowball fight was nearing  it was almost time for lunch  Norm charged Charlie throwing a barrage of snowballs Ducking and laughing Charlie was at first forced back and then turned tail and ran jumping the low stone wall that divided the Norton back yard from the woods He ran down the path that led toward Strimmers Brook As he went Norm caught him a damn good one on the back of the hood Then Charlie disappeared from sight Norm jumped the wall and stood there for a moment looking into the snowy woods and listening to the drip of meltwater from the birches pines and spruces Come on back chicken Norm called and made a series of high gobbling sounds Charlie didnt rise to the bait There was no sign of him now but the path descended steeply as it went down toward the brook Norm gobbled again and shifted irresolutely from one foot to the other These were Charlies woods not his Charlies territory Norm loved a good snowball fight when he was winning but he didnt really want to go down there if Charlie was lying in ambush for him with half a dozen good hard slushballs all ready to go Nonetheless he had taken half a dozen steps down the path when a high breathless scream rose from below Norm Lawson went as cold as the snow his green gumrubber boots were planted in The two snowballs he had been holding dropped from his hands and plopped to the ground The scream rose again so thin it was barely audible Jeeperscreepers he went and fell in the brook Norm thought and that broke the paralysis of his fear He ran down the path slipping and sliding falling right on his can once His heartbeat roared in his ears Part of his mind saw him fishing Charlie from the brook just before he went down for the third time and getting written up in Boys Life as a hero Threequarters of the way down the slope the path doglegged and when he got around the corner he saw that Charlie Norton hadnt fallen in Strimmers Brook after all He was standing at the place where the path levelled out and he was staring at something in the melting snow His hood had fallen back and his face was nearly as white as the snow itself As Norm approached he uttered that horrible gasping outofbreath scream again What is it Norm asked approaching Charlie whats wrong Charlie turned to him his eyes huge his mouth gaping He tried to speak but nothing came out of his mouth but two inarticulate grunts and a silver cord of saliva He pointed instead Norm came closer and looked Suddenly all the strength went out of his legs and he sat down hard The world swam around him Protruding from the melting snow were two legs clad in blue jeans There was a loafer on one foot but the other was bare white and defenseless One arm stuck out of the snow and the hand at the end of it seemed to plead for a rescue that had never come The rest of the body was still mercifully hidden Charlie and Norm had discovered the body of seventeenyear old Carol Dunbarger the fourth victim of the Castle Rock Strangler It had been almost two years since he had last killed and the people of Castle Rock Strimmers Brook formed the southern borderline between the towns of Castle Rock and Otisfield had begun to relax thinking the nightmare was finally over It wasnt Eleven days after the discovery of the Dunbarger girls body a sleetandice storm struck northern New England On the sixth floor of the Eastern Maine Medical Center everything was running just a little bit late in consequence A lot of the staff had run into problems getting to work and those that made it found themselves running hard just to stay even It was after nine am when one of the aides a young woman named Allison Conover brought Mr Starret his light breakfast Mr Starret was recovering from a heart attack and was doing his sixteen in intensive care  a sixteenday stay following a coronary was standard operating procedure Mr Starret was doing nicely He was in room  and he had told his wife privately that the biggest incentive to his recovery was the prospect of getting away from the living corpse in the rooms second bed The steady whisper of the poor guys respirator made it hard to sleep he told her After a while it got so you didnt know if you wanted it to go on whispering or stop Stop dead so to speak The TV was on when Allison came in Mr Starret was sitting up in bed with his control button in one hand Today had ended and Mr Starret had not yet decided to blank out My Back Yard the cartoon show that followed it That would have left him alone with the sound of Johnnys respirator Id about given up on you this morning Mr Starret said looking at his breakfast tray of orange juice plain yoghurt and wheat flakes with no great joy What he really craved was two cholesterolfilled eggs fried over easy and sweating butter with five slices of bacon on the side not too crisp The sort of fare that had in fact landed him here in the first place At least according to his doctor  the birdbrain The goings bad outside Allison said shortly Six patients had already told her they had about given up on her this morning and the line was getting old Allison was a pleasant girl but this morning she was feeling harried Oh sorry Mr Starret said humbly Pretty slippery on the roads is it It sure is Allison said thawing slightly If I didnt have my husbands fourwheel drive today I never would have made it Mr Starret pushed the button that raised his bed so he could eat his breakfast comfortably The electric motor that raised and lowered it was small but loud The TV was still quite loud  Mr Starret was a little deaf and as he had told his wife the guy in the other bed had never complained about a little extra volume Never asked to see what was on the other channel either He supposed a joke like that was in pretty poor taste but when youd had a heart attack and wound up in intensive care sharing a room with a human vegetable you either learned a little black humor or you went crazy Allison raised her voice a little to be heard over the whining motor and the TV as she finished setting up Mr Starrets tray There were cars off the road all up and down State Street hill In the other bed Johnny Smith said softly The whole wad on nineteen One way or the other My girls sick You know this yogurt isnt half bad Mr Starret said He hated yogurt but he didnt want to be left alone until absolutely necessary When he was alone he kept taking his own pulse It tastes a little bit like wild hickory Did you hear something Allison asked She looked around doubtfully Mr Starret let go of the control button on the side of the bed and the whine of the electric motor died On the TV Elmer Fudd took a potshot at Bugs Bunny and missed Nothing but the TV Mr Starret said Whatd I miss Nothing I guess It must have been the wind around that window She could feel a stress headache coming on  too much to do and not enough people this morning to help her do it  and she rubbed at her temples as if to drive the pain away before it could get properly seated On her way out she paused and looked down at the man in the other bed for a moment Did he look different somehow As if he had shifted position Surely not Allison left the room and went on down the hall pushing her breakfast cabinet ahead of her It was as terrible a morning as she had feared it would be everything out of kilter and by noon her head was pounding She had quite understandably forgotten all about anything she might have heard that morning in Room  But in the days that followed she found herself looking more and more often at Smith and by March Allison had become almost sure that he had straightened a bit  come out of what the doctors called his prefetal position a little Not much just a little She thought of mentioning it to someone but in the end did not After all she was only an aide little more than kitchen help It really wasnt her place It was a dream he guessed He was in a dark gloomy place  a hallway of some kind The ceiling was too high to see It was lost in the shadows The walls were dark chromed steel They opened out as they went upward He was alone but a voice floated up to where he stood as if from a great distance A voice he knew words that had been spoken to him in another place at another time The voice frightened him It was groaning and lost echoing back and forth between that dark chromed steel like a trapped bird he remembered from his childhood The bird had flown into his fathers toolshed and hadnt the wit to get back out It had panicked and had gone swooping back and forth cheeping in desperate alarm battering itself against the walls until it had battered itself to death This voice had the same doomed quality as that long ago birds cheeping It was never going to escape this place You plan all your life and you do what you can this spectral voice groaned You never want nothing but the best and the kid comes home with hair down to his asshole and says the president of the United States is a pig A pig Sheeyit I dont Look out he wanted to say He wanted to warn the voice but he was mute Look out for what He didnt know He didnt even know for sure who he was although he had a suspicion that he had once been a teacher or a preacher Jeeeesus The faraway voice screamed Lost voice doomed drowned Jeeeee Silence then Echoes dying away Then in a little while it would start again So after a while  he did not know how long time seemed to have no meaning or relevance in this place  he began to grope his way down the hall calling in return or perhaps only calling in his mind perhaps hoping that he and the owner of the voice could find their way out together perhaps only hoping to give some comfort and receive some in return But the voice kept getting further and further away dimmer and fainter far and wee until it was just an echo of an echo And then it was gone He was alone now walking down this gloomy and deserted hall of shadows And it began to seem to him that it wasnt an illusion or a mirage or a dream  at least not of the ordinary kind It was as if he had entered limbo a weird conduit between the land of the living and that of the dead But toward which end was he moving Things began to come back Disturbing things They were like ghosts that joined him on his walk fell in on either side of him in front of him behind him until they circled him in an eldritch ring  weave a circle round him thrice and touch his eyes with holy dread was that how it went He could almost see them All the whispering voices of purgatory There was a Wheel turning and turning in the night a Wheel of the Future red and black life and death slowing Where had he laid his bet He couldnt remember and he should be able to because the stakes were his existence In and out It had to be one or the other His girl was sick He had to get her home After a while the hallway began to seem brighter At first he thought it was imagination a sort of dream within a dream if that were possible but after an unknown length of time the brightness became too marked to be an illusion The whole experience of the corridor seemed to become less dreamlike The walls drew back until he could barely see them and the dull dark color changed to a sad and misty gray the color of twilight on a warm and overcast March afternoon It began to seem that he was not in a hallway at all anymore but in a room almost in a room separated from it by the thinnest of membranes a sort of placental sac like a baby waiting to be born Now he heard other voices not echoey but dull and thudding like the voices of nameless gods speaking in forgotten tongues Little by little these voices came clearer until he could nearly make out what they were saying He began to open his eyes from time to time or thought he did and he could actually see the owners of those voices bright glowing spectral shapes with no faces at first sometimes moving about the room sometimes bending over him It didnt occur to him to try speaking to them at least not at first It came to him that this might be some sort of afterlife and these bright shapes the shapes of angels The faces like the voices began to come clearer with time He saw his mother once leaning into his field of vision and slowly thundering something totally without meaning into his upturned face His father was there another time Dave Pelsen from school A nurse he came to know he believed her name was Mary or possibly Marie Faces voices coming closer jelling together Something else crept in a feeling that he had changed He didnt like the feeling He distrusted it It seemed to him that whatever the change was it was nothing good It seemed to him that it meant sorrow and bad times He had gone into the darkness with everything and now it felt to him that he was coming out of it with nothing at all  except for some secret strangeness The dream was ending Whatever it had been the dream was ending The room was very real now very close The voices the faces He was going to come into the room And it suddenly seemed to him that what he wanted to do was turn and run  to go back down that dark hallway forever The dark hallway was not good but it was better than this new feeling of sadness and impending loss He turned and looked behind him and yes it was there the place where the rooms walls changed to dark chrome a corner beside one of the chairs where unnoticed by the bright people who came and went the room became a passageway into what he now suspected was eternity The place where that other voice had gone the voice of The cab driver Yes That memory was all there now The cab ride the driver bemoaning his sons long hair bemoaning the fact that his son thought Nixon was a pig Then the headlights breasting the hill a pair on each side of the white line The crash No pain but the knowledge that his thighs had connected with the taximeter hard enough to rip it out of its frame There had been a sensation of cold wetness and then the dark hallway and now this Choose something inside whispered Choose or theyll choose for you theyll rip you out of this place whatever and wherever it is like doctors ripping a baby out of its mothers womb by cesarian section And then Sarahs face came to him  she had to be out there someplace although hers had not been one of the bright faces bending over his She had to be out there worried and scared She was almost his now He felt that He was going to ask her to marry him That feeling of unease came back stronger than ever and this time it was all mixed up with Sarah But wanting her was stronger and he made his decision He turned his back on the dark place and when he looked back over his shoulder later on it had disappeared there was nothing beside the chair but the smooth white wall of the room where he lay Not long after he began to know where the room must be  it was a hospital room of course The dark hallway faded to a dreamy memory never completely forgotten But more important more immediate was the fact that he was John Smith he had a girl named Sarah Bracknell and he had been in a terrible car accident He suspected that he must be very lucky to be alive and he could only hope that all his original equipment was still there and still functioning He might be in Cleaves Mills Community Hospital but he guessed the EMMC was more likely From the way he felt he guessed he had been here for some time  he might have been blacked out for as long as a week or ten days It was time to get going again Time to get going again That was the thought in Johnnys mind when things finally jelled all the way back together and he opened his eyes It was May   Mr Starret had long since gone home with standing orders to walk two miles a day and mend his high cholesterol ways Across the room was an old man engaged in a weary fifteenth round with that alltime heavyweight champ carcinoma He slept the sleep of morphia and the room was otherwise empty It was   PM The TV screen was a drawn green shade Here I am Johnny Smith croaked to no one at all He was shocked by the weakness of his voice There was no calendar in the room and he had no way of knowing that he had been out of it fourandahalf years  The nurse came in some forty minutes later She went over to the old man in the other bed changed his IV feed went into the bathroom and came out with a blue plastic pitcher She watered the old mans flowers There were over half a dozen bouquets and a score of getwell cards standing open on his table and windowsill Johnny watched her perform this homey chore feeling as yet no urge to try his voice again She put the pitcher back and came over to Johnnys bed Going to turn my pillows he thought Their eyes met briefly but nothing in hers changed She doesnt know Im awake My eyes have been open before It doesnt mean anything to her She put her hand on the back of his neck It was cool and comforting and Johnny knew she had three children and that the youngest had lost most of the sight of one eye last Fourth of July A firecracker accident The boys name was Mark She lifted his head flipped his pillow over and settled him back She started to turn away adjusting her nylon uniform at the hips and then turned back puzzled Belatedly thinking that there had been something new in his eyes maybe Something that hadnt been there before She glanced at him thoughtfully started to turn away again and he said Hello Marie She froze and he could hear an ivory dick as her teeth came suddenly and violently together Her hand pressed against her chest just above the swell of her breasts A small gold crucifix hung there myGod she said Youre awake I thought you looked different How did you know my name I suppose I must have heard it It was hard to talk terribly hard His tongue was a sluggish worm seemingly unlubricated by saliva She nodded Youve been coming up for some time now Id better go down to the nurses station and have Dr Brown or Dr Weizak paged Theyll want to know youre back with us But she stayed a moment longer looking at him with a frank fascination that made him uneasy Did I grow a third eye he asked She laughed nervously No of course not Excuse me His eye caught on his own window ledge and his table pushed up against it On the ledge was a faded African violet and a picture of Jesus Christ  it was the sort of picture of Jesus his mother favored with Christ looking as if he was ready to bat deanup for the New York Yankees or something of a similar clean and athletic nature But the picture was yellow Yellow and beginning to curl at the corners Sudden fear dropped over him like a suffocating blanket Nurse he called Nurse In the doorway she turned back Where are my getwell cards Suddenly it was hard for him to breathe That other guys got  didnt anyone send me a card She smiled but it was forced It was the smile of some one who is hiding something Suddenly Johnny wanted her by his bed He would reach out and touch her If he could touch her he would know what she was hiding Ill have the doctor paged she said and left before he could say anything else He looked at the African violet at the aging picture of Jesus baffled and afraid After a little while he drifted off to sleep again  He was awake Marie Michaud said He was completely coherent Okay Dr Brown answered Im not doubting you If he woke up once hell wake up again Probably Its just a matter of Johnny moaned His eyes opened They were blank half rolled up Then he seemed to see Marie and his eyes came into focus He smiled a little But his face was still slack as if only his eyes were awake and the rest of him still slept She had a sudden feeling that he was not looking at her but into her I think hell be okay Johnny said Once they clean that impacted cornea the eyell be as good as new Should be Marie gasped harshly and Brown glanced at her What is it Hes talking about my boy she whispered My Mark No Brown said Hes talking in his sleep thats all Dont make a picture out of an inkblot Nurse Yes Okay But hes not asleep now is he Marie Johnny asked He smiled tentatively I dozed off didnt I Yes Brown said You were talking in your sleep Gave Marie here a turn Were you dreaming Nooo not that I remember What did I say And who are you Im Dr James Brown Just like the soul singer Only Im a neurologist You said I think hell be okay once they clean that impacted cornea I think that was it wasnt it Nurse My boys going to have that operation Marie said My boy Mark I dont remember anything Johnny said I guess I was sleeping He looked at Brown His eyes were clear now and scared I cant lift my arms Am I paralyzed Nope Try your fingers Johnny did They all wiggled He smiled Superfine Brown said Tell me your name John Smith Good and your middle name I dont have one Thats fine who needs one Nurse go down to your station and find out whos in neurology tomorrow Id like to start a whole series of tests on Mr Smith Yes Doctor And you might call Sam Weizak Youll get him at home or at the golf course Yes Doctor And no reporters please  for your life Brown was smiling but serious No of course not She left white shoes squeaking faintly Her little boys going to be just fine Johnny thought Ill be sure to tell her Dr Brown he said where are my getwell cards Didnt anybody send me a card Just a few more questions Dr Brown said smoothly Do you recall your mothers name Of course I do Vera Her maiden name Nason Your fathers name Herbert Herb And why did you tell her no reporters Your mailing address RFD  Pownal Johnny said promptly and then stopped An expression of comic surprise passed across his face I mean  well I live in Cleaves Mills now at  North Main Street Why the hell did I give you my parents address I havent lived there since I was eighteen And how old are you now Look it up on my drivers license Johnny said I want to know why I dont have any getwell cards How long have I been in the hospital anyway And which hospital is this Its the Eastern Maine Medical Center And well get to all the rest of your questions if youll just let me  Brown was sitting by the bed in a chair he had drawn over from the corner  the same corner where Johnny had once seen the passage leading away He was making notes on a clipboard with a type of pen Johnny couldnt remember ever having seen before It had a thick blue plastic barrel and a fibrous tip It looked like the strange hybrid offspring of a fountain pen and a ballpoint Just looking at it made that formless dread come back and without thinking about it Johnny suddenly seized Dr Browns left hand in one of his own His arm moved creakily as if there were invisible sixtypound weights tied to it  a couple below the elbow and a couple above He captured the doctors hand in a weak grip and pulled The funny pen left a thick blue line across the paper Brown looked at him at first only curious Then his face drained of color The sharp expression of interest left his eyes and was replaced with a muddy look of fear He snatched his hand away  Johnny had no power to hold it  and for an instant a look of revulsion crossed the doctors face as if he had been touched by a leper Then it was gone and he only looked surprised and disconcerted What did you do that for Mr Smith His voice faltered Johnnys face had frozen in an expression of dawning comprehension His eyes were the eyes of a man who has seen something terrible moving and shifting in the shadows something too terrible to be described or even named But it was a fact It had to be named Fiftyfive months Johnny asked hoarsely Going on five years No Oh my God no Mr Smith Brown said now totally flustered Please its not good for you to excite Johnny raised his upper body perhaps three inches from the bed and then slumped back his face shiny with sweat His eyes rolled helplessly in their sockets Im twentyseven he muttered Twentyseven Oh my Jesus Brown swallowed and heard an audible dick When Smith had grabbed his hand he had felt a sudden onrush of bad feelings childlike in their intensity crude images of revulsion had assaulted him He had found himself remembering a picnic in the country when he had been seven or eight sitting down and putting his hand in something warm and slippery He had looked around and had seen that he had put his hand into the maggoty remains of a woodchuck that had lain under a laurel bush all that hot August He had screamed then and he felt a little bit like screaming now  except that the feeling was fading dwindling to be replaced with a question How did he know He touched me and he knew  Then twenty years of education rose up strongly in him and he pushed the notion aside There were cases without number of comatose patients who had awakened with a dreamlike knowledge of many of the things that had gone on around them while they were in coma Like anything else coma was a matter of degree Johnny Smith had never been a vegetable his EEG had never gone flatline and if it had Brown would not be talking with him now Sometimes being in a coma was a little like being behind a oneway glass To the beholding eye the patient was completely conked out but the patients senses might still continue to function in some low powerdown fashion And that was the case here of course Marie Michaud came back in Neurology is confirmed and Dr Weizak is on his way I think Sam will have to wait until tomorrow to meet Mr Smith Brown said I want him to have five milligrams of Valium I dont want a sedative Johnny said I want to get out of here I want to know what happened Youll know everything in time Brown said Right now its important that you rest Ive been resting for fourandahalf years Then another twelve hours wont make much difference Brown said inexorably A few moments later the nurse swabbed his upper arm with alcohol and there was the sting of a needle Johnny began to feel sleepy almost at once Brown and the nurse began to look twelve feet tall Tell me one thing at least he said His voice seemed to come from far far away Suddenly it seemed terribly important That pen What do you call that pen This Brown held it out from his amazing height Blue plastic body fibrous tip Its called a Flair Now go to sleep Mr Smith And Johnny did but the word followed him down into his sleep like a mystic incantation full of idiot meaning Flair  Flair  Herb put the telephone down and looked at it He looked at it for a long time From the other room came the sound of the TV turned up almost all the way Oral Roberts was talking about football and the healing love of Jesus there was a connection there someplace but Herb had missed it Because of the telephone call Orals voice boomed and roared Pretty soon the show would end and Oral would dose it out by confidently telling his audience that something good was going to happen to them Apparently Oral was right My boy Herb thought While Vera had prayed for a miracle Herb had prayed for his boy to die It was Veras prayer that had been answered What did that mean and where did it leave him And what was it going to do to her He went into the living room Vera was sitting on the couch Her feet encased in elastic pink mules were up on a hassock She was wearing her old gray robe She was eating popcorn straight from the popper Since Johnnys accident she had put on nearly forty pounds and her blood pressure had skyrocketed The doctor wanted to put her on medication but Vera wouldnt have it  if it was the will of the Lord for her to have the high blood she said then she would have it Herb had once pointed out that the will of the Lord had never stopped her from taking Bufferin when she had a headache She had answered with her sweetest longsuffering smile and her most potent weapon silence Who was on the phone she asked him not looking away from the TV Oral had his arm round the wellknown quarterback of an NFC team He was talking to a hushed multitude The quarterback was smiling modestly  and you have all heard this fine athlete tell you tonight how he abused his body his Temple of God And you have heard Herb snapped it off Herbert Smith  She nearly spilled her popcorn sitting up I was watching That was Johnny woke up  Oral Roberts and The words snapped off in her mouth She seemed to crouch back in her chair as if he had taken a swing at her He looked back unable to say more wanting to feel joy but afraid So afraid Johnnys She stopped swallowed then tried again Johnny our Johnny Yes He spoke with Dr Brown for nearly fifteen minutes Apparently it wasnt that thing they thought  falsewaking after all Hes coherent He can move Johnnys awake Her hands came up to her mouth The popcorn popper half full did a slow dipsydoodle off her lap and thumped to the rug spilling popcorn everywhere Her hands covered the lower half of her face Above them her eyes got wider and wider still until for a dreadful second Herb was afraid that they might fall out and dangle by their stalks Then they dosed A tiny mewing sound came from behind her hands Vera Are you all right O my God I thank You for Your will be done my Johnny You brought me my I knew You would my Johnny  dear God I will bring You my thanksgiving every day of my life for my Johnny Johnny JOHNNY  Her voice was rising to an hysterical triumphant scream He stepped forward grabbed the lapels of her robe and shook her Suddenly time seemed to have reversed doubled back on itself like strange cloth  they might have been back on the night when the news of the accident came to them delivered through that same telephone in that same nook By nook or by crook Herb Smith thought crazily O my precious God my Jesus oh my Johnny the miracle like I said the miracle Stop it Vera Her eyes were dark and hazy and hysterical Are you sorry hes awake again After all these years of making fun of me Of telling people I was crazy Vera I never told anyone you were crazy You told them with your eyes she shouted at him But my God wasnt mocked Was he Herbert Was he No he said I guess not I told you I told you God had a plan for my Johnny Now you see his hand beginning to work She got up Ive got to go to him Ive got to tell him She walked toward the closet where her coat hung seemingly unaware that she was in her robe and nightgown Her face was stunned with rapture In some bizarre and almost blasphemous way she reminded him of the way she had looked on the day they were married Her pink mules crunched popcorn into the rug Vera Ive got to tell him that Gods plan Vera She turned to him but her eyes were far away with her Johnny He went to her and put his hands on her shoulders You tell him that you love him that you prayed waited  watched Who has a better right Youre his mother You bled for him Havent I watched you bleed for him over the last five years Im not sorry hes back with us you were wrong to say that I dont think I can make of it what you do but Im not sorry I bled for him too Did you Her eyes were flinty proud and unbelieving Yes And Im going to tell you something else Vera Youre going to keep your trap shut about God and miracles and Great Plans until Johnnys up on his feet and able to Ill say what I have to say  and able to think what hes doing What Im saying is that youre going to give him a chance to make something of it for himself before you start in on him You have no right to talk to me that way No right at all Im exercising my right as Johnnys dad he said grimly Maybe for the last time in my life And you better not get in my way Vera You understand Not you not God not the bleeding holy Jesus You follow She glared at him sullenly and said nothing Hes going to have enough to do just coping with the idea that hes been out like a light for fourandahalf years We dont know if hell be able to walk again in spite of the therapist that came in We do know therell have to be an operation on his ligaments if he even wants to try Weizak told us that Probably more than one And more therapy and a lot of its going to hurt him like hell So tomorrow youre just going to be his mother Dont you dare talk to me that way Dont you dare If you start sermonizing Vera Ill drag you out of his room by the hair of your head She stared at him whitefaced and trembling Joy and fury were at war in her eyes You better get dressed Herb said We ought to get going It was a long silent ride up to Bangor The happiness they should have felt between them was not there only Veras hot and militant joy She sat bolt upright in the passenger seat her Bible in her lap open to the twentythird Psalm  At quarter of nine the next morning Marie came into Johnnys room and said Your mom and dad are here if youre up to seeing them Yes Id like that He felt much better this morning stronger and less disoriented But the thought of seeing them scared him a little In terms of his conscious recollection he had seen them about five months ago His father had been working on the foundation of a house that had now probably been standing for three years or more His mom had fixed him homebaked beans and apple pie for dessert and had clucked over how thin he was getting He caught Maries hand weakly as she turned to go Do they look all right I mean They look fine Oh Good You can only have half an hour with them now Some more time this evening if the neurology series doesnt prove too tiring Dr Browns orders And Dr Weizaks All right For a while Im not sure how long I want to be poked and prodded Marie hesitated Something Johnny asked No not now You must be anxious to see your folks Ill send them in He waited nervous The other bed was empty the cancer patient had been moved out while Johnny slept off his Valium pop The door opened His mother and father came in Johnny felt simultaneous shock and relief shock because they had aged it was all true relief because the changes in them did not yet seem mortal And if that could be said of them perhaps it could be said of him as well But something in him had changed changed drastically  and it might be mortal That was all he had time to think before his mothers arms were around him her violet sachet strong in his nostrils and she was whispering Thank God Johnny thank God thank God youre awake He hugged her back as best he could his arms still had no power to grip and fell away quickly and suddenly in six seconds he knew how it was with her what she thought and what was going to happen to her Then it was gone fading like that dream of the dark corridor But when she broke the embrace to look at him the look of zealous joy in her eyes had been replaced with one of thoughtful consideration The words seemed to come out of him of their own Let them give you the medicine Mom Thats best Her eyes widened she wet her lips and then Herb was beside her his eyes filled with tears He had lost some weight  not as much as Vera had put on but he was noticeably thinner His hair was going fast but the face was the same homely and plain and wellloved He took a large brakemans bandanna from his back pocket and wiped his eyes with it Then he stuck out his hand Hi son he said Good to have you back Johnny shook his fathers hand as well as he could his pale and strengthless fingers were swallowed up in his fathers red hand Johnny looked from one to the other his mother in a bulky powderblue pantsuit his father in a really hideous houndstooth jacket that looked as if it should belong to a vacuumcleaner salesman in Kansas and he burst into tears Im sorry he said Im sorry its just that You go on Vera said sitting on the bed beside him Her face was calm and clear now There was more mother than madness in it You go on and cry sometimes thats best And Johnny did  Herb told him his Aunt Germaine had died Vera told him that the money for the Pownal Community Hall had finally been raised and the building had commenced a month ago as soon as the frost was out of the ground Herb added that he had put in a bid but he guessed honest work cost too dear for them to want to pay Oh shush you sore loser Vera said There was a little silence and then Vera spoke again I hope you realize that your recovery is a miracle of God Johnny The doctors despaired In Matthew chapter nine we read Vera Herb said warningly Of course it was a miracle Mom I know that You you do Yes And I want to talk about it with you hear your ideas about what that means  just as soon as I get on my feet again She was staring at him openmouthed Johnny glanced past her at his father and their eyes met for a moment Johnny saw great relief in his fathers eyes Herb nodded imperceptibly A Conversion Vera ejaculated loudly My boy has had a Conversion Oh praise God Vera hush Herb said Best to praise God in a lower voice when youre in the hospital I dont see how anybody could not call it a miracle Mom And were going to talk about it a lot Just as soon as Im out of here Youre going to come home she said Back to the house where you were raised Ill nurse you back to health and well pray for understanding He was smiling at her but holding the smile was an effort You bet Mom would you go down to the nurses station and ask Marie if I can have some juice Or maybe some ginger ale I guess Im not used to talking and my throat Of course I will She kissed his cheek and stood up Oh youre so thin But Ill fix that when I get you home She left the room casting a single victorious glance at Herb as she went They heard her shoes tapping off down the hall How long has she been that way Johnny asked quietly Herb shook his head Its come a little at a time since your accident But it had its start long before that You know You remember Is she I dont know There are people down South that handle snakes Id call them crazy She doesnt do that How are you Johnny Really I dont know Johnny said Daddy wheres Sarah Herb leaned forward and clasped his hands between his knees I dont like to tell you this John but Shes married She got married Herb didnt answer Without looking directly at Johnny he nodded his head Oh God Johnny said hollowly I was afraid of that Shes been Mrs Walter Hazlett for going on three years Hes a lawyer They have a baby boy John no one really believed you were going to wake up Except for your mother of course None of us had any reason to believe you would wake up His voice was trembling now hoarse with guilt The doctors said  ah never mind what they said Even I gave you up I hate like hell to admit it but its true All I can ask you is try to understand about me and Sarah He tried to say that he did understand but all that would come out was a sickly sort of croak His body felt sick and old and suddenly he was drowning in his sense of loss The lost time was suddenly sitting on him like a load of bricks  a real thing not just a vague concept Johnny dont take on There are other things Good things Its  going to take some getting used to he managed Yeah I know Do you ever see her We write back and forth once in a while We got acquainted after your accident Shes a nice girl real nice Shes still teaching at Cleaves but I understand she is getting done this June Shes happy John Good he said thickly Im glad someone is Son I hope youre not telling secrets Vera Smith said brightly coming back into the room She had an iceclogged pitcher in one hand They said you werent ready for fruit juice Johnny so I brought you the ginger ale Thats fine Mom She looked from Herb to Johnny and back to Herb again Have you been telling secrets Why the long faces I was just telling Johnny hes going to have to work hard if he wants to get out of here said Herb Lots of therapy Now why would you want to talk about that now She poured ginger ale into Johnnys glass Everythings going to be fine now Youll see She popped a flexible straw into the glass and handed it to him Now you drink all of it she said smiling Its good for you Johnny did drink all of it It tasted bitter Close your eyes Dr Weizak said He was a small rolypoly man with an incredible styled head of hair and spade sideburns Johnny couldnt get over all that hair A man with a haircut like that in  would have had to fight his way out of every bar in eastern Maine and a man Weizaks age would have been considered ripe for committal All that hair Man He closed his eyes His head was covered with electrical contact points The contacts went to wires that fed into a wallconsole EEG Dr Brown and a nurse stood by the console which was calmly extruding a wide sheet of graph paper Johnny wished the nurse could have been Marie Michaud He was a little scared Dr Weizak touched his eyelids and Johnny jerked Nuh  hold still Johnny These are the last two Just there All right Doctor the nurse said A low hum All right Johnny Are you comfortable Feels like there are pennies on my eyelids Yes Youll get used to that in no time Now let me explain to you this procedure I am going to ask you to visualize a number of things You will have about ten seconds on each and there are twenty things to visualize in all You understand Yes Very fine We begin Dr Brown All ready Excellent Johnny I ask you to see a table On this table there is an orange Johnny thought about it He saw a small cardtable with folding steel legs Resting on it a little offcenter was a large orange with the word SUNKIST stamped on its pocky skin Good Weizak said Can that gadget see my orange Nuh  well yes in a symbolic way it can The machine is tracing your brainwaves We are searching for blocks Johnny Areas of impairment Possible indications of continuing intercranial pressure Now I ask you to shush with the questions All right Now I ask you to see a television It is on but not receiving a station Johnny saw the TV that was in his apartment  had been in his apartment The screen was bright gray with snow The tips of the rabbit ears were wrapped with tinfoil for better reception Good The series went on For the eleventh item Weizak said Now I ask you to see a picnic table on the left side of a green lawn Johnny thought about it and in his mind he saw a lawn chair He frowned Something wrong Weizak asked No not at all Johnny said He thought harder Picnics Weiners a charcoal brazier  associate dammit associate How hard can it be to see a picnic table in your mind youve only seen a thousand of them in your life associate your way to it Plastic spoons and forks paper plates his father in a chefs hat holding a long fork in one hand and wearing an apron with a motto printed across it in tipsy letters THE COOK NEEDS A DRINK His father making burgers and then they would all go sit at the Ah here it came Johnny smiled and then the smile faded This time the image in his mind was of a hammock Shit No picnic table Its the weirdest thing I cant quite  seem to think of it I mean I know what it is but I cant see it in my mind Is that weird or is that weird Never mind Try this one a globe of the world sitting on the hood of a pickup truck That one was easy On the nineteenth item a rowboat lying at the foot of a street sign who thinks these things up Johnny wondered it happened again It was frustrating He saw a beachball lying beside a gravestone He concentrated harder and saw a turnpike overpass Weizak soothed him and a few moments later the wires were removed from his head and eyelids Why couldnt I see those things he asked his eyes moving from Weizak to Brown Whats the problem Hard to say with any real certainty Brown said It may be a kind of spot amnesia Or it may be that the accident destroyed a small portion of your brain  and I mean a really microscopic bit We dont really know what the problem is but its pretty obvious that youve lost a number of trace memories We happened to strike two Youll probably come across more Weizak said abruptly You sustained a head injury when you were a child yes Johnny looked at him doubtfully There is an old scar Weizak said There is a theory Johnny backed by a good deal of statistical research Research that is nowhere near complete Brown said almost primly That is true But this theory supposes that the people who tend to recover from longterm coma are people who have sustained some sort of brain injury at a previous time it is as though the brain has made some adaptation as the result of the first injury that allows it to survive the second Its not proven Brown said He seemed to disapprove of Weizak even bringing it up The scar is there Weizak said Can you not remember what happened to you Johnny I would guess you must have blacked out Did you fall down the stairs A bicycle accident perhaps The Scar says this happened to a young boy Johnny thought hard then shook his head Have you asked my mom and dad Neither of them can remember any sort of head injury nothing occurs to you For a moment something did  a memory of smoke black and greasy and smelling like rubber Cold Then it was gone Johnny shook his head Weizak sighed then shrugged You must be tired Yes A little bit Brown sat on the edge of the examination table Its quarter of eleven Youve worked hard this morning Dr Weizak and I will answer a few questions if you like then you go up to your room for a nap Okay Okay Johnny said The pictures you took of my brain  The CATscan Weizak nodded Computerized Axial Tomography He took a box of Chidets and shook three of them into his mouth The CATscan is really a series of brain Xrays Johnny The computer highlights the pictures and What did it tell you How long have I got What is this how long have I got stuff Brown asked It sounds like a line from an old movie Ive heard that people who come out of longterm comas dont always last so long Johnny said They lapse back Its like a light bulb going really bright before it burns out for good Weizak laughed hard It was a hearty bellowing laugh and it was something of a wonder that he didnt choke on his gum Oh such melodrama He put a hand on Johnnys chest You think Jim and I are babies in this field Nuh We are neurologists What you Americans call highpriced talent Which means we are only stupid about the functions of the human brain instead of outandout ignoramuses So I tell you yes there have been lapsebacks But you will not lapse I think we can say that Jim yes okay Yes Brown said We havent been able to find very much in the way of significant impairment Johnny theres a guy in Texas who was in a coma for nine years Now hes a bank loan officer and hes been doing that job for six years Before that he was a teller for two years Theres a woman in Arizona who was down for twelve years Something went wrong with the anesthesia while she was in labor Now shes in a wheelchair but shes alive and aware She came out of it in  and met the baby she had delivered twelve years before The baby was in the seventh grade and an honors student Am I going to be in a wheelchair Johnny asked I cant straighten my legs out My arms are a little better but my legs He trailed off shaking his head The ligaments shorten Weizak said Yes Thats why comatose patients begin to pull into what we call the prefetal position But we know more about the physical degeneration that occurs in coma than we used to we are better at holding it off You have been exercised regularly by the hospital physical therapist even in your sleep And different patients react to coma in different ways Your deterioration has been quite slow Johnny As you say your arms are remarkably responsive and able But there has been deterioration Your therapy will be long and should I lie to you Nuh I dont think so It will be long and painful You will shed your tears You may come to hate your therapist You may come to fall in love with your bed And there will be operations  only one if you are very very lucky but perhaps as many as four  to lengthen those ligaments These operations are still new They may succeed completely partially or not at all And yet as God wills it I believe you will walk again I dont believe you will ever ski or leap hurdles but you may run and you will certainly swim Thank you Johnny said He felt a sudden wave of affection for this man with the accent and the strange haircut He wanted to do something for Weizak in return  and with that feeling came the urge almost the need to touch him He reached out suddenly and took Weizaks hand in both of his own The doctors hand was big deeply lined warm Yes Weizak said kindly And what is this And suddenly things changed It was impossible to say how Except that suddenly Weizak seemed very clear to him Weizak seemed to  to stand forth outlined in a lovely clear light Every mark and mole and line on Weizaks face stood in relief And every line told its own story He began to understand I want your wallet Johnny said My   Weizak and Brown exchanged a startled glance Theres a picture of your mother in your wallet and I need to have it Johnny said Please How did you know that Please Weizak looked into Johnnys face for a moment and then slowly dug under his smock and produced an old Lord Buxton bulgy and out of shape How did you know I carry a picture of my mother She is dead she died when the Nazis occupied Warsaw Johnny snatched the wallet from Weizaks hand Both he and Brown looked stunned Johnny opened it dismissed the plastic picturepockets and dug in the back instead his fingers hurrying past old business cards receipted bills a canceled check an old ticket to some political function He came up with a small snapshot that had been laminated in plastic The picture showed a young woman her features plain her hair drawn back under a kerchief Her smile was radiant and youthful She held the hand of a young boy Beside her was a man in the uniform of the Polish army Johnny pressed the picture between his hands and closed his eyes and for a moment there was darkness and then rushing out of the darkness came a wagon  no not a wagon a hearse A horsedrawn hearse The lamps had been muffled in black sacking Of course it was a hearse because they were dying by the hundreds yes by the thousands no match for the panzers the wehrmacht nineteenthcentury cavalry against the tanks and machine guns explosions screaming dying men a horse with its guts blown out and its eyes rolling wildly showing the white an overturned cannon behind it and still they come weizak comes standing in his stirrups his sword held high in the slanting rain of late summer  his men following him stumbling through the mud the turret gun of the nazi tiger tank tracks him braces him brackets him fires and suddenly he is gone below the waist the sword flying out of his hand and down the road is warsaw the nazi wolf is loose in europe Really we have to put a stop to this Brown said his voice faraway and worried Youre overexciting yourself Johnny The voices came from far away from a hallway in time Hes put himself in some kind of trance Weizak said Hot in here He was sweating He was sweating because the citys on fire thousands are fleeing a truck is roaring from side to side down a cobbled street and the back of the truck is full of waving German soldiers in coalscuttle helmets and the young woman is not smiling now she is fleeing no reason not to flee the child has been sent away to safety and now the truck jumps the curb the mudguard strikes her shattering her hip and sending her flying through a plate glass window and into a clock shop and everything begins to chime chime because of the time the chime time is Six oclock Johnny said thickly His eyes had rolled up to straining bulging whites September   and all the cuckoo birds are singing Oh my God what is it we have Weizak whispered The nurse had backed up against the EEG console her face pale and scared Everyone is scared now because death is in the air Its always in the air in this place this hospital smell of ether theyre screaming in the place of death poland is dead poland has fallen before the lightning warfare wehrmacht blitzkreig shattered hip the man in the next bed calling for water calling calling calling she remembers THE BOY IS SAFE what boy she doesnt know what boy what is her name she doesnt remember only that The boy is safe Johnny said thickly Uhhuh Uhhuh We have to put a stop to this Brown repeated How do you suggest we do that Weizak asked his voice brittle It has gone too far to Voices fading The voices are under the clouds Everything is under the clouds Europe is under the clouds of war Everything is under the clouds but the peaks the mountain peaks of switzerland switzerland and now her name is BORENTZ her name is JOHANNA BORENTZ and her husband is an engineer or an architect whichever it is that builds the bridges he builds in switzerland and there is goats milk goats cheese a baby ooooh the labor the labor is terrible and she needs drugs morphine this JOHANNA BORENTZ because of the hip the broken hip it has mended it has gone to sleep but now it awakes and begins to scream as her pelvis spreads to let the baby out one baby two and three and four they dont come all at once no  they are a harvest of years they are The babies Johnny lilted and now he spoke in a womans voice not his own voice at all It was the voice of a woman Then gibberish in song came from his mouth What in the name of God Brown began Polish it is Polish Weizak cried His eyes were bulging his face pale It is a cradle song and it is in Polish my God my Christ what is it we have here Weizak leaned forward as if to cross the years with Johnny as if to leap them as if to bridge a bridge its in turkey then a bridge somewhere hot in the far east is it Laos cant tell lost a man there we lost HANS there then a bridge in virginia a bridge over the RAPPAHANNOCK RIVER and another bridge in california we are applying for citizenship now and we go to classes in a hot little room in the back of a postoffice where it always smells of glue it is  november and when we hear kennedy has been killed in dallas we weep and when the little boy salutes his dead fathers coffin she thinks THE BOY IS SAFE and it brings back memories of some burning some great burning and sorrow what boy she dreams about the boy it makes her head hurt and the man dies HELMUT BORENTZ dies and she and the children live in carmel california in a house on on on cant see the street sign its in the dead zone like the rowboat like the picnic table on the lawn its in the dead zone like warsaw the children go away she goes to their graduation ceremonies one by one and her hip hurts one dies in vietnam the rest of them are fine one of them is building bridges her name is JOHANNA BORENTZ and late at night alone now she sometimes thinks in the ticking darkness THE BOY IS SAFE Johnny looked up at them His head felt strange That peculiar light around Weizak had gone He felt like himself again but weak and a little pukey He looked at the picture in his hands for a moment and then handed it back Johnny Brown said Are you all right Tired he muttered Can you tell us what happened to you He looked at Weizak Your mother is alive he said No Johnny She died many years ago In the war A German trooptruck knocked her through a plateglass show window and into a dock shop Johnny said She woke up in a hospital with amnesia She had no identification no papers She took the name Johanna somebody I didnt get that but when the war was over she went to Switzerland and married a Swiss engineer I think His specialty was building bridges and his name was Helmut Borentz So her married name was  is Johanna Borentz The nurses eyes were getting bigger and bigger Dr Browns face was tight either because he had decided Johnny was having them all on or perhaps just because he didnt like to see his neat schedule of tests disrupted But Weizaks face was still and thoughtful She and Helmut Borentz had four children Johnny said in that same calm washedout voice His job took him all over the world He was in Turkey for a while Somewhere in the Far East Laos I think maybe Cambodia Then he came here Virginia first then some other places I didnt get finally California He and Johanna became US citizens Helmut Borentz is dead One of the children they had is also dead The others are alive and fine But she dreams about you sometimes And in the dreams she thinks the boy is safe But she doesnt remember your name Maybe she thinks its too late California Weizak said thoughtfully Sam Dr Brown said Really you mustnt encourage this Where in California John Carmel By the sea But I couldnt tell which street It was there but I couldnt tell It was in the dead zone Like the picnic table and the rowboat But shes in Carmel California Johanna Borentz Shes not old No of course she would not be old Sam Weizak said in that same thoughtful distant tone She was only twentyfour when the Germans invaded Poland Dr Weizak I have to insist Brown said harshly Weizak seemed to come out of a deep study He looked around as if noticing his younger colleague for the first time Of course he said Of course you must And John has had his questionandanswer period  although I believe he has told us more than we have told him Thats nonsense Brown said curtly and Johnny thought Hes scared Scared spitless Weizak smiled at Brown and then at the nurse She was eyeing Johnny as if he were a tiger in a poorly built cage Dont talk about this Nurse Not to your supervisor your mother your brother your lover or your priest Understood Yes Doctor the nurse said But shell talk Johnny thought and then glanced at Weizak And he knows it He slept most of the afternoon Around four PM he was rolled down the corridor to the elevator taken down to neurology and there were more tests Johnny cried He seemed to have very little control over the functions adults are supposed to be able to control On his way back up he urinated on himself and had to be changed like a baby The first but far from the last wave of deep depression washed over him carried him limply away and he wished himself dead Selfpity accompanied the depression and he thought how unfair this was He had done a Rip van Winkle He couldnt walk His girl had married another man and his mother was in the grip of a religious mania He couldnt see anything ahead that looked worth living for Back in his room the nurse asked him if he would like anything If Marie had been on duty Johnny would have asked for ice water But she had gone off at three No he said and rolled over to face the wall After a little while he slept His father and mother came in for an hour that evening and Vera left a bundle of tracts Were going to stay until the end of the week Herb said and then if youre still doing fine well be going back to Pownal for a while But well be back up every weekend I want to stay with my boy Vera said loudly Its best that you dont Mom Johnny said The depression had lifted a little bit but he remembered how black it had been If his mother started to talk about Gods wonderful plan for him while he was in that state he doubted if he would be able to hold back his cackles of hysterical laughter You need me John You need me to explain First I need to get well Johnny said You can explain after I can walk Okay She didnt answer There was an almost comically stubborn expression on her face  except there was nothing very funny about it Nothing at all Nothing but a quirk of fate thats all Five minutes earlier or later on that road would have changed everything Now look at us all of us fucked over royally And she believes its Gods plan Its either that or go completely crazy I suppose To break the awkward silence Johnny said Well did Nixon get reelected dad Who ran against him He got reelected Herb said He ran against McGovern Who McGovern George McGovern Senator from South Dakota Not Muskie No But Nixons not president anymore He resigned What He was a liar Vera said dourly He became swollen with pride and the Lord brought him low Nixon resigned Johnny was flabbergasted Him It was either quit or be fired Herb said They were getting ready to impeach him Johnny suddenly realized that there had been some great and fundamental upheaval in American politics almost surely as a result of the war in Vietnam  and he had missed it For the first time he really felt like Rip van Winkle How much had things changed He was almost afraid to ask Then a really chilling thought occurred Agnew Agnews president Ford Vera said A good honest man Henry Ford is president of the United States Not Henry she said Jerry He stared from one to the other more than half convinced that all this was a dream or a bizarre joke Agnew resigned too Vera said Her lips were pressed thin and white He was a thief He accepted a bribe right in his office Thats what they say He didnt resign over the bribe Herb said He resigned over some mess back in Maryland He was up to his neck in it I guess Nixon nominated Jerry Ford to become vice president Then Nixon resigned last August and Ford took over He nominated Nelson Rockefeller to be vice president And thats where we are now A divorced man Vera said grimly God forbid he ever becomes the president What did Nixon do Johnny asked Jesus Christ I He glanced at his mother whose brow had clouded instantly I mean holy crow if they were going to impeach him You neednt take the Saviors name in vain over a bunch of crooked politicians Vera said It was Watergate Watergate Was that an operation in Vietnam Something like that The Watergate Hotel in Washington Herb said Some Cubans broke into the offices of the Democratic Committee there and got caught Nixon knew about it He tried to cover it up Are you kidding Johnny managed at last It was the tapes Vera said And that John Dean Nothing but a rat deserting a sinking ship thats what I think A common tattletale Daddy can you explain this to me Ill try Herb said but I dont think the whole story has come out even yet And Ill bring you the books Theres been about a million books written on it already and I guess therell be a million more before its finally done Just before the election in the summer of   It was tenthirty and his parents were gone The lights on the ward had been dimmed Johnny couldnt sleep It was all dancing around in his head a frightening jumble of new input The world had changed more resoundingly than he would have believed possible in so short a time He felt out of step and out of tune Gas prices had gone up nearly a hundred percent his father had told him At the time of his accident you could buy regular gas for thirty or thirtytwo cents a gallon Now it was fiftyfour cents and sometimes there were lines at the pumps The legal speed limit all over the country was fiftyfive miles an hour and the longhaul truckers had almost revolted over that But all of that was nothing Vietnam was over It had ended The country had finally gone Communist Herb said it had happened just as Johnny began to show signs that he might come out of his coma After all those years and all that bloodshed the heirs of Uncle Ho had rolled up the country like a windowshade in a matter of days The president of the United States had been to Red China Not Ford but Nixon He had gone before he resigned Nixon of all people the old witchhunter himself If anyone but his dad had told him that Johnny would have flatly refused to believe It was all too much it was too scary Suddenly he didnt want to know any more for fear it might drive him totally crazy That pen Dr Brown had had that Flair how many other things were there like that How many hundreds of little things all of them making the point over and over again You lost part of your life almost six percent if the actuarial tables are to be believed Youre behind the times You missed out John The voice was soft Are you asleep John He turned over A dim silhouette stood in his doorway A small man with rounded shoulders It was Weizak No Im awake I hoped so May I come in Yes Please do Weizak looked older tonight He sat by Johnnys bed I was on the phone earlier he said I called directory assistance for Carmel California I asked for a Mrs Johanna Borentz Do you think there was such a number Unless its unlisted Qr she doesnt have a phone at all Johnny said She has a phone I was given the number Ah Johnny said He was interested because he liked Weizak but that was all He felt no need to have his knowledge of Johanna Borentz validated because he knew it was valid knowledge  he knew it the same way he knew he was righthanded I sat for a long time and thought about it Weizak said I told you my mother was dead but that was really only an assumption My father died in the defense of Warsaw My mother simply never turned up huh It was logical to assume that she had been killed in the shelling during the occupation  you understand She never turned up so it was logical to assume that Amnesia  as a neurologist I can tell you that permanent general amnesia is very very rare Probably rarer than true schizophrenia I have never read of a documented case lasting thirtyfive years She recovered from her amnesia long ago Johnny said I think she simply blocked everything out When her memory did come back she had remarried and was the mother of two children possibly three Remembering became a guilt trip maybe But she dreams of you The boy is safe Did you call her Yes Weizak said I dialed it direct Did you know you could do that now Yes It is a great convenience You dial one the area code the number Eleven digits and you can be in touch with any place in the country It is an amazing thing In some ways a frightening thing A boy  no a young man  answered the telephone I asked if Mrs Borentz was at home I heard him call Mom its for you Clunk went the receiver on the table or desk or whatever I stood in Bangor Maine not forty miles from the Atlantic Ocean and listened to a young man put the phone down on a table in a town on the Pacific Ocean My heart  it was pounding so hard it frightened me The wait seemed long Then she picked up the phone and said Yes Hello What did you say How did you handle it I did not as you say handle it Weizak replied and smiled crookedly I hung up the telephone And I wished for a strong drink but I did not have one Are you satisfied it was her John what a naive question I was nine years old in I had not heard my mothers voice since then She spoke only Polish when I knew her I speak only English now  I have forgotten much of my native language which is a shameful thing How could I be satisfied one way or the other Yes but were you Weizak scrubbed a hand slowly across his forehead Yes he said It was her It was my mother But you couldnt talk to her Why should I Weizak asked sounding almost angry Her life is her life huh It is as you said The boy is safe Should I upset a woman that is just coming into her years of peace Should I take the chance of destroying her equilibrium forever Those feelings of guilt you mentioned  should I set them free Or even run the risk of so doing I dont know Johnny said They were troublesome questions and the answers were beyond him  but he felt that Weizak was trying to say something about what he had done by articulating the questions The questions he could not answer The boy is safe the woman is safe in Carmel The country is between them and we let that be But what about you John What are we going to do about you I dont understand what you mean I will spell it out for you then huh Dr Brown is angry He is angry at me angry at you and angry at himself I suspect for halfbelieving something he has been sure is total poppycock for his whole life The nurse who was a witness will never keep her silence She will tell her husband tonight in bed and it may end there but her husband may tell his boss and it is very possible that the papers will have wind of this by tomorrow evening Coma Patient ReAwakens with Second Sight Second sight Johnny said Is that what it is I dont know what it is not really Is it psychic Seer Handy words that describe nothing nothing at all You told one of the nurses that her sons optic surgery was going to be successful Marie Johnny murmured He smiled a little He liked Marie  and that is already all over the hospital Did you see the future Is that what second sight is I dont know You put a picture of my mother between your hands and were able to tell me where she lives today Do you know where lost things and lost people may be found Is that what second sight is I dont know Can you read thoughts Influence objects of the physical world Heal by the laying on of hands These are all things that some call psychic They are all related to the idea of second sight They are things that Dr Brown laughs at Laughs No He doesnt laugh He scoffs And you dont I think of Edgar Cayce And Peter Hurkos I tried to tell Dr Brown about Hurkos and he scoffed He doesnt want to talk about it he doesnt want to know about it Johnny said nothing So what are we going to do about you Does something need to be done I think so Weizak said He stood up Ill leave you to think it out for yourself But when you think think about this some things are better not seen and some things are better lost than found He bade Johnny good night and left quietly Johnny was very tired now but still sleep did not come for a long time Johnnys first surgery was scheduled for May  Both Weizak and Brown had explained the procedure carefully to him He would be given a local anesthetic  neither of them felt a general could be risked This first operation would be on his knees and ankles His own ligaments which had shortened during his long sleep would be lengthened with a combination of plastic wonderfibers The plastic to be used was also employed in heart valve bypass surgery The question was not so much one of his bodys acceptance or rejection of the artificial ligaments Brown told him as it was a question of his legs ability to adjust to the change if they had good results with the knees and the ankles three more operations were on the boards one on the long ligaments of his thighs one on the elbowtrap ligaments and possibly a third on his neck which he could barely turn at all The surgery was to be performed by Raymond Ruopp who had pioneered the technique He was flying in from San Francisco What does this guy Ruopp want with me if hes such a superstar Johnny asked Superstar was a word he had learned from Marie She had used it in connection with a balding bespectacled singer with the unlikely name of Elton John Youre underestimating your own superstar qualities Brown answered There are only a handful of people in the United States who have recovered from comas as long as yours was And of that handful your recovery from the accompanying brain damage has been the most radical and pleasing Sam Weizak was more blunt Youre a guinea pig huh What Yes Look into the light please Weizak shone a light into the pupil of Johnnys left eye Did you know I can look right at your optic nerve with this thing Yes The eyes are more than the windows of the soul They are one of the brains most crucial maintenance points Guinea pig Johnny said morosely staring into the savage point of light Yes The light snapped off Dont feel so sorry for yourself Many of the techniques to be employed in your behalf  and some of those already employed  were perfected during the Vietnam war No shortage of guinea pigs in the VA hospitals nuh A man like Ruopp is interested in you because you are unique Here is a man who has slept fourandahalf years Can we make him walk again An interesting problem He sees the monograph he will write on it for The New England Journal of Medicine He looks forward to it the way a child looks forward to new toys under the Christmas tree He does not see you he does not see Johnny Smith in his pain Johnny Smith who must take the bedpan and ring for the nurse to scratch if his back itches Thats good His hands will not shake Smile Johnny This Ruopp looks like a bank clerk but he is maybe the best surgeon in North America But it was hard for Johnny to smile He had read his way dutifully through the tracts his mother had left him They depressed him and left him frightened all over again for her sanity One of them by a man named Salem Kirban struck him as nearly pagan in its loving contemplation of a bloody apocalypse and the yawning barbecue pits of hell Another described the coming Antichrist in pulphorror terms The others were a dark carnival of craziness Christ was living under the South Pole God drove flying saucers New York was Sodom LA was Gomorrah They dealt with exorcism with witches with all manner of things seen and unseen It was impossible for him to reconcile the pamphlets with the religious yet earthy woman he had known before his coma Three days after the incident involving Weizaks snapshot of his mother a slim and darkhaired reporter from the Bangor Daily News named David Bright showed up at the door of Johnnys room and asked if he could have a short interview Have you asked the doctors Johnny asked Bright grinned Actually no All right Johnny said In that case Id be happy to talk to you Youre a man after my own heart Bright said He came in and sat down His first questions were about the accident and about Johnnys thoughts and feelings upon slipping out of the coma and discovering he had misplaced nearly half a decade Johnny answered these questions honestly and straightforwardly Then Bright told him that he had heard from a source that Johnny had gained some sort of sixth sense as a result of the accident Are you asking me if Im psychic Bright smiled and shrugged Thatll do for a start Johnny had thought carefully about the things Weizak had said The more he thought the more it seemed to him that Weizak had done exactly the right thing when he hung up the phone without saying anything Johnny had begun to associate it in his mind with that W W Jacobs story The Monkeys Paw The paw was for wishing but the price you paid for each of your three wishes was a black one The old couple had wished for one hundred pounds and had lost their son in a mill accident  the mills compensation had come to exactly one hundred pounds Then the old woman had wished for her son back and he had come  but before she could open the door and see what a horror she had summoned out of its grave the old man had used the last wish to send it back As Weizak had said maybe some things were better lost than found No he said Im no more psychic than you are According to my source you No it isnt true Bright smiled a trifle cynically seemed to debate pressing the matter further then turned to a fresh page in his notebook He began to ask about Johnnys prospects for the future his feelings about the road back and Johnny also answered these questions as honestly as he could So what are you going to do when you get out of here Bright asked closing his notebook I havent really thought about that Im still trying to adjust to the idea that Gerald Ford is the president Bright laughed Youre not alone in that my friend I suppose Ill go back to teaching Its all I know But right now thats too far ahead to think about Bright thanked him for the interview and left The artide appeared in the paper two days later the day before his leg surgery It was on the bottom of the front page and the headline read JOHN SMITH MODERN RIP VAN WINKLE FACES LONG ROAD BACK There were three pictures one of them Johnnys picture for the Cleaves Mills High School yearbook it had been taken barely a week before the accident a picture of Johnny in his hospital bed looking thin and twisted with his arms and legs in their bent positions Between these two was a picture of the almost totally demolished taxi lying on its side like a dead dog There was no mention in Brights artide of sixth senses precognitive powers or wild talents How did you turn him off the ESP angle Weizak asked him that evening Johnny shrugged He seemed like a nice guy Maybe he didnt want to stick me with it Maybe not Weizak said But he wont forget it Not if hes a good reporter and I understand that he is You understand I asked around Looking out for my best interests We all do what we can nuh Are you nervous about tomorrow Johnny Not nervous no Scared is a more accurate word Yes of course you are I would be Will you be there Yes in the observation section of the operating theater You wont be able to tell me from the others in my greens but I will be there Wear something Johnny said Wear something so Ill know its you Weizak looked at him and smiled All right Ill pin my watch to my tunic Good Johnny said What about Dr Brown Will he be there Dr Brown is in Washington Tomorrow he will present you to the American Society of Neurologists I have read his paper It is quite good Perhaps overstated You werent invited Weizak shrugged I dont like to fly That is something that scares me And maybe you wanted to stay here Weizak smiled crookedly spread his hands and said nothing He doesnt like me much does he Johnny asked Dr Brown No not much Weizak said He thinks you are having us on Making things up for some reason of your own Seeking attention perhaps Dont judge him solely on that John His cast of mind makes it impossible for him to think otherwise if you feel anything for Jim feel a little pity He is a brilliant man and he will go far Already he has offers and someday soon he will fly from these cold north woods and Bangor will see him no more He will go to Houston or Hawaii or possibly even to Paris But he is curiously limited He is a mechanic of the brain He has cut it to pieces with his scalpel and found no soul Therefore there is none Like the Russian astronauts who circled the earth and did not see God It is the empiricism of the mechanic and a mechanic is only a child with superior motor control You must never tell him I said that No And now you must rest Tomorrow you have a long day  All Johnny saw of the worldfamous Dr Ruopp during the operation was a pair of thick hornrimmed glasses and a large wen at the extreme left side of the mans forehead The rest of him was capped gowned and gloved Johnny had been given two preop injections one of demerol and one of atropine and when he was wheeled in he was as high as a kite The anesthetist approached with the biggest novocaine needle Johnny had ever seen in his life He expected that the injection would hurt and he was not wrong He was injected between L and L the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae high enough up to avoid the cauda equina that bundle of nerves at the base of the spine that vaguely resembles a horses tail Johnny lay on his stomach and bit his arm to keep from screaming After an endless time the pain began to fade to a dull sensation of pressure Otherwise the lower half of his body was totally gone Ruopps face loomed over him The green bandit Johnny thought Jesse James in hornrims Your money or your life Are you comfortable Mr Smith Ruopp asked Yes But Id just as soon not go through that again You may read magazines if you like Or you may watch in the mirror if you feel it will not upset you All right Nurse give me a blood pressure please Onetwenty over seventysix Doctor Thats lovely Well group shall we begin Save me a drumstick Johnny said weakly and was surprised by the hearty laughter Ruopp patted his sheetcovered shoulder with one thinly gloved hand He watched Ruopp select a scalpel and disappear behind the green drapes hung over the metal hoop that curved above Johnny The mirror was convex and Johnny had a fairly good if slightly distorted view of everything Oh yes Ruopp said Oh yes deededee  heres what we want  humdehum okay  damp please Nurse come on wake up for Christs sake  yes sir  now I believe Id like one of those no hold it dont give me what I ask for give me what I need  yes okay Strap please With forceps the nurse handed Ruopp something that looked like a bundle of thin wires twisted together Ruopp picked them delicately out of the air with tweezers Like an Italian dinner Johnny thought and look at all that spaghetti sauce That was what made him feel ill and he looked away Above him in the gallery the rest of the bandit gang looked down at him Their eyes looked pale and merciless and frightening Then he spotted Weizak third from the right his watch pinned neatly to the front of his gown Johnny nodded Weizak nodded back That made it a little better  Ruopp finished the connections between his knees and calves and Johnny was turned over Things continued The anesthesiologist asked him if he felt all right Johnny told her he thought he felt as well as possible under the circumstances She asked him if he would like to listen to a tape and he said that would be very nice A few moments later the dear sweet voice of Joan Baez filled the operating room Ruopp did his thing Johnny grew sleepy and dozed off When he woke up the operation was still going on Weizak was still there Johnny raised one hand acknowledging his presence and Weizak nodded again  An hour later it was done He was wheeled into a recovery room where a nurse kept asking him if he could tell her how many of his toes she was touching After a while Johnny could Ruopp came in his bandits mask hanging off to one side All right he asked Yes It went very well Ruopp said Im optimistic Good Youll have some pain Ruopp said Quite a lot of it perhaps The therapy itself will give you a lot of pain at first Stick with it Stick with it Johnny muttered Good afternoon Ruopp said and left Probably Johnny thought to play a quick nine on the local golf course before it got too dark  Quite a lot of pain By nine PM the last of the local had worn off and Johnny was in agony He was forbidden to move his legs without the help of two nurses It felt as if nailstudded belts had been looped around his knees and then cinched cruelly tight Time slowed to an inchworms crawl He would glance at his watch sure that an hour had passed since the last time he had looked at it and would see instead that it had only been four minutes He became sure he couldnt stand the pain for another minute then the minute would pass and he would be sure he couldnt stand it for another minute He thought of all the minutes stacked up ahead like coins in a slot five miles high and the blackest depression he had ever known swept over him in a smooth solid wave and carried him down They were going to torture him to death Operations on his elbows thighs his neck Therapy Walkers wheelchairs canes Youre going to have pain  stick with it No you stick with it Johnny thought Just leave me alone Dont come near me again with your butchers knives If this is your idea of helping I want no part of it Steady throbbing pain digging into the meat of him Warmth on his belly trickling He had wet himself Johnny Smith turned his face toward the wall and cried  Ten days after that first operation and two weeks before the next one was scheduled Johnny looked up from the book he was reading  Woodward and Bernsteins All the Presidents Men  and saw Sarah standing in the doorway looking at him hesitantly Sarah he said It is you isnt it She let out her breath shakily Yes Its me Johnny He put the book down and looked at her She was smartly dressed in a lightgreen linen dress and she held a small brown clutch bag in front of her like a shield She had put a streak in her hair and it looked good It also made him feel a sharp and twisting stab of jealousy had it been her idea or that of the man she lived and slept with She was beautiful Come in he said Come in and sit down She crossed the room and suddenly he saw himself as she must see him  too thin his body slumped a little to one side in the chair by the window his legs stuck out straight on the hassock dressed in a johnny and a cheap hospital bathrobe As you can see I put on my tux he said You look fine She kissed his cheek and a hundred memories shuffled brightly through his mind like a doubled pack of cards She sat in the other chair crossed her legs and tugged at the hem of her dress They looked at each other without saying anything He saw that she was very nervous If someone were to touch her on the shoulder she would probably spring right out of her seat I didnt know if I should come she said but I really wanted to Im glad you did Like strangers on a bus he thought dismally Its got to be more than this doesnt it So howre you doing she asked He smiled Ive been in the war Want to see my battle scars He raised his gown over his knees showing the Sshaped incisions that were now beginning to heal They were still red and hashmarked with stitches Oh my Lord what are they doing to you Theyre trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again Johnny said All the kings horses all the kings men and all the kings doctors So I guess And then he stopped because she was crying Dont say it like that Johnny she said Please dont say it like that Im sorry It was just  I was trying to joke about it Was that it Had he been trying to laugh it off or had it been a way of saying Thanks for coming to see me theyre cutting me to pieces Can you Can you joke about it She had gotten a Kleenex from the clutch bag and was wiping her eyes with it Not very often I guess seeing you again  the defenses go up Sarah Are they going to let you out of here Eventually Its like running the gauntlet in the old days did you ever read about that If Im still alive after every Indian in the tribe has had a swing at me with his tomahawk I get to go free This summer No I I dont think so Im so sorry it happened she said so low he could barely hear her I try to figure out why or how things could have changed  and it just robs me of sleep if I hadnt eaten that bad hot dog  if you had stayed instead of going back She shook her head and looked at him her eyes red It seems sometimes theres no percentage Johnny smiled Double zero House spin Hey you remember that I clobbered that Wheel Sarah Yes You won over five hundred dollars He looked at her still smiling but now the smile was puzzled wounded almost You want to know something funny My doctors think maybe the reason I lived was because I had some sort of head injury when I was young But I couldnt remember any and neither could my mom and dad But it seems like every time I think of it I flash on that Wheel of Fortune  and a smell like burning rubber Maybe you were in a car accident she began doubtfully No I dont think thats it But its like the Wheel was my warning and I ignored it She shifted a little and said uneasily Dont Johnny He shrugged Or maybe it was just that I used up four years of luck in one evening But look at this Sarah Carefully painfully he took one leg off the hassock bent it to a ninety degree angle then stretched it out on the hassock again Maybe they can put Humpty back together again When I woke up I couldnt do that and I couldnt get my legs to straighten out as much as they are now either And you can think Johnny she said You can talk We all thought that you know Yeah Johnny the turnip A silence fell between them again awkward and heavy Johnny broke it by saying with forced brightness So hows by you Well Im married I guess you knew that Dad told me Hes such a fine man Sarah said And then in a burst I couldnt wait Johnny Im sorry about that too The doctors said youd never come out of it that youd get lower and lower until you just just slipped away And even if I had known  She looked up at him with an uneasy expression of defense on her face Even if I had known Johnny I dont think I could have waited Fourandahalf years is a long time Yeah it is he said Thats a hell of a long time You want to hear something morbid I got them to bring me four years worth of news magazines just so I could see who died Truman Janis Joplin Jimi Hendrix  Jesus I thought of him doing Purple Haze and I could hardly believe it Dan Blocker And you and me We just slipped away I feel so bad about it she said nearly whispering So damn guilty But I love the guy Johnny I love him a lot Okay thats what matters His name is Walt Hazlett and hes a I think Id rather hear about your kid Johnny said No offense huh Hes a peach she said smiling Hes seven months old now His name is Dennis but we call him Denny Hes named after his paternal grandfather Bring him in sometime Id like to see him I will Sarah said and they smiled at each other falsely knowing that nothing of the kind was ever going to happen Johnny is there anything that you need Only you babe And the last fourandahalf years back again Nah he said You still teachin Still teachin for a while yet she agreed Still snortin that wicked cocaine Oh Johnny you havent changed Same old tease Same old tease he agreed and the silence fell between them again with an almost audible thump Can I come see you again Sure he said That would be fine Sarah He hesitated not wanting it to end so inconclusively not wanting to hurt her or himself if it could be avoided Wanting to say something honest Sarah he said you did the right thing Did I she asked She smiled and it trembled at the corners of her mouth I wonder It all seems so cruel and  I cant help it so wrong I love my husband and my baby and when Walt says that someday were going to be living in the finest house in Bangor I believe him He says someday hes going to run for Bill Cohens seat in the House and I believe that too He says someday someone from Maine is going to be elected president and I can almost believe that And I come in here and look at your poor legs She was beginning to cry again now They look like they went through a Mixmaster or something and youre so thin  No Sarah dont Youre so thin and it seems wrong and cruel and I hate it I hate it because it isnt right at all none of it Sometimes nothing is right I guess he said Tough old world Sometimes you just have to do what you can and try to live with it You go and be happy Sarah Ann if you want to come and see me come on and come Bring a cribbage board I will she said Im sorry to cry Not very cheery for you huh Its all right he said and smiled You want to get off that cocaine baby Your nosell fall off She laughed a little Same old Johnny she said Suddenly she bent and kissed his mouth h Johnny be well soon He looked at her thoughtfully as she drew away Johnny You didnt leave it he said No you didnt leave it at all Leave what She was frowning in puzzlement Your wedding ring You didnt leave it in Montreal He had put his hand up to his forehead and was rubbing the patch of skin over his right eye with his fingers His arm cast a shadow and she saw with something very like superstitious fear that his face was halflight halfdark It made her think of the Halloween mask he had scared her with She and Walt had honeymooned in Montreal but how could Johnny know that Unless maybe Herb had told him Yes that was almost certainly it But only she and Walt knew that she had lost her wedding ring somewhere in the hotel room No one else knew because he had bought her another ring before they flew home She had been too embarrassed to tell anyone even her mother How Johnny frowned deeply then smiled at her His hand fell away from his forehead and clasped its mate in his lap It wasnt sized right he said You were packing dont you remember Sarah He was out buying something and you were packing He was out buying buying dont know Its in the dead zone Dead zone He went out to a novelty shop and bought a whole bunch of silly stuff as souvenirs Whoopee cushions and things like that But Johnny how could you know I lost my r You were packing The ring wasnt sized right it was a lot too big You were going to have it taken care of when you got back But in the meantime you  That puzzled frown began to return then cleared immediately He smiled at her You stuffed it with toilet paper There was no question about the fear now It was coiling lazily in her stomach like cold water Her hand crept up to her throat and she stared at him nearly hypnotized Hes got the same look in his eyes that same cold amused look that he had when he was beating the Wheel that night Whats happened to you Johnny What are you The blue of his eyes had darkened to a near violet and he seemed far away She wanted to run The room itself seemed to be darkening as if he were somehow tearing the fabric of reality pulling apart the links between past and present It slipped off your finger he said You were putting his shaving stuff into one of those side pockets and it just sllipped off You didnt notice youd lost it until later and so you thought it was somewhere in the room He laughed and it was a high tinkling tripping sound  not like Johnnys usual laugh at all  but cold  cold Boy you two turned that room upside down But you packed it Its still in that suitcase pocket All this time You go up in the attic and look Sarah Youll see In the corridor outside someone dropped a water glass or something and cursed in surprise when it broke Johnny glanced toward the sound and his eyes cleared He looked back saw her frozen wideeyed face and frowned with concern What Sarah did I say something wrong How did you know she whispered How could you know those things I dont know he said Sarah Im sorry if I Johnny I ought to go Dennys with the sitter All right Sarah Im sorry I upset you How could you know about my ring Johnny He could only shake his head  Halfway down the firstfloor corridor her stomach began to feel strange She found the ladies just in time She hurried in dosed the door of one of the stalls and threw up violently She flushed and then stood with her eyes closed shivering but also close to laughter The last time she had seen Johnny she had thrown up too Rough justice Brackets in time like bookends She put her hands over her mouth to stifle whatever might be trying to get out  laughter or maybe a scream And in the darkness the world seemed to tilt irrationally like a dish Like a spinning Wheel of Fortune  She had left Denny with Mrs Labelle so when she got home the house was silent and empty She went up the narrow stairway to the attic and turned the switch that controlled the two bare dangling light bulbs Their luggage was stacked up in one corner the Montreal travel stickers still pasted to the sides of the orange Grants suitcases There were three of them She opened the first felt through the elasticized side pouches and found nothing Likewise the second Likewise the third She drew in a deep breath and then let it out feeling foolish and a little disappointed  but mostly relieved Overwhelmingly relieved No ring Sorry Johnny But on the other hand Im not sorry at all It would have been just a little bit too spooky She started to slide the suitcases back into place between a tall pile of Walts old college texts and the floor lamp that crazy womans dog had knocked over and which Sarah had never had the heart to throw out And as she dusted off her hands preparatory to putting the whole thing behind her a small voice far inside her whispered almost too low to hear Sort of a flying search wasnt it Didnt really want to find anything did you Sarah No No she really hadnt wanted to find anything And if that little voice thought she was going to open all those suitcases again it was crazy She was fifteen minutes in picking up Denny Walt was bringing home one of the senior partners in his firm for dinner a very big deal and she owed Bettye Hackman a letter  from the Peace Corps in Uganda Bettye had gone directly into marriage with the son of a staggeringly rich Kentucky horse breeder Also she ought to dean both bathrooms set her hair and give Denny a bath There was really too much to do to be frigging around up in this hot dirty attic So she pulled all three suitcases open again and this time she searched the side pockets very carefully and tucked all the way down in the corner of the third suitcase she found her wedding ring She held it up to the glare of one of the naked bulbs and read the engraving inside still as fresh as it had been on the day Walt slipped the ring on her finger WALTER AND SARAH HAZLETT  JULY   Sarah looked at it for a long time Then she put the suitcases back turned off the lights and went back downstairs She changed out of the linen dress which was now streaked with dust and into slacks and a light top She went down the block to Mrs Labelles and picked up her son They went home and Sarah put Denny in the living room where he crawled around vigorously while she prepared the roast and peeled some potatoes With the roast in the oven she went into the living room and saw that Denny had gone to sleep on the rug She picked him up and put him in his crib Then she began to dean the toilets And in spite of everything in spite of the way the dock was racing toward dinnertime her mind never left the ring Johnny had known She could even pinpoint the moment he had come by this knowledge When she had kissed him before leaving Just thinking about him made her feel weak and strange and she wasnt sure why It was all mixed up His crooked smile so much the same his body so terribly changed so light and undernourished the lifeless way his hair lay against his scalp contrasting so blindingly with the rich memories she still held of him She had wanted to kiss him Stop it she murmured to herself Her face in the bathroom mirror looked like a strangers face Flushed and hot and lets face it gang sexy Her hand dosed on the ring in the pocket of her slacks and almost  but not quite  before she was aware of what she was going to do she had thrown it into the clean slightly blue water of the toilet bowl All sparkly clean so that if Mr Treaches of Baribault Treaches Moorehouse and Gendron had to take a leak sometime during the dinner party he wouldnt be offended by any unsightly ring around the bowl who knows what roadblocks may stand in the way of a young man on his march toward the counsels of the mighty right Who knows anything in this world It made a tiny splash and sank slowly to the bottom of the dear water turning lazily over and over She thought she heard a small clink when it struck the porcelain at the bottom but that was probably just imagination Her head throbbed The attic had been hot and stale and musty But Johnnys kiss  that had been sweet So sweet Before she could think about what she was doing and thus allow reason to reassert itself she reached out and flushed the toilet It went with a bang and a roar It seemed louder maybe because her eyes were squeezed shut When she opened them the ring was gone It had been lost and now it was lost again Suddenly her legs felt weak and she sat down on the edge of the tub and put her hands over her face Her hot hot face She wouldnt go back and see Johnny again It wasnt a good idea It had upset her Walt was bringing home a senior partner and she had a bottle of Mondavi and a budgetfracturing roast those were the things she would think about She should be thinking about how much she loved Walt and about Denny asleep in his crib She should think about how once you made your choices in this crazy world you had to live with them And she would not think about Johnny Smith and his crooked charming smile anymore  The dinner that night was a great success The doctor put Vera Smith on a bloodpressure drug called Hydrodiural It didnt lower her blood pressure much not a dimes worth she was fond of writing in her letters but it did make her feel sick and weak She had to sit down and rest after vacuuming the floor Climbing a flight of stairs made her stop at the top and pant like a doggy on a hot August afternoon If Johnny hadnt told her it was for the best she would have thrown the pills out the window right then The doctor tried her on another drug and that made her heart race so alarmingly that she did stop taking it This is a trialanderror procedure the doctor said Well get you fixed up eventually Vera Dont worry I dont worry Vera said My faith is in the Lord God Yes of course it is Just as it should be too By the end of June the doctor had settled on a combination of Hydrodiural and another drug called Aldomet fat yellow expensive pills nasty things When she started taking the two drugs together it seemed like she had to make water every fifteen minutes She had headaches She had heart palpitations The doctor said her blood pressure was down into the normal range again but she didnt believe him What good were doctors anyway Look what they were doing to her Johnny cutting him up like butchers meat three operations already he looked like a monster with stitches all over his arms and legs and neck and he still couldnt get around without one of those walkers like old Mrs Sylvester had to use If her blood pressure was down why did she feel so crummy all the time Youve got to give your body time enough to get used to the medication Johnny said It was the first Saturday in July and his parents were up for the weekend Johnny had just come back from hydrotherapy and he looked pale and haggard In each hand he held a small lead ball and he was raising them and then lowering them into his lap as they talked flexing his elbows building up his biceps and triceps The healing scars which ran like slashmarks across his elbows and forearms expanded and contracted Put your faith in God Johnny Vera said Theres no need of all this foolishness Put your faith in God and hell help you Vera Herb began Dont you Vera me This is foolishness Doesnt the Bible say ask and it shall be given knock and it shall be opened unto you Theres no need for me to take that evil medicine and no need for my boy to let those doctors go on torturing him Its wrong its not helping and its sinful Johnny put the balls of lead shot on the bed The muscles in his arms were trembling He felt sick to his stomach and exhausted and suddenly furious at his mother The Lord helps those who help themselves he said You dont want the Christian God at all Mom You want a magic genie thats going to come out of a bottle and give you three wishes Johnny Well its true Those doctors put that idea in your head All of these crazy ideas I Her lips were trembling her eyes wide but tearless God brought you out of that coma to do his will John These others theyre just Just trying to get me back on my feet so I wont have to do Gods will from a wheelchair the rest of my life Lets not have an argument Herb said Families shouldnt argue And hurricanes shouldnt blow but they do every year and nothing he could say was going to stop this It had been coming If you put your trust in God Johnny Vera began taking no notice of Herb at all I dont trust anything anymore Im sorry to hear you say that she said Her voice was stiff and distant Satans agents are everywhere Theyll try to turn you from your destiny Looks like they are getting along with it real well You have to make some kind of of eternal thing out of it dont you Ill tell you what it was it was a stupid accident a couple of kids were dragging and I just happened to get turned into dog meat You know what I want Mom I want to get out of here Thats all I want And I want you to go on taking your medicine and and try to get your feet back on the ground Thats all I want Im leaving She stood up Her face was pale and drawn Ill pray for you Johnny He looked at her helpless frustrated and unhappy His anger was gone He had taken it out on her Keep taking your medicine he said I pray that youll see the light She left the room her face set and as grim as stone Johnny looked helplessly at his father John I wish you hadnt done that Herb said Im tired It doesnt do a thing for my judgment Or my temper Yeah Herb said He seemed about to say more and didnt Is she still planning to go out to California for that flying saucer symposium or whatever it is Yes But she may change her mind You never know from one day to the next and its still a month away You ought to do something Yeah What Put her away Commit her Johnny shook his head I dont know But maybe its time you thought about that seriously instead of just acting like its out of the question Shes sick You have to see that Herb said loudly She was all right before you Johnny winced as if slapped Look Im sorry John I didnt mean that Okay Dad No I really didnt Herbs face was a picture of misery Look I ought to go after her Shes probably leafleting the hallways by now Okay Johnny just try to forget this and concentrate on getting well She does love you and so do I Dont be hard on us No Its all right dad Herb kissed Johnnys cheek I have to go after her All right Herb left When they were gone Johnny got up and tottered the three steps between his chair and the bed Not much But something A start He wished more than his father knew that he hadnt blown up at his mother like that He wished it because an odd sort of certainty was growing in him that his mother was not going to live much longer  Vera stopped taking her medication Herb talked to her then cajoled finally demanded It did no good She showed him the letters of her correspondents in Jesus most of them scrawled and full of misspellings all of them supporting her stand and promising to pray for her One of them was from a lady in Rhode Island who had also been at the farm in Vermont waiting for the end of the world along with her pet Pomeranian Otis GOD is the best medicine this lady wrote ask GOD and YOU WILL BE HEALED not DRS who OSURP the POWER of GOD it is DRS who have caused all the CANCER in this evil world with there DEVILS MEDDLING anyone who has had SURGERY for instance even MINOR like TONSILS OUT sooner or later they will end up with CANCER this is a proven fact so ask GOD pray GOD merge YOUR WILL with HIS WILL and YOU WILL BE HEALED Herb talked to Johnny on the phone and the next day Johnny called his mother and apologized for being so short with her He asked her to please start taking the medicine again  for him Vera accepted his apology but refused to go back to the medication If God needed her treading the earth then he would see she continued to tread it If God wanted to call her home he would do that even if she took a barrel of pills a day It was a seamless argument and Johnnys only possible rebuttal was the one that Catholics and Protestants alike have rejected for eighteen hundred years that God works His will through the mind of man as well as through the spirit of man Momma he said havent you thought that Gods will was for some doctor to invent that drug so you could live longer Cant you even consider that idea Long distance was no medium for theological argument She hung up The next day Marie Michaud came into Johnnys room put her head on his bed and wept Here here Johnny said startled and alarmed Whats this Whats wrong My boy she said still crying My Mark They operated on him and it was just like you said Hes fine Hes going to see out of his bad eye again Thank God She hugged Johnny and he hugged her back as best he could With her warm tears on his own cheek he thought that whatever had happened to him wasnt all bad Maybe some things should be told or seen or found again It wasnt even so farfetched to think that God was working through him although his own concept of God was fuzzy and illdefined He held Marie and told her how glad he was He told her to remember that he wasnt the one who had operated on Mark and that he barely remembered what it was that he had told her She left shortly after that drying her eyes as she went leaving Johnny alone to think  Early in August Dave Pelsen came to see Johnny The Cleaves Mills High assistant principal was a small neat man who wore thick glasses and Hush Puppies and a series of loud sports jackets Of all the people who came to see Johnny during that almost endless summer of  Dave had changed the least The gray was speckled a little more fully through his hair but that was all So how are you doing Really Dave asked when they had finished the amenities Not so bad Johnny said I can walk alone now if I dont overdo it I can swim six laps in the pool I get headaches sometimes real killers but the doctors say I can expect that to go on for some time Maybe the rest of my life Mind a personal question If youre going to ask me if I can still get it up Johnny said with a grin thats affirmative Thats good to know but what I wanted to know about is the money Can you pay for this Johnny shook his head Ive been in the hospital for going on five years No one but a Rockefeller could pay for that My father and mother got me into some sort of statefunded program Total Disaster or something like that Dave nodded The Extraordinary Disaster program I figured that But how did they keep you out of the state hospital Johnny That place is the pits Dr Weizak and Dr Brown saw to that And theyre largely responsible for my having been able to come back as far as I have I was a  a guinea pig Dr Weizak says How long can we keep this comatose man from turning into a total vegetable The physical therapy unit was working on me the last two years I was in coma I had megavitamin shots  my ass still looks like a case of smallpox Not that they expected any return on the project from me personally I was assumed to be a terminal case almost from the time I came in Weizak says that what he and Brown did with me is aggressive life support He thinks its the beginning of a response to all the criticism about sustaining life after hope of recovery is gone Anyway they couldnt continue to use me if Id gone over to the state hospital so they kept me here Eventually they would have finished with me and then I would have gone to the state hospital Where the most sophisticated care you would have gotten would have been a turn every six hours to prevent bedsores Dave said And if youd waked up in  you would have been a basket case I think I would have been a basket case no matter what Johnny said He shook his head slowly I think if someone proposes one more operation on me Ill go nuts And Im still going to have a limp and Ill never be able to turn my head all the way to the left When are they letting you out In three weeks God willing Then what Johnny shrugged Im going down home I guess To Pownal My mothers going to be in California for a while on a  a religious thing Dad and I can use the time to get reacquainted I got a letter from one of the big literary agents in New York well not him exactly but one of his assistants They think there might be a book in what happened to me I thought Id try to do two or three chapters and an outline maybe this guy or his assistants can sell it The money would come in pretty damn handy no kidding there Has there been any other media interest Well the guy from the Bangor Daily News who did that original story Bright Hes good Hed like to come down to Pownal after I blow this joint and do a feature story I like the guy but right now Im holding him off Theres no money in it for me and right now frankly thats what Im looking for Id go on To Tell the Truth if I thought I could make two hundred bucks out of it My folks savings are gone They sold their car and bought a clunker Dad took a second mortgage on the house when he should have been thinking about retiring and selling it and living on the proceeds Have you thought about coming back into teaching Johnny glanced up Is that an offer It aint chopped liver Im grateful Johnny said But Im just not going to be ready in September Dave I wasnt thinking about September You must remember Sarahs friend Anne Strafford Johnny nodded Well shes Anne Beatty now and shes going to have a baby in December So we need an English teacher second semester Light schedule Four classes one senior study hall two free periods Are you making a firm offer Dave Firm Thats pretty damn good of you Johnny said hoarsely Hell with that Dave said easily You were a pretty damn good teacher Can I have a couple of weeks to think it over Until the first of October if you want Dave said Youd still be able to work on your book I think If it looks like there might be a possibility there Johnny nodded And you might not want to stay down there in Pownal too long Dave said You might find it  uncomfortable Words rose to Johnnys lips and he had to choke them off Not for long Dave You see my mothers in the process of blowing her brains out right now Shes just not using a gun Shes going to have a stroke Shell be dead before Christmas unless my father and I can persuade her to start taking her medicine again and I dont think we can And Im a part of it  how much of a part I dont know I dont think I want to know Instead he replied News travels huh Dave shrugged I understand through Sarah that your mother has had problems adjusting Shell come around Johnny In the meantime think about it I will In fact Ill give you a tentative yes right now It would be good to teach again To get back to normal Youre my man Dave said After he left Johnny lay down on his bed and looked out the window He was very tired Get back to normal Somehow he didnt think that was ever really going to happen He felt one of his headaches coming on  The fact that Johnny Smith had come out of his coma with something extra finally did get into the paper and it made page one under David Brights byline It happened less than a week before Johnny left the hospital He was in physical therapy lying on his back on a floorpad Resting on his belly was a twelvepound medicine ball His physical therapist Eileen Magown was standing above him and counting off situps He was supposed to do ten of them and he was currently struggling over number eight Sweat was streaming down his face and the healing scars on his neck stood out bright red Eileen was a small homely woman with a whipcord body a nimbus of gorgeous frizzy red hair and deep green eyes flecked with hazel Johnny sometimes called her  with a mixture of irritation and amusement  the worlds smallest Marine DI She had ordered and cajoled and demanded him back from a bedfast patient who could barely hold a glass of water to a man who could walk without a cane do three chinups at a time and do a complete turn around the hospital pool in fiftythree seconds  not Olympic time but not bad She was unmarried and lived in a big house on Center Street in Oldtown with her four cats She was slatehard and she wouldnt take no for an answer Johnny collapsed backward Nope he panted Oh I dont think so Eileen Up boy she cried in high and sadistic good humor Up Up Just three more and you can have a Coke Give me my tenpound ball and Ill give you two more That tenpound ball is going into the Guinness Book of Records as the worlds biggest suppository if you dont give me three more Up Urrrrrrgrah Johnny cried jerking through number eight He flopped back down then jerked up again Great Eileen cried One more one more OOOOARRRRRRRRUNCH Johnny screamed and sat up for the tenth time He collapsed to the mat letting the medicine ball roil away I ruptured myself are you happy all my guts just came loose theyre floating around inside me Ill sue you you goddam harpy Jeez what a baby Eileen said offering him her hand This is nothing compared to what Ive got on for next time Forget it Johnny said All I Im gonna do next time is swim in the He looked at her an expression of surprise spreading over his face His grip tightened on her hand until it was almost painful Johnny Whats wrong Is it a charley horse Oh gosh Johnny said mildly Johnny He was still gripping her hand looking into her face with a faraway dreamy contemplation that made her feel nervous She had heard things about Johnny Smith rumors that she had disregarded with her own brand of hardheaded pragmatism There was a story that he had predicted Marie Michauds boy was going to be all right even before the doctors were one hundred percent sure they wanted to try the risky operation Another rumor had something to do with Dr Weizak it was said Johnny had told him his mother was not dead but living someplace on the West Coast under another name As far as Eileen Magown was concerned the stories were so much eyewash on a par with the confession magazines and sweetsavage love stories so many nurses read on station But the way he was looking at her now made her feel afraid It was as if he was looking inside her Johnny are you okay They were alone in the physical therapy room The big double doors with the frosted glass panels which gave on the pool area were closed Gosh sakes Johnny said You better  yes theres still time Just about What are you talking about He snapped out of it then He let go of her hand but he had gripped it tightly enough to leave white indentations along the back Call the fire department he said You forgot to turn off the burner The curtains are catching on fire What The burner caught the dish towel and the dish towel caught the curtains Johnny said impatiently Hurry up and call them Do you want your house to burn down Johnny you cant know Never mind what you cant know Johnny said grabbing her elbow He got her moving and they walked across to the doors Johnny was limping badly on his left leg as he always did when he was tired They crossed the room that housed the swimming pool their heels clacking hollowly on the tiles then went out into the first floor hallway and down to the nurses station Inside two nurses were drinking coffee and a third was on the phone telling someone on the other end how she had redone her apartment Are you going to call or should I Johnny asked Eileens mind was in a whirl Her morning routine was as set as a single persons is apt to be She had gotten up and boiled herself a single egg while she ate a whole grapefruit unsweetened and a bowl of AllBran After breakfast she had dressed and driven to the hospital Had she turned off the burner Of course she had She couldnt specifically remember doing it but it was habit She must have Johnny really I dont know where you got the idea Okay I will They were in the nurses station now a glassed in booth furnished with three straightbacked chairs and a hot plate The little room was dominated by the callboard rows of small lights that flashed red when a patient pushed his call button Three of them were flashing now The two nurses went on drinking their coffee and talking about some doctor who had turned up drunk at Benjamins The third was apparently talking with her beautician Pardon me I have to make a call Johnny said The nurse covered the phone with her hand Theres a pay phone in the lob Thanks Johnny said and took the phone out of her hand He pushed for one of the open lines and dialed  He got a busy signal Whats wrong with this thing Hey The nurse who had been talking to her beautician cried What the hell do you think youre doing Give me that Johnny remembered that he was in a hospital with its own switchboard and dialed  for an outside line Then he redialed the  The deposed nurse her cheeks flaming with anger grabbed for the phone Johnny pushed her away She whirled saw Eileen and took a step toward her Eileen whats with this crazy guy she asked stridently The other two nurses had put down their coffee cups and were staring gapemouthed at Johnny Eileen shrugged uncomfortably I dont know he just Operator Operator I want to report a fire in Oldtown Johnny said Can you give me the correct number to call please Hey one of the nurses said Whose house is on fire Eileen shifted her feet nervously He says mine is The nurse who had been talking about her apartment to her beautician did a double take Oh my God its that guy she said Johnny pointed at the callboard where five or six lights were flashing now Why dont you go see what those people want The operator had connected him with the Oldtown Fire Department My name is John Smith and I need to report a fire Its at He looked at Eileen Whats your address For a moment Johnny didnt think she was going to tell him Her mouth worked but nothing came out The two coffee drinkers had now forsaken their cups and withdrawn to the stations far corner They were whispering together like little girls in a grammar school john Their eyes were wide Sir the voice on the other end asked Come on Johnny said do you want your cats to fry  Center Street Eileen said reluctantly Johnny youve wigged out Johnny repeated the address into the phone Its in the kitchen Your name sir John Smith Im calling from the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor May I ask how you came by your information Wed be on the phone the rest of the day My information is correct Now go put it out He banged the phone down  and he said Sam Weizaks mother was still She broke off and looked at Johnny For a moment he felt all of them looking at him their eyes lying on his skin like tiny hot weights and he knew what would come of this and it made his stomach turn Eileen he said What Do you have a friend next door Yes Burt and Janice are next door Either of them home I guess Janice probably would be sure Why dont you give her a call Eileen nodded suddenly understanding what he was getting at She took the phone from his hand and dialed an  exchange number The nurses stood by watching avidly as if they had stepped into a really exciting TV program by accident Hello Jan Its Eileen Are you in your kitchen  Would you take a look out your window and tell me if everything looks well all right over at my place  Well a friend of mine says  Ill tell you after you go look okay Eileen was blushing Yes Ill wait She looked at Johnny and repeated Youve wigged out Johnny There was a pause that seemed to go on and on Then Eileen began listening again She listened for a long time and then said in a strange subdued voice totally unlike her usual one No thats all right Jan Theyve been called No  I cant explain right now but Ill tell you later She looked at Johnny Yes it is funny how I could have known  but I can explain At least I think I can Goodbye She hung up the telephone They all looked at her the nurses with avid curiosity Johnny with only dull certainty Jan says theres smoke pouring out of my kitchen window Eileen said and all three nurses sighed in unison Their eyes wide and somehow accusing turned to Johnny again Jurys eyes he thought dismally I ought to go home Eileen said The aggressive cajoling positive physical therapist was gone replaced by a small woman who was worried about her cats and her house and her things I dont know how to thank you Johnny  Im sorry I didnt believe you but She began to weep One of the nurses moved toward her but Johnny was there first He put an arm around her and led her out into the hall You really can Eileen whispered What they said You go on Johnny said Im sure its going to be fine Theres going to be some minor smoke and water damage and thats all That movie poster from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid I think youre going to lose that but thats all Yes okay Thank you Johnny God bless you She kissed him on the cheek and then began to trot down the hall She looked back once and the expression on her face was very much like superstitious dread The nurses were lined up against the glass of the nurses station staring at him Suddenly they reminded him of crows on a telephone line crows staring down at something bright and shiny something to be pecked at and pulled apart Go on and answer your calls he said crossly and they flinched back at the sound of his voice He began to limp up the hall toward the elevator leaving them to start the gossip on its way He was tired His legs hurt His hip joints felt as if they had broken glass in them He wanted to go to bed What are you going to do Sam Weizak asked Christ I dont know Johnny said How many did you say are down there About eight One of them is the northern New England AP stringer And there are people from two of the TV stations with cameras and lights The hospital director is quite angry with you Johnny He feels you have been naughty Because a ladys house was going to burn down Johnny asked All I can say is it must have been one frigging slow news day As a matter of fact it wasnt Ford vetoed two bills The PLO blew up a restaurant in Tel Aviv And a police dog sniffed out four hundred pounds of marijuana at the airport Then what are they doing here Johnny asked When Sam had come in with the news that reporters were gathering in the lobby his first sinking thought was what his mother might make of this She was with his father in Pownal making ready for her California pilgrimage which began the following week Neither Johnny nor his father believed the trip was a good idea and the news that her son had somehow turned psychic might make her cancel it but in this case Johnny was very much afraid that the cure might be the greater of two evils Something like this could set her off for good On the other hand  this thought suddenly blossomed in his mind with all the force of inspiration  it might persuade her to start taking her medicine again Theyre here because what happened is news Sam said It has all the classic ingredients I didnt do anything I just You just told Eileen Magown her house was on fire and it was Sam said softly Come on Johnny you must have known this was going to happen sooner or later Im no publicity hound Johnny said grimly No I didnt mean to suggest you were An earthquake is no publicity hound But the reporters cover it People want to know What if I just refuse to talk to them That is not much of an option Sam replied They will go away and publish crazy rumors Then when you leave the hospital they will fall on you They will shove microphones in your face as if you were a senator or a crime boss nuh Johnny thought about it Is Bright down there Yes Suppose I ask him to come up He can get the story and give it to the rest of them You can do that but it would make the rest of them extremely unhappy And an unhappy reporter will be your enemy Nixon made them unhappy and they tore him to pieces Im not Nixon Johnny said Weizak grinned radiantly Thank God he said What do you suggest Johnny asked  The reporters stood up and crowded forward when Johnny stepped through the swing doors and into the west lobby He was wearing a white shirt open at the collar and a pair of blue jeans that were too big for him His face was pale but composed The scars from the tendon operations stoodout clearly on his neck Flashbulbs popped warm fire at him and made him wince Questions were babbled Here Here  Sam Weizak shouted This is a convalescent patient He wants to make a brief statement and he will answer some of your questions but only if you behave in an orderly fashion Now fall back and let him breathe Two sets of TV light bars flashed on bathing the lobby in an unearthly glare Doctors and nurses had gathered by the lounge doorway to watch Johnny winced away from the lights wondering if this was what they meant by the limelight He felt as if all of it might be a dream Whore you one of the reporters yelled at Weizak I am Samuel Weizak this young mans doctor and that name is spelled with two Xs There was general laughter and the mood eased a little Johnny you feel all right Weizak asked It was early evening and his sudden insight that Eileen Magowns kitchen was catching fire seemed distant and unimportant the memory of a memory Sure he said Whats your statement one of the reporters called Well Johnny said its this My physical therapist is a woman named Eileen Magown Shes a very nice lady and shes been helping me get my strength back I was in an accident you see and  One of the TV cameras moved in goggling at him blankly throwing him offstride for a moment  and I got pretty weak My muscles sort of collapsed We were in the physical therapy room this morning just finishing up and I got the feeling that her house was on fire That is to be more specific  Jesus you sound like an asshole I felt that she had forgotten to turn off her stove and that the curtains in the kitchen were about to catch fire So we just went and called the fire department and thats all there was to it There was a moments gaping pause as they digested that  I sort of got the feeling and thats all there was to it  and then the barrage of questions came again everything mixed together into a meaningless stew of human voices Johnny looked around helplessly feeling disoriented and vulnerable One at a time Weizak yelled Raise your hands Were you never schoolchildren Hands waved and Johnny pointed at David Bright Would you call this a psychic experience Johnny I would call it a feeling Johnny answered I was doing situps and I finished Miss Magown took my hand to help me up and I just knew He pointed at someone else Mel Allen Portland Sunday Telegram Mr Smith Was it like a picture A picture in your head No not at all Johnny said but he was not really able to remember what it had been like Has this happened to you before Johnny A young woman in a slacksuit asked Yes a few times Can you tell us about the other incidents No Id rather not One of the TV reporters raised his hand and Johnny nodded at him Did you have any of these flashes before your accident and the resulting coma Mr Smith Johnny hesitated The room seemed very still The TV lights were warm on his face like a tropical sun No he said Another barrage of questions Johnny looked helplessly at Weizak again Stop Stop He bellowed He looked at Johnny as the roar subsided You are done Johnny Ill answer two more questions Johnny said Then really  its been a long day for me  yes Maam He was pointing to a stout woman who had wedged herself in between two young reporters Mr Smith she said in a loud carrying tubalike voice who will be the Democrats nominee for president next year I cant tell you that Johnny said honestly surprised at the question How could I tell you that More hands were raised Johnny pointed to a tall soberfaced man in a dark suit He took one step forward There was something prim and coiled about him Mr Smith Im Roger Dussault from the Lewiston Sun and I would like to know if you have any idea why you should have such an extraordinary ability as this  if indeed you do Why you Mr Smith Johnny cleared his throat As I understand your question  youre asking me to justify something I dont understand I cant do that Not justify Mr Smith Just explain He thinks Im hoaxing them Or trying Weizak stepped up beside Johnny I wonder if I might answer that he said Or at least attempt to explain why it cannot be answered Are you psychic too Dussault asked coldly Yes all neurologists must be its a requirement Weizak said There was a burst of laughter and Dussault flushed Ladies and gentlemen of the press This man spent fourandahalf years in a coma We who study the human brain have no idea why he did or why he came out of it and this is for the simple reason that we do not understand what a coma really is any more than we understand sleep or the simple act of waking Ladies and gentlemen we do not understand the brain of a frog or the brain of an ant You may quote me on these things you see I am fearless nuh More laughter They liked Weizak But Dussault did not laugh You may also quote me as saying I believe this man is now in possession of a very new human ability or a very old one Why If I and my coleagues do not understand the brain of an ant can I tell you why I cannot I can suggest some interesting things to you however things which may or may not have bearing A part of John Smiths brain has been damaged beyond repair  a very small part but all parts of the brain may be vital He calls this his dead zone and there apparently a number of trace memories were stored all of these wiped out memories seem to be part of a set that of street road and highway designations A subset of a larger overall set that of where it is This is a small but total aphasia which seems to include both language and vizualization skills Balancing this off another tiny part of John Smiths brain appears to have awakened A section of the cerebrum within the parietal lobe This is one of the deeply grooved sections of the forward or thinking brain The electrical responses from this section of Smiths brain are way out of line from what they should be nuh Here is one more thing The parietal lobe has something to do with the sense of touch  how much or how little we are not completely sure  and it is very near to that area of the brain that sorts and identifies various shapes and textures And it has been my own observation that Johns flashes are always preceded by some sort of touching Silence Reporters were scribbling madly The TV cameras which had moved in to focus on Weizak now pulled back to include Johnny in the picture Is that it Johnny Weizak asked again I guess Dussault suddenly shouldered his way through the knot of reporters For a bemused moment Johnny thought he was going to join them in front of the doors possibly for the purpose of rebuttal Then he saw that Dussault was slipping something from around his neck Lets have a demonstration he said He was holding a medallion on a finelink gold chain Lets see what you can do with this Well see no such thing Weizak said His bushy saltandpepper eyebrows had drawn thunderously together and he stared down at Dussault like Moses This man is not a carnival performer sir You sure could have fooled me Dussault said Either he can or he cant right While you were busy suggesting things I was busy suggesting something to myself What I was suggesting was that these guys can never perform on demand because theyre all as genuine as a pile of threedollar bills Johnny looked at the other reporters Except for Bright who looked rather embarrassed they were watching avidly They looked like the nurses peering at him through the glass Suddenly he felt like a Christian in a pitful of lions They win either way he thought If I can tell him something theyve got a frontpage story If I cant or if I refuse to try theyve got another kind of story Well Dussault asked The medallion swung back and forth below his fist Johnny looked at Weizak but Weizak was looking away disgusted Give it to me Johnny said Dussault handed it over Johnny put the medallion in his palm It was a St Christopher medal He dropped the finelink chain on top of it in a crisp little yellow heap and closed his hand over it Dead silence fell in the room The handful of doctors and nurses standing by the lounge doorway had been joined by half a dozen others some of them dressed in streetclothes and on their way out of the hospital for the night A crowd of patients had gathered at the end of the hallway leading to the firstfloor TV and game lounge The people who had come for the regular early evening visiting hours had drifted over from the main lobby A feeling of thick tension lay in the air like a humming power cable Johnny stood silently pale and thin in his white shirt and oversized blue jeans The St Christopher medal was clamped so tightly in his right hand that the cords in his wrist stood out dearly in the glare of the TV light bars In front of him sober impeccable and judgmental in his dark suit Dussault stood in the adversary position The moment seemed to stretch out interminably No one coughed or whispered h Johnny said softly  then Is that it His fingers loosened slowly He looked at Dussault Well Dussault asked but the authority was suddenly gone from his voice The tired nervous young man who had answered the reporters questions seemed also to be gone There was a halfsmile on Johnnys lips but there was nothing warm about it The blue of his eyes had darkened They had grown cold and distant Weizak saw and felt a chill of gooseflesh He later told his wife that it had been the face of a man looking through a highpowered microscope and observing an interesting species of paramecium Its your sisters medallion he said to Dussault Her name was Anne but everyone called her Terry Your older sister You loved her You almost worshiped the ground she walked on Suddenly terribly Johnny Smiths voice began to climb and change It became the cracked and unsure voice of an adolescent Its for when you cross Lisbon Street against the lights Terry or when youre out parking with one of those guys from EL Dont forget Terry dont forget The plump woman who had asked Johnny who the Democrats would nominate next year uttered a frightened little moan One of the TV cameramen muttered Holy Jesus in a hoarse voice Stop it Dessault whispered His face had gone a sick shade of gray His eyes bulged and spittle shone like chrome on his lower lip in this harsh light His hands moved for the medallion which was now looped on its fine gold chain over Johnnys fingers But his hands moved with no power or authority The medallion swung back and forth throwing off hypnotic gleams of light Remember me Terry the adolescent voice begged Stay clean Terry  please for Gods sake stay clean Stop it Stop it you bastard Now Johnny spoke in his own voice again It was speed wasnt it Then meth She died of a heart attack at twentyseven But she wore it ten years Rog She remembered you She never forgot Never forgot  never never  never The medallion slipped from his fingers and struck the floor with a small musical sound Johnny stared away into emptiness for a moment his face calm and cool and distant Dussault grubbed at his feet for the medallion sobbing hoarsely in the stunned silence A flashbulb popped and Johnnys face cleared and became his own again Horror touched it and then pity He knelt clumsily beside Dussault Im sorry he said Im sorry I didnt mean  You cheapjack bastard hoaxer Dussault screamed at him Its a lie All a lie All a lie He struck Johnny a clumsy openhanded blow on the neck and Johnny fell over striking his head on the floor hard He saw stars Uproar He was dimly aware that Dussault was pushing his way blindly through the crowd and toward the doors People milled around Dussault around Johnny He saw Dussault through a forest of legs and shoes Then Weizak was beside him helping him to sit up John are you all right Did he hurt you Not as bad as I hurt him Im okay He struggled to his feet Hands  maybe Weizaks maybe someone elses helped him He felt dizzy and sick almost revolted This had been a mistake a terrible mistake Someone screamed piercingly  the stout woman who had asked about the Democrats Johnny saw Dussault pitch forward to his knees grope at the sleeve of the stout womans print blouse and then slide tiredly forward onto the tile near the doorway he had been trying to reach The St Christopher medal was still in one hand Fainted someone said Fainted dead away Ill be damned My fault Johnny said to Sam Weizak His throat felt close and tight with shame with tears All my fault No Sam said No John But it was He shook loose of Weizaks hands and went to where Dussault lay coming around now eyes blinking dazedly at the ceiling Two of the doctors had come over to where he lay Is he all right Johnny asked He turned toward the woman reporter in the slacksuit and she shrank away from him A cramp of fear passed over her face Johnny turned the other way toward the TV reporter who had asked him if hed had any flashes before his accident It suddenly seemed very important that he explained to someone I didnt mean to hurt him he said Honest to God I never meant to hurt him I didnt know  The TV reporter backed up a step No he said Of course you didnt He was asking for it anybody could see that Just dont touch me huh Johnny looked at him dumbly lips quivering He was still in shock but beginning to understand Oh yes He was beginning to understand The TV reporter tried to smile and could only produce a deathshead rictus Just dont touch me Johnny Please Its not like that Johnny said  or tried to Later he was never sure if any sound had come out Dont touch me Johnny okay The reporter backed up to where his cameraman was packing his gear Johnny stood and watched him He began to shake all over  Its for your own good John Weizak said The nurse stood behind him a white ghost a sorcerers apprentice with her hands hovering above the small wheeled medication table a junkies paradise of sweet dreams No Johnny said He was still shaking and now there was cold sweat as well No more shots Ive had it up to here with shots A pill then No more pills either To help you sleep Will he be able to sleep That man Dussault He asked for it the nurse murmured and then flinched as Weizak turned toward her But Weizak smiled crookedly She is right nuh he said The man asked for it He thought you were selling empty bottles John A good nights sleep and youll be able to put this in perspective Ill sleep on my own Johnny please It was quarter past eleven The TV across the room had just gone off Johnny and Sam had watched the filmed story together it had been secondlined right after the bills Ford had vetoed My own story made better theater Johnny thought with morbid amusement Film footage of a baldheaded Republican mouthing platitudes about the national budget just didnt compare with the film clip that WABI camera man had gotten here earlier this evening The clip had ended with Dussault plunging across the floor with his sisters medal clutched in his hand and then crashing down in a faint clutching at the woman reporter the way a drowning man might clutch at a straw When the TV anchorman went on to the police dog and the four hundred pounds of pot Weizak had left briefly and had come back with the news that the hospital switchboard had jammed up with calls for him even before the report was over The nurse with the medication had shown up a few minutes later leading Johnny to believe that Sam had gone down to the nurses station to do more than check on incoming calls At that instant the telephone rang Weizak swore softly under his breath I told them to hold them all Dont answer it John Ill But Johnny already had it He listened for a moment then nodded Yes that was right He put a hand over the receiver Its my dad he said He uncovered the receiver Hi Dad I guess you  He listened The small smile on his lips faded and was replaced by an expression of dawning horror His lips moved silently John what is it Weizak asked sharply All right Daddy Johnny said almost in a whisper Yes Cumberland General I know where it is Just above Jerusalems Lot Okay All right Daddy His voice broke His eyes were tearless but glistening I know that Daddy I love you too Im sorry Listened Yes Yes it was Johnny said Ill see you Daddy Yes Goodbye He hung up the phone put the heels of his hands to his eyes and pressed Johnny Sam leaned forward took one of his hands away and held it gently Is it your mother Yeah Its my mother Heart attack Stroke Johnny said and Sam Weizak made a small pained hissing between his teeth They were watching the TV news  neither of them had any idea  and I came on and she had a stroke Christ Shes in the hospital Now if something happens to my dad we got a triple play He uttered a high scream of laughter His eyes rolled wildly from Sam to the nurse and back to Sam again Its a good talent he said Everybody should have it The laugh came again so like a scream How bad is she Sam asked He doesnt know Johnny swung his legs out of bed He had changed back to a hospital gown and his feet were bare What do you think you are doing Sam asked sharply What does it look like Johnny got up and for a moment it seemed that Sam would push him hack onto the bed But he only watched Johnny limp over to the closet Dont be ridiculous Youre not ready for this John Unmindful of the nurse  they had seen his bare tail enough times God knew Johnny let the gown drop around his feet The thick twisting scars stood out on the backs of his knees and dimpled into the scant swell of his calves He began to rummage in the closet for clothes and came up with the white shirt and jeans he had worn to the news conference John I absolutely forbid this As your doctor and your friend I tell you it is madness Forbid all you want Im going Johnny said He began to dress His face wore that expression of distant preoccupation that Sam associated with his trances The nurse gawped Nurse you might as well go back to your station Sam said She backed to the door stood there for a moment and then left Reluctantly Johnny Sam said He got up went to him and put a hand on his shoulder You didnt do it Johnny shook the hand off I did it all right he said She was watching me when it happened He began to button the shirt You urged her to take her medicine and she stopped Johnny looked at Weizak for a moment and then went back to buttoning his shirt If it hadnt happened tonight it would have happened tomorrow next week next month Or next year Or in ten years No It would not have been ten years or even one And you know it Why are you so anxious to pin this tail on yourself Because of that smug reporter Is it maybe an inverted kind of selfpity An urge to believe that you have been cursed Johnnys face twisted She was watching me when it happened Dont you get that Are you so fucking soft you dont get that She was planning a strenuous trip all the way to California and back you told me that yourself A symposium of some kind A highly emotional sort of thing from what you have said Yes Yes It would almost certainly have happened then A stroke is not lightning from a blue sky Johnny Johnny buttoned the jeans and then sat down as if the act of dressing had tired him out too much to do more His feet were still bare Yeah he said Yeah you may be right Sense He sees sense Thank the Lord But I still have to go Sam Weizak threw up his hands And do what She is in the hands of her doctors and her God That is the situation Better than anyone else you must understand My dad will need me Johnny said softly I understand that too How will you go Its nearly midnight By bus Ill grab a cab over to Peters Candlelighter The Greyhounds still stop there dont they You dont have to do that Sam said Johnny was groping under the chair for his shoes and not finding them Sam got them from under the bed and handed them to him Ill drive you down Johnny looked up at him Youd do that If youll take a mild tranquilizer yes But your wife  He realized in a confused sort of way that the only concrete thing he knew about Weizaks personal life was that his mother was living in California I am divorced Weizak said A doctor has to be out at all hours of the night  unless he is a pediatrist or a dermatologist nub My wife saw the bed as halfempty rather than halffull So she filled it with a variety of men Im sorry Johnny said embarrassed You spend far too much time being sorry John Sams face was gentle but his eyes were stern Put on your shoes Hospital to hospital Johnny thought dreamily flying gently along on the small blue pill he had taken just before he and Sam left the EMMC and climbed into Sams  El Dorado Hospital to hospital person to person station to station In a queer secret way he enjoyed the trip  it was his first time out of the hospital in almost five years The night was clear the Milky Way sprawled across the sky in an unwinding clockspring of light a halfmoon followed them over the dark tree line as they fled south through Palmyra Newport Pittsfield Benton Clinton The car whispered along in near total silence Low music Haydn issued from the four speakers of the stereo tape player Came to one hospital in the Cleaves Mills Rescue Squad ambulance went to another in a Cadillac he thought He didnt let it bother him It was just enough to ride to float along on the track to let the problem of his mother his new ability and the people who wanted to pry into his soul He asked for it  just dont touch me huh rest in a temporary limbo Weizak didnt talk Occasionally he hummed snatches of the music Johnny watched the stars He watched the turnpike nearly deserted this late It unrolled ceaselessly in front of them They went through the tollgate at Augusta and Weizak took a timeandtoll ticket Then they went on again  Gardener Sabbatus Lewiston Nearly five years longer than some convicted murderers spend in the slam He slept Dreamed Johnny his mother said in his dream Johnny make me better make me well She was in a beggars rags She was crawling toward him over cobblestones Her face was white Thin blood ran from her knees White lice squirmed in her thin hair She held shaking hands out to him Its the power of God working in you she said Its a great responsibility Johnny A great trust You must be worthy He took her hands closed his own over them and said Spirits depart from this woman She stood up Healed she cried in a voice that was filled with a strange and terrible triumph Healed My son has healed me His work is great upon the earth He tried to protest to tell her that he didnt want to do great works or heal or speak in tongues to divine the future or find those things that had been lost He tried to tell her but his tongue wouldnt obey the command of his brain Then she was past him striding off down the cobbled street her posture cringing and servile but somehow arrogant at the same time her voice belled like a clarion Saved Savior Saved Savior And to his horror he saw that there had been thousands of others behind her maybe millions all of them maimed or deformed or in terror The stout lady reporter was there needing to know who the Democrats would nominate for the presidency in  there was a deatheyed farmer in biballs with a picture of his son a smiling young man in Air Force blues who had been reported MIA over Hanoi in  he needed to know if his son was dead or alive a young woman who looked like Sarah with tears on her smooth cheeks holding up a baby with a hydrocephalic head on which blue veins were traced like runes of doom an old man with his fingers turned into clubs by arthritis others They stretched for miles they would wait patiently they would kill him with their mute bludgeoning need Saved His mothers voice carried back imperatively Savior Saved Saved He tried to tell them that he could neither heal nor save but before he could open his mouth to make the denial the first had laid hands on him and was shaking him The shaking was real enough It was Weizaks hand on his arm Bright orange light filled the car turning the interior as bright as day it was nightmare light turning Sams kind face into the face of a hobgoblin For a moment he thought the nightmare was still going on and then he saw the light was coming from parkinglot lamps They had changed those too apparently while he was in his coma From hard white to a weird orange that lay on the skin like paint Where are we he asked thickly The hospital Sam said Cumberland General Oh All right He sat up The dream seemed to slide off him in fragments still littering the floor of his mind like something broken and not yet swept up Are you ready to go in Yes Johnny said They crossed the parking lot amid the soft creak of summer crickets in the woods Fireflies stitched through the darkness The image of his mother was very much on him  but not so much that he was unable to enjoy the soft and fragrant smell of the night and the feel of the faint breeze against his skin There was time to enjoy the health of the night and the feeling of health coming inside him In the context of why he was here the thought seemed almost obscene  but only almost And it wouldnt go away  Herb came down the hallway to meet them and Johnny saw that his father was wearing old pants shoes with no socks and his pajama shirt It told Johnny a lot about the suddenness with which it had come It told him more than he wanted to know Son he said He looked smaller somehow He tried to say more and couldnt Johnny hugged him and Herb burst into tears He sobbed against Johnnys shirt Daddy he said Thats all right Daddy thats all right His father put his arms on Johnnys shoulders and wept Weizak turned away and began to inspect the pictures on the walls indifferent water colors by local artists Herb began to recover himself He swiped his arm across his eyes and said Look at me still in my pi top I had time to change before the ambulance came I guess I never thought of it Must be getting senile No youre not Well He shrugged Your doctor friend brought you down That was nice of you Dr Weizak Sam shrugged It was nothing Johnny and his father walked toward the small waiting room and sat down Daddy is she Shes sinking Herb said He seemed calmer now Conscious but sinking Shes been asking for you Johnny I think shes been holding on for you My fault Johnny said All this is my The pain in his ear startled him and he stared at his father astonished Herb had seized his ear and twisted it firmly So much for the role reversal of having his father cry in his arms The old twisttheear trick had been a punishment Herb had reserved for the gravest of errors Johnny couldnt remember having his ear twisted since he was thirteen and had gotten fooling around with their old Rambler He had inadvertently pushed in the clutch and the old car had rumbled silently downhill to crash into their back shed Dont you ever say that Herb said Jeez Dad Herb let go a little smile lurking just below the corners of his mouth Forgot all about the old twisttheear huh Probably thought I had too No such luck Johnny Johnny stared at his father still dumbfounded Dont you ever blame yourself But she was watching that damned News yes She was ecstatic she was thrilled  then she was on the floor her poor old mouth opening and closing like she was a fish out of water Herb leaned closer to his son The doctor wont come right out and tell me but he asked me about heroic measures I told him none of that stuff She committed her own kind of sin Johnny She presumed to know the mind of God So dont you ever blame yourself for her mistake Fresh tears glinted in his eyes His voice roughened God knows I spent my life loving her and it got hard in the late going Maybe this is just the best thing Can I see her Yes shes at the end of the hall Room  Theyre expecting you and so is she Just one thing Johnny Agree with anything and everything she might say Dont let her die thinking it was all for nothing No He paused Are you coming with me Not now Maybe later Johnny nodded and walked up the hall The lights were turned down low for the nighttime The brief moment in the soft kind summer night seemed far away now but his nightmare in the car seemed very close Room  VERA HELEN SMITH the little card on the door read Had he known her middle name was Helen It seemed he must have although he couldnt remember But he could remember other things her bringing him an icecream bar wrapped in her handkerchief one bright summer day at Old Orchard Beach smiling and gay He and his mother and father playing rummy for matches  later after the religion business began to deepen its hold on her she wouldnt have cards in the house not even to play cribbage with He remembered the day the bee had stung him and he ran to her bawling his head off and she had kissed the swelling and pulled out the stinger with tweezers and then had wrapped the wound in a strip of cloth that had been dipped in baking soda He pushed the door open and went in She was a vague hump in the bed and Johnny thought Thats what I looked like A nurse was taking her pulse she turned when the door opened and the dim hall lights flashed on her spectacles Are you Mrs Smiths son Yes Johnny The voice rose from the hump in the bed dry and hollow rattling with death as a few pebbles will rattle in an empty gourd The voice  God help him made his skin crawl He moved closer Her face was twisted into a snarling mask on the lefthand side The hand on the counterpane was a claw Stroke he thought What the old people call a shock Yes Thats better Thats what she looks like Like shes had a bad shock Is that you John Its me Ma Johnny Is that you Yes Ma He came closer yet and forced himself to take the bony claw I want my Johnny she said querulously The nurse shot him a pitying look and he found himself wanting to smash his fist through it Would you leave us alone he asked I really shouldnt while Come on shes my mother and I want some time alone with her Johnny said What about it Well Bring me my juice Dad his mother cried hoarsely Feel like I could drink a quart Would you get out of here he cried at the nurse He was filled with a terrible sorrow of which he could not even find the focus It seemed like a whirlpool going down into darkness The nurse left Ma he said sitting beside her That weird feeling of doubled time of reversal would not leave him How many times had she sat over his bed like this perhaps holding his dry hand and talking to him He recalled the timeless period when the room had seemed so close to him  seen through a gauzy placental membrane his mothers face bending over him thundering senseless sounds slowly into his upturned face Ma he said again and kissed the hook that had replaced her hand Gimme those nails I can do that she said Her left eye seemed frozen in its orbit the other rolled wildly It was the eye of a gutshot horse I want Johnny Ma Im here Johnny Johnny JOHNNY Ma he said afraid the nurse would come back You  She broke off and her head turned toward him a little Bend over here where I can see she whispered He did as she asked You came she said Thank you Thank you Tears began to ooze from the good eye The bad one the one on the side of her face that had been frozen by the shock stared indifferently upward Sure I came I saw you she whispered What a power God has given you Johnny Didnt I tell you Didnt I say it was so Yes you did He has a job for you she said Dont run from him Johnny Dont hide away in a cave like Elijah or make him send a big fish to swallow you up Dont do that John No I wont He held her clawhand His head throbbed Not the potter but the potters clay John Remember All right Remember that she said stridently and he thought Shes going back into nonsense land But she didnt at least she went no further into nonsense land than she had been since he came out of his coma Heed the still small voice when it comes she said Yes Ma I will Her head turned a tiny bit on the pillow and  was she smiling You think Im crazy I guess She twisted her head a little more so she could look directly at him But that doesnt matter Youll know the voice when it comes Itll tell you what to do It told Jeremiah and Daniel and Amos and Abraham Itll come to you Itll tell you And when it does Johnny do your duty Okay Ma What a power she murmured Her voice was growing furry and indistinct What a power God has given you I knew  I always knew Her voice trailed off The good eye closed The other stared blankly forward Johnny sat with her another five minutes then got up to leave His hand was on the doorknob and he was easing the door open when her dry rattling voice came again chilling him with its implacable positive command Do your duty John Yes Ma It was the last time he ever spoke to her She died at five minutes past eight on the morning of August  Somewhere north of them Walt and Sarah Hazlett were having a discussion about Johnny that was almost an argument and somewhere south of them Greg Stillson was cutting himself some prime asshole You dont understand Greg Stillson said in a voice of utter reasonable patience to the kid sitting in the lounge at the back of the Ridgeway police station The kid shirtless was tilted back in a padded folding chair and drinking a bottle of Pepsi He was smiling indulgently at Greg Stillson not understanding that twice was all Greg Stillson ever repeated himself understanding that there was one prime asshole in the room but not yet understanding who it was That realization would have to be brought home to him Forcibly if necessary Outside the late August morning was bright and warm Birds sang in the trees And Greg felt his destiny was closer than ever That was why he would be careful with this prime asshole That was no longhaired bikefreak with a bad case of bowlegs and BO this kid was a college boy his hair was moderately long but squeaky clean and he was George Harveys nephew Not that George cared for him much George had fought his way across Germany in  and he had two words for these longhaired freaks and those two words were not Happy Birthday but he was blood And George was a man to be reckoned with on the town council See what you can do with him George had told Greg when Greg informed him that Chief Wiggins had arrested his sisters kid But his eyes said Dont hurt him Hes blood The kid was looking at Greg with lazy contempt I understand he said Your Deputy Dawg took my shirt and I want it back And you better understand something If I dont get it back Im going to have the American Civil Liberties Union down on your red neck Greg got up went to the steelgray file cabinet opposite the soda machine pulled out his keyring selected a key and opened the cabinet From atop a pile of accident and traffic forms he took a red Tshirt He spread it open so the legend on it was clear BABY LETS FUCK You were wearing this Greg said in that same mild voice On the street The kid rocked on the back legs of his chair and swigged some more Pepsi The little indulgent smile playing around his mouth  almost a sneer  did not change Thats right he said And I want it back Its my property Gregs head began to ache This smartass didnt realize how easy it would be The room was soundproofed and there had been times when that soundproofing had muffled screams No  he didnt realize He didnt understand But keep your hand on it Dont go overboard Dont upset the applecart Easy to think Usually easy to do But sometimes his temper  his temper got out of hand Greg reached into his pocket and pulled out his Bic lighter So you just go tell your gestapo chief and my fascist uncle that the First Amendment  He paused eyes widening a little What are you   Hey Hey Taking no notice and at least outwardly calm Greg struck a light The Bics gas flame vroomed upward and Greg lit the kids Tshirt on fire It burned quite well actually The front legs of the kids chair came down with a bang and he leaped toward Greg with his bottle of Pepsi still in his hand The selfsatisfied little smirk was gone replaced with a look of wideeyed shock and surprise  and the anger of a spoiled brat who has had everything his own way for too long No one ever called him runt Greg Stillson thought and his headache worsened Oh he was going to have to be careful Gimme that the kid shouted Greg was holding the shirt out pinched together in two fingers at the neck ready to drop it when it got too hot Gimme that you asshole Thats mine Thats Greg planted his hand in the middle of the kids bare chest and shoved him as hard as he could  which was hard indeed The kid went flying across the room the anger dissolving into total shock and  at last  what Greg needed to see fear He dropped the shirt on the tile floor picked up the kids Pepsi and poured what was left in the bottle onto the smouldering Tshirt It hissed balefully The kid was getting up slowly his back pressed against the wall Greg caught his eyes with his own The kids eyes were brwn and very very wide Were going to reach an understanding Greg said and the words seemed distant to him behind the sick thud in his head Were going to have a little seminar right here in this back room about just whos the asshole you got my meaning Were gonna reach some conclusions Isnt that what you college boys like to do Reach conclusions The kid drew breath in hitches He wet his lips seemed about to speak and then he yelled Help Yeah you need help all right Greg said Im going to give you some too Youre crazy George Harveys nephew said and then yelled again louder HELP I may be Greg said Sure But what we got to find out Sonny is who the prime asshole is See what I mean He looked down at the Pepsi bottle in his hand and suddenly he swung it savagely against the corner of the steel cabinet It shattered and when the kid saw the scatter of glass on the floor and the jagged neck in Gregs hand pointing toward him he screamed The crotch of his jeans faded almost white suddenly darkened His face went the color of old parchment And as Greg walked toward him gritting glass under the workboots he wore summer and winter he cringed against the wall When I go out on the street I wear a white shirt Greg said He was grinning showing white teeth Sometimes a tie When you go out on the street you wear some rag with a filthy saying on it So whos the asshole kiddo George Harveys nephew whined something His bulging eyes never left the spears of glass jutting from the bottle neck in Gregs hand Im standing here high and dry Greg said coming a little closer and you got piss running down both legs into your shoes So whos the asshole He began to jab the bottle neck lightly toward the kids bare and sweaty midriff and George Harveys nephew began to cry This was the sort of kid that was tearing the country in two Greg thought The thick wine of fury buzzed and coursed in his head Stinking yellowbelly crybaby assholes like this Ah but dont hurt him  dont kick over the apple cart I sound like a human being Greg said and you sound like a pig in a greasepit boy So whos the asshole He jabbed with the bottle again one of the jagged glass points dimpled the kids skin just below the right nipple and brought a tiny bead of blood The kid howled Im talking to you Greg said You better answer up same as youd answer up one of your professors Whos the asshole The kid sniveled but made no coherent sound You answer up if you want to pass this exam Greg said Ill let your guts loose all over this floor boy And in that instant he meant it He couldnt look directly at this welling drop of blood it would send him crazy if he did George Harveys nephew or not Whos the asshole Me the kid said and began to sob like a small child afraid of the bogeyman the Allamagoosalum that waits behind the closet door in the dead hours of the night Greg smiled The headache thumped and flared Well thats pretty good you know Thats a start But its not quite good enough I want you to say Im an asshole Im an asshole the kid said still sobbing Snot flowed from his nose and hung there in a runner He wiped it away with the back of his hand Now I want you to say Im a prime asshole I Im a prime asshole Now you just say one more thing and maybe we can be done here You say Thank you for burning up that dirty shirt Mayor Stilison The kid was eager now The kid saw his way clear Thanks for burning up that dirty shirt In a flash Greg ran one of the jagged points from left to right across the kids soft belly bringing a line of blood He barely broke the skin but the kid howled as if all the devils of hell were behind him You forgot to say Mayor Stillson Greg said and just like that it broke The headache gave one more massive beat right between his eyes and was gone He looked down stupidly at the bottle neck in his hand and could barely remember how it had gotten there Stupid damn thing He had almost thrown everything away over one numbnuts kid Mayor Stillson The kid was screaming His terror was perfect and complete Mayor Stillson Mayor Stillson Mayor Still Thats good Greg said  son Mayor Stillson Mayor Stillson Mayor Greg whacked him hard across the face and the kid rapped his head on the wall He fell silent his eyes wide and blank Greg stepped very close to him He reached out He closed one hand around each of the kids ears He pulled the kids face forward until their noses were touching Their eyes were less than half an inch apart Now your uncle is a power in this town he said softly holding the kids ears like handles The kids eyes were huge and brown and swimming Im a power too coming to be one  but I aint no George Harvey He was born here raised here everything And if you was to tell your uncle what went on in here he might take a notion to finish me in Ridgeway The kids lips were twitching in a nearly soundless blubber Greg shook the boys head slowly back and forth by the ears banging their noses together He might not he was pretty damn mad about that shirt But he might Blood ties are strong ties So you think about this son If you was to tell your uncle what went on here and your uncle squeezed me out I guess I would come along and kill you Do you believe that Yeah the kid whispered His cheeks were wet gleaming Yes sir Mayor Stillson Yessir Mayor Stilison Greg let go of his ears Yeah he said Id kill you but first Id tell anybody thatd listen about how you pissed yourself and stood there crying with snot running out of your nose He turned and walked away quickly as if the kid smelled bad and went to the cabinet again He got a box of BandAids from one of the shelves and tossed them across to the kid who flinched back and fumbled them He hastened to pick them up off the floor as if Stillson might attack him again for missing Greg pointed Bathroom over there You clean yourself up Im gonna leave you a Ridgeway PAL sweatshirt I want it mailed back clean no bloodstains You understand Yes the kid whispered SIR Stillson screamed at him SIR SIR SIR Cant you remember that Sir the kid moaned Yessir yessir They dont teach you kids respect for nothing Greg said Not for nothing The headache was trying to come back He took several deep breaths and quelled it  but his stomach felt miserably upset Okay thats the end I just want to offer you one good piece of advice Dont you make the mistake of getting back to your damn college this fall or whenever and start thinking this was some way it wasnt Dont you try to kid yourself about Greg Stillson Best forgotten kid By you me and George Working this around in your mind until you think you could have another swing at it would be the worst mistake of your life Maybe the last With that Greg left taking one last contemptuous look at the kid standing there his chest and belly caked with a few minor smears of dried blood his eyes wide his lips trembling He looked like an overgrown tenyearold who has struck out in the Little League playoffs Greg made a mental bet with himself that he would never see or hear from this particular kid again and it was a bet he won Later that week George Harvey stopped by the barbershop where Greg was getting a shave and thanked him for talking some sense into his nephew Youre good with these kids Greg he said I dunno they seem to respect you Greg told him not to mention it  While Greg Stillson was burning a shirt with an obscene saying on it in New Hampshire Walt and Sarah Hazlett were having a late breakfast in Bangor Maine Walt had the paper He put his coffee cup down with a clink and said Your old boyfriend made the paper Sarah Sarah was feeding Denny She was in her bathrobe her hair something of a mess her eyes still only about a quarter open Eighty percent of her mind was still asleep There had been a party last night The guest of honor had been Harrison Fisher who had been New Hampshires third district congressman since dinosaurs walked the earth and a sure candidate for reelection next year It had been politic for her and Walt to go Politic That was a word that Walt used a lot lately He had had lots more to drink than she had and this morning he was dressed and apparently chipper while she felt buried in a pile of sludge It wasnt fair Blue Denny remarked and spat back a mouthful of mixed fruit Thats not nice Sarah said to Denny To Walt Are you talking about Johnny Smith The one and only She got up and came around to Walts side of the table Hes all right isnt he Feeling good and kicking up dickens by the sound of this Walt said dryly She had a hazy idea that it might be related to what had happened to her when she went to see Johnny but the size of the headline shocked her REAWAKENED COMA PATIENT DEMONSTRATES PSYCHIC ABILITY AT DRAMATIC NEWS CONFERENCE The story was under David Brights byline The accompanying photo showed Johnny still looking thin and in the unsparing glare of the flash pitifully confused standing over the sprawled body of a man the caption identified as Roger Dussault a reporter for the Lewiston paper Reporter Faints after Revelation the caption read Sarah sank down into the chair next to Walt and began to read the article This did not please Denny who began to pound on the tray of his highchair for his morning egg I believe youre being summoned Walt said Would you feed him honey He eats better for you anyway Story Continued Page  Col  She folded the paper open to page nine Flattery will get you everywhere Walt said agreeably He slipped off his sports coat and put on her apron Here it comes guy he said and began feeding Denny his egg When she had finished the story Sarah went back and read it again Her eyes were drawn again and again to the picture to Johnnys confused horrorstruck face The people loosely grouped around the prone Dussault were looking at Johnny with an expression close to fear She could understand that She remembered kissing him and the strange preoccupied look that had slipped over his face And when he told her where to find the lost wedding ring she had been afraid But Sarah what you were afraid of wasnt quite the same thing was it Just a little more big boy Walt was saying as if from a thousand miles away Sarah looked up at them sitting together in a bar of motedusted sunlight her apron flapping between Walts knees and she was suddenly afraid again She saw the ring sinking to the bottom of the toilet bowl turning over and over She heard the small clink as it struck the porcelain She thought of Halloween masks of the kid saying l love to see this guy take a beatin She thought of promises made and never kept and her eyes went to his thin newsprint face looking out at her with such haggard wretched surprise  gimmick anyway Walt said hanging up her apron He had gotten Denny to eat the egg every bit of it and now their son and heir was sucking contentedly away at a juicebottle Huh Sarah looked up as he came over to her I said that for a man who must have almost half a million dollars worth of hospital bills outstanding its a helluva good gimmick What are you talking about What do you mean gimmick Sure he said apparently missing her anger He could make seven maybe ten thousand dollars doing a book about the accident and the coma But if he came out of the coma psychic  the skys the limit Thats one hell of an allegation Sarah said and her voice was thin with fury He turned to her his expression first one of surprise and then of understanding The understanding look made her angrier than ever If she had a nickel for every time Walt Hazlett had thought he understood her they could fly firstclass to Jamaica Look Im sorry I brought it up he said Johnny would no more lie than the Pope would  would you know He bellowed laughter and in that moment she nearly picked up his own coffee cup and threw it at him Instead she locked her hands together tightly under the table and squeezed them Denny goggled at his father and then burst into his own peal of laughter Honey Walt said I have nothing against him I have nothing against what hes doing In fact I respect him for it If that fat old mossback Fisher can go from a broke lawyer to a millionaire during fifteen years in the House of Representatives then this guy should have a perfect right to pick up as much as he can playing psychic Johnny doesnt lie she repeated tonelessly Its a gimmick for the bluerinse brigade who read the weekly tabloids and belong to the Universe Book Club he said cheerily Although I will admit that a little second sight would come in handy during jury selection in this damn Timmons trial Johnny Smith doesnt lie she repeated and heard him saying It slipped off your finger You were putting his shaving stuff into one of those side pockets and it just slipped off  you go up in the attic and look Sarah Youll see But she couldnt tell Walt that Walt didnt know she had been to see Johnny Nothing wrong in going to see him her mind offered uneasily No but how would he react to the news that she had thrown her original wedding ring into the toilet and flushed it away He might not understand the sudden twitch of fear that had made her do it  the same fear she saw mirrored on those other newsprint faces and to some degree on Johnnys own No Walt might not understand that at all After all throwing your wedding ring into the toilet and then pushing the flush did suggest a certain vulgar symbolism All right Walt was saying he doesnt lie But I just dont believe Sarah said softly Look at the people behind him Walt Look at their faces They believe Walt gave them a cursory glance Sure the way a kid believes in a magician as long as the trick is ongoing You think this fellow Dussault was a whatdoyoucallit a shill According to the article he and Johnny had never met before Thats the only way the illusion will work Sarah Walt said patiently It doesnt do a magician any good to pull a bunny out of a rabbit hutch only out of a hat Either Johnny Smith knew something or he made a terribly good guess based on this guy Dussaults behavior at the time But I repeat I respect him for it He got a lot of mileage out of it If it turns him a buck more power to him In that moment she hated him loathed him this good man she had married There was really nothing so terrible on the reverse side of his goodness his steadiness his mild good humor  just the belief apparently grounded in the bedrock of his soul that everybody was looking out for number one each with his or her own little racket This morning he could call Harrison Fisher a fat old mossback last night he had been bellowing with laughter at Fishers stories about Greg Stillson the funny mayor of sometownorother and who might just be crazy enough to run as an independent in the House race next year No in the world of Walt Hazlett no one had psychic powers and there were no heroes and the doctrine of wehavetochangethesystem fromwithin was allpowerful He was a good man a steady man he loved her and Denny but suddenly her soul cried out for Johnny and the five years together of which they had been robbed Or the lifetime together A child with darker hair You better get going babe she said quietly Theyll have your guy Timmons in stocks and bonds or whatever they are Sure He smiled at her the summation done session adjourned Still friends Still friends But he knew where the ring was He knew Walt kissed her his right hand resting lightly on the back of her neck He always had the same thing for breakfast he always kissed her the same way some day they were going to Washington and no one was psychic Five minutes later he was gone backing their little red Pinto out onto Pond Street giving his usual brief toot on the horn and putting away She was left alone with Denny who was in the process of strangling himself while he tried to wriggle under his highchair tray Youre going at that all wrong Sluggo Sarah said crossing the kitchen and unlatching the tray Blue Denny said disgusted with the whole thing Speedy Tomato their tomcat sauntered into the kitchen at his usual slow hipshot juvenile delinquents stride and Denny grabbed him making little chuckling noises Speedy laid his ears back and looked resigned Sarah smiled a little and cleared the table Inertia A body at rest tends to remain at rest and she was at rest Never mind Walts darker side she had her own She had no intention of doing more than sending Johnny a card at Christmas It was better safer that way  because a body in motion tends to keep moving Her life here was good She had survived Dan she had survived Johnny who had been so unfairly taken from her but so much in this world was unfair she had come through her own personal rapids to this smooth water and here she would stay This sunshiny kitchen was not a bad place Best to forget county fairs Wheels of Fortune and Johnny Smiths face As she ran water into the sink to do the dishes she turned on the radio and caught the beginning of the news The first item made her freeze with a justwashed plate in one hand her eyes looking out over their small backyard in startled contemplation Johnnys mother had had a stroke while watching a TV report on her sons press conference She had died this morning not an hour ago Sarah dried her hands snapped off the radio and pried Speedy Tomato out of Dennys hands She carried her boy into the living room and popped him into his playpen Denny protested this indignity with loud lusty howls of which she took no notice She went to the telephone and called the EMMC A switchboard operator who sounded tired of repeating the same piece of intelligence over and over again told her that John Smith had discharged himself the night before slightly before midnight She hung up the phone and sat down in a chair Denny continued to cry from his playpen Water ran into the kitchen sink After a while she got up went into the kitchen and turned it off The man from Inside View showed up on October  not long after Johnny had walked up to get the mail His fathers house was set well back from the road their graveled driveway was nearly a quarter of a mile long running through a heavy stand of secondgrowth spruce and pine Johnny did the total round trip every day At first he had returned to the porch trembling with exhaustion his legs on fire his limp so pronounced that he was really lurching along But now a month and a half after the first time when the half a mile had taken him an hour to do the walk had become one of his days pleasures something to look forward to Not the mail but the walk He had begun splitting wood for the coming winter a chore Herb had been planning to hire out since he himself had landed a contract to do some inside work on a new housing project in Libertyville You know when old age has started lookin over your shoulder John he had said with a smile Its when you start lookin for inside work as soon as fall rolls around Johnny climbed the porch and sat down in the wicker chair beside the glider uttering a small sound of relief He propped his right foot on the porch railing and with a grimace of pain used his hands to lift his left leg over it That done he began to open his mail It had tapered off a lot just lately During the first week he had been back here in Pownal there had sometimes been as many as two dozen letters and eight or nine packages a day most of them forwarded through the EMMC a few of them sent to General Delivery Pownal and assorted variant spellings Pownell Poenul and in one memorable case Poonuts Most of them were from dissociated people who seemed to be drifting through life in search of any rudder There were children who wanted his autograph women who wanted to sleep with him both men and women seeking advice to the lovelorn Some sent lucky charms Some sent horoscopes A great many of the letters were religious in nature and in these badly spelled missives usually written in a large and careful handwriting but one step removed from the scrawl of a bright firstgrader he seemed to feel the ghost of his mother He was a prophet these letters assured him come to lead the weary and disillusioned American people out of the wilderness He was a sign that the Last Times were at hand To this date October  he had received eight copies of Hal Lindseys The Late Great Planet Earth his mother surely would have approved of that one He was urged to proclaim the divinity of Christ and put a stop to the loose morals of youth These letters were balanced off by the negative contingent which was smaller but just as vocal  if usually anonymous One correspondent writing in grubby pencil on a sheet of yellow legal paper proclaimed him the Antichrist and urged him to commit suicide Four or five of the letter writers had inquired about how it felt to murder your own mother A great many wrote to accuse him of perpetrating a hoax One wit wrote PRECOGNITION TELEPATHY BULLSHIT EAT MY DONG YOU EXTRASENSORY TURKEY And they sent things That was the worst of it Every day on his way home from work Herb would stop at the Pownal post office and pick up the packages that were too big to fit in their mailbox The notes accompanying the things were all essentially the same a lowgrade scream Tell me tell me tell me This scarf belonged to my brother who disappeared on a fishing trip in the Allagash in  I feel very strongly that he is still alive Tell me where he is This lipstick came from my wifes dressing table I think shes having an affair but Im not sure Tell me if she is This is my sons ID bracelet He never comes home after school anymore he stays out until all hours Im worried sick Tell me what hes doing A woman in North Carolina  God knew how she had found out about him the press conference in August had not made the national media  sent a charred piece of wood Her house had burned down her letter explained and her husband and two of her five children had died in the blaze The Charlotte fire department said it was faulty wiring but she simply couldnt accept that It had to be arson She wanted Johnny to feel the enclosed blackened relic and tell her who had done it so the monster would spend the rest of his life rotting in prison Johnny answered none of the letters and returned all the objects even the charcoaled hunk of wood at his cost and with no comment He did touch some of them Most like the charred piece of wallboard from the griefstricken woman in Charlotte told him nothing at all But when he touched a few of them disquieting images came like waking dreams In most cases there was barely a trace a picture would form and fade in seconds leaving him with nothing concrete at all only a feeling But one of them It had been the woman who sent the scarf in hopes of finding out what had happened to her brother It was a white knitted scarf no different from a million others But as he handled it the reality of his fathers house had suddenly been gone and the sound of the television in the next room rose and flattened rose and flattened until it was the sound of drowsing summer insects and the faraway babble of water Woods smells in his nostrils Green shafts of sunlight falling through great old trees The ground had been soggy for the last three hours or so squelchy almost swamplike He was scared plenty scared but he had kept his head If you were lost in the big north country and panicked they might as well carve your headstone He had kept pushing south It had been two days since he had gotten separated from Stiv and Rocky and Logan They had been camping near but that wouldnt come it was in the dead zone some stream troutfishing and it had been his own damn fault he had been pretty damn drunk Now he could see his pack leaning against the edge of an old and mossgrown blowdown white deadwood poking through the green here and there like bones he could see his pack yes but he couldnt reach it because he had walked a few yards away to take a leak and he had walked into a really squelchy place mud almost to the tops of his LL Beans boots and he tried to back out find a dryer place to do his business but he couldnt get out He couldnt get out because it wasnt mud at all It was something else He stood there looking around fruitlessly for something to grab onto almost laughing at the idiocy of having walked right into a patch of quicksand while looking for a place to take a piss He stood there at first positive that it must be a shallow patch of quicksand at the very worst over his boottops another tale to tell when he was found He stood there and real panic did not begin to set in until the quicksand oozed implacably over his knees He began to struggle then forgetting that if you got your stupid self into quicksand you were supposed to remain very still In no time at all the quicksand was up to his waist and now it was chesthigh sucking at him like great brown lips constricting his breathing he began to scream and no one came nothing came except for a fat brown squirrel that picked its way down the side of the mossy deadfall and perched on his pack and watched him with his bright black eyes Now it was up to his neck the rich brown smell of it in his nose and his screams became thin and gasping as the quicksand implacably pressed the breath out of him Birds flew swooping and cheeping and scolding and green shafts of sunlight like tarnished copper fell through the trees and the quicksand rose over his chin Alone he was going to die alone and he opened his mouth to scream one last time and there was no scream because the quicksand flowed into his mouth it flowed over his tongue it flowed between his teeth in thin ribbons he was swallowing quicksand and the scream was never uttered Johnny had come out of that in a cold sweat his flesh marbled into goosebumps the scarf wrapped tightly between his hands his breath coming in shrt strangled gasps He had thrown the scarf on the floor where it lay like a twisted white snake He would not touch it again His father had put it in a return envelope and sent it back But now mercifully the mail was beginning to taper off The crazies had discovered some fresher object for their public and private obsessions Newsmen no longer called for interviews partly because the phone number had been changed and unlisted partly because the story was old hat Roger Dussault had written a long and angry piece for his paper of which he was the feature editor He proclaimed the whole thing a cruel and tasteless hoax Johnny had undoubtedly boned up on incidents from the pasts of several reporters who were likely to attend the press conference just in case Yes he admitted his sister Annes nickname had been Terry She had died fairly young and amphetamines might have been a contributing cause But all of that was accessible information to anyone who wanted to dig it up He made it all seem quite logical The article did not explain how Johnny who had not been out of the hospital could have come by this accessible information but that was a point most readers seemed to have overlooked Johnny could not have cared less The incident was closed and he had no intention of creating new ones What good could it possibly do to write the lady who had sent the scarf and tell her that her brother had drowned screaming in quicksand because he had gone the wrong way while looking for a place to take a piss Would it ease her mind or help her live her life any better Todays mail was a mere six letters A power bill A card from Herbs cousin out in Oklahoma A lady who had sent Johnny a crucifix with MADE IN TAIWAN stamped on Christs feet in tiny gold letters There was a brief note from Sam Weizak And a small envelope with a return address that made him blink and sit up straighter S Hazlett  Pond Street Bangor Sarah He tore it open He had received a sympathy card from her two days after the funeral services for his mother Written on the back of it in her cool backslanting hand had been Johnny  Im so sorry that this has happened I heard on the radio that your mom had passed away  in some ways that seemed the most unfair thing of all that your private grief should have been made a thing of public knowledge You may not remember but we talked a little about your mom the night of your accident I asked you what shed do if you brought home a lapsed Catholic and you said she would smile and welcome me in and slip me a few tracts I could see your love for her in the way you smiled I know from your father that she had changed but much of the change was because she loved you so much and just couldnt accept what had happened And in the end I guess her faith was rewarded Please accept my warm sympathy and if theres anything I can do now or later on please count on your friend  Sarah That was one note he had answered thanking her for both the card and the thought He had written it carefully afraid that he might betray himself and say the wrong thing She was a married woman now that was beyond his control or ability to change But he did remember their conversation about his mother  and so many other things about that night Her note had summoned up the whole evening and he answered in a bittersweet mood that was more bitter than sweet He still loved Sarah Bracknell and he had to remind himself constantly that she was gone replaced by another woman who was five years older and the mother of a small boy Now he pulled a single sheet of stationery out of the envelope and scanned it quickly She and her boy were headed down to Kennebunk to spend a week with Sarahs freshman and sophomore roommate a girl named Stephanie Constantine now Stephanie Carsleigh then She said that Johnny might remember her but Johnny didnt Anyway Walt was stuck in Washington for three weeks on combined firm and Republican party business and Sarah thought she might take one afternoon and come by Pownal to see Johnny and Herb if it was no trouble You can reach me at Stephs number  any time between Oct th and the rd Of course if it would make you feel uncomfortable in any way just call me and say so either up here or down there in Kbunk Ill understand Much love to both of you  Sarah Holding the letter in one hand Johnny looked across the yard and into the woods which had gone russet and gold seemingly just in the last week The leaves would be falling soon and then it would be time for winter Much love to both of you  Sarah He ran his thumb across the words thoughtfully It would be better not to call not to write not to do anything he thought She would get the message Like the woman who mailed the scarf what possible good could it do Why kick a sleeping dog Sarah might be able to use that phrase much love blithely but he could not He wasnt over the hurt of the past For him time had been crudely folded stapled and mutilated In the progression of his own interior time she had been his girl only six months ago He could accept the coma and the loss of time in an intellectual way but his emotions stubbornly resisted Answering her condolence note had been difficult but with a note it was always possible to crumple the thing up and start again if it began to go in directions it shouldnt go if it began to overstep the bounds of friendship which was all they were now allowed to share If he saw her he might do or say something stupid Better not to call Better just to let it sink But he would call he thought Call and invite her over Troubled he slipped the note back into the envelope The sun caught on bright chrome twinkled there and tossed an arrow of light back into his eyes A Ford sedan was crunching its way down the driveway Johnny squinted and tried to make out if it was a familiar car Company out here was rare There had been lots of mail but people had only stopped by on three or four occasions Pownal was small on the map hard to find If the car did belong to some seeker after knowledge Johnny would send him or her away quickly as kindly as possible but firmly That had been Weizaks parting advice Good advice Johnny thought Dont let anyone rope you into the role of consulting swami John Give no encouragement and they will forget It may seem heartless to you at first  most of them are misguided people with too many problems and only the best of intentions  but it is a question of your life your privacy So be firm And so he had been The Ford pulled into the turnaround between the shed and the woodpile and as it swung around Johnny saw the small Hertz sticker in the corner of the windshield A very tall man in very new blue jeans and a red plaid hunting shirt that looked as if it had just come out of an LL Bean box got out of the car and glanced around He had the air of a man who is not used to the country a man who knows there are no more wolves or cougars in New England but who wants to make sure all the same A city man He glanced up at the porch saw Johnny and raised one hand in greeting Good afternoon he said He had a flat city accent as well  Brooklyn Johnny thought  and he sounded as if he were talking through a Saltine box Hi Johnny said Lost Boy I hope not the stranger said coming over to the foot of the steps Youre either John Smith or his twin brother Johnny grinned I dont have a brother so I guess you found your way to the right door Can I do something for you Well maybe we can do something for each other The stranger mounted the porch steps and offered his hand Johnny shook it My name is Richard Dees Inside View magazine His hair was cut in a fashionable earlength style and it was mostly gray Dyed gray Johnny thought with some amusement What could you say about a man who sounded as if he were talking through a Saltine box and dyed his hair gray Maybe youve seen the magazine Oh Ive seen it They sell it at the checkout counters in the supermarket Im not interested in being interviewed Sorry you had to make a trip out here for nothing They sold it in the supermarket all right The headlines did everything but leap off the pulpstock pages and try to mug you CHILD KILLED BY CREATURES FROM SPACE DISTRAUGHT MOTHER CRIES THE FOODS THAT ARE POISONING YOUR CHILDREN  PSYCHICS PREDICT CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE BY  Well now an interview wasnt exactly what we were thinking of Dees said May I sit down Really I Mr Smith Ive flown all the way up from New York and from Boston I came on a little plane that had me wondering what would happen to my wife if I died interstate PortlandBangor Airways Johnny asked grinning Thats what it was Dees agreed All right Johnny said Im impressed with your valor and your dedication to your job Ill listen but only for fifteen minutes or so Im supposed to sleep every afternoon This was a small lie in a good cause Fifteen minutes should be more than enough Dees leaned forward Im just making an educated guess Mr Smith but Id estimate that you must owe somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred thousand dollars That roll somewhere within putting distance of the pin does it Johnnys smile thinned What I owe or dont owe he said is my business All right of course sure I didnt mean to offend Mr Smith Inside View would like to offer you a job A rather lucrative job No Absolutely not If youll just give me a chance to lay this out for you Johnny said Im not a practicing psychic Im not a Jeanne Dixon or an Edgar Cayce or an Alex Tannous Thats over with The last thing I want to do is rake it up again Can I have just a few moments Mr Dees you dont seem to understand what Im  Just a few moments Dees smiled winningly How did you find out where I was anyway We have a stringer on a midMaine paper called the Kennebec Journal He said that although youd dropped out of the public view you were probably staying with your father Well I owe him a real debt of thanks dont I Sure Dees said easily Im betting youll think so when you hear the whole deal May I All right Johnny said But just because you flew up here on Panic Airlines Im not going to change my mind Well however you see it Its a free country isnt it Sure it is Inside View specializes in a psychic view of things Mr Smith as you probably know Our readers to be perfectly frank are out of their gourds for this stuff We have a weekly circulation of three million Three million readers every week Mr Smith hows that for a long shot straight down the fairway How do we do it We stick with the upbeat the spiritual Twin Babies Eaten By Killer Bear Johnny murmured Dees shrugged Sure well its a tough old world isnt it People have to be informed about these things Its their right to know But for every downbeat article weve got three others telling our readers how to lose weight painlessly how to find sexual happiness and compatibility how to get closer to God Do you believe in God Mr Dees Actually I dont Dees said and smiled his winning smile But we live in a democracy greatest country on earth right Everyone is the captain of his own soul No the point is our readers believe in God They believe in angels and miracles And exorcisms and devils and Black Masses  Right right right You catch Its a spiritual audience They believe all this psychic bushwah We have a total of ten psychics under contract including Kathleen Nolan the most famous seer in America Wed like to put you under contract Mr Smith Would you Indeed we would What would it mean for you Your picture and a short column would appear roughly twelve times a year when we run one of our AllPsychic issues Inside Views Ten Famous Psychics Preview the Second Ford Administration that sort of thing We always do a New Years issue and one each Fourth of July on the course of America over the next year  thats always a very informative issue lots of chip shots on foreign policy and economic policy in that one  plus assorted other goodies I dont think you understand Johnny said He was speaking very slowly as if to a child Ive had a couple of precognitive bursts  I suppose you could say I saw the future  but I dont have any control over it I could no more come up with a prediction for the second Ford administration  if there ever is one  than I could milk a bull Dees looked horrified Who said you could Staff writers do all those columns Staff Johnny gaped at Dees finally shocked Of course Dees said impatiently Look One of our most popular guys over the last couple of years has been Frank Ross the guy who specializes in natural disasters Hell of a nice guy but Jesus Christ he quit school in the ninth grade He did two hitches in the Army and was swamping out Greyhound buses at the Port Authority terminal in New York when we found him You think wed let him write his own column Hed misspell cat But the predictions A free hand nothing but a free hand But youd be surprised how often these guys and gals get stuck for a real whopper Whopper Johnny repeated bemused He was a little surprised to find himself getting angry His mother had bought inside View for as long as he could remember all the way back to the days when they had featured pictures of bloody car wrecks decapitations and bootlegged execution photos She had sworn by every word Presumably the greater part of inside Views other  readers did as well And here sat this fellow with his dyed gray hair and his fortydollar shoes and his shirt with the storecreases still in it talking about whoppers But it all works out Dees was saying If you ever get stuck all you have to do is call us collect and we all take it into the proshop together and come up with something We have the right to anthologize your columns in our yearly book Inside Views of Things to Come Youre perfectly free to sign any contract you can get with a book publisher however All we get is first refusal on the magazine rights and we hardly ever refuse I can tell you And we pay very handsomely Thats over and above whatever figure we contract for Gravy on your mashed potatoes you might say Dees chuckled And what might that figure be Johnny asked slowly He was gripping the arms of his rocker A vein in his right temple pulsed rhythmically Thirty thousand dollars per year for two years Dees said And if you prove popular that figure would become negotiable Now all our psychics have some area of expertise I understand that youre good with objects Deess eyes became halflidded dreamy I see a regular feature Twice monthly maybe  we dont want to run a good thing into the ground John Smith invites inside Viewers to send in personal belongings for psychic examination Something like that Wed make it clear of course that they should send in inexpensive stuff because nothing could be returned But youd be surprised Some people are crazy as bedbugs God love em Youd be surprised at some of the stuff that would come in Diamonds gold coins wedding rings and we could attach a rider to the contract specifying that all objects mailed in would become your personal property Now Johnny began to see tones of dull red before his eyes People would send things in and Id just keep them Thats what youre saying Sure I dont see any problem with that Its just a question of keeping the ground rules clear up front A little extra gravy for those mashed potatoes Suppose Johnny said carefully keeping his voice even and modulated suppose I got   stuck for a whopper as you put it  and I just called in and said President Ford was going to be assassinated on September   Not because I felt he was but because I was stuck Well September only has thirty days you know Dees said But otherwise I think its a hole in one Youre going to be a natural Johnny You think big Thats good Youd be surprised how many of these people think small Afraid to put their mouths where their money is I suppose One of our guys  Tim Clark out in Idaho wrote in two weeks ago and said hed had a flash that Earl Butz was going to be forced to resign next year Well pardon my French but who gives a fuck Whos Earl Butz to the American housewife But you have good waves Johnny You were made for this stuff Good waves Johnny muttered Dees was looking at him curiously You feel all right Johnny You look a little white Johnny was thinking f the lady who had sent the scarf Probably she read Inside View too Let me see if I can summarize this he said Youd pay me thirty thousand dollars a year for my name And your picture dont forget And my picture for a few ghostwritten columns Also a feature where I tell people what they want to know about objects they send in As an extra added attraction I get to keep the stuff If the lawyers can work it out  as my personal property That the deal Thats the bare bones of the deal Johnny The way these things feed each other its just amazing Youll be a household word in six months and after that the sky is the limit The Carson show Personal appearances Lecture tours Your book of course pick your house theyre practically throwing money at psychics along Publishers Row Kathy Nolan started with a contract like the one were offering you and she makes over two hundred thou a year now Also she founded her own church and the IRS cant touch dimeone of her money She doesnt miss a trick does our Kathy Dees leaned forward grinning I tell you Johnny the sky is the limit Ill bet Well What do you think Johnny leaned forward toward Dees He grabbed the sleeve of Deess new LL Bean shirt in one hand and the collar of Deess new LL Bean shirt in the other Hey What the hell do you think youre Johnny bunched the shirt in both hands and drew Dees forward Five months of daily exercise had toned up the muscles in his hands and arms to a formidable degree You asked me what I thought Johnny said His head was beginning to throb and ache Ill tell you I think youre a ghoul A grave robber of peoples dreams I think someone ought to put you to work at RotoRooter I think your mother should have died of cancer the day after she conceived you If theres a hell I hope you burn there You cant talk to me like that Dees cried His voice rose to a fishwifes shriek Youre fucking crazy Forget it Forget the whole thing you stupid hick sonofabitch I You had your chance Dont come crawling around Furthermore you sound like youre talking through a Saltine box Johnny said standing up He lifted Dees with him The tails of his shirt popped out of the waistband of his new jeans revealing a fishnet undershirt beneath Johnny began to shake Dees methodically back and forth Dees forgot about being angry He began to blubber and roar Johnny dragged him to the porch steps raised one foot and planted it squarely in the seat of the new Levis Dees went down in two big steps still blubbering and roaring He fell in the dirt and sprawled full length When he got up and turned around to face Johnny his countrycousin duds were caked with dooryard dust It made them look more real somehow Johnny thought but doubted if Dees would appreciate that I ought to put the cops on you he said hoarsely And maybe I will You do whatever turns you on Johnny said But the law around here doesnt take too kindly to people who stick their noses in where they havent been invited Deess face worked in an uneasy contortion of fear anger and shock God help you if you ever need us he said Johnnys head was aching fiercely now but he kept his voice even Thats just right he said I couldnt agree more Youre going to be sorry you know Three million readers That cuts both ways When we get done with you the people in this country wouldnt believe you if you predicted spring in April They wouldnt believe you if you said the World Series is going to come in October They wouldnt believe you if  if  Dees spluttered furious Get out of here you cheap cocksucker Johnny said You can kiss off that book Dees screamed apparently summoning up the worst thing he could think of With his working knotted face and his dustcaked shirt he looked like a kid having a classA tantrum His Brooklyn accent had deepened and darkened to the point where it was almost a patois Theyll laugh you out of every publishing house in New York Nightstand Readers wouldnt touch you when I get done with you There are ways of fixing smart guys like you and we got em fuckhead We I guess Ill go get my Remmy and shoot myself a trespasser Johnny remarked Dees retreated to his rental car still shouting threats and obscenities Johnny stood on the porch and watched him his head thudding sickly Dees got in revved the cars engine mercilessly and then screamed out throwing dirt into the air in clouds He let the car drift just enough on his way out to knock the chopping block by the shed flying Johnny grinned a little at that in spite of his bad head He could set up the chopping block a lot more easily than Dees was going to be able to explain the big dent in that Fords front fender to the Hertz people Afternoon sun twinkled on chrome again as Dees sprayed gravel all the way up the driveway to the road Johnny sat down in the rocker again and put his forehead in his hand and got ready to wait out the headache  Youre going to do what the banker asked outside and below traffic passed back and forth along the bucolic main street of Ridgeway New Hampshire On the walls of the bankers pinepanelled thirdfloor office were Frederick Remington prints and photographs of the banker at local functions On his desk was a lucite cube and embedded in this cube were pictures of his wife and son Im going to run for the House of Representatives next year Greg Stillson repeated He was dressed in khaki suntan pants a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a black tie with a single blue figure He looked out of place in the bankers office somehow as if at any moment he might rise to his feet and begin an aimless destructive charge around the room knocking over furniture sweeping the expensively framed Remington prints to the floor pulling the drapes from their rods The banker Charles Chuck Gendron president of the local Lions Club laughed  a bit uncertainly Stillson had a way of making people feel uncertain As a boy he had been scrawny perhaps he liked to tell people that a high wind woulda blowed me away but in the end his fathers genes had told and sitting here in Gendrons office he looked very much like the Oklahoma oufield roughneck that his father had been He frowned at Gendrons chuckle I mean George Harvey might have something to say about that mightnt he Greg George Harvey besides being a mover and a shaker in town politics was the third district Republican godfather George wont say boo Greg said calmly There was a salting of gray in his hair but his face suddenly looked very much like the face of the man who long ago had kicked a dog to death in an Iowa farmyard His voice was patient George is going to be on the sidelines but hes gonna be on my side of the sidelines if you get my meaning I aint going to be stepping on his toes because Im going to run as an independent I dont have twenty years to spend learning the ropes and licking boots Chuck Gendron said hesitantly Youre kidding arent you Greg Gregs frown returned It was forbidding Chuck I never kid People they think I kid The UnionLeader and those yoyos on the Daily Democrat they think I kid But you go see George Harvey You ask him if I kid around or if I get the job done You ought to know better too After all we buried some bodies together didnt we Chuck The frown metamorphosed into a somehow chilling grin  chilling to Gendron perhaps because he had allowed himself to be pulled along on a couple of Greg Stilisons development schemes They had made money yes of course they had that wasnt the problem But there had been a couple of aspects of the Sunningdale Acres development and the Laurel Estates deal as well to be honest that hadnt been  well strictly legal A bribed EPA agent for one thing but that wasnt the worst thing On the Laurel Estates thing there had been an old man out on the Back Ridgeway Road who hadnt wanted to sell and first the old mans fourteenorso chickens had died of some mysterious ailment and second there had been a fire in the old mans potato house and third when the old man came back from visiting his sister who was in a nursing home in Keene one weekend not so long ago someone bad smeared dogshit all over the old mans living room and dining room and fourth the old man had sold and fifth Laurel Estates was now a fact of life And maybe sixth That motorcycle spook Sonny Elliman was hanging around again He and Greg were good buddies and the only thing that kept that from being town gossip was the counterbalancing fact that Greg was seen in the company of a lot of heads hippies freaks and cyclists  as a direct result of the Drug Counselling Center he had set up plus Ridgeways rather unusual program for young drug alcohol and road offenders Instead of fining them or locking them up the town took out their services in trade It had been Gregs idea  and a good one the banker would be the first to admit It had been one of the things that had helped Greg to get elected mayor But this  this was utter craziness Greg had said something else Gendron wasnt sure what Pardon me he said I asked you how youd like to be my campaign manager Greg repeated Greg  Gendron had to clear his throat and start again Greg you dont seem to understand Harrison Fisher is the Third District representative in Washington Harrison Fisher is Republican respected and probably eternal No one is eternal Greg said Harrison is damn close Gendron said Ask Harvey They went to school together Back around  I think Greg took no notice of this thin witticism Ill call myself a Bull Moose or something  and everyone will think Im kidding around  and in the end the good people of the Third District are going to laugh me all the way to Washington Greg youre crazy Gregs smile disappeared as if it had never been there Something frightening happened to his face It became very still and his eyes widened to show too much of the whites They were like the eyes of a horse that smells bad water You dont want to say something like that Chuck Ever The banker felt more than chilled now Greg I apologize Its just that No you dont ever want to say that to me unless you want to find Sonny Elliman waiting for you some afternoon when you go out to get your big fucking Imperial Gendrons mouth moved but no sound came out Greg smiled again and it was like the sun suddenly breaking through threatening clouds Never mind We dont want to be kicking sand if were going to be working together Greg I want you because you know every damn business man in this part of New Hampshire Were gonna have plenty good money once we get this thing rolling but I figure well have to prime the pump Nows the time for me to expand a little and start looking like the states man as well as Ridgeways man I figure fifty thousand dollars ought to be enough to fertilize the grass roots The banker who had worked for Harrison Fisher in his last four canvasses was so astounded by Gregs political naivete that at first he was at a loss on how to proceed At last he said Greg Businessmen contribute to campaigns not out of the goodness of their hearts but because the winner ends up owing them something in a close campaign theyll contribute to any candidate who has a chance of winning because they can write off the loser as a tax loss as well But the operant phrase is chance of winning Now Fisher is a Shooin Greg supplied He produced an envelope from his back pocket Want you to look at these Gendron looked doubtfully at the envelope then up at Greg Greg nodded encouragingly The banker opened the envelope There was a long silence in the pinepanelled office after Gendrons initial gasp for breath It was unbroken except for the faint hum of the digital clock on the bankers desk and the hiss of a match as Greg lit a Phillies cheroot On the walls of the office were Frederick Remington pictures In the lucite cube were family pictures Now spread on the desk were pictures of the banker with his head buried between the thighs of a young woman with black hair  or it might have been red the pictures were highgrain blackandwhite glossies and it was hard to tell The womans face was very clear It was not the face of the bankers wife Some residents of Ridge way would have recognized it as the face of one of the waitresses at Bobby Strangs truckstop two towns over The pictures of the banker with his head between the legs of the waitress were the safe ones  her face was clear but his was not In others his own grandmother would have recognized him There were pictures of Gendron and the waitress involved in a whole medley of sexual delights  hardly all the positions of the Kama Sutra but there were several positions represented that had never made the Sexual Relationships chapter of the Ridgeway High health textbook Gendron looked up his face cheesy his hands trembling His heart was galloping in his chest He feared a heart attack Greg was not even looking at him He was looking out the window at the bright blue slice of October sky visible between the Ridgeway Five and Ten and the Ridgeway Card and Notion Shoppe The winds of change have started to blow he said and his face was distant and preoccupied almost mystical He looked back at Gendron One of those drugfreaks down at the Center you know what he gave me Chuck Gendron shook his head numbly With one of his shaking hands he was massaging the left side if his chest  just in case His eyes kept falling to the photographs The damning photographs What if his secretary came in right now He stopped massaging his chest and began gathering up the pictures stuffing them back into the envelope He gave me Chairman Maos little red book Greg said A chuckle rumbled up from the barrel chest that had once been so thin part of a body that had mostly disgusted his idolized father And one of the proverbs in there  I cant remember exactly how it went but it was something like The man who senses the wind of change should build not a windbreak but a windmill That was the flavor of it anyway He leaned forward Harrison Fishers not a shooin hes a hasbeen Ford is a hasbeen Muskies a hasbeen Humphreys a hasbeen A lot of local and state politicians all the way across this country are going to wake up the day after election day and find out that theyre as dead as dodo birds They forced Nixon out and the next year they forced out the people who stood behind him in the impeachment hearings and next year theyll force out Jerry Ford for the same reason Greg Stillsons eyes blazed at the banker You want to see the wave of the future Look up in Maine at this guy Longley The Republicans ran a guy named Erwin and the Democrats ran a guy named Mitchell and when they counted the votes for governor they both got a big surprise because the people went and elected themselves an insurance man from Lewiston that didnt want any part of either party Now theyre talking about him as a dark horse candidate for president Gendron still couldnt talk Greg drew in his breath Theyre all gonna think Im kiddin see They thought Longley was kiddin But Im not kiddin Im building windmills And youre gonna supply the building materials He ceased Silence fell in the office except for the hum of the clock At last Gendron whispered Where did you get these pictures Was it that Elliman Aw hey You dont want to talk about that You forget all about those pictures Keep them And who keeps the negatives Chuck Greg said earnestly you dont understand Im offering you Washington Skys the limit boy Im not even asking you to raise that much money Like I said just a bucket of water to help prime the pump When we get rolling plenty of money is going to come in Now you know the guys that have money You have lunch with them down at the Caswell House You play poker with them You have written them commercial loans tied to the prime rate at no more than their say so And you know how to put an armlock on them Greg you dont understand you dont Greg stood up The way I just put an armlock on you he said The banker looked up at him His eyes rolled helplessly Greg Stillson thought he looked like a sheep that had been led neatly to the slaughter Fifty thousand dollars he said You find it He walked out closing the door gently behind him Gendron heard his booming voice even through the thick walls bandying with his secretary His secretary was a sixtyyearold flatchested biddy and Stillson probably had her giggling like a schoolgirl He was a buffoon It was that as much as his programs for coping with youthful crime that had made him mayor of Ridgeway But the people didnt elect buffoons to Washington Well  hardly ever That wasnt his problem Fifty thousand dollars in campaign contributions that was his problem His mind began to scurry around the problem like a trained white rat scurrying around a piece of cheese on a plate It could probably be done Yes it could probably be done  but would it end there The white envelope was still on his desk His smiling wife looked at it from her place in the lucite cube He scooped the envelope up and jammed it into the inner pocket of his suitcoat It had been Elliman somehow Elliman had found out and had taken the pictures he was sure of it But it had been Stillson who told him what to do Maybe the man wasnt such a buffoon after all His assessment of the political climate of  wasnt completely stupid Building windmills instead of windbreaks  the skys the limit But that wasnt his problem Fifty thousand dollars was his problem Chuck Gendron president of the Lions and allround good fellow last year he had ridden one of those small funny motorcycles in the Ridgeway Fourth of July parade pulled a yellow legal tablet out of the top drawer of his desk and began jotting down a list of names The trained white rat at work And down on Main Street Greg Stillson turned his face up into the strong autumn sunlight and congratulated himself on a job welldone  or wellbegun Later Johnny supposed that the reason he ended up finally making love to Sarah  almost five years to the day after the fair  had a lot to do with the visit of Richard Dees the man from inside View The reason he finally weakened and called Sarah and invited her to come and visit was little more than a wistful urge to have someone nice to come to call and take the nasty taste out of his mouth Or so he told himself He called her in Kennebunk and got the former roommate who said Sarah would be right with him The phone clunked down and there was a moment of silence when he contemplated but not very seriously just hanging up and closing the books for good Then Sarahs voice was in his ear Johnny Is it you The very same How are you Fine Hows by you Im fine she said Glad you called I didnt know if you would Still sniffin that wicked cocaine No Im on heroin now You got your boy with you I sure do Dont go anywhere without him Well why dont the two of you truck on out here some day before you have to go back up north Id like that Johnny she said warmly Dads working in Westbrook and Im chief cook and bottlewasher He gets home around fourthirty and we eat around fivethirty Youre welcome to stay for dinner but be warned all my best dishes use FrancoAmencan spaghetti as their base She giggled Invitation accepted Which day is best What about tomorrow or the day after Sarah Tomorrows fine she said after the briefest of hesitations See you then Take care Sarah You too He hung up thoughtfully feeling both excited and guilty  for no good reason at all But your mind went where it wanted to didnt it And where his mind wanted to go now was to examine possibilities maybe best left unconsidered Well she knows the thing she needs to know She knows what time dad comes home  what else does she need to know And his mind answered itself What you going to do if she shows up at noon Nothing he answered and didnt wholly believe it Just thinking about Sarah the set of her lips the small upward tilt of her green eyes  those were enough to make him feel weak and sappy and a little desperate Johnny went out to the kitchen and slowly began to put together this nights supper not so important just for two Father and son batching it It hadnt been all that bad He was still healing He and his father had talked about the fourandahalf years he had missed about his mother  working around that carefully but always seeming to come a little closer to the center in a tightening spiral Not needing to understand maybe but needing to come to terms No it hadnt been that bad It was a way to finish putting things together For both of them But it would be over in January when he returned to Cleaves Mills to teach He had gotten his halfyear contract from Dave Pelsen the week before had signed it and sent it back What would his father do then Go on Johnny supposed People had a way of doing that just going on pushing through with no particular drama no big drumrolls He would get down to visit Herb as often as he could every weekend if that felt like the right thing to do So many things had gotten strange so fast that all he could do was feel his way slowly along groping like a blind man in an unfamiliar room He put the roast in the oven went into the living room snapped on the TV then snapped it off again He sat down and thought about Sarah The baby he thought The baby will be our chaperon if she comes early So that was all right after all All bases covered But his thoughts were still long and uneasily speculative  She came at quarter past twelve the next day wheeling a snappy little red Pinto into the driveway and parking it getting out looking tall and beautiful her dark blonde hair caught in the mild October wind Hi Johnny  she called raising her hand Sarah He came down to meet her she lifted her face and he kissed her cheek lightly Just let me get the emperor she said opening the passenger door Can I help Naw we get along just fine together dont we Denny Come on kiddo Moving deftly she unbuckled the straps holding a pudgy little baby in the car seat She lifted him out Denny stared around the yard with wild solemn interest and then his eyes fixed on Johnny and held there He smiled Vig Denny said and waved both hands I think he wants to go to you Sarah said Very unusual Denny has his fathers Republican sensibilities hes rather standoffish Want to hold him Sure Johnny said a little doubtfully Sarah grinned He wont break and you wont drop him she said and handed Denny over If you did hed probably bounce right up like Silly Putty Disgustingly fat baby Vun bunk  Denny said curling one arm nonchalantly around Johnnys neck and looking comfortably at his mother It really is amazing Sarah said He never takes to people like Johnny Johnny When the baby put his arm around Johnnys neck a confused rush of feelings had washed over him like mild warm water There was nothing dark nothing troubling Everything was very simple There was no concept of the future in the babys thoughts No feeling of trouble No sense of past unhappiness And on words only strong images warmth dryness the mother the man that was himself Johnny She was looking at him apprehensively Hmmmm Is everything all right Shes asking me about Denny he realized Is everything all right with Denny Do you see trouble Problems Everythings fine he said We can go inside if you want but I usually roost on the porch Itll be time to crouch around the stove all day long soon enough I think the porch will be super And Denny looks as if hed like to try out the yard Great yard he says Right kiddo She ruffled his hair and Denny laughed Hell be okay As long as he doesnt try to eat any of those woodchips Ive been splitting stovelengths Johnny said setting Denny down as carefully as a Ming vase Good exercise How are you Physically I think Johnny said remembering the heaveho he had given Richard Dees a few days ago that Im doing as well as could be expected Thats good You were kinda low the last time I saw you Johnny nodded The operations Johnny He glanced at her and again felt that odd mix of speculation guilt and something like anticipation in his viscera Her eyes were on his face frankly and openly Yeah Do you remember about the wedding ring He nodded It was there Where you said it would be I threw it away Did you He was not completely surprised I threw it away and never mentioned it to Walt She shook her head And I dont know why Its bothered me ever since Dont let it They were standing on the steps facing each other Color had come up in her cheeks but she didnt drop her eyes Theres something Id like to finish she said simply Something we never had the chance to finish Sarah  he began and stopped He had absolutely no idea what to say next Below them Denny tottered six steps and then sat down hard He crowed not put out of countenance at all Yes she said I dont know if its right or wrong I love Walt Hes a good man easy to love Maybe the one thing I know is a good man from a bad one Dan  that guy I went with in college  was one of the bad guys You set my mouth for the other kind Johnny Without you I never could have appreciated Walt for what he is Sarah you dont have  I do have to Sarah contradicted Her voice was low and intense Because things like this you can only say once And you either get it wrong or right its the end either way because its too hard to ever try to say again She looked at him pleadingly Do you understand Yes I suppose I do I love you Johnny she said I never stopped Ive tried to tell myself that it was an act of God that split us up I dont know Is a bad hot dog an act of God Or two kids dragging on a back road in the middle of the night All I want  Her voice had taken on a peculiar flat emphasis that seemed to beat its way into the cool October afternoon like an artisans small hammer into thin and precious foil  all I want is what was taken from us Her voice faltered She looked down And I want it with all my heart Johnny Do you Yes he said He put his arms out and was confused when she shook her head and stepped away Not in front of Denny she said Its stupid maybe but that would be a little bit too much like public infidelity I want everything Johnny Her color rose again and her pretty blush began to feed his own excitement I want you to hold me and kiss me and love me she said Her voice faltered nearly broke I think its wrong but I cant help it Its wrong but its right Its fair He reached out One finger and brushed away a tear that was moving slowly down her cheek And its only this once isnt it She nodded Once will have to put paid to everything Everything that would have been if things hadnt gone wrong She looked up her eyes brighter green than ever swimming with tears Can we put paid to everything with only the one time Johnny No he said smiling But we can try Sarah She looked fondly down at Denny who was trying to climb up onto the chopping block without much success Hell sleep she said  They sat on the porch and watched Denny play in the yard under the high blue sky There was no hurry no impatience between them but there was a growing electricity that they both felt She had opened her coat and sat on the porch glider in a powderblue wool dress her ankles crossed her hair blown carelessly on her shoulders where the wind had spilled it The blush never really left her face And high white clouds fled across the sky west to east They talked of inconsequential things  there was no hurry For the first time since he had come out of it Johnny felt that time was not his enemy Time had provided them with this little air pocket in exchange for the main flow of which they had been robbed and it would be here for as long as they needed it They talked about people who had been married about a girl from Cleaves Mills who had won a Merit scholarship about Maines independent governor Sarah said he looked like Lurch on the old Addams Family show and thought like Herbert Hoover and they both laughed over that Look at him Sarah said nodding toward Denny He was sitting on the grass by Vera Smiths ivy trellis his thumb in his mouth looking at them sleepily She got his carbed out of the Pintos back seat Will he be okay on the porch she asked Johnny Its so mild Id like to have him nap in the fresh air Hell be fine on the porch Johnny said She Set the bed in the shade popped him into it and pulled the two blankets up to his chin Sleep baby Sarah said He smiled at her and promptly closed his eyes Just like that Johnny asked Just like that she agreed She stepped close to him and put her arms around his neck Quite clearly he could hear the faint rustle of her slip beneath her dress Id like you to kiss me she said calmly Ive waited five years for you to kiss me again Johnny He put his arms around her waist and kissed her gently Her lips parted Oh Johnny she said against his neck I love you I love you too Sarah Where do we go she asked stepping away from him Her eyes were as dear and dark as emeralds now Where  He spread the faded army blanket which was old but clean on the straw of the second loft The smell was fragrant and sweet High above them there was the mysterious coo and flutter of the barn swallows and then they settled down again There was a small dusty window which looked down on the house and porch Sarah wiped a clean place on the glass and looked down at Denny Its okay Johnny asked Yes Better here than in the house That would have been like She shrugged Making my dad a part of it Yes This is between us Our business Our business she agreed She lay on her stomach her face turned to one side on the faded blanket her legs bent at the knee She pushed her shoes off one by one Unzip me Johnny He knelt beside her and pulled the zipper down The sound was loud in the stillness Her back was the color of coffee with cream against the whiteness of her slip He kissed her between the shoulder blades and she shivered Sarah he murmured What I have to tell you something What The doctor made a mistake during one of those operations and gelded me She punched him on the shoulder Same old Johnny she said And you had a friend once who broke his neck on the crackthewhip at Topsham Fair Sure he said Her hand touched him like silk moving gently up and down It doesnt feel like they did anything terminal to you she said Her luminous eyes searched his Not at all Shall we look and see There was the sweet smell of the hay Time spun out There was the rough feel of the army blanket the smooth feel of her flesh the naked reality of her Sinking into her was like sinking into an old dream that had never been quite forgotten Oh Johnny my dear  Her voice in rising excitement Her hips moving in a quickening tempo Her voice was far away The touch of her hair was like fire on his shoulder and chest He plunged his face deeply into it losing himself in that darkblonde darkness Time spinning out in the sweet smell of hay The roughtextured blanket The sound of the old barn creaking gently like a ship in the October wind Mild white light coming in through the roof chinks catching motes of chaff in half a hundred pencilthin sunbeams Motes of chaff dancing and revolving She cried out At some point she cried out his name again and again and again like a chant Her fingers dug into him like spurs Rider and ridden Old wine decanted at last a fine vintage Later they sat by the window looking out into the yard Sarah slipped her dress on over bare flesh and left him for a little bit He sat alone not thinking content to watch her reappear in the window smaller and cross the yard to the porch She bent over the baby bed and readjusted the blankets She came back the wind blowing her hair out behind her and tugging playfully at the hem of her dress Hell sleep another half hour she said Will he Johnny smiled Maybe I will too She walked her bare toes across his belly You better not And so again and this time she was on top almost in an attitude of prayer her head bent her hair swinging forward and obscuring her face Slowly And then it was over  Sarah No Johnny Better not say it Times up I was going to say that youre beautiful Am I You are he said softly Dear Sarah Did we put paid to everything she asked him Johnny smiled Sarah we did the best we could  Herb didnt seem surprised to see Sarah when he got home from Westbrook He welcomed her made much of the baby and then scolded Sarah for not bringing him down sooner He has your color and complexion Herb said And I think hes going to have your eyes when they get done changing if only he has his fathers brains Sarah said She had put an apron on over the blue wool dress Outside the sun was going down Another twenty minutes and it would be dark You know the cooking is supposed to be Johnnys job Herb said Couldnt stop her She put a gun to my head Well maybe its all for the best Herb said Everything you make comes out tasting like FrancoAmerican spaghetti Johnny shied a magazine at him and Denny laughed a high piercing sound that seemed to fill the house Can he see Johnny wondered It feels like its written all over my face And then a startling thought came to him as he watched his father digging in the entryway closet for a box of Johnnys old toys that he had never let Vera give away Maybe he understands They ate Herb asked Sarah what Walt was doing in Washington and she told them about the conference he was attending which had to do with Indian land claims The Republican meetings were mostly windtesting exercises she said Most of the people hes meeting with think that if Reagan is nominated over Ford next year its going to mean the death of the party Sarah said And if the Grand Old Party dies that means Walt wont be able to run for Bill Cohens seat in  when Cohen goes after Bill Hathaways Senate seat Herb was watching Denny eat string beans seriously one by one using all six of his teeth on them I dont think Cohen will be able to wait until  to get in the Senate Hell run against Muskie next year Walt says Bill Cohens not that big a dope Sarah said Hell wait Walt says his own chance is coming and Im starting to believe him After supper they sat in the living room and the talk turned away from politics They watched Denny play with the old wooden cars and trucks that a much younger Herb Smith had made for his own son over a quarter of a century ago A younger Herb Smith who had been married to a tough goodhumored woman who would sometimes drink a bottle of Black Label beer in the evening A man with no gray in his hair and nothing but the highest hopes for his son He does understand Johnny thought sipping his coffee Whether he knows what went on between Sarah and me this afternoon whether or not he suspects what might have gone on he understands the basic cheat You cant change it or rectify it the best you can do is try to come to terms This afternoon she and I consummated a marriage that never was And tonight hes playing with his grandson He thought of the Wheel of Fortune slowing stopping House number Everyone loses Gloom was trying to creep up a dismal sense of finality and he pushed it away This wasnt the time he wouldnt let it be the time By eightthirty Denny had begun to get scratchy and cross and Sarah said Time for us to go folks He can suck a bottle on our way back to Kennebunk About three miles from here hell have corked off Thanks for having us Her eyes brilliant green found Johnnys for a moment Our pleasure entirely Herb said standing up Right Johnny Right he said Let me carry that carbedout for you Sarah At the door Herb kissed the top of Dennys head and Denny grabbed Herbs nose in his chubby fist and honked it hard enough to make Herbs eyes water and Sarahs cheek Johnny carried the carbed down to the red Pinto and Sarah gave him the keys so he could put everything in the back When he finished she was standing by the drivers door looking at him It was the best we could do she said and smiled a little But the brilliance of her eyes told him the tears were close again It wasnt so bad at all Johnny said Well stay in touch I dont know Sarah Will we No I suppose not It would be too easy wouldnt it Pretty easy yes She stepped close and stretched to kiss his cheek He could smell her hair clean and fragrant Take care she whispered Ill think about you Be good Sarah he said and touched her nose She turned then got in behind the wheel a smart young matron whose husband was on the way up I doubt like hell if theyll be driving a Pinto next year Johnny thought The lights came on then the little sewing machine motor roared She raised a hand to him and then she was pulling out of the driveway Johnny stood by the chopping block hands in his pockets and watched her go Something in his heart seemed to have closed It was not a major feeling That was the worst of it  it wasnt a major feeling at all He watched until the taillights were out of sight and then he climbed the porch steps and went back into the house His dad was sitting in the big easy chair in the living room The TV was off The few toys he had found in the closet were scattered on the rug and he was looking at them Good to see Sarah Herb said Did you and she have  there was the briefest most minute hesitation  a nice visit Yes Johnny said Shell be down again No I dont think so He and his father were looking at each other Well now maybe thats for the best Herb said finally Yes Maybe so You played with these toys Herb said getting down on his knees and beginning to gather them up I gave a bunch of them to Lottie Gedreau when she had her twins but I knew I had a few of them left I saved a few back He put them back in the box one at a time turning each of them over in his hands examining them A race car A bulldozer A police car A small hookandladder truck from which most of the red paint had been worn away where a small hand would grip He took them back to the entryway closet and put them away Johnny didnt see Sarah Hazlett again for three years The snow came early that year There were six inches on the ground by November  and Johnny had taken to lacing on a pair of old green gumrubber boots and wearing his old parka for the trek up to the mailbox Two weeks before Dave Pelsen had mailed down a package containing the texts he would be using in January and Johnny had already begun making tentative lesson plans He was looking forward to getting back Dave had also found him an apartment on Howland Street in Cleaves  Howland Street Johnny kept that on a scrap of paper in his wallet because the name and number had an irritating way of slipping his mind On this day the skies were slatey and lowering the temperature hovering just below the twenty degree mark As Johnny tramped up the driveway the first spats of snow began to drift down Because he was alone he didnt feel too self conscious about running his tongue out and trying to catch a flake on it He was hardly limping at all and he felt good There hadnt been a headache in two weeks or more The mail consisted of an advertising circular a Newsweek and a small manila envelope addressed to John Smith no return address Johnny opened it on the way back the rest of the mail stuffed into his hip pocket He pulled out a single page of newsprint saw the words Inside View at the top and came to a halt halfway back to the house It was page three of the previous weeks issue The headline story dealt with a reporters expose on the handsome second banana of a TV crime show the second banana had been suspended from high school twice twelve years ago and busted for possession of cocaine six years ago Hot news for the hausfraus of America There was also an allgrain diet a cute baby photo and a story of a nineyearold girl who had been miraculously cured of cerebral palsy at Lourdes DOCTORS MYSTIFIED the headline trumpeted gleefully A story near the bottom of the page had been circled MAINE PSYCHIC ADMITS HOAX the headline read The story was not bylined IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE POLICY of Inside View not only to bring you the fullest coverage of the psychics which the socalled National Press ignores but to expose the tricksters and charlatans who have held back true acceptance of legitimate psychic phenomena for so long One of these tricksters admitted his own hoax to an Inside View source recently This so called psychic John Smith of Pownal Maine admitted to our source that it was all a gimmick to pay back my hospital bills If theres a book in it I might come out with enough to pay off what I owe and retire for a couple of years in the bargain Smith grinned These days people will believe anything  why shouldnt I get on the gravy train Thanks to Inside View which has always cautioned readers that there are two phony psychics for each real one John Smiths gravy train has just been derailed And we reiterate our standing offer of  to anyone who can prove that any nationally known psychic is a fraud Hoaxers and charlatans be warned Johnny read the article twice as the snow began to come down more heavily A reluctant grin broke over his features The evervigilant press apparently didnt enjoy being thrown off some bumpkins front porch he thought He tucked the tear sheet back into its envelope and stuffed it into his back pocket with the rest of the mail Dees he said aloud I hope youre still black and blue  His father was not so amused Herb read the clipping and then slammed it down on the kitchen table in disgust You ought to sue that son of a whore Thats nothing but slander Johnny A deliberate hatchet job Agreed and agreed Johnny said It was dark outside This afternoons silently falling snow had developed into tonights early winter blizzard The wind shrieked and howled around the eaves The driveway had disappeared under a dunelike progression of drifts But there was no third party when we talked and Dees damn well knows it Its his word against mine He didnt even have the guts to put his own name to this lie Herb said Look at this an Inside View source Whats this source Get him to name it thats what I say Oh you cant do that Johnny said grinning Thats like walking up to the meanest streetfighter on the block with a KICK ME HARD sign taped to your crotch Then they turn it into a holy war page one and all No thanks As far as Im concerned they did me a favor I dont want to make a career out of telling people where gramps hid his stock certificates or whos going to win the fourth at Scarborough Downs Or take this lottery One of the things that had most surprised Johnny on coming out of his coma was to discover that Maine and about a dozen other states had instituted a legal numbers game In the last month Ive gotten sixteen letters from people who want me to tell them what the numbers going to be Its insane Even if I could tell them which I couldnt what good would it do them You cant pick your own number in the Maine lottery you get what they give you But still I get the letters I dont see what that has to do with this crappy article If people think Im a phony maybe theyll leave me alone Oh Herb said Yeah I see what you mean He lit his pipe Youve never really been comfortable with it have you No Johnny said We never talk much about it either which is something of a relief It seems like the only thing other people do want to talk about And it wasnt just that they wanted to talk that wouldnt have bothered him so much But when he was in Slocums Store for a sixpack or a loaf of bread the girl would try to take his money without touching his hand and the frightened skittish look in her eyes was unmistakable His fathers friends would give him a little wave instead of a handshake In October Herb had hired a local high school girl to come in once a week to do some dusting and vacuum the floors After three weeks she had quit for no stated reason at all probably someone at her high school had told her who she was cleaning for It seemed that for everyone who was anxious to be touched to be informed to be in contact with Johnnys peculiar talent there was another who regarded him as a kind of leper At times like these Johnny would think of the nurses staring at him the day he had told Eileen Magown that her house was on fire staring at him like magpies on a telephone wire He would think of the way the TV reporter had drawn back from him after the press conferences unexpected conclusion agreeing with everything he said but not wanting to be touched Unhealthy either way No we dont talk about it Herb agreed It makes me think of your mother I suppose She was so sure youd been given the  the whateveritis for some reason Sometimes I wonder if she wasnt right Johnny shrugged All I want is a normal life I want to bury the whole damn thing And if this little squib helps me do it so much the better But you still can do it cant you Herb asked He was looking closely at his son Johnny thought about a night not quite a week ago They had gone out to dinner a rare happening on their strapped budget They had gone to Coles Farm in Gray probably the best restaurant in the area a place that was always packed The night had been cold the dining room cheery and warm Johnny had taken his fathers coat and his own into the cloakroom and as he thumbed through the racked coats looking for empty hangers a whole series of clear impressions had cascaded through his mind It was like that sometimes and on another occasion he could have handled every coat for twenty minutes and gotten nothing at all Here was a ladys coat with a fur collar She was having an affair with one of her husbands poker buddies was scared sick about it but didnt know how to close it off A mans denim jacket sheepskinlined This guy was also worried  about his brother who had been badly hurt on a construction project the week before A small boys parka  his grandmother in Durham had given him a Snoopy transistor radio just today and he was mad because his father hadnt let him bring it into the dining room with him And another one a plain black topcoat that had turned him cold with terror and robbed him of his appetite The man who owned this coat was going mad So far he had kept up appearances  not even his wife suspected  but his vision of the world was being slowly darkened by a series of increasingly paranoid fantasies Touching that Coat had been like touching a writhing coil of snakes Yes I can still do it Johnny said briefly I wish to hell I couldnt You really mean that Johnny thought of the plain black topcoat He had only picked at his meal looking this way and that trying to single the man out of the crowd unable to do so Yes he said I mean it Best forgotten then Herb said and clapped his son on the shoulder  And for the next month or so it seemed that it would be forgotten Johnny drove north to attend a meeting at the high school for midyear teachers and to take a load of his personal things up to his new apartment which he found small but liveable He went in his fathers car and as he was getting ready to leave Herb asked him Youre not nervous About driving Johnny shook his head Thoughts of the accident itself troubled him very little now If something was going to happen to him it would And deep down he felt confident that lightning would not strike in the same place again  when he died he didnt believe it would be in a car accident In fact the long trip was quiet and soothing the meeting a little bit like Old Home Week All of his old colleagues who were still teaching at CMHS dropped by to wish him the best But he couldnt help noticing how few of them actually shook hands with him and he seemed to sense a certain reserve a wariness in their eyes Drivmg home he convinced himself it was probably imagination And if not well  even that had its amusing side If they had read their Inside View they would know he was a hoax and nothing to worry about The meeting over there was nothing to do but go back to Pownal and wait for the Christmas holidays to come and go The packages containing personal objects stopped coming almost as if a switch had been thrown  the power of the press Johnny told his father They were replaced by a brief spate of angry  and mostly anonymous  letters and cards from people who seemed to feel personally cheated You ort to burn in H E L L for your slimey skeems to bilk this American Republic a typical one read It had been written on a crumpled sheet of Ramada Inn stationery and was postmarked York Pennsylvania You are nothing but a Con Artist and a dirty rotten cheet I bless God for that paper that saw thru you You Ort to be ashamed of yourself Sir The Bible says an ordinery sinner will be cast into the Lake of FIRE and be consomed but a FALSE PROFIT shall burn forever and EVER Thats you a False Profit who sold your Immortal Soul for a few cheep bucks So thats the end of my letter and I hope for your sake I never catch you ut on the Streets of your Home Town Signed A FRIEND of God not you Sir Over two dozen letters in this approximate vein came in during the course of about twenty days following the appearance of the inside View story Several enterprising souls expressed an interest in joining in with Johnny as partners I used to be a magicians assistant one of these latter missives bragged and I could trick an old whore out of her gstring If youre planning a mentalist gig you need me in Then the letters dried up as had the earlier influx of boxes and packages On a day in late November when he had checked the mailbox and found it empty for the third afternoon in a row Johnny walked back to the house remembering that Andy Warhol had predicted that a day would come when everyone in America would be famous for fifteen minutes Apparently his fifteen minutes had come and gone and no one was any more pleased about it than he was But as things turned out it wasnt over yet  Smith The telephone voice asked John Smith Yes It wasnt a voice he knew or a wrong number That made it something of a puzzle since his father had had the phone unlisted about three months ago This was December  and their tree stood in the corner of the living room its base firmly wedged into the old tree stand Herb had made when Johnny was just a kid Outside it was snowing My name is Bannerman Sheriff George Bannerman from Castle Rock He cleared his throat Ive got a well I suppose youd say Ive got a proposal for you How did you get this number Bannerman cleared his throat again Well I could have gotten it from the phone company I suppose it being police business But actually I got it from a friend of yours Doctor by the name of Weizak Sam Weizak gave you my number Thats right Johnny sat down in the phone nook utterly perplexed Now the name Bannerman meant something to him He had come across the name in a Sunday supplement article only recently He was the sheriff of Castle County which was considerably west of Pownal in the Lakes region Castle Rock was the county seat about thirty miles from Norway and twenty from Bridgton Police business he repeated Well I guess youd say so ayuh I was wondering if maybe the two of us could get together for a cup of coffee It involves Sam No Dr Weizak has nothing to do with it Bannerman said He gave me a call and mentioned your name That was oh a month ago at least To be frank I thought he was nuts But now were just about at our wits end About what Mr  Sheriff  Bannerman I dont understand what youre talking about Itd really be a lot better if we could get together for coffee Bannerman said Maybe this evening Theres a place called Jons on the main drag in Bridgton Sort of halfway between your town and mine No Im sorry Johnny said Id have to know what it was about And how come Sam never called me Bannerman sighed I guess youre a man who doesnt read the papers he said But that wasnt true He had read the papers compulsively since he had regained consciousness trying to pick up on the things he had missed And he had seen Bannermans name just recently Sure Because Bannerman was on a pretty hot seat He was the man in charge ofJohnny held the phone away from his ear and looked at it with sudden understanding He looked at it the way a man might look at a snake he has just realized is poisonous Mr Smith It squawked tinnily Hello Mr Smith Im here Johnny said putting the phone back to his ear He was conscious of a dull anger at Sam Weizak Sam who had told him to keep his head down only this summer and then had turned around and given this localyokel sheriff an earful  behind Johnnys back Its that strangling business isnt it Bannerman hesitated a long time Then he said Could we talk Mr Smith No Absolutely not The dull anger had ignited into sudden fury Fury and something else He was scared Mr Smith its important Today No I want to be left alone Besides dont you read the goddam inside View Im a fake anyway Dr Weizak said He had no business saying anything Johnny shouted He was shaking all over Goodbye He slammed the phone into its cradle and got out of the phone nook quickly as if that would prevent it from ringing again He could feel a headache beginning in his temples Dull drillbits Maybe I should call his mother out there in California he thought Tell her where her little sonnybuns is Tell her to get in touch Tit for tat Instead he hunted in the address book in the phonetable drawer found Sams office number in Bangor and called it As soon as it rang once on the other end he hung up scared again Why had Sam done that to him Goddammit why He found himself looking at the Christmas tree Same old decorations They had dragged them down from the attic again and taken them out of their tissuepaper cradles again and hung them up again just two evenings ago It was a funny thing about Christmas decorations There werent many things that remained intact year after year as a person grew up Not many lines of continuity not many physical objects that could easily serve both the states of childhood and adulthood Your kid clothes were handed down or packed off to the Salvation Army your Donald Duck watch sprung its mainspring your Red Ryder cowboy boots wore out The wallet you made in your first camp handicrafts class got replaced by a Lord Buxton and you traded your red wagon and your bike for more adult toys  a car a tennis racket maybe one of those new TV hockey games There were only a few things you could hang onto A few books maybe or a lucky coin or a stamp collection that had been preserved and improved upon Add to that the Christmas tree ornaments in your parents house The same chipped angels year after year and the same tinsel star on top the tough surviving platoon of what had once been an entire battalion of glass balls and we never forget the honored dead he thought  this one died as a result of a babys clutching hand this one slipped as dad was putting it on and crashed to the floor the red one with the Star of Bethlehem painted on it was simply and mysteriously broken one year when we took them down from the attic and I cried the tree stand itself But sometimes Johnny thought absently massaging his temples it seemed it would be better more merciful if you lost touch with even these last vestiges of childhood You could never discover the books that had first turned you on in quite the same way The lucky coin had not protected you from any of the ordinary whips and scorns and scrapes of an ordinary life And when you looked at the ornaments you remembered that there had once been a mother in the place to direct the treetrimming operation always ready and willing to piss you off by saying a little higher or a little lower or I think youve got too much tinsel on that left side dear You looked at the ornaments and remembered that just the two of you had been around to put them up this year just the two of you because your mother went crazy and then she died but the fragile Christmas tree ornaments were still here still hanging around to decorate another tree taken from the small back woodlot and didnt they say more people committed suicide around Christmas than at any other time of the year By God it was no wonder What a power God has given you Johnny Sure thats right Gods a real prince He knocked me through the windshield of a cab and I broke my legs and spent five years or so in a coma and three people died The girl I loved got married She had the son who should have been mine by a lawyer whos breaking his ass to get to Washington so he can help run the big electric train set If Im on my feet for more than a couple of hours at a time it feels like somebody took a long splinter and rammed it straight up my leg to my balls Gods a real sport Hes such a sport that he fixed up a funny comicopera world where a bunch of glass Christmas tree globes could outlive you Neat world and a really firstclass God in charge of it He must have been on our side during Vietnam because thats the way hes been running things ever since time began He has a job for you Johnny Bailing some halfassed country cop out of a jam so he can get reelected next year Dont run from him Johnny Dont hide away in a cave He rubbed his temples Outside the wind was rising He hoped dad would be careful coming home from work Johnny got up and pulled on a heavy sweatshirt He went out into the shed watching his breath frost the air ahead of him To the left was a large pile of wood he had split in the autumn just past all of it cut into neat Stove lengths Next to it was a box of kindling and beside that was a stack of old newspapers He squatted down and began to thumb through them His hands went numb quickly but he kept going and eventually he came to the one he was looking for The Sunday paper from three weeks ago He took it into the house slapped it down on the kitchen table and began to root through it He found the article he was looking for in the features section and sat down to reread it The article was accompanied by several photos one of them showing an old woman locking a door another showing a police car cruising a nearly deserted street two others showing a couple of businesses that were nearly deserted The headline read THE HUNT FOR THE CASTLE ROCK STRANGLER GOES ON  AND ON Five years ago according to the story a young woman named Alma Frechette who worked at a local restaurant had been raped and strangled on her way home from work A joint investigation of the crime had been conducted by the state attorney generals office and the Castle County sheriffs department The result had been a total zero A year later an elderly woman also raped and strangled had been discovered in her tiny thirdfloor apartment on Carbine Street in Castle Rock A month later the killer had struck again this time the victim had been a bright young junior high school girl There had been a more intensive investigation The investigative facilities of the FBI had been utilized all to no result The following November Sheriff Carl M Kelso who had been the countys chief law officer since approximately the days of the Civil War had been voted out and George Bannerman had been voted in largely on an aggressive campaign to catch the Castle Rock Strangler Two years passed The strangler had not been apprehended but no further murders occurred either Then last January the body of seventeenyearold Carol Dunbarger had been found by two small boys The Dunbarger girl had been reported as a missing person by her parents She had been in and out of trouble at Castle Rock High School where she had a record of chronic tardiness and truancy she had been busted twice for shoplifting and had run away once before getting as far as Boston Both Bannerman and the state police assumed she had been thumbing a ride  and the killer had picked her up A midwinter thaw had uncovered her body near Strimmers Brook where two small boys had found it The state medical examiner said she had been dead about two months Then this November  there had been yet another murder The victim was a wellliked Castle Rock grammar school teacher named Etta Ringgold She was a lifetime member of the local Methodist church holder of an MBS in elementary education and prominent in local charities She had been fond of the works of Robert Browning and her body had been found stuffed into a culvert that ran beneath an unpaved secondary road The uproar over the murder of Miss Ringgold had rumbled over all of northern New England Comparisons to Albert DeSalvo the Boston Strangler were made comparisons that did nothing to pour oil on the troubled waters William Loebs UnionLeader in notso distant Manchester New Hampshire had published a helpful editorial titled THE DONOTHING COPS IN OUR SISTER STATE This Sunday supplement article now nearly six weeks old and smelling pungently of shed and woodbox quoted two local psychiatrists who had been perfectly happy to bluesky the situation as long as their names werent printed One of them mentioned a particular sexual aberration  the urge to commit some violent act at the moment of orgasm Nice Johnny thought grimacing He strangled them to death as he came His headache was getting worse all the time The other shrink pointed out the fact that all five murders had been committed in late fall or early winter And while the manicdepressive personality didnt conform to any one set pattern it was fairly common for such a person to have moodswings closely paralleling the change of the seasons He might have a low lasting from midApril until about the end of August and then begin to climb peaking at around the time of the murders During the manic or up state the person in question was apt to be highly sexed active daring and optimistic He would be likely to believe the police unable to catch him the unnamed psychiatrist had finished The article concluded by saying that so far the person in question had been right Johnny put the paper down glanced at the clock and saw his father should be home almost anytime unless the snow was holding him up He took the old newspaper over to the wood stove and poked it into the firebox Not my business Goddam Sam Weizak anyway Dont hide away in a cave Johnny He wasnt hiding away in a cave that wasnt it at all It just so happened that hed had a fairly tough break Losing a big chunk of your life that qualified you for toughbreak status didnt it And all the selfpity you can guzzle Fuck you he muttered to himself He went to the window and looked out Nothing to see but snow falling in heavy winddriven lines He hoped dad was being careful but he also hoped his father would show up soon and put an end to this useless ratrun of introspection He went over to the telephone again and stood there undecided Selfpity or not he had lost a goodish chunk of his life His prime if you wanted to put it that way He had worked hard to get back Didnt he deserve some ordinary privacy Didnt he have a right to what he had just been thinking of a few minutes ago  an ordinary life There is no such thing my man Maybe not but there was such a thing as an abnormal life That thing at Coles Farm Feeling peoples clothes and suddenly knowing their little dreads small secrets petty triumphs  that was abnormal It wasnt a talent it was a curse Suppose he did meet this sheriff There was no guarantee he could tell him a thing And suppose he could Just suppose he could hand him his killer on a silver platter It would be the hospital press conference all over again a threering circus raised to the grisly nth power A little song began to run maddeningly through his aching head little more than a jingle really A Sunday school song from his early childhood This little light of mine Im gonna let it shine  this little light of mine  Im gonna let it shine  let it shine shine shine let it shine He picked up the phone and dialed Weizaks office number Safe enough now after five Weizak would have gone home and bigdeal neurologists dont list their home phones The phone rang six or seven times and Johnny was going to put it down when it was answered and Sam himself said Hi Hello Sam John Smith The pleasure in Sams voice was Unmistakable  but was there also an undercurrent of unease in it Yeah its me How do you like this snow Weizak said maybe a little heartily Is it snowing where you are Its snowing Just started here about an hour ago They say John Is it the sheriff Is that why you sound so cold Well he called me Johnny said and Ive been sort of wondering what happened Why you gave him my name Why you didnt call me and say you had and why you didnt call me first and ask if you could Weizak sighed Johnny I could maybe give you a lie but that would be no good I didnt ask you first because I was afraid you would say no And I didnt tell you Id done it afterward because the sheriff laughed at me When someone laughs at one of my suggestions I assume nub that the suggestion is not going to be taken Johnny rubbed at one aching temple with his free hand and closed his eyes But why Sam You know how I feel about that You were the one who told me to keep my head down and let it blow over You told me that yourself It was the piece in the paper Sam said I said to myself Johnny lives down that way And I said to myself five dead women Five His voice was slow halting and embarrassed It made Johnny feel much worse to hear Sam sounding like this He wished he hadnt called Two of them teenage girls A young mother A teacher of young children who loved Browning All of it so corny nuh So corny I suppose they would never make a movie or a TV show out of it But nonetheless true It was the teacher I thought about most Stuffed into a culvert like a bag of garbage You had no damn right to bring me into your guilt fantasies Johnny said thickly No perhaps not No perhaps about it Johnny are you all right You sound Im fine  Johnny shouted You dont sound fine Ive got a shitter of a headache is that so surprising I wish to Christ youd left this alone When I told you about your mother you didnt call her Because you said I said some things are better lost than found But that is not always true Johnny This man whoever he is has a terribly disturbed personality He may kill himself I am sure that when he stopped for two years the police thought he had But a manicdepressive sometimes has long level periods  it is called a plateau of normality and then goes back to the same moodswings He may have killed himself after murdering that teacher last month But if he hasnt what then He may kill another one Or two Or four Or Stop it Sam said Why did Sheriff Bannerman call you What made him change his mind I dont know I suppose the voters are after him Im sorry I called him Johnny and that this has u set you so But even more I am sorry that I did not call you and tell you what I had done I was wrong God knows you have a right to live your life quietly Hearing his own thoughts echoed did not make him feel better Instead he felt more miserable and guilty than ever All right he said Thats okay Sam Ill not say anything to anyone again I suppose that is like putting a new lock on the barn door after a horse theft but its all I can say I was indiscreet In a doctor thats bad All right Johnny said again He felt helpless and the slow embarrassment with which Sam spoke made it worse Ill see you soon Ill be up in Cleaves next month to start teaching Ill drop by Good Again my sincere apologies John Stop saying that They said their goodbyes and Johnny hung up wishing he hadnt called at all Maybe he hadnt wanted Sam to agree so readily that what he had done was wrong Maybe what he had really wanted Sam to say was Sure l called him I wanted you to get off your ass and do something He wandered across to the window and looked out into the blowing darkness Stuffed into a culvert like a bag of garbage  God how his head ached  Herb got home half an hour later took one look at Johnnys white face and said Headache Yeah Bad Not too bad We want to watch the national news Herb said Glad I got home in time Bunch of people from NBC were over in Castle Rock this afternoon filming That lady reporter you think is so pretty was there Cassie Mackin He blinked at the way Johnny turned on him For a moment it seemed that Johnnys face was all eyes staring out at him and full of a nearly inhuman pain Castle Rock Another murder Yeah They found a little girl on the town common this morning Saddest damn thing you ever heard of I guess she had a pass to go across the common to the library for some project she was working on She got to the library but she never got back  Johnny you look terrible boy How old was she Just nine Herb said A man whod do a thing like that should be strung up by the balls Thats my view on it Nine Johnny said and sat down heavily Stone the crows Johnny you sure you feel okay Youre white as paper Fine Turn on the news Shortly John Chancellor was in front of them bearing his nightly satchel of political aspirations Fred Harriss campaign was not catching much fire government edicts the cities of America would just have to learn common budgetary sense according to President Ford international incidents a nationwide strike in France the Dow Jones up and a heartwarming piece about a boy with cerebral palsy who was raising a H cow Maybe they cut it Herb said But after a commercial Chancellor said In western Maine theres a townful of frightened angry people tonight The town is Castle Rock and over the last five years there have been five nasty murders  five women ranging in age from seventyone to fourteen have been raped and strangled Today there was a sixth murder in Castle Rock and the victim was a nineyearold girl Catherine Mackin is in Castle Rock with the story And there she was looking like a figment of makebelieve carefully superimposed on a real setting She was standing across from the Town Office Building The first of that afternoons snow which had developed into tonights blizzard was powdering the shoulders of her coat and her blonde hair A sense of quietly mounting hysteria lies over this small New England mill town this afternoon she began The townspeople of Castle Rock have been nervous for a long time over the unknown person the local press calls the Castle Rock Strangler or sometimes the November Killer That nervousness has changed to terror  no one here thinks that word is too strong  following the discovery of Mary Kate Hendrasens body on the town common not far from the bandstand where the body of the November Killers first victim a waitress named Alma Frechette was discovered A long panning shot of the town common looking bleak and dead in the falling snow This was replaced with a school photograph of Mary Kate Hendrasen grinning brashly through a heavy set of braces Her hair was a fine whiteblonde Her dress was an electric blue Most likely her best dress Johnny thought sickly Her mother put her into her best dress for her school photo The report went on  now they were recapitulating the past murders  but Johnny was on the phone first to directory assistance and then to the Castle Rock town offices He dialed slowly his head thudding Herb came out of the living room and looked at him curiously Who are you calling son Johnny shook his head and listened to the phone ring on the other end It was picked up Castle County sheriffs office Id like to talk to Sheriff Bannerman please Could I have your name John Smith from Pownal Hold on please Johnny turned to look at the TV and saw Bannerman as he had been that afternoon bundled up in a heavy parka with county sheriff patches on the shoulders He looked uncomfortable and dogged as he fielded the reporters questions He was a broadshouldered man with a big sloping head capped with curly dark hair The rimless glasses he wore looked strangely out of place as spectacles always seem to look out of place on very big men Were following up a number of leads Bannerman said Hello Mr Smith Bannerman said Again that queer sense of doubling Bannerman was in two places at one time Two times at one time if you wanted to look at it that way Johnny felt an instant of helpless vertigo He felt the way God help him you felt on one of those cheap carnival rides the TiltAWhirl or the CrackTheWhip Mr Smith Are you there man Yes Im here He swallowed Ive changed my mind Good boy Im damned glad to hear it I still may not be able to help you you know I know that But  no venture no gain Bannerman cleared his throat Theyd run me out of this town on a rail if they knew I was down to consulting a psychic Johnnys face was touched with a ghost of a grin And a discredited psychic at that Do you know where Jons in Bridgton is I can find it Can you meet me there at eight oclock Yes I think so Thank you Mr Smith All right He hung up Herb was watching him closely Behind him the Nightly News credits were rolling He called you earlier huh Yeah he did Sam Weizak told him I might be able to help Do you think you can I dont know Johnny said but my headache feels a little better  He was fifteen minutes late getting to Jons Restaurant in Bridgton it seemed to be the only business establishment on Bridgtons main drag that was still open The plows were falling behind the snow and there were drifts across the road in several places At the junction of Routes O and  the blinker light swayed back and forth in the screaming wind A police cruiser with CASTLE COUNTY SHERIFF in gold leaf on the door was parked in front of Jons He parked behind it and went inside Bannerman was sitting at a table in front of a cup of coffee and a bowl of chili The TV had misled He wasnt a big man he was a huge man Johnny walked over and introduced himself Bannerman stood up and shook the offered hand Looking at Johnnys white strained face and the way his thin body seemed to float inside his Navy pea jacket Bannermans first thought was This guy is sick  hes maybe not going to live too long Only Johnnys eyes seemed to have any real life  they were a direct piercing blue and they fixed firmly on Bannermans own with sharp honest curiosity And when their hands clasped Bannerman felt a peculiar kind of surprise a sensation he would later describe as a draining It was a little like getting a shock from a bare electrical wire Then it was gone Glad you could come Bannerman said Coffee Yes How about a bowl of chili They make a great damn chili here Im not supposed to eat it because of my ulcer but I do anyway He saw the look of surprise on Johnnys face and smiled I know it doesnt seem right a great big guy like me having an ulcer does it I guess anyone can get one Youre damn tooting Bannerman said What changed your mind It was the news The little girl Are you sure it was the same guy It was the same guy Same MO And the same sperm type He watched Johnnys face as the waitress came over Coffee she asked Tea Johnny said And bring him a bowl of chili Miss Bannerman said When the waitress had gone he said This doctor he says that if you touch something sometimes you get ideas about where it came from who might have owned it that sort of thing Johnny smiled Well he said I just shook your hand and I know youve got an Irish setter named Rusty And I know hes old and going blind and you think its time he was put to sleep but you dont know how youd explain it to your girl Bannerman dropped his spoon back into his chili plop He stared at Johnny with his mouth open By God he said You got that from me Just now Johnny nodded Bannerman shook his head and muttered Its one thing to hear something like that and another to  doesnt it tire you out Johnny looked at Bannerman surprised It was a question he had never been asked before Yes Yes it does But you knew Ill be damned But look Sheriff George Just plain George Okay Im Johnny just plain Johnny George what I dont know about you would fill about five books I dont know where you grew up or where you went to police school or who your friends are or where you live I know youve got a little girl and her names something like Cathy but thats not quite it I dont know what you did last week or what beer you favor or what your favorite TV program is My daughters name is Katrina Bannerman said softly Shes nine too She was in Mary Kates class What Im trying to say is that the  the knowing is sometimes a pretty limited thing Because of the dead zone Dead zone Its like some of the signals dont conduct Johnny said I can never get streets or addresses Numbers are hard but they sometimes come The waitress returned with Johnnys tea and chili He tasted the chili and nodded at Bannerman Youre right Its good Especially on a night like this Go to it Bannerman said Man I love good chili My ulcer hollers bloody hell about it Fuck you ulcer I say Down the hatch They were quiet for a moment Johnny worked on his chili and Bannerman watched him curiously He supposed Smith could have found out he had a dog named Rusty He even could have found out that Rusty was old and nearly blind Take it a step farther if he knew Katrinas name he might have done that something like Cathy but thats not quite it routine just to add the right touch of hesitant realism But why And none of that explained that queer zapped feeling hed gotten in his head when Smith touched his hand If it was a con it was a damned good one Outside the wind gusted to a low shriek that seemed to rock the small building on its foundations A flying veil of snow lashed the Pondicherry Bowling Lanes across the street Listen to that Bannerman said Supposed to keep up all night Dont tell me the wintersre getting milder Have you got something Johnny asked Something that belonged to the guy youre looking for We think we might Bannerman said and then shook his head But its pretty thin Tell me Bannerman laid it out for him The grammar school and the library sat facing each other across the town common It was standard operating procedure to send students across when they needed a book for a project or a report The teacher gave them a pass and the librarian initialed it before sending them back Near the center of the common the land dipped slightly On the west side of the dip was the town bandstand In the dip itself were two dozen benches where people sat during band concerts and football rallies in the fall We think he just sat himself down and waited for a kid to come along He would have been out of sight from both sides of the common But the footpath runs along the north side of the dip close to those benches Bannerman shook his head slowly What makes it worse is that the Frechette woman was killed right on the bandstand I am going to face a shitstorm about that at town meeting in March  that is if Im still around in March Well I can show them a memo I wrote to the town manager requesting adult crossing guards on the common during school hours Not that it was this killer that I was worried about Christ no Never in my wildest dreams did I think hed go back to the same spot a second time The town manager turned down the crossing guards Not enough money Bannerman said Of course he can spread the blame around to the town selectmen and theyll try to spread it back on me and the grass will grow on Mary Kate Hendrasens grave and  He paused for a moment or perhaps choked on what he was saying Johnny gazed at his lowered head sympathetically It might not have made any difference anyhow Bannerman went on in a dryer voice Most of the crossing guards we use are women and this fuck were after doesnt seem to care how old or young they are But you think he waited on one of those benches Bannerman did They had found an even dozen fresh cigarette butts near the end of one of the benches and four more behind the bandstand itself along with an empty box Marlboros unfortunately  the second or third most popular brand in the country The cellophane on the box had been dusted for prints and had yielded none at all None at all Johnny said Thats a little funny isnt it Why do you say so Well youd guess the killer was wearing gloves even if he wasnt thinking about prints  it was cold out  but youd think the guy that sold him the cigarettes  Bannerman grinned Youve got a head for this work he said but youre not a smoker No Johnny said I used to smoke a few cigarettes when I was in college but I lost the habit after my accident A man keeps his cigarettes in his breast pocket Take them out get a cigarette put the pack back If youre wearing gloves and not leaving fresh prints every time you get a butt what youre doing is polishing that cellophane wrapper Get it And you missed one other thing Johnny Need me to tell you Johnny thought it over and then said Maybe the pack of cigarettes came out of a carton And those cartons are packed by machine Thats it Bannerman said You are good at this What about the tax stamp on the package Maine Bannerman said So if the killer and the smoker were the same man Johnny said thoughtfully Bannerman shrugged Sure theres the technical possibility that they werent But Ive tried to imagine who else would want to sit on a bench in the town common on a cold cloudy winter morning long enough to smoke twelve or sixteen cigarettes and I come up a blank Johnny sipped his tea None of the other kids that crossed saw anything Nothing Bannerman said Ive talked to every kid that had a library pass this morning Thats a lot weirder than the fingerprint business Doesnt it strike you that way It strikes me as goddam scary Look the guy is sitting there and what hes waiting for is one kid one girl  by herself He can hear the kids as they come along And each time he fades back behind the bandstand Tracks Johnny said Not this morning There was no snowcover this morning Just frozen ground So heres this crazy shitbag that ought to have his own testicles carved off and served to him for dinner here he is skulking behind the bandstand At about   AM Peter Harrington and Melissa Loggins come along School has been in session about twenty minutes at that time When theyre gone he goes back to his bench At  i he fades back behind the bandstand again This time its two little girls Susan Flarhaty and Katrina Bannerman Johnny set his mug down with a bang Bannerman had taken off his spectacles and was polishing them savagely Your daughter crossed this morning Jesus Bannerman put his glasses on again His face was dark and dull with fury And hes afraid Johnny saw Not afraid that the voters would turn him out or that the UnionLeader would publish another editorial about nitwit cops in western Maine but afraid because if his daughter had happened to go to the library alone this morning My daughter Bannerman agreed softly I think she passed within forty feet of that  that animal You know what that makes me feel like I can guess Johnny said No I dont think you can It makes me feel like I almost stepped into an empty elevator shaft Like I passed up the mushrooms at dinner and someone else died of toadstool poisoning And it makes me feel dirty It makes me feel filthy I guess maybe it also explains why I finally called you Id do anything right now to nail this guy Anything at all Outside a giant orange plow loomed out of the snow like something from a horror movie It parked and two men got out They crossed the street to Jons and sat at the counter Johnny finished his tea He no longer wanted the chili This guy goes back to his bench Bannerman resumed but not for long Around  he hears the Harrington boy and the Loggins girl coming back from the library So he goes back behind the bandstand again It must have been around  because the librarian signed them out at  At  three boys from the fifth grade went past the bandstand on their way to the library One of them thinks he might have seen some guy standing on the other side of the bandstand Thats our whole description Some guy We ought to put it out on the wire what do you think Be on the lookout for some guy Bannerman uttered a short laugh like a bark At  my daughter and her friend Susan go by on their way back to school Then about  Mary Kate Hendrasen came along  by herself Katrina and Sue met her going down the school steps as they were going up They all said hi Dear God Johnny muttered He ran his hands through his hair Last of all  AM The three fifthgrade boys are coming back One of them sees something on the bandstand Its Mary Kate with her leotard and her underpants yanked down blood all over her legs her face   her face   Take it easy Johnny said and put a hand on Bannermans arm No I cant take it easy Bannerman said He spoke almost apologetically Ive never seen anything like that not in eighteen years of police work He raped that little girl and that would have been enough  enough to you know kill her  the medical examiner said the way he did it  he ruptured something and it  yeah it probably would have well  killed her  but then he had to go on and choke her Nine years old and choked and left  left on the bandstand with her underpants pulled down Suddenly Bannerman began to cry The tears filled his eyes behind his glasses and then rolled down his face in two streams At the counter the two guys from the Bridgton road crew were talking about the Superbowl Bannerman took his glasses off again and mopped his face with his handkerchief His shoulders shook and heaved Johnny waited stirring his chili aimlessly After a little while Bannerman put his handkerchief away His eyes were red and Johnny thought how oddly naked his face looked without his glasses Im sorry man he said Its been a very long day Its all right Johnny said I knew I was going to do that but I thought I could hold on until I got home to my wife Well I guess that was just too long to wait Youre a sympathetic ear Bannerman slipped his glasses back on No youre more than that Youve got something Ill be damned if I know just what it is but its something What else have you got to go on Nothing Im taking most of the heat but the state police havent exactly distinguished themselves Neither has the attorney generals special investigator or our pet FBI man The county ME has been able to type the sperm but thats no good to us at this stage of the game The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of hair or skin under the victims fingernails They all must have struggled but we dont have as much as a centimeter of skin The devil must be on this guys side He hasnt dropped a button or a shopping list or left a single damn track We got a shrink from Augusta also courtesy of the state AG and he tells us all these guys give themselves away sooner or later Some comfort What if its later say about twelve bodies from now The cigarette pack is in Castle Rock Yes Johnny stood up Well lets take a ride My car Johnny smiled a little as the wind rose shrieking outside On a night like this it pays to be with a policeman he said  The snowstorm was at its height and it took them an hour and a half to get over to Castle Rock in Bannermans cruiser It was twenty past ten when they came in through the foyer of the Town Office Building and stamped the snow off their boots There were half a dozen reporters in the lobby most of them sitting on a bench under a gruesome oil portrait of some town founding father telling each other about previous night watches They were up and surrounding Bannerman and Johnny in no time Sheriff Bannerman is it true there has been a break in the case I have nothing for you at this time Bannerman said stolidly Theres been a rumor that youve taken a man from Oxford into custody Sheriff is that true No If you folks will pardon us  But their attention had turned to Johnny and he felt a sinking sensation in his belly as he recognized at least two faces from the press conference at the hospital Holy God one of them exclaimed Youre John Smith arent you Johnny felt a crazy urge to take the fifth like a gangster at a Senate committee hearing Yes he said Thats me The psychic guy another asked Look let us pass Bannerman said raising his voice Havent you guys got anything better to do than  According to Inside View youre a fake a young man in a heavy topcoat said Is that true All I can say about that is Inside View prints what they want Johnny said Look really  Youre denying the Inside View story Look I really cant say anything more As they went through the frosted glass door and into the sheriffs office the reporters were racing toward the two pay phones on the wall by the dog wardens office Now the shit has truly hit the fan Bannerman said unhappily I swear before God I never thought theyd still be here on a night like this I should have brought you in the back Oh didnt you know Johnny asked bitterly We love the publicity All of us psychics are in it for the publicity No I dont believe that Bannerman said At least not of you Well its happened Cant be helped now But in his mind Johnny could visualize the headlines a little extra seasoning in a pot of stew that was already bubbling briskly CASTLE ROCK SHERIFF DEPUTIZES LOCAL PSYCHIC IN STRANGLER CASE NOVEMBER KILLER TO BE INVESTIGATED BY SEER HOAX ADMISSION STORY A FABRICATION SMITH PROTESTS There were two deputies in the outer office one of them snoozing the other drinking coffee and looking glumly through a pile of reports His wife kick him out or something Bannerman asked sourly nodding toward the sleeper He just got back from Augusta the deputy said He was little more than a kid himself and there were dark circles of weariness under his eyes He glanced over at Johnny curiously Johnny Smith Frank Dodd Sleeping beauty over there is Roscoe Fisher Johnny nodded hello Roscoe says the AG wants the whole case Dodd told Bannerman His look was angry and defiant and somehow pathetic Some Christmas present huh Bannerman put a hand on the back of Dodds neck and shook him gently You worry too much Frank Also youre spending too much time on the case I just keep thinking there must be something in these reports He shrugged and then flicked them with one finger Something Go home and get some rest Frank And take sleeping beauty with you All we need is for one of those photographers to get a picture of him Theyd run it in the papers with a caption like In Castle Rock the Intensive Investigation Goes On and wed all be out sweeping streets Bannerman led Johnny into his private office The desk was awash in paperwork On the windowsill was a triptych showing Bannerman his wife and his daughter Katrina His degree hung neatly framed on the wall and beside it in another frame the front page of the Castle Rock Call which had announced his election Coffee Bannerman asked him unlocking a file cabinet No thanks Ill stick to tea Mrs Sugarman guards her tea jealously Bannerman said Takes it home with her every day sorry Id offer you a tonic but wed have to run the gauntlet out there again to get to the machine Jesus Christ I wish theyd go home Thats okay Bannerman came back with a small clasp envelope This is it he said He hesitated for a moment then handed the envelope over Johnny held it but did not immediately open it As long as you understand that nothing comes guaranteed I cant promise Sometimes I can and sometimes I cant Bannerman shrugged tiredly and repeated No venture no gain Johnny undid the clasp and shook an empty Marlboro cigarette box out into his hand Red and white box He held it in his left hand and looked at the far wall Gray wall Industrial gray wall Red and white box Industrial gray box He put the cigarette package in his other hand then cupped it in both He waited for something anything to come Nothing did He held it longer hoping against hope ignoring the knowledge that when things come they came at once At last he handed the cigarette box back Im sorry he said No soap huh No There was a perfunctory tap at the door and Roscoe Fisher stuck his head in He looked a bit shamefaced Frank and I are going home George I guess you caught me coopin As long as I dont catch you doing it in your cruiser Bannerman said Say hi to Deenie for me You bet Fisher glanced at Johnny for a moment and then closed the door Well Bannerman said It was worth the try I guess Ill run you back I want to go over to the common Johnny said abruptly No thats no good Its under a foot of snow You can find the place cant you Of course I can But whatll it gain I dont know But lets go across Those reporters are going to follow us Johnny Just as sure as God made little fishes You said something about a back door Yeah but its a fire door Getting in that way is okay but if we use it to go out the alarm goes off Johnny whistled through his teeth Let them follow along then Bannerman looked at him thoughtfully for several moments and then nodded Okay  When they came out of the office the reporters were up and surrounding them immediately Johnny was reminded of a rundown kennel over in Durham where a strange old woman kept collies The dogs would all runout at you when you went past with your fishing pole yapping and snarling and generally scaring the hell out of you They would nip but not actually bite Do you know who did it Johnny Have any ideas at all Got any brainwaves Mr Smith Sheriff was calling in a psychic your idea Do the state police and the AGs office know about this development Sheriff Bannerman Do you think you can break the case Johnny Sheriff have you deputized this guy Bannerman pushed his way slowly and solidly through them zipping his coat No comment no comment Johnny said nothing at all The reporters clustered in the foyer as Johnny and Bannerman went down the snowy steps It wasnt until they bypassed the cruiser and began wading across the street that one of them realized they were going to the common Several of them ran back for their topcoats Those who had been dressed for outside when Bannerman and Johnny emerged from the office now floundered down the Town Office steps after them calling like children  Flashlights bobbing in the snowy dark The wind howled blowing snow past them this way and that in errant sheets Youre not gonna be able to see a damn thing Bannerman said You w  holy shit He was almost knocked off his feet as a reporter in a bulky overcoat and a bizarre tam oshanter sprawled into him Sorry Sheriff he said sheepishly Slippery Forgot my galoshes Up ahead a yellow length of nylon rope appeared out of the gloom Attached to it was a wildly swinging sign reading POLICE INVESTIGATION You forgot your brains too Bannerman said No you keep back all of you Keep right back Town commons public property Sheriff one of the reporters cried Thats right and this is police business You stay behind this rope here or youll spend the night in my holding cell With the beam of his flashlight he traced the course of the rope for them and then held it up so Johnny could pass beneath They walked down the slope toward the snowmounded shapes of the benches Behind them the reporters gathered at the rope pooling their few lights so that Johnny and George Bannerman walked in a dull sort of spotlight Flying blind Bannerman said Well theres nothing to see anyway Johnny said Is there No not now I told Frank he could take that rope down anytime Now Im glad he didnt get around to it You want to go over to the bandstand Not yet Show me where the cigarette butts were They went on a little farther and then Bannerman stopped Here he said and shone his light on a bench that was little more than a vague hump poking out of a drift Johnny took off his gloves and put them in his coat pockets Then he knelt and began to brush the snow away from the seat of the bench Again Bannerman was struck by the haggard pallor of the mans face On his knees before the bench he looked like a religious penitent a man in desperate prayer Johnnys hands went cold then mostly numb Melted now ran off his fingers He got down to the splintered weatherbeaten surface of the bench He seemed to see it very clearly almost with magnifying power It had once been green but now much of the paint had flaked and eroded away Two rusted steel bolts held the seat to the backrest He seized the bench in both hands and sudden weirdness flooded him he had felt nothing so intense before and would feel something so intense only once ever again He stared down at the bench frowning gripping it tightly in his hands It  A summer bench How many hundreds of different people had sat here at one time or another listening to God Bless America to Stars and Stripes Forever Be hind to your webfooted friends for a duck may be somebodys moooother to the Castle Rock Cougars fight song Green summer leaves smoky haze of fall like a memory of cornhusks and men with rakes in mellow dusk The thud of the big snare drum Mellow gold trumpets and trombones School band uniforms  for a duck  may be somebodys mother Good summer people sitting here listening applauding holding programs that had been designed and printed in the Castle Rock High School graphic arts shop But this morning a killer had been sitting here Johnny could feel him Dark tree branches etched against a gray snowsky like runes HeI am sitting here smoking waiting feeling good feeling like heI could jump right over the roof of the world and land lightly on two feet Humming a song Something by the Rolling Stones Cant get that but very dearly everything is is what All right Everything is all right everything is gray and waiting for snow and Em Slick Johnny muttered Im slick Im so slick Bannerman leaned forward unable to catch the words over the howling wind What Slick Johnny repeated He looked up at Bannerman and the Sheriff involuntarily took a step backward Johnnys eyes were cool and somehow inhuman His dark hair blew wildly around his white face and overhead the winter wind screamed through the black sky His hands seemed welded to the bench Im so fucking slick he said clearly A triumphant smile had formed on his lips His eyes stared through Bannerman Bannerman believed No one could be acting this or putting it on And the most terrible part of it was he was reminded of someone The  the tone of voice  Johnny Smith was gone he seemed to have been replaced by a human blank And lurking behind the planes of his ordinary features almost near enough to touch was another face The face of the killer The face of someone he knew Never catch me because Im too slick for you A little laugh escaped him confident lightly taunting I put it on every time and if they scratch or bite they dont get a bit of me because Im so SLICK  His voice rose to a triumphant crazy shriek that competed with the wind and Bannerman fell back another step his flesh crawling helplessly his balls tight and cringing against his guts Let it stop he thought Let it stop now Please Johnny bent his head over the bench Melting snow dripped between his bare fingers Snow Silent snow secret snow  She put a clothespin on it so Id know how it felt How it felt when you got a disease A disease from one of those nastyfuckers theyre all nasty fuckers and they have to be stopped yes stopped stop them stop the stop the STOP  OH MY GOD THE STOP SIGN  He was little again Going to school through the silent secret snow And there was a man looming out of the shifting whiteness a terrible man a terrible black grinning man with eyes as shiny as quarters and there was a red STOP sign clutched in one gloved hand him  him   him OH MY GOD DONT  DONT LET HIM GET ME  MOMMA  DONT LET HIM GET MEEEEE Johnny screamed and fell away from the bench his hands suddenly pressed to his cheeks Bannerman crouched beside him badly frightened Behind the rope the reporters stirred and murmured Johnny Snap out of it Listen Johnny Slick Johnny muttered He looked up at Bannerman with hurt frightened eyes In his mind he still saw that black shape with the shinyquarter eyes looming out of the snow His crotch throbbed dully from the pain of the clothespin the killers mother had made him wear He hadnt been the killer then oh no not an animal not a pusbag or a shitbag or whatever Bannerman had called him hed only been a scared little boy with a clothespin on hishis Help me get up he muttered Bannerman helped him to his feet The bandstand now Johnny said No I think we ought to go back Johnny Johnny pushed past him blindly and began to flounder toward the bandstand a big circular shadow up ahead It bulked and loomed in the darkness the death place Bannerman ran and caught up to him Johnny who is it Do you know who You never found any scraps of tissue under their finger nails because he was wearing a raincoat Johnny said He panted the words out A raincoat with a hood A slick vinyl raincoat You go back over the reports You go back over the reports and youll see It was raining or snowing every time They clawed at him all right They fought him Sure they did But their fingers just slipped and slid over it Who Johnny Who I dont know But Im going to find out He stumbled over the lowest of the six steps leading up to the bandstand fumbled for his balance and would have lost it if Bannerman had not gripped his arm Then they were up on the stage The snow was thin here a bare dusting kept off by the conical roof Bannerman trained his flashlight beam on the floor and Johnny dropped to his hands and knees and began to crawl slowly across it His hands were bright red Bannerman thought they must be like chunks of raw meat by now Johnny stopped suddenly and stiffened like a dog on point Here he muttered He did it right here Images and textures and sensations flooded in The copper taste of excitement the possibility of being seen adding to it The girl was squirming trying to scream He had covered her mouth with one gloved hand Awful excitement Never catch me Im the Invisible Man is it dirty enough for you now momma Johnny began to moan shaking his head back and forth Sound of clothes ripping Warmth Something flowing Blood Semen Urine He began to shudder all over His hair hung in his face His face His smiling open face caught inside the circular border of the raincoats hood as his my hands close around the neck at the moment of orgasm and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze The strength left his arms as the images began to fade He slipped forward now lying on the stage fulllength sobbing When Bannerman touched his shoulder he cried out and tried to scramble away his face crazy with fear Then little by little it loosened He put his head back against the waisthigh bandstand railing and closed his eyes Shudders raced through his body like whippets His pants and coat were sugared with snow I know who it is he said  Fifteen minutes later Johnny sat in Bannermans inner office again stripped to his shorts and sitting as close as he could to a portable electric heater He still looked cold and miserable but he had stopped shaking Sure you dont want some coffee Johnny shook his head I cant abide the stuff Johnny Bannerman sat down Do you really know something I know who killed them You would have gotten him eventually You were just too close to it Youve even seen him in his raincoat that shiny allover raincoat Because he crosses the kids in the morning He has a stop sign on a stick and he crosses the kids in the morning Bannerman looked at him thunderstruck Are you talking about Frank Frank Dodd Youre nuts Frank Dodd killed them Johnny said Frank Dodd killed them all Bannerman looked as though he didnt know whether to laugh at Johnny or deal him a good swift kick Thats the craziest goddam thing Ive ever heard he said finally Frank Dodds a fine officer and a fine man Hes crossing over next November to run for municipal chief of police and hell do it with my blessing Now his expression was one of amusement mixed with tired contempt Franks twentyfive That means he would have had to have started this crazy shit when he was just nineteen He lives at home very quietly with his mother who isnt very well hypertension thyroid and a semidiabetic condition Johnny you put your foot in the bucket Frank Dodd is no murderer Id stake my life on that The murders stopped for two years Johnny said Where was Frank Dodd then Was he in town Bannerman turned toward him and now the tired amusement had left his face and he only looked hard Hard and angry I dont want to hear any more about this You were right the first time  youre nothing but a fake Well you got your press coverage but that doesnt mean I have to listen to you malign a good officer a man I A man you think of as your son Johnny said quietly Bannermans lips thinned and a lot of the color that had risen in his cheeks during their time outside now faded out of his face He looked like a man who has been punched low Then it passed and his face was expressionless Get out of here he said Get one of your reporter friends to give you a ride home You can hold a press conference on your way But I swear to God I swear to holy God that if you mention Frank Dodds name Ill come for you and Ill break your back Understood Sure my buddies from the press Johnny shouted at him suddenly Thats right Didnt you see me answering all their questions Posing for their pictures and making sure they got my good side Making sure they spelled my name right Bannerman looked startled then hard again Lower your voice No Ill be goddamned if I will Johnny said and his voice rose even higher in pitch and volume I think you forgot who called who Ill refresh your recollection for you It was you calling me Thats how eager I was to get over here That doesnt mean you Johnny walked over to Bannerman pointing his index finger like a pistol He was several inches shorter and probably eighty pounds lighter but Bannerman backed up a step  as he had done on the common Johnnys cheeks had flushed a dull red His lips were drawn back slightly from his teeth No youre right you calling me doesnt mean shit in a tin bucket he said But you dont want it to be Dodd do you It can be somebody else then well at least look into it but it cant be good old Frank Dodd Because Franks upstanding Frank takes care of his mother Frank looks up to good old Sheriff George Bannerman oh Franks bloody Christ down from the cross except when hes raping and strangling old ladies and little girls and it could have been your daughter Bannerman dont you understand it could have been your own Bannerman hit him At the last moment he pulled the punch but it was still hard enough to knock Johnny backward he stumbled over the leg of a chair and then sprawled on the floor Blood trickled from his cheek where Bannermans Police Academy ring had grazed him You had that coming Bannerman said but there was no real conviction in his voice It occurred to him that for the first time in his life he had hit a cripple  or the next thing to a cripple Johnnys head felt light and full of bells His voice seemed to belong to someone else a radio announcer or a Bmovie actor You ought to get down on your knees and thank God that he really didnt leave any clues because you would have overlooked them feeling like you do about Dodd And then you could have held yourself responsible in Mary Kate Hendrasens death as an accessory That is nothing but a damnable lie Bannerman said slowly and clearly Id arrest my own brother if he was the guy doing this Get up off the floor Im sorry I hit you He helped Johnny to his feet and looked at the scrape on his cheek Ill get the firstaid kit and put some iodine on that Forget it Johnny said The anger had left his voice I guess I kind of sprang it on you didnt I Im telling you it cant be Frank Youre not a publicity hound okay I was wrong about that Heat of the moment okay But your vibes or your astral plane or whatever it is sure gave you a bum steer this time Then check Johnny said He caught Bannermans eyes with his own and held them Check it out Show me I got it wrong He swallowed Check the times and dates against Franks work schedule Can you do that Grudgingly Bannerman said The time cards in the back closet there go back fourteen or fifteen years I guess I could check it Then do it Mister  He paused Johnny if you knew Frank youd laugh at yourself I mean it Its not just me you ask anybody If Im wrong Ill be glad to admit it This is crazy Bannerman muttered but he went to the storage closet where the old time cards were kept and opened the door  Two hours passed It was now nearly one oclock in the morning Johnny had called his father and told him he would find a place to sleep in Castle Rock the storm had leveled off at a single furious pitch and driving back would be next to impossible Whats going on over there Herb asked Can you tell me I better not over the phone Dad All right Johnny Dont exhaust yourself No But he was exhausted He was more tired than he could remember being since those early days in physical therapy with Eileen Magown A nice woman he thought randomly A nice friendly woman at least until I told her that her house was burning down After that she had become distant and awkward She had thanked him sure but  had she ever touched him after that Actually touched him Johnny didnt think so And it would be the same with Bannerman when this thing was over Too bad Like Eileen he was a fine man But people get very nervous around people who can just touch things and know all about them It doesnt prove a thing Bannerman was saying now There was a sulky littleboy rebelliousness in his voice that made Johnny want to grab him and shake him until he rattled But he was too tired They were looking down at a rough chart Johnny had made on the back of a circular for used state police interceptors Stacked untidily by Bannermans desk were seven or eight cartons of old time cards and sitting in the top half of Bannermans inout basket were Frank Dodds cards going back to  when he had joined the sheriffs department The chart looked like this THE MURDERS  FRANK DODD Alma Frechette waitress Then working at Main Street PM  Gulf Station Pauline Toothaker Offduty AM  Cheryl Moody UHS student Offduty  PM  Carol Dunbarger HS student Twoweek vacation period  Etta Ringgold teacher Regular duty tours  Mary Kate Hendrasen Offduty  AM  All times are estimated time of death figures supplied by State Medical Examiner No it doesnt prove anything Johnny agreed rubbing his temples But it doesnt exactly rule him out either Bannerman tapped the chart When Miss Ringgold was killed he was on duty Yeah if she really was killed on the twentyninth of October But it might have been the twentyeighth or the twentyseventh And even if he was on duty who suspects a cop Bannerman was looking at the little chart very carefully What about the gap Johnny said The twoyear gap Bannerman thumbed the time cards Frank was right here on duty all during  and  You saw that So maybe the urge didnt come on him that year At least so far as we know So far as we know we dont know anything Bannerman contradicted quickly But what about  Late  and early  There are no time cards for that period Was he on vacation No Bannerman said Frank and a guy named Tom Harrison took a semester course in Rural Law Enforcement at a branch of the University of Colorado in Pueblo Its the only place in the country where they offer a deal like that Its an eightweek course Frank and Tom were out there from October  until just about Christmas The state pays part the county pays part and the US government pays part under the Law Enforcement Act of I picked Harrison  hes chief of police over in Gates Falls now  and Frank Frank almost didnt go because he was worried about his mother being alone To tell you the truth I think she tried to persuade him to stay home I talked him into it He wants to be a career officer and something like the Rural Law Enforcement course looks damn good on your record I remember that when he and Tom got back in December Frank had a lowgrade virus and he looked terrible Hed lost twenty pounds Claimed no one out there in cow country could cook like his mom Bannerman fell silent Something in what he had just said seemed to disturb him He took a weeks sick leave around the holidays and then he was okay Bannerman resumed almost defensively He was back by the fifteenth of January at the latest Check the time cards for yourself I dont have to Any more than I have to tell you what your next step is No Bannerman said He looked at his hands I told you that you had a head for this stuff Maybe I was righter than I knew Or wanted to be He picked up the telephone and pulled out a thick directory with a plain blue cover from the bottom drawer of his desk Paging through it without looking up he told Johnny This is courtesy of that same Law Enforcement Act Every sheriffs office in every county of the United States He found the number he wanted and made his call Johnny shifted in his seat Hello Bannerman said Am I talking to the Pueblo sheriffs office  All right My name is George Bannerman Im the county sheriff of Castle County in western Maine yes thats what I said State of Maine Who am I talking to please  All right Officer Taylor this is the situation Weve had a series of murders out here rapestranglings six of them in the past five years All of them have taken place in the late fall or early winter We have a  He looked up at Johnny for a moment his eyes hurt and helpless Then he looked down at the phone again We have a suspect who was in Pueblo from October  of  until  uh December  I think What Id like to know is if you have an unsolved homicide on your books during that period victim female no particular age raped cause of death strangulation Further I would like to know the perpetrators sperm type if you have had such a crime and a sperm sample was obtained What  Yes okay Thanks  Ill be right here waiting Goodbye Officer Taylor He hung up Hes going to verify my bona fides then check it through then call me back You want a cup of no you dont drink it do you No Johnny said Ill settle for a glass of water He went over to the big glass cooler and drew a paper cupful of water Outside the storm howled and pounded Behind him Bannerman said awkwardly Yeah okay You were right Hes the son Idve liked to have had My wife had Katrina by cesarian She can never have another one the doctor said it would kill her She had the BandAid operation and I had a vasectomy Just to be sure Johnny went to the window and looked out on darkness his cup of water in his hand There was nothing to see but snow but if he turned around Bannerman would break off  you didnt have to be psychic to know that Franks dad worked on the BM line and died in an accident when Frank was five or so He was drunk tried to make a coupling in a state where he probably would have pissed down his own leg and never known it He got crushed between two flatcars Franks had to be the man of the house ever since Roscoe says he had a girl in high school but Mrs Dodd put paid to that in a hurry I bet she did Johnny thought A woman who would do that thing that clothespin thing to her own son that sort of woman would stop at nothing She must be almost as crazy as he is He came to me when he was sixteen and asked if there was such a thing as a parttime policeman Said it was the only thing hed ever really wanted to do or be since he was a kid I took a shine to him right off Hired him to work around the place and paid him out of my own pocket Paid him what I could you know he never complained about the wages He was the Sort of kid who would have worked for free He put in an application for fulltime work the month before he graduated from high school but at that time we didnt have any vacancies So he went to work at Donny Haggars Gulf and took a night course in police work at the university down in Gorham I guess Mrs Dodd tried to put paid to that too  felt she was alone too much of the time or something  but that time Frank stood up to her  with my encouragement We took him on in July of  and hes been with the department ever since Now you tell me this and I think of Katrina being out yesterday morning walking right past whoever did it  and its like some dirty kind of incest almost Franks been at our house hes eaten our food babysat Katie once or twice and you tell me Johnny turned around Bannerman had taken off his glasses and was wiping his eyes again If you really can see such things I pity you Youre a freak of God no different from a twoheaded cow I once saw in the carnival Im sorry Thats a shit thing to say I know The Bible says God loves all his creatures Johnny said His voice was a bit unsteady Yeah Bannerman nodded and rubbed the red places on the sides of his nose where his glasses sat Got a funny way of showing it doesnt he  About twenty minutes later the telephone rang and Bannerman answered it smartly Talked briefly Listened Johnny watched his face get old He hung up and looked at Johnny for a long time without speaking November   he said A college girl They found her in a field out by the turnpike Ann Simons her name was Raped and strangled Twentythree years old No semen type obtained Its still not proof Johnny I dont think in your own mind you need any more proof Johnny said And if you confront him with what you have I think hell break down And if he doesnt Johnny remembered the vision on the handstand It whirled back at him like a crazy lethal boomerang The tearing sensation The pain that was pleasant the pain that recalled the pain of the clothespin the pain that reconfirmed everything Get him to drop his pants Johnny said Bannerman looked at him  The reporters were still out in the lobby In truth they probably wouldnt have moved even had they not suspected a break in the case  or at least a bizarre new development The roads out of town were impassable Bannerman and Johnny went out the supply closet window Are you sure this is the way to do it Johnny asked and the storm tried to rip the words out of his mouth His legs hurt No Bannerman said simply but I think you should be in on it Maybe I think he should have the chance to look you in the face Johnny Come on The Dodds are only two blocks from here They set off hooded and booted a pair of shadows in the driving snow Beneath his coat Bannerman was wearing his service pistol His handcuffs were clipped to his belt Before they had gone a block through the deep snow Johnny was limping badly but he kept his mouth grimly shut about it But Bannerman noticed They stopped in the doorway of the Castle Rock Western Auto Son whats the matter with you Nothing Johnny said His head was starting to ache again too It sure is something You act like youre walking on two broken legs They had to operate on my legs after I came out of the coma The muscles had atrophied Started to melt is how Dr Brown put it The joints were decayed They fixed it up the best they could with synthetics Like the Six Million Dollar Man huh Johnny thought of the neat piles of hospital hills back home sitting in the top drawer of the dining room hutch Yes something like that When Im on them too long they stiffen up Thats all You want to go back You bet I do Go back and not have to think about this hellacious business anymore Wish Id never come Not my problem This is the guy who compared me to a twoheaded cow No Im okay he said They stepped out of the doorway and the wind grabbed them and tried to bowl them along the empty street They struggled through the harsh snowchoked glare of arcsodium streetlights bent into the wind They turned onto a side street and five houses down Bannerman stopped in front of a small and neat New England saltbox Like the other houses on the street it was dark and battened down This is the house Bannerman said his voice oddly colorless They worked their way through the snowdrift that the wind had thrown against the porch and mounted the steps  Mrs Henrietta Dodd was a big woman who was carrying a dead weight of flesh on her frame Johnny had never seen a woman who looked any sicker Her skin was a yellowishgray Her hands were nearly reptilian with an eczemalike rash And there was something in her eyes narrowed to glittering slits in their puffy sockets that reminded him unpleasantly of the way his mothers eyes had sometimes looked when Vera Smith was transported into one of her religious frenzies She had opened the door to them after Bannerman had rapped steadily for nearly five minutes Johnny stood beside him on his aching legs thinking that this night would never end It would just go on and on until the snow bad piled up enough to avalanche down and bury them all What do you want in the middle of the night George Bannerman she asked suspiciously Like many fat women her voice was a high buzzy reed instrument  it sounded a bit like a fly or a bee caught in a bottle Have to talk to Frank Henrietta Then talk to him in the morning Henrietta Dodd said and started to close the door in their faces Bannerman stopped the doors swing with a gloved hand Im sorry Henrietta Has to be now Well Im not going to wake him up she cried not moving from the doorway He sleeps like the dead anyway Some nights I ring my bell for him the palpitations are terrible sometimes and does he come No he sleeps right through it and he could wake up some morning to find me dead of a heart attack in my bed instead of getting him his goddam runny poached egg Because you work him too hard She grinned in a sour kind of triumph the dirty secret exposed and hats over the windmill All day all night swing shift chasing after drunks in the middle of the night and any one of them could have a  gun under the seat going out to the ginmills and honkytonks oh theyre a rough trade out there but a lot you mind I guess I know what goes on in those places those cheap slutty women thatd be happy to give a nice boy like my Frank an incurable disease for the price of a quarter beer Her voice that reed instrument swooped and buzzed Johnnys head pumped and throbbed in counterpoint He wished she would shut up It was a hallucination he knew just the tiredness and stress of this awful night catching up but it began to seem more and more to him that this was his mother standing here that at any moment she would turn from Bannerman to him and begin to huckster him about the wonderful talent God had given him Mrs Dodd  Henrietta  Bannerman began patiently Then she did turn to Johnny and regarded him with her smartstupid little pigs eyes Whos this Special deputy Bannerman said promptly Henrietta Ill take the responsibility for waking Frank up Oooh the responsibility she cooed with monstrous buzzing sarcasm and Johnny finally realized she was afraid The fear was coming off her in pulsing noisome waves  that was what was making his headache worse Couldnt Bannerman feel it The reesponsibilitee Isnt that big of you my God yes Well I wont have my boy waked up in the middle of the night George Bannerman so you and your special deputy can just go peddle your goddam papers She tried to shut the door again and this time Bannerman shoved it all the way open His voice showed tight anger and beneath that a terrible tension Open up Henrietta I mean it now You cant do this she cried This isnt no police state Ill have your job Lets see your warrant No thats right but Im going to talk to Frank Bannerman said and pushed past her Johnny barely aware of what he was doing followed Henrietta Dodd made a grab for him Johnny caught her Wrist  and a terrible pain flared in his head dwarfing the sullen thud of the headache And the woman felt it too The two of them stared at each other for a moment that seemed to last forever an awful perfect understanding For that moment they seemed welded together Then she fell back clutching at her ogres bosom My heart   my heart   She scrabbled at her robe pocket and pulled out a phial of pills Her face had gone to the color of raw dough She got the cap off the phial and spilled tiny pills all over the floor getting one into her palm She slipped it under her tongue Johnny stood staring at her in mute horror His head felt like a swelling bladder full of hot blood You knew he whispered Her fat wrinkled mouth opened and closed opened and closed No sound came out It was the mouth of a beached fish All of this time you knew Youre a devil she screamed at him Youre a monster  devil  oh my heart  oh Im dying  think Im dying call the doctor George Bannerman dont you go up there and wake my baby Johnny let go of her and unconsciously rubbing his hand back and forth on his coat as if to free it of a stain he stumbled up the stairs after Bannerman The wind outside sobbed around the eaves like a lost child Halfway up he glanced back Henrietta Dodd sat in a wicker chair a sprawled mountain of meat gasping and holding a huge breast in each hand His head still felt as if it were swelling and he thought dreamily Pretty soon itll just pop and thatll be the end Thank God An old and threadbare runner covered the narrow hall floor The wallpaper was watermarked Bannerman was pounding on a closed door It was at least ten degrees colder up here Frank Frank Its George Bannerman Wake up Frank There was no response Bannerman turned the knob and shoved the door open His hand had fallen to the butt of his gun but he had not drawn it It could have been a fatal mistake but Frank Dodds room was empty The two of them stood in the doorway for a moment looking in It was a childs room The wallpaper  also watermarked  was covered with dancing clowns and rocking horses There was a childsized chair with a Raggedy Andy sitting in it looking back at them with its shiny blank eyes In one corner was a toybox In the other was a narrow maple bed with the covers thrown back Hooked over one of the bedposts and looking out of place was Frank Dodds holstered gun My God Bannerman said softly What is this Help Mrs Dodds voice floated up Help me She knew Johnny said She knew from the very beginning from the Frechette woman He told her And she covered up for him Bannerman backed slowly out of the room and opened another door His eyes were dazed and hurt It was a guest bedroom unoccupied He opened the closet which was empty except for a neat tray of DCon ratkiller on the floor Another door This bedroom was unfinished and cold enough to show Bannermans breath He looked around There was another door this one at the head of the stairs He went to it and Johnny followed This door was locked Frank Are you in there He rattled the knob Open it Frank There was no answer Bannerman raised his foot and kicked out connecting with the door just below the knob There was a flat cracking sound that seemed to echo in Johnnys head like a steel platter dropped on a tile floor Oh God Bannerman said in a flat choked voice Frank Johnny could see over his shoulder could see too much Frank Dodd was propped on the lowered seat of the toilet He was naked except for a shiny black raincoat which he had looped over his shoulders the raincoats black hood executioners hood Johnny thought dimly dangled down on the top of the toilet tank like some grotesque deflated black pod He had somehow managed to cut his own throat  Johnny would not have thought that possible There was a package of Wilkinson Sword Blades on the edge of the washbasin A single blade lay on the floor glittering wickedly Drops of blood had beaded on its edge The blood from his severed jugular vein and carotid artery had splashed everywhere There were pools of it caught in the folds of the raincoat which dragged on the floor It was on the shower curtain which had a pattern of paddling ducks with umbrellas held over their heads It was on the ceiling Around Frank Dodds neck on a string was a sign crayoned in lipstick It read I CONFESS The pain in Johnnys head began to climb to a sizzling insupportable peak He groped out with a hand and found the doorjamb Knew he thought incoherently Knew somehow when he saw me Knew it was all over Came home Did this Black rings overlaying his sight spreading like evil ripples What a talent God has given you Johnny I CONFESS Johnny From far away Johnny are you all Fading Everything fading away That was good Would have been better if he had never come out of the coma at all Better for all concerned Well he had had his chance  Johnny  Frank Dodd had come up here and somehow he had slit his throat from the ear to the proverbial ear while the storm howled outside like all the dark things of the earth let loose Gone a gusher as his father had said that winter twelve years or so ago when the pipes in the basement had frozen and burst Gone a gusher Sure as hell had All the way up to the ceiling He believed that he might have screamed then but afterward was never sure It might only have been in his own head that he screamed But he had wanted to scream to scream out all the horror and pity and agony in his heart Then he was falling forward into darkness and grateful to go Johnny blacked out  From the New York Times December   MAINE PSYCHIC DIRECTS SHERIFF TO KILLER DEPUTYS HOME AFTER VISITING SCENE OF THE CRIME Special to the Times John Smith of Pownal may not actually be psychic but one would have difficulty persuading Sheriff George F Bannerman of Castle County Maine to believe that Desperate after a sixth assaultmurder in the small western Maine town of Castle Rock Sheriff Bannerman called Mr Smith on the phone and asked him to come over to Castle Rock and lend a hand if possible Mr Smith who received national attention earlier this year when he recovered from a deep coma after fiftyfive months of unconsciousness had been condemned by the weekly tabloid Inside View as a hoaxer but at a press conference yesterday Sheriff Bannerman would only say We dont put a whole lot of stock up here in Maine in what those New York reporters think According to Sheriff Bannerman Mr Smith crawled on his hands and knees around the scene of the sixth murder which occurred on the Castle Rock town common He came up with a mild case of frostbite and the murderers name  Sheriffs Deputy Franklin Dodd who had been on the Castle County Sheriffs payroll five years as long as Bannerman himself Earlier this year Mr Smith stirred controversy in his native state when he had a psychic flash that his physical therapists house had caught fire The flash turned out to be nothing but the truth At a press conference following a reporter challenged him to From Newsweek page  week of December   THE NEW HURKOS It may be that the first genuine psychic since Peter Hurkos has been uncovered in this country Hurkos was the Germanborn seer who has been able to tell questioners all about their private lives by touching their hands silverware or items from their handbags John Smith is a shy and unassuming young man from the southcentral Maine town of Pownal Earlier this year he returned to consciousness after a period of more than four years in a deep coma following a car accident see photo According to the consulting neurologist in the case Dr Samuel Weizak Smith made a perfectly astounding recovery Today he is recovering from a mild case of frostbite and a fourhour blackout following the bizarre resolution of a longunsolved multiple murder case in the town of December   Dear Sarah Dad and I both enjoyed your letter which arrived just this afternoon Im really fine so you can stop worrying okay But I thank you for your concern The frostbite was greatly exaggerated in the press Just a couple of patches on the tips of three fingers of my left hand The blackout was really nothing much more than a fainting spell brought on by emotional overload Weizak says Yes he came down himself and insisted on driving me to the hospital in Portland Just watching him in action is nearly worth the price of admission He bullied them into giving him a consultation room and an EEG machine and a technician to run it He says he can find no new brain damage or signs of progressive brain damage He wants to do a whole series of tests some of them sound utterly inquisitorial  Renounce heretic or well give you another pneumobrainscan Haha and are you still sniffin that wicked cocaine darlin Anyway I turned down the kind offer to be pumped and prodded some more Dad is rather pissed at me about turning the tests down keeps trying to draw a parallel between my refusal to have them and my mothers refusal to take her hypertension medicine Its very hard to make him see that if Weizak did find something the odds would be ninetoone against him being able to do anything about it Yes I saw the Newsweek article That picture of me is from the press conference only cropped Dont look like anyone youd like to meet in a dark alley do I Haha Holy Gee as your buddy Anne Strafford is so fond of saying but I wish they hadnt run that story The packages cards and letters have started coming again l dont open any of them anymore unless I recognize the return address just mark them Return to Sender They are too pitiful too full of hope and hate and belief and unbelief and somehow they all remind me of the way my Mom was Well I dont mean to sound so gloomy it aint all that bad But I dont want to be a practicing psychic I dont want to go on tour or appear on TV some yahoo from NBC got our phone number who knows how and wanted to know if Id consider doing the Carson show Great idea huh Don Rickles could insult some people some starlet could show her jugs and I could make a few predictions All brought to you by General Foods I dont want to do any of that SHIT What l am really looking forward to is getting back to Cleaves Mills and sinking into the utter obscurity of the HS English teacher And save the psychic flashes for football pep rallies Guess thats all for this time Hope you and Walt and Denny had yourself a merry little Christmas and are looking forward eagerly from what you said Im sure Walt is at the very least to the Brave Bicentennial Election Year now stretching before us Glad to hear your spouse has been picked to run for the state senate seat there but cross your fingers Sarey   doesnt exactly look like a banner year for elephantlovers Send your thanks for that one across to San Clemente My dad sends best and wants me to tell you thanks for the picture of Denny who really impressed him l send my best also Thanks for writing and for your misplaced concern misplaced but very welcome Im fine and looking forward to getting back in harness Love and good wishes Johnny PS For the last time kiddo get off that cocaine J December   Dear Johnny I think this is the hardest bitterest letter Ive had to write in my sixteen years of school administration  not only because youre a good friend but because youre a damned good teacher There is no way to gild the lily on this so guess I wont even try There was a special meeting of the school board last evening at the behest of two members I wont name but they were on the board when you were teaching here and I think you can probably guess the names and they voted  to ask that your contract be withdrawn The reason youre too controversial to be effective as a teacher I came very close to tendering my own resignation I was that disgusted If it wasnt for Maureen and the kids I think I would have This abortion isnt even on a par with tossing Rabbit Run or Catcher in the Rye out of the classroom This is worse It stinks I told them that but I might as well have been talking in Esperanto or igpay atm lay All they can see is that your picture was in Newsweek and the New York Times and that the Castle Rock story was on the national network news broadcasts Too controversial Five old men in trusses the kind of men who are more interested in hair length than in textbooks more involved in finding out who might smoke pot on the faculty than in finding out how to get some twentiethcentury equipment for the Sci Wing l have written a strong letter of protest to the boardatlarge and with a little armtwisting I believe I can get Irving Finegold to cosign it with me But Id also be less than truthful if I told you there was a hope in hell of getting those five old men to change their minds My honest advice to you is to get yourself a lawyer Johnny You signed that blueback in good faith and I believe you can squeeze them for every last cent of your salary whether you ever step into a Cleaves Mills classroom or not And call me when you feel like talking With all my heart Im sorry Your friend Dave Pelsen  Johnny stood beside the mailbox with Daves letter in his hand looking down at it unbelievingly It was the last day of  clear and bitingly cold His breath came out of his nostrils in fine white jets of smoke Shit he whispered Oh man oh skit Numbly still not assimilating it totally he leaned down to see what else the mailman had brought him As usual the box was crammed full It had just been luck that Daves letter had been sticking out the end There was a white fluttering slip of paper telling him to call at the post office for the packages the inevitable packages My husband deserted me in  here is a pair of his socks tell me where he is so I can get childsupport out of the bastard My baby choked to death last year here is his rattle please write and tell me if he is happy with the angels l didnt have him baptized because his father did not approve and now my heart is breaking The endless litany What a talent God has given you Johnny The reason Youre too controversial to be effective as a teacher In a sudden vicious spasm he began to rake letters and manila envelopes out of the box dropping some in the snow The inevitable headache began to form around his temples like two dark clouds that would slowly draw together enveloping him in pain Sudden tears began to slip down his cheeks and in the deep stiff cold they froze to glittering tracks almost immediately He bent and began to pick up the letters he had dropped he saw one doubled and trebled through the prisms of his tears addressed in heavy dark pencil to JOHN SMITH SIKIK SEER Sikik seer thats me His hands began to tremble wildly and he dropped everything including Daves letter It fluttered down like a leaf and landed print side up among the other letters all the other letters Through his helpless tears he could see the letterhead and the motto below the torch TO TEACH TO LEARN TO KNOW TO SERVE Serve my ass you cheap bastards Johnny said He fell on his knees and began to gather up the letters sweeping them together with his mittens His fingers ached dully a reminder of the frostbite a reminder of Frank Dodd riding a dead toilet seat into eternity blood in his allAmerican blond hair I CONFESS He swept the letters up and heard himself muttering over and over like a defective record Killing me you people are killing me let me alone cant you see youre killing me He made himself stop This was no way to behave Life would go on One way or another life would most certainly go on Johnny started back to the house wondering what he could do now Perhaps something would come along At any rate he had fulfilled his mothers prophecy If God had had a mission for him then he had done it No matter now that it had been a kamikaze mission He had done it He was quits The boy read slowly following the words with his finger his long brown footballplayers legs stretched out on the chaise by the pool in the bright clear light of June Of course young Danny Ju  Juniper  young Danny Juniper was dead and I   suppose that there were few in the world who would say he had not de duh  dee Oh shit I dont know Few in the world who would say he had not deserved his death Johnny Smith said Only a slightly fancier way of saying that most would agree that Dannys death was a good thing Chuck was looking at him and the familiar mix of emotions was crossing his usually pleasant face amusement resentment embarrassment and a trace of sullenness Then he sighed and looked down at the Max Brand Western again Deserved his death But it was my great trah  truhjud Tragedy Johnny supplied But it was my great tragedy that he had died just as he was about to redeem some of his eeevil work by one great service to the world Of course that     that   sih Chuck closed the book looked up at Johnny and smiled brilliantly Lets quit for the day Johnny what do you say Chucks smile was his most winning the one that had probably tumbled cheerleaders into bed all over New Hampshire Doesnt that pool look good You bet it does The sweat is running right off your skinny malnourished little bod Johnny had to admit  at least to himself  that the pool did look good The first couple of weeks of the Bicentennial Summer of  had been uncommonly hot and sticky From behind them around on the other side of the big gracious white house came the soporific drone of the riding lawnmower as Ngo Phat the Vietnamese groundsman mowed what Chuck called the front forty It was a sound that made you want to drink two glasses of cold lemonade and then nod off to sleep No derogatory comments about my skinny bod he said Besides we just started the chapter Sure but we read two before it Wheedling Johnny sighed Usually he could keep Chuck at it but not this afternoon And today the kid had fought his way gamely through the way John Sherburne had set up his net of guards around the Amity jail and the way the evil Red Hawk had broken through and killed Danny Juniper Yeah well just finish this page then he said That word youre stuck ons sickened No teeth in that one Chuck Good man The grin widened And no questions right Well maybe just a few Chuck scowled but it was a puton he was getting off easy and knew it He opened the paperback with the picture of the gunslinger shouldering his way through a set of saloon batwings again and began to read in his slow halting voice  a voice so different from his normal speaking voice that it could have belonged to a different young man altogether Of course that suh   sickened me at once But it was was nothing to what waited for me at the bedside of poor Tom Keyn  Kenyon He had been shot through the body and he was fast drying when I Dying Johnny said quietly Context Chuck Read for context Fast drying Chuck said and giggled Then he resumed   and he was fast dying when I arar when I arrived Johnny felt a sadness for Chuck steal over him as he watched the boy hunched over the paperback copy of Fire Brain a good oat opera that should have read like the wind  and instead here was Chuck following Max Brands simple pointtopoint prose with a laboriously moving finger His father Roger Chatsworth owned Chatsworth Mills and Weaving a very big deal indeed in southern New Hampshire He owned this sixteenroom house in Durham and there were five people on the staff including Ngo Phat who went down to Portsmouth once a week to take United States citizenship classes Chatsworth drove a restored  Cadillac convertible His wife a sweet cleareyed woman of fortytwo drove a Mercedes Chuck had a Corvette The family fortune was in the neighborhood of five million dollars And Chuck at seventeen was what God had really meant when he breathed life into the clay Johnny often thought He was a physically lovely human being He stood sixtwo and weighed a good muscular one hundred and ninety pounds His face was perhaps not quite interesting enough to be truly handsome but it was acne and pimplefree and set off by a pair of striking green eyes which had caused Johnny to think that the only other person he knew with really green eyes was Sarah Hazlett At his high school Chuck was the apotheosis of the BMOC almost ridiculously so He was captain of the baseball and football teams president of the junior class during the school year just ended and presidentelect of the student council this coming fall And most amazing of all none of it had gone to his head In the words of Herb Smith who had been down once to check out Johnnys new digs Chuck was a regular guy Herb had no higher accolade in his vocabulary In addition he was someday going to be an exceedingly rich regular guy And here he sat bent grimly over his book like a machine gunner at a lonely outpost shooting the words down one by one as they came at him He had taken Max Brands exciting fastmoving story of drifting John Fire Brain Sherburne and his confrontation with the outlaw Comanche Red Hawk and had turned it into something that sounded every bit as exciting as a trade advertisement for semiconductors or radio components But Chuck wasnt stupid His math grades were good his retentive memory was excellent and he was manually adept His problem was that he had great difficulty storing printed words His oral vocabulary was fine and he could grasp the theory of phonics but apparently not it  practice and he would sometimes reel a sentence off flawlessly and then come up totally blank when you asked him to rephrase it His father had been afraid that Chuck was dyslexic but Johnny didnt think so  he had never met a dyslexic child that he was aware of although many parents seized on the words to explain or excuse the reading problems of their children Chucks problem seemed more general  a loose acrosstheboard reading phobia It was a problem that had become more and more apparent over the last five years of Chucks schooling but his parents had only begun to take it seriously  as Chuck had  when his sports eligibility became endangered And that was not the worst of it This winter would be Chucks last good chance to take the Scholastic Achievement Tests if he expected to start college in the fall of  The maths were not much of a problem but the rest of the exam well if he could have the questions read aloud to him he would do an averagetogood job Five hundreds no sweat But they dont let you bring a reader with you when you take the SATs not even if your dad is a biggie in the world of New Hampshire business But I found him a ch  changed man He knew what lay before him and his courage was  supper superb He asked for nothing he regretted nothing All the terror and the nerv  nervousness which had puss  possett possessed him so long as he was cuh cuh  culafronted  confronted by an unknown fate Johnny had seen the ad for a tutor in the Maine Times and had applied without too much hope He had moved down to Kittery in midFebruary needing more than anything else to get away from Pownal from the boxful of mail each day the reporters who had begun to find their way to the house in everincreasing numbers the nervous women with the wounded eyes who had just dropped by because they just happened to be in the neighborhood one of those who had just dropped by because she just happened to be in the neighborhood had a Maryland license plate another was driving a tired old Ford with Arizona tags Their hands stretching out to touch him In Kittery he had discovered for the first time that an anonymous name like JohnnomiddleinitialSmith had its advantages His third day in town he had applied for a job as a shortorder cook putting down his experience in the UMO commons and one summer cooking at a boys camp in the Rangely Lakes as experience The diners owner a toughasnails widow named Ruby Pelletier had looked over his application and said Youre a teensy bit overeducated for slinging hash You know that dont you slugger Thats right Johnny said I went and educated myself right out of the job market Ruby Pelletier put her hands on her scrawny hips threw her head back and bellowed laughter You think you can keep your shit together at two in the morning when twelve CB cowboys pull in all at once and order scrambled eggs bacon sausage french toast and flapjacks I guess maybe Johnny said I guess maybe you dont know what the eff Im talking about just yet Ruby said but Ill give you a go college boy Go get yourself a physical so were square with the board of health and bring me back a clean bill Ill put you right on He had done that and after a harumscarum first two weeks which included a painful rash of blisters on his right hand from dropping a frenchfry basket into a well of boiling fat a little too fast he had been riding the job instead of the other way around When he saw Chatsworths ad he had sent his resume to the box number In the course of the resume he had listed his special ed credentials which included a onesemester seminar in learning disabilities and reading problems In late April as he was finishing his second month at the diner he had gotten a letter from Roger Chatsworth asking him to appear for an interview on May  He made the necessary arrangements to take the day off and at  loon a lovely midspring afternoon he had been sitting in Chatsworths study a tall icechoked glass of PepsiCola in one hand listening to Stuart talk about his sons reading problems That sound like dyslexia to you Stuart asked No It sounds like a general reading phobia Chatsworth had winced a little Jacksons Syndrome Johnny had been impressed  as he was no doubt supposed to be Michael Carey Jackson was a readingandgrammar specialist from the University of Southern California who had caused something of a stir nine years ago with a book called The Unlearning Reader The book described a loose basket of reading problems that had since become known as Jacksons Syndrome The book was a good one if you could get past the dense academic jargon The fact that Chatsworth apparently had done so told Johnny a good deal about the mans commitment to solving his sons problem Something like it Johnny agreed But you understand I havent even met your son yet or listened to him read Hes got course work to make up from last year American Writers a nineweek history block and civics of all things He flunked his final exam there because he couldnt read the beastly thing Have you got a New Hampshire teachers certificate No Johnny said but getting one is no problem And how would you handle the situation Johnny outlined the way he would deal with it A lot of oral reading on Chucks part leaning heavily on highimpact materials such as fantasy science fiction Westerns and boymeetscar juvenile novels Constant questioning on what had just been read And a relaxation technique described in Jacksons book High achievers often suffer the most Johnny said They try too hard and reinforce the block Its a kind of mental stutter that  Jackson says that Chatsworth interposed sharply Johnny smiled No I say that he said Okay Go on Sometimes if the student can totally blank his mind right after reading and not feel the pressure to recite back right away the circuits seem to dear themselves When that begins to happen the student begins to rethink his line of attack Its a positive thinking kind of thing Chatsworths eyes had gleamed Johnny had just touched on the linchpin of his own personal philosophy probably the linchpin for the beliefs of most selfmade men Nothing succeeds like success he said Well yes Something like that How long would it take you to get a New Hampshire certificate No longer than it takes them to process my application Two weeks maybe Then you could start on the twentieth Johnny blinked You mean Im hired If you want the job youre hired You can stay in the guest house itll keep the goddam relatives at bay this summer not to mention Chucks friends  and I want him to really buckle down Ill pay you six hundred dollars a month not a kings ransom but if Chuck gets along Ill pay you a substantial bonus Substantial Chatsworth removed his glasses and rubbed a hand across his face I love my boy Mr Smith I only want the best for him Help us out a little if you can Ill try Chatsworth put his glasses back on and picked up Johnnys resume again You havent taught for a helluva long time Didnt agree with you Here it comes Johnny thought It agreed he said but I was in an accident Chatsworths eyes had gone to the scars on Johnnys neck where the atrophied tendons had been partially repaired Car crash Yes Bad one Yes You seem fine now Chatsworth said He picked up the resume slammed it into a drawer and amazingly that had been the end of the questions So after five years Johnny was teaching again although his student load was only one  As for me who had i  indirectly br   brog  brought his death upon him he took my hand with a weak grip and smiled his for forgiveness up to me It was a hard moment and I went away feeling that I had done more harm in the world than I could ever ma make up to it Chuck snapped the book closed There Last one in the pools a green banana Hold it a minute Chuck Ahhhhhhh  Chuck sat down again heavily his face composing itself into what Johnny already thought of as his now the questions expression Longsuffering good humor predominated but beneath it he could sometimes see another Chuck sullen worried and scared Plenty scared Because it was a readers world the unlettered of America were dinosaurs lumbering down a blind alley and Chuck was smart enough to know it And he was plenty afraid of what might happen to him when he got back to school this fall Just a couple of questions Chuck Why bother You know I wont be able to answer them Oh yes This time youll be able to answer them all I can never understand what I read you ought to know that by now Chuck looked morose and unhappy I dont even know what you stick around for unless its the chow Youll be able to answer these questions because theyre not about the book Chuck glanced up Not about the book Then why ask em I thought Just humour me okay Johnnys heart was pounding hard and he was not totally surprised to find that he was scared He had been planning this for a long time waiting for just the right confluence of circumstances This was as close as he was ever going to get Mrs Chatsworth was not hovering around anxiously making Chuck that much more nervous None of his buddies were splashing around in the pool making him feel selfconscious about reading aloud like a backward fourth grader And most important his father the man Chuck wanted to please above all others in the world was not here He was in Boston at a New England Environmental Commission meeting on water pollution From Edward Stanneys An Overview of Learning Disabilities The subject Rupert J was sitting in the third row of a movie theater He was closest to the screen by more than six rows and was the only one in a position to observe that a small fire had started in the accumulated litter on the floor Ru pert J stood up and cried FFFFF  while the people behind him shouted for him to sit down and be quiet  How did that make you feel l asked Rupert J I could never explain in a thousand years how it made me feel he answered J was scared but even more than being scared  was frustrated I felt inadequate not fit to be a member of the human race The stuttering always made me feel that way but now I felt impotent too Was there anything else Yes I felt jealousy because someone else would see the fire and you know Get the glory of reporting it Yes thats right I saw the fire starting I was the only one And all I could say was FFFF like a stupid broken record Not fit to be a member of the human race describes it best And how did you break the block The day before had been my mothers birthday l got her half a dozen roses at the florists And I stood there with all of them yelling at me and l thought I am going to open my mouth and scream ROSES lust as loud as I can I got that word all ready Then what did you do I opened my mouth and screamed FIRE at the top of my lungs It had been eight years since Johnny had read that case history in the introduction to Stanneys text but he had never forgotten it He had always thought that the key word in Rupert Js recollection of what had happened was impotent If you feel that sexual intercourse is the most important thing on earth at this point in time your risk of corning up with a limp penis increases ten or a hundredfold And if you feel that reading is the most important thing on earth Whats your middle name Chuck he asked casually Murphy Chuck said with a little grin Hows that for bad My mothers maiden name You tell Jack or Al that and Ill be forced to do gross damage to your skinny body Nofear Johnny said Whens your birthday September  Johnny began to throw the questions faster not giving Chuck a chance to think  but they werent questions you had to think about Whats your girls name Beth You know Beth Johnny Whats her middle name Chuck grinned Alma Pretty horrible right Whats your paternal grandfathers name Richard Who do you like in the American League East this year Yankees In a walk Who do you like for president Id like to see Jerry Brown get it You planning to trade that Vette Not this year Maybe next Your moms idea You bet She says it outraces her peace of mind How did Red Hawk get past the guards and kill Danny Jupiter Sherburne didnt pay enough attention to that trapdoor leading into the jail attic Chuck said promptly without thinking and Johnny felt a sudden burst of triumph that hit him like a knock of straight bourbon It had worked He had gotten Chuck talking about roses and he had responded with a good healthy yell of fire Chuck was looking at him in almost total surprise Red Hawk got into the attic through the skylight Kicked open the trapdoor Shot Danny Jupiter Shot Tom Kenyon too Thats right Chuck I remembered he muttered and then looked up at Johnny eyes widening a grin starting at the corners of his mouth You tricked me into remembering I just took you by the hand and led you around the side of whatever has been in your way all this time Johnny said But whatever it is its still there Chuck Dont kid yourself Who was the girl Sherburne fell for It was  His eyes clouded a little and he shook his head reluctantly I dont remember He struck his thigh with sudden viciousness I cant remember anything Im so fucking stupid Can you remember ever having been told how your dad and mom met Chuck looked up at him and smiled a little There was an angry red place on his thigh where he had struck himself Sure She was working for Avis down in Charleston South Carolina She rented my dad a car with a fiat tire Chuck laughed She still claims she only married him because number two tries harder And who was that girl Sherburne got interested in Jenny Langhorne Bigtime trouble for him Shes Greshams girl A redhead Like Beth She He broke off staring at Johnny as if he had just produced a rabbit from the breast pocket of his shirt You did it again No You did it Its a simple trick of misdirection Why do you say Jenny Langhorne is bigtime trouble for John Sherburne Well because Greshams the big wheel there in that town What town Chuck opened his mouth but nothing came out Suddenly he cut his eyes away from Johnnys face and looked at the pool Then he smiled and looked back Amity The same as in the flick Jaws Good How did you come up with the name Chuck grinned This makes no sense at all but I started thinking about trying out for the swimming team and there it was What a trick What a great trick Okay Thats enough for today I think Johnny felt tired sweaty and very very good You just made a breakthrough in case you didnt notice Lets swim Last one ins a green banana Johnny What Will that always work If you make a habit of it it will Johnny said And every time you go around that block instead of trying to bust through the middle of it youre going to make it a little smaller I think youll begin to see an improvement in your wordtoword reading before long also I know a couple of other little tricks He fell silent What he had just given Chuck was less the truth than a king of hypnotic suggestion Thanks Chuck said The mask of longsuffering good humor was gone replaced by naked gratitude If you get me over this Ill  well I guess Id get down and kiss your feet if you wanted me to Sometimes I get so scared I feel like Im letting my dad down Chuck dont you know thats part of the problem It is Yeah Youre  youre overswinging Overthrowing Overeverything And it may not be just a psychological block you know There are people who believe that some reading problems Jacksons Syndrome reading phobias all of that may be some kind of  mental birthmark A fouled circuit a faulty relay a d  He shut his mouth with a snap A what Chuck asked A dead zone Johnny said slowly Whatever Names dont matter Results do The misdirection trick really isnt a trick at all Its educating a fallow part of your brain to do the work of that small faulty section For you that means getting into an oralbased train of thought every time you hit a snag Youre actually changing the location in your brain from which your thought is coming Its learning to switchhit But can I do it You think I can do it I know you can Johnny said All right Then I will Chuck dived low and flat into the pool and came up shaking water out of his long hair in a fine spray of droplets Come on in Its fine I will Johnny said but for the moment he was content just to stand on the pools tile facing and watch Chuck swim powerfully toward the pools deep end to savor this success There had been no good feeling like this when he had suddenly known Eileen Magowns kitchen curtains were taking fire no good feeling like this when he had uncovered the name of Frank Dodd If God had given him a talent it was teaching not knowing things he had no business knowing This was the sort of thing he had been made for and when he had been teaching at Cleaves Mills back in  he had known it More important the kids had known it and responded to it as Chuck had done just now You gonna stand there like a dummy Chuck asked Johnny dived into the pool Warren Richardson came out of his small office building at quarter to five as he always did He walked around to the parking lot and hoisted his twohundredpound bulk behind the wheel of his Chevy Caprice and started the engine All according to routine What was not according to routine was the face that appeared suddenly in the rearview mirror an oliveskinned stubbled face framed by long hair and set off by eyes every bit as green as those of Sarah Hazlett or Chuck Chatsworth Warren Richardson had not been so badly scared since he was a kid and his heart took a great unsteady leap in his chest Howdy said Sonny Elliman leaning over the seat Who  was all Richardson managed uttering the word in a terrified hiss of breath His heart was pounding so hard that dark specks danced and pulsed before his eyes in rhythm with its beat He was afraid he might have a heart attack Easy the man who had been hiding in his back seat said Go easy man Lighten up And Warren Richardson felt an absurd emotion It was gratitude The man who had scared him wasnt going to scare him anymore He must be a nice man he must be Who are you he managed this time A friend Sonny said Richardson started to turn and fingers as hard as pincers bit into the sides of his flabby neck The pain was excruciating Richardson drew breath in a convulsive heaving whine You dont need to turn around man You can see me as well as you need to see me in your rearview Can you dig that Yes Richardson gasped Yes yes yes just let me go I The pincers began to ease up and again he felt that irrational sense of gratitude But he no longer doubted that the man in the back seat was dangerous or that he was in this car on purpose although he couldnt think why anyone would And then he could think why someone would at least why someone might it wasnt the sort of thing youd expect any ordinary candidate for office to do but Greg Stillson wasnt ordinary Greg Stillson was a crazy man and Very softly Warren Richardson began to blubber Got to talk to you man Sonny said His voice was kind and regretful but in the rearview mirror his eyes glittered green amusement Got to talk to you like a Dutch uncle Its Stillson isnt it Its   The pincers were suddenly back the mans fingers were buried in his neck and Richardson uttered a highpitched shriek No names the terrible man in the back seat told him in that same kindyetregretful voice You draw your own conclusions Mr Richardson but keep the names to yourself Ive got one thumb just over your carotid artery and my fingers are over by your jugular and I can turn you into a human turnip if I want to What do you want Richardson asked He did not exactly moan but it was a near thing he had never felt more like moaning in his life He could not believe that this was happening in the parking lot behind his real estate office in Capital City New Hampshire on a bright summers day He could see the clock set into the red brick of the town hall tower It said ten minutes to five At home Norma would be putting the pork chops nicely coated with Shake n Bake into the oven to broil Sean would be watching Sesame Street on TV And there was a man behind him threatening to cut off the flow of blood to his brain and turn him into an idiot No it wasnt real it was like a nightmare The sort of nightmare that makes you moan in your sleep I dont want anything Sonny Elliman said Its all a matter of what you want I dont understand what youre talking about But he was terribly afraid that he did That story in the New Hampshire Journal about funny real estate deals Sonny said You surely did have a lot to say Mr Richardson didnt you Especially about certain people I That stuff about the Capital Mail for instance Hinting around about kickbacks and payoffs and one hand washing the other All that horseshit The fingers tightened on Richardsons neck again and this time he did moan But he hadnt been identified in the story he had just been an informed source How had they known How had Greg Stillson known The man behind him began to speak rapidly into Warren Richardsons ear now his breath warm and ticklish You could get certain people into trouble talking horseshit like that Mr Richardson you know it People running for public office lets say Running for office its like playing bridge you dig it Youre vulnerable People can sling mud and it sticks especially these days Now theres no trouble yet Im happy to tell you that because if there was trouble you might be sitting here picking your teeth out of your nose instead of having a nice little talk with me In spite of his pounding heart in spite of his fear Richardson said This  this person  young man youre crazy if you think you can protect him Hes played it as fast and loose as a snakeoil salesman in a southern town Sooner or later A thumb slammed into his ear grinding The pain was immense unbelievable Richardsons head slammed into his window and he cried out Blindly he groped for the horn ring You blow that horn Ill kill you the voice whispered Richardson let his hands drop The thumb eased up You ought to use Qtips in there man the voice said I got wax all over my thumb Pretty gross Warren Richardson began to cry weakly He was powerless to stop himself Tears coursed down his fat cheeks Please dont hurt me anymore he said Please dont Please Its like I said Sonny told him Its all a matter of what you want Your job isnt to worry what someone else might say about  these certain people Your job is to watch what comes out of your own mouth Your job is to think before you talk the next time that guy from the Journal comes around You might think about how easy it is to find out who an informed source is Or you might think about what a bummer it would be if your house burned down Or you might think about how youd pay for plastic surgery if someone threw some battery acid in your wifes face The man behind Richardson was panting now He sounded like an animal in a jungle Or you might think you know dig it how easy it would be for someone to come along and pick up your son on his way home from kindergarten Dont you say that Richardson cried hoarsely Dont you say that you slimy bastard All Im saying is that you want to think about what you want Sonny said An election its an allAmerican thing you know Especially in a Bicentennial year Everyone should have a good time No one has a good time if numb fucks like you start telling a lot of lies Numb jealous fucks like you The hand went away altogether The rear door opened Oh thank God thank God You just want to think Sonny Elliman repeated Now do we have an understanding Yes Richardson whispered But if you think Gr a certain person can be elected using these tactics youre badly mistaken No Sonny said Youre the one whos mistaken Because everyones having a good time Make sure that youre not left out Richardson didnt answer He sat rigid behind the steering wheel his neck throbbing staring at the clock on the Town Office Building as if it were the only sane thing left in his life It was now almost five of five The pork chops would be in by now The man in the back seat said one more thing and then he was gone striding away rapidly his long hair swinging against the collar of his shirt not looking back He went around the corner of the building and out of sight The last thing he had said to Warren Richardson was QTips Richardson began to shake all over and it was a long time before he could drive His first clear feeling was anger  terrible anger The impulse that came with it was to drive directly to the Capital City police department housed in the building below the dock and report what had happened  the threats on his wife and son the physical abuse  and on whose behalf it had been done You might think about how youd pay for plastic surgery  or how easy it would be for someone to come along and pick up your son But why Why take the chance What he had said to that thug was just the plain unvarnished truth Everyone in southern New Hampshire real estate knew that Stillson had been running a shell game reaping shortterm profits that would land him in jail not sooner or later but sooner or even sooner His campaign was an exercise in idiocy And now strongarm tactics No one could get away with that for long in America  and especially not in New England But let someone else blow the whistle Someone with less to lose Warren Richardson started his car and went home to his pork chops and said nothing at all Someone else would surely put a stop to it On a day not long after Chucks first breakthrough Johnny Smith stood in the bathroom of the guest house running his Norelco over his cheeks Looking at himself closeup in a mirror always gave him a weird feeling these days as if he were looking at an older brother instead of himself Deep horizontal lines had grooved themselves across his forehead Two more bracketed his mouth Strangest of all there was that streak of white and the rest of his hair was beginning to go gray It seemed to have started almost overnight He snapped off the razor and went out into the combination kitchenliving room Lap of luxury he thought and smiled a little Smiling was starting to feel natural again He turned on the TV got a Pepsi out of the fridge and settled down to watch the news Roger Chatsworth was due back later in the evening and tomorrow Johnny would have the distinct pleasure of telling him that his son was beginning to make real progress Johnny had been up to see his own father every two weeks or so He was pleased with Johnnys new job and listened with keen interest as Johnny told him about the Chatsworths the house in the pleasant college town of Durham and Chucks problems Johnny in turn listened as his father told him about the gratis work he was doing at Charlene MacKenzies house in neighboring New Gloucester Her husband was a helluva doctor but not much of a handyman Herb said Charlene and Vera had been friends before Veras deepening involvement in the stranger offshoots of fundamentalism That had separated them Her husband a GP had died of a heart attack in  Place was practically falling down around that womans ears Herb said Least I could do I go up on Saturdays and she gives me a dinner before I come back home I have to tell the truth Johnny she cooks better than you do Looks better too Johnny said blandly Sure shes a finelooking woman but its nothing like that Johnny Your mother not even in her grave a year But Johnny suspected that maybe it was something like that and secretly couldnt have been more pleased He didnt fancy the idea of his father growing old alone On the television Walter Cronkite was serving up the evenings political news Now with the primary season over and the conventions only weeks away it appeared that Jimmy Carter had the Democratic nomination sewed up It was Ford who was in a scrap for his political life with Ronald Reagan the exgovernor of California and exhost of GE Theater It was close enough to have the reporters counting individual delegates and in one of her infrequent letters Sarah Hazlett had written Walts got his fingers and toes crossed that Ford gets in As a candidate for state senate up here hes already thinking about coattails And he says that in Maine at least Reagan hasnt any While he was shortorder cooking in Kittery Johnny had gotten into the habit of going down to Dover or Portsmouth or any number of smaller towns in New Hampshire a couple of times a week All of the candidates for president were in and out and it was a unique opportunity to see those who were running closeup and without the nearly regal trappings bf authority that might later surround any one of them It became something of a hobby although of necessity a shortlived one when New Hampshires firstinthenation primary was over the candidates would move on to Florida without a glance back And of course a few of their number would bury their political ambitions somewhere between Portsmouth and Keene Never a political creature before except during the Vietnam era  Johnny became an avid politicianwatcher in the healing aftermath of the Castle Rock business  and his own particular talent affliction whatever it was played a part in that too He shook hands with Morris Udall and Henry Jackson Fred Harris clapped him on the back Ronald Reagan gave him a quick and practiced politicos doublepump and said Get out to the polls and help us if you can Johnny had nodded agreeably enough seeing no point in disabusing Mr Reagan of his notion that he was a bona fide New Hampshire voter He had chatted with Sarge Shriver just inside the main entrance to the monstrous Newington Mall for nearly fifteen minutes Shriver his hair freshly cut and smelling of aftershave and perhaps desperation was accompanied by a single aide with his pockets stuffed full of leaflets and a Secret Service man who kept scratching furtively at his acne Shriver had seemed inordinately pleased to be recognized A minute or two before Johnny said goodbye a candidate in search of some local office had approached Shriver and asked him to sign his nominating papers Shriver had smiled gently Johnny had sensed things about all of them but little of a specific nature It was as if they had made the act of touching such a ritual that their true selves were buried beneath a layer of tough clear lucite Although he saw most of them  with the exception of President Ford Johnny had felt only once that sudden electrifying snap of knowledge that he associated with Eileen Magown and in an entirely different way with Frank Dodd It was a quarter of seven in the morning Johnny had driven down to Manchester in his old Plymouth He had worked from ten the evening before until six this morning He was tired but the quiet winter dawn had been too good to sleep through And he liked Manchester Manchester with its narrow streets and timeworn brick buildings the gothic textile mills strung along the river like midVictorian beads He had not been consciously politicianhunting that morning he thought he would cruise the streets for a while until they began to get crowded until the cold and silent spell of February was broken then go back to Kittery and catch some sacktime He turned a corner and there had been three nondescript sedans pulled up in front of a shoe factory in a noparking zone Standing by the gate in the cyclone fencing was Jimmy Carter shaking hands with the men and women going on shift They were carrying lunch buckets or paper sacks breathing out white clouds bundled into heavy coats their faces still asleep Carter had a word for each of them His grin then not so publicized as it became later was tireless and fresh His nose was red with the cold Johnny parked half a block down and walked toward the factory gate his shoes crunching and squeaking on the packed snow The Secret Service agent with Carter sized him up quickly and then dismissed him or seemed to Ill vote for anyone whos interested in cutting taxes a man in an old ski parka was saying The parka had a constellation of what looked like batteryacid burns in one sleeve The goddam taxes are killing me I kid you not Well were gonna see about that Carter said Lookin over the tax situation is gonna be one of our first priorities when I get into the White House There was a serene selfconfidence in his voice that struck Johnny and made him a little uneasy Carters eyes bright and almost amazingly blue shifted to Johnny Hi there he said Hello Mr Carter Johnny said I dont work here I was driving by and saw you Well Im glad you stopped Im running for President I know Carter put his hand out Johnny shook it Carter began I hope youll And broke off The flash came a sudden powerful zap that was like sticking his finger in an electric socket Carters eyes sharpened He and Johnny looked at each other for what seemed a very long time The Secret Service guy didnt like it He moved toward Carter and suddenly he was unbuttoning his coat Somewhere behind them a million miles behind them the shoe factorys seven oclock whistle blew its single note into the crisp blue morning Johnny let go of Carters hand but still the two of them looked at each other What the hell was that Carter asked very softly Youve probably got someplace to go dont you the Secret Service guy said suddenly He put a hand on Johnnys shoulder It was a very big hand Sure you do Its all right Carter said Youre going to be president Johnny said The agents hand was still on Johnnys shoulder more lightly now but still there and he was getting something from him too The Secret Service guy eyes didnt like his eyes He thought they were assassins eyes psychos eyes cold and strange and if this guy put so much as one hand in his coat pocket if he even looked as if he might be going in that direction he was going to put him on the sidewalk Behind the Secret Service guys secondtosecond evaluation of the situation there ran a simple maddening litany of thought laurel maryland laurel maryland laurel maryland laurel Yes Carter said Its going to be closer than anyone thinks  closer than you think but youll win Hell beat himself Poland Poland will beat him Carter only looked at him halfsmiling Youve got a daughter Shes going to go to a public school in Washington Shes going to go to But it was in the dead zone I think  its a school named after a freed slave Fellow I want you to move on the agent said Carter looked at him and the agent subsided Its been a pleasure meeting you Carter said A little disconcerting but a pleasure Suddenly Johnny was himself again It had passed He was aware that his ears were cold and that he had to go to the bathroom Have a good morning he said lamely Yes You too now He had gone back to his car aware of the Secret Service guys eyes still on him He drove away bemused Shortly after Carter had put away the competition in New Hampshire and went on to Florida  Walter Cronkite finished with the politicians and went on to the civil war in Lebanon Johnny got up and freshened his glass of Pepsi He tipped the glass at the TV Your good health Walt To the three Ds  death destruction and destiny Where would we be without them There was a light tap at the door Come in Johnny called expecting Chuck probably with an invitation to the drivein over in Somersworth But it wasnt Chuck It was Chucks father Hi Johnny he said He was wearing washaded jeans and an old cotton sports shirt the tails out May I come in Sure I thought you werent due back until late Well Shelley gave me a call Shelley was his wife Roger came in and shut the door Chuck came to see her Burst into tears just like a little kid He told her you were doing it Johnny He said he thought he was going to be all right Johnny put his glass down Weve got a ways to go he said Chuck met me at the airport I havent seen him looking like he did since he was  what Ten Eleven When I gave him the  hed been waiting for for five years He read me a story out of the newspaper The improvement is  almost eerie I came over to thank you Thank Chuck Johnny said Hes an adaptable boy A lot of whats happening to him is positive reinforcement Hes psyched himself into believing he can do it and now hes tripping on it Thats the best way I can put it Roger sat down He says youre teaching him to switchhit Johnny smiled Yeah I guess so Is he going to be able to take the SATs I dont know And Id hate to see him gamble and lose The SATs are a heavy pressure situation If he gets in that lecture hall with an answer sheet in front of him and an IBM pencil in his hand and then freezes up its going to be a real setback for him Have you thought about a good prep school for a year A place like Pittsfield Academy Weve kicked the idea around but frankly I always thought of it as just postponing the inevitable Thats one of the things thats been giving Chuck trouble This feeling that hes in a makeorbreak situation Ive never pressured Chuck Not on purpose I know that So does he On the other hand youre a rich successful man who graduated from college sum ma cum laude I think Chuck feels a little bit like hes batting after Hank Aaron Theres nothing I can do about that Johnny I think a year at a prep school away from home after his senior year might put things in perspective for him And he wants to go to work in one of your mills next summer If he were my kid and if they were my mills Id let him Chuck wants to do that How come he never told me Because he didnt want you to think he was asskissing Johnny said He told you that Yes He wants to do it because he thinks the practical experience will be helpful to him later on The kid wants to follow in your footsteps Mr Chatsworth Youve left some big ones behind you Thats what a lot of the reading block has been about Hes having buck fever In a sense he had lied Chuck had hinted around these things and even mentioned some of them obliquely but he had not been as frank as Johnny had led Roger Chatsworth to believe Not verbally at least But Johnny had touched him from time to time and he had gotten signals that way He had looked through the pictures Chuck kept in his wallet and knew how Chuck felt about his dad There were things he could never tell this pleasant but rather distant man sitting across from him Chuck idolized the ground his father walked on Beneath his easycome easygo exterior an exterior that was very similar to Rogers the boy was eaten up by the secret conviction that he could never measure up His father had built a ten percent interest in a failing woolen mill into a New England textile empire He believed that the issue of his fathers love hung on his own ability to move similar mountains To play sports To get into a good college To read How sure are you about all of this Roger asked Im pretty sure But Id appreciate it if you never mentioned to Chuck that we talked this way Theyre his secrets Im telling And thats truer than youll ever know All right And Chuck and his mother and I will talk over the prep school idea In the meantime this is yours He took out a plain white business envelope from his back pocket and passed it to Johnny What is it Open it and see Johnny opened it Inside the envelope was a cashiers check for five hundred dollars Oh hey  I cant take this You can and you will I promised you a bonus if you could perform and I keep my promises Therell be another when you leave Really Mr Chatsworth I just Shh Ill tell you something Johnny He leaned forward He was smiling a peculiar little smile and Johnny suddenly felt he could see beneath the pleasant exterior to the man who had made all of this happen  the house the grounds the pool the mills And of course his sons reading phobia which could probably be classified a hysterical neurosis Its been my experience that ninetyfive percent of the people who walk the earth are simply inert Johnny One percent are saints and one percent are assholes The other three percent are the people who do what they say they can do Im in that three percent and so are you You earned that money Ive got people in the mills that take home eleven thousand dollars a year for doing little more than playing with their dicks But Im not bitching Im a man of the world and all that means is I understand what powers the world The fuel mix is one part highoctane to nine parts pure bullshit Youre no bullshitter So you put that money in your wallet and next time try to value yourself a little higher All right Johnny said I can put it to good use I wont lie to you about that Doctor bills Johnny looked up at Roger Chatsworth his eyes narrowed I know all about you Roger said Did you think I wouldnt check back on the guy I hired to tutor my son You know about Youre supposed to be a psychic of some kind You helped to solve a murder case in Maine At least thats what the papers say You had a teaching job lined up for last January but they dropped you like a hot potato when your name got in the papers You knew For how long I knew before you moved in And you still hired me I wanted a tutor didnt I You looked like you might be able to pull it off I think I showed excellent judgment in engaging your services Well thanks Johnny said His voice was hoarse I told you you didnt have to say that As they talked Walter Cronkite had finished up with the real news of the day and had gone on to the man bites dog stories that sometimes turn up near the end of a newscast He was saying   voters in western New Hampshire have an independent running in the third district this year Well the cash will come in handy Johnny said Thats    Shh I want to hear this Chatsworth was leaning forward hands dangling between his knees a pleasant smile of expectation on his face Johnny turned to look at the TV   Stillson Cronkite said This fortythreeyearold insurance and real estate agent is surely running one of the most eccentric races of Campaign  but both the thirddistrict Republican candidate Harrison Fisher and his Democratic opponent David Bowes are running scared because the polls have Greg Stillson running comfortably ahead George Herman has the story Whos Stillson Johnny asked Chatsworth laughed Oh you gotta see this guy Johnny Hes as crazy as a rat in a drainpipe But I do believe the sobersided electorate of the third district is going to send him to Washington this November Unless he actually falls down and starts frothing at the mouth And I wouldnt completely rule that out Now the TV showed a picture of a handsome young man in a white openthroated shirt He was speaking to a small crowd from a buntinghung platform in a supermarket parking lot The young man was exhorting the crowd The crowd looked less than thrilled George Herman voiced over This is David Bowes the Democratic candidate  sacrificial offering some would say  for the thirddistrict seat in New Hampshire Bowes expected an uphill fight because New Hampshires third district has never gone Democratic not even in the great LBJ blitz of  But he expected his competition to come from this man Now the TV showed a man of about sixtyfive He was speaking to a plushy fundraising dinner The crowd had that plump righteous and slightly constipated look that seems the exclusive province of businessmen who belong to the GOP The speaker bore a remarkable resemblance to Edward Gurney of Florida although he did not have Gurneys slim tough build This is Harrison Fisher Herman said The voters of the third district have been sending him to Washington every two years since  He is a powerful figure in the house sitting on five committees and chairing the House Committee on Parks and Waterways It had been expected that he would beat young David Bowes handily But neither Fisher nor Bowes counted on a wild card in the deck This wild card The picture switched Holy God Johnny said Beside him Chatsworth roared laughter and slapped his thighs Can you believe that guy No lackadaisical supermarket parkinglot crowd here No comfy fund raiser in the Granite State Room of the Portsmouth Hilton either Greg Stillson was standing on a platform outside in Ridgeway his home town Behind him there loomed the statue of a Union soldier with his rifle in his hand and his kepi tilted down over his eyes The street was blocked off and crowded with wildly cheering people predominantly young people Stillson was wearing faded jeans and a twopocket Army fatigue shirt with the words GIVE PEACE A CHANCE embroidered on one pocket and MOMS APPLE PIE on the other There was a hiimpact construction workers helmet cocked at an arrogant rakish angle on his head and plastered to the front of it was a green American flag ecology sticker Beside him was a stainless steel cart of some kind From the twin loudspeakers came the sound of John Denver singing Thank God Im a Country Boy Whats that cart Johnny asked Youll see Roger said still grinning hugely Herman said The wild card is Gregory Ammas Stillson fortythree exsalesman for the Truthway Bible Company of America exhousepainter and in Oklahoma where he grew up onetime rainmaker Rainmaker said Johnny bemused Oh thats one of his planks Roger said If hes elected well have rain whenever we need it George Herman went on Stillsons platform is  well refreshing John Denver finished singing with a yell that brought answering cheers from the crowd Then Stillson started talking his voice booming at peak amplification His PA system at least was sophisticated there was hardly any distortion His voice made Johnny vaguely uneasy The man had the high hard pumping delivery of a revival preacher You could see a fine spray of spittle from his lips as he talked What are we gonna do in Washington Why do we want to go to Washington Stillson roared Whats our platform Our platform got five boards my friends n neighbors five old boards And what are they Ill tell you up front First board THROW THE BUMS OUT A tremendous roar of approval ripped out of the crowd Someone threw double handfuls of confetti into the air and someone else yelled YaaaahHOO Stillson leaned over his podium You wanna know why Im wearing this helmet friends n neighbors Ill tell you why Im wearin it because when you send me up to Washington Im gonna go through them like youknowwhat through a canebrake Gonna go through em just like this And before Johnnys wondering eyes Stillson put his head down and began to charge up and down the podium stage like a bull uttering a high yipping Rebel yell as he did so Roger Chatsworth simply dissolved in his chair laughing helplessly The crowd went wild Stillson charged back to the podium took off his construction helmet and spun it into the crowd A minor riot over possession of it immediately ensued Second board Stillson yelled into the mike Were gonna throw out anyone in the government from the highest to the lowest who is spending time in bed with some gal who aint his wife If they wanna sleep around they aint gonna do it on the public tit What did he say Johnny asked blinking Oh hes just getting warmed up Roger said He wiped his streaming eyes and went off into another gale of laughter Johnny wished it seemed that funny to him Third board Stillson roared Were gonna send all the pollution right into outer space Gonna put it in Hefty bags Gonna put it in Glad bags Gonna send it to Mars to Jupiter and the rings of Saturn Were gonna have clean air and were gonna have clean water and were gonna have it in SIX MONTHS The crowd was in paroxysms of joy Johnny saw many people in the crowd who were almost killing themselves laughing as Roger Chatsworth was presently doing Fourth board Were gonna have all the gas and oil we need Were gonna stop playing games with these Arabs and get down to brass tacks Aint gonna be no old people in New Hampshire turned into Popsicles this coming winter like there was last winter This brought a solid roar of approval The winter before an old woman in Portsmouth had been found frozen to death in her thirdfloor apartment apparently following a turnoff by the gas company for nonpayment We got the muscle friends n neighbors we can do it Anybody out there think we cant do it NO The crowd bellowed back Last board Stillson said and approached the metal cart He threw back the hinged lid and a cloud of steam puffed out HOT DOGS He began to grab double handfuls of hot dogs from the cart which Johnny now recognized as a portable steam table He threw them into the crowd and went back for more Hot dogs flew everywhere Hot dogs for every man woman and child in America And when you put Greg Stillson in the House of Representatives you gonna say HOT DOG SOMEONE GIVES A RIP AT LAST The picture changed The podium was being dismantled by a crew of longhaired young men who looked like rock band roadies Three more of them were cleaning up the litter the crowd had left behind George Herman resumed Democratic candidate David Bowes calls Stillson a practical joker who is trying to throw a monkeywrench into the workings of the democratic process Harrison Fisher is stronger in his criticism He calls Stillson a cynical carnival pitchman who is playing the whole idea of the free election as a burlesquehouse joke In speeches he refers to independent candidate Stilison as the only member of the American Hot Dog party But the fact is this the latest CBS poll in New Hampshires third district showed David Bowes with twenty percent of the vote Harrison Fisher with twentysix  and maverick Greg Stillson with a whopping fortytwo percent Of course election day is still quite a way down the road and things may change But for now Greg Stillson has captured the hearts  if not the minds  of New Hampshires thirddistrict voters The TV showed a shot of Herman from the waist up Both hands had been out of sight Now he raised one of them and in it was a hot dog He took a big bite This is George Herman CBS News in Ridgeway New Hampshire Walter Cronkite came back on in the CBS newsroom chuckling Hot dogs he said and chuckled again And thats the way it is    Johnny got up and snapped off the set I just cant believe that he said That guys really a candidate Its not a joke Whether its a joke or not is a matter of personal interpretation Roger said grinning but he really is running Im a Republican myself born and bred but I must admit I get a kick out of that guy Stillson You know he hired half a dozen exmotorcycle outlaws as bodyguards Real iron horsemen Not Hells Angels or anything like that but I guess they were pretty rough customers He seems to have reformed them Motorcycle freaks as security Johnny didnt like the sound of that very much The motorcycle freaks had been in charge of security when the Rolling Stones gave their free concert at Altamont Speedway in California It hadnt worked out so well People put up with a  a motorcycle goon squad No it really isnt like that Theyre quite cleancut And Stillson has a helluva reputation around Ridgeway for reforming kids in trouble Johnny grunted doubtfully You saw him Roger said gesturing at the TV set The man is a clown He goes charging around the speaking platform like that at every rally Throws his helmet into the crowd  Id guess hes gone through a hundred of them by now  and gives out hot dogs Hes a clown so what Maybe people need a little comic relief from time to time Were runningout of oil the inflation is slowly but surely getting out of control the average guys tax load has never been heavier and were apparently getting ready to elect a fuzzyminded Georgia cracker president of the United States So people want a giggle or two Even more they want to thumb their noses at a political establishment that doesnt seem able to solve anything Stillsons harmless Hes in orbit Johnny said and they both laughed We have plenty of crazy politicians around Roger said In New Hampshire weve got Stillson who wants to hot dog his way into the House of Representatives so what Out in California theyve got Hayakawa Or take our own governor Meldrim Thomson Last year he wanted to arm the New Hampshire National Guard with tactical nuclear weapons Id call that bigtime crazy Are you saying its okay for those people in the third district to elect the village fool to represent them in Washington You dont get it Chatsworth said patiently Take a voterseyeview Johnny Those thirddistrict people are mostly all bluecollars and shopkeepers The most rural parts of the district are just starting to develop some recreational potential Those people look at David Bowes and they see a hungry young kid whos trying to get elected on the basis of some slick talk and a passing resemblance to Dustin Hoffman Theyre supposed to think hes a man of the people because he wears blue jeans Then take Fisher My man at least nominally Ive organized fund raisers for him and the other Republican candidates around this part of New Hampshire Hes been on the Hill so long he probably thinks the Capitol dome would split in two pieces if he wasnt around to give it moral support Hes never had an original thought in his life he never went against the party line in his life Theres no stigma attached to his name because hes too stupid to be very crooked although hell probably wind up with some mud on him from this Koreagate thing His speeches have all the excitement of the copy of the National Plumbers Wholesale Catalogue People dont know all those things but they can sense them sometimes The idea that Harrison Fisher is doing anything for his constituency is just plain ridiculous So the answer is to elect a loony Chatsworth smiled indulgently Sometimes these loonies turn out doing a pretty good job Look at Bella Abzug Theres a damn fine set of brains under those crazy hats But even if Stillson turns out to be as crazy in Washington as he is down in Ridgeway hes only renting the seat for two years Theyll turn him out in  and put in someone who understands the lesson The lesson Roger stood up Dont fuck the people over for too long he said Thats the lesson Adam Clayton Powell found out Agnew and Nixon did too Just dont fuck the people for too long He glanced at his watch Come on over to the big house and have a drink Johnny Shelley and I are going out later on but weve got time for a short one Johnny smiled and got up Okay he said You twisted my arm In midAugust Johnny found himself alone at the Chatsworth estate except for Ngo Phat who had his own quarters over the garage The Chatsworth family had closed up the house and had gone to Montreal for three weeks of rr before the new school year and the fall rush at the mills began Roger had left Johnny the keys to his wifes Mercedes and he motored up to his dads house in Pownal feeling like a potentate His fathers negotiations with Charlene MacKenzie had entered the critical stage and Herb was no longer bothering to protest that his interest in her was only to make sure that the house didnt fall down on top of her In fact he was in full courting plumage and made Johnny a little nervous After three days of it Johnny went back to the Chatsworth house caught up on his reading and his correspondence and soaked up the quiet He was sitting on a rubber chair float in the middle of the pool drinking a SevenUp and reading the New York Times Book Review when Ngo came over to the pools apron took off his zori and dipped his feet into the water Ahhhh he said Much better He smiled at Johnny Quiet huh Very quiet Johnny agreed How goes the citizenship class Ngo Very nice going Ngo said We are having a field trip on Saturday First one Very exciting The whole class will be tripping Going Johnny said smiling at an image of Ngo Phats whole citizenship class freaking on LSD or psilpcybin Pardon He raised his eyebrows politely Your whole class will he going Yes thanks We are going to the political speech and rally in Trimbull We are all thinking how lucky it is to be taking the citizenship class in an election year It is most instructive Yes Ill bet it is Who are you going to see Greg Stirrs He stopped and pronounced it again very carefully Greg Stillson who is running independently for a seat in the US House of Representatives Ive heard of him Johnny said Have you discussed him in class at all Ngo Yes we have had some conversation of this man Born in  A man of many jobs He came to New Hampshire in  Our instructor has told us that now he is here long enough so people do not see him as a carpetfogger Bagger Johnny said Ngo looked at him with blank politeness The term is carpetbagger Yes thanks Do you find Stillson a bit odd In America perhaps he is odd Ngo said In Vietnam there were many like him People who are  He sat thinking swishing his small and delicate feet in the bluegreen water of the pool Then he looked up at Johnny again I do not have the English for what I wish to say There is a game the people of my land play it is called the Laughing Tiger It is old and much loved like your baseball One child is dressing up as the tiger you see He puts on a skin And the other children tries to catch him as he runs and dances The child in the skin laughs but he is also growling and biting because that is the game In my country before the Communists many of the village leaders played the Laughing Tiger I think this Stillson knows that game too Johnny looked over at Ngo disturbed Ngo did not seem disturbed at all He smiled So we will all go and see for ourselves After we are having the picnic foods I myself am making two pies I think it will be nice It sounds great It will be very great Ngo said getting up Afterward in class we will talk over all we saw in Trimbull Maybe we will be writing the compositions It is much easier to write the compositions because one can look up the exact word Le mot juste Yes sometimes writing can be easier But I never had a high school comp class that would believe it Ngo smiled How does it go with Chuck Hes doing quite well Yes he is happy now Not just pretending He is a good boy He stood up Take a rest Johnny Im going to take a nap All right He watched Ngo walk away small slim and lithe in blue jeans and a faded chambray work shirt The child in the skin laughs but he is also growling and biting because that is the game  I think this Stillson knows that game too That thread of disquiet again The pool chair bobbed gently up and down The sun beat pleasantly on him He opened his Book Review again but the article he had been reading no longer engaged him He put it down and paddled the little rubber float to the edge of the pool and got out Trimbull was less than thirty miles away Maybe he would just hop into Mrs Chatsworths Mercedes and drive down this Saturday See Greg Stillson in person Enjoy the show Maybe maybe shake his hand No No But why not After all he had more or less made politicians his hobby this election year What could possibly be so upsetting about going to see one more But he was upset no question about that His heart was knocking harder and more rapidly than it should have been and he managed to drop his magazine into the pool He fished it out with a curse before it was saturated Somehow thinking about Greg Stilison made him think about Frank Dodd Utterly ridiculous He couldnt have any feeling at all about Stillson one way or the other from having just seen him on TV Stay away Well maybe he would and maybe he wouldnt Maybe he would go down to Boston this Saturday instead See a film But a strange heavy feeling of fright had settled on him by the time he got back to the guest house and changed his clothes In a way the feeling was like an old friend  the sort of old friend you secretly hate Yes he would go down to Boston on Saturday That would be better Although he relived that day over and over in the months afterward Johnny could never remember exactly how or why it was that he ended up in Trimbull after all He had set out in another direction planning to go down to Boston and take in the Red Sox at Fenway Park then maybe go over to Cambridge and nose through the bookshops If there was enough cash left over he had sent four hundred dollars of Chatsworths bonus to his father who in turn sent it on to Eastern Maine Medical  a gesture tantamount to a spit in the ocean he planned to go to the Orson Welles Cinema and see that reggae movie The Harder They Come A good days program and a fine day to implement it that August  had dawned hot and dear and sweet the distillation of the perfect New England summers day He had let himself into the kitchen of the big house and made three hefty hamandcheese sandwiches for lunch put them in an oldfashioned wicker picnic basket he found in the pantry and after a little soulsearching had topped off his haul with a sixpack of Tuborg Beer At that point he had been feeling fine absolutely firstrate No thought of either Greg Stillson or his homemade bodyguard corps of iron horsemen had so much as crossed his mind He put the picnic basket on the floor of the Mercedes and drove southeast toward  All clear enough up to that point But then other things had begun to creep in Thoughts of his mother on her deathbed first His mothers face twisted into a frozen snarl the hand on the counterpane hooked into a claw her voice sounding as if it were coming through a big mouthful of cotton wadding Didnt I tell you Didnt I say it was so Johnny turned the radio up louder Good rock n roll poured out of the Mercedess stereo speakers He had been asleep for fourandahalf years but rock n roll had remained alive and well thank you very much Johnny sang along He has a job for you Dont run from him Johnny The radio couldnt drown out his dead mothers voice His dead mother was going to have her say Even from beyond the grave she was going to have her say Dont hide away in a cave or make him have to send a big fish to swallow you But he had been swallowed by a big fish Its name was not leviathan but coma He had spent fourandahalf years in that particular fishs black belly and that was enough The entrance ramp to the turnpike came up  and then slipped behind him He had been so lost in his thoughts that he had missed his turn The old ghosts just wouldnt give up and let him alone Well he would turn around and go back as soon as he found a good place Not the potter but the potters clay Johnny Oh come on he muttered He had to get this crap off his mind that was all His mother had been a religious crazy not a very kind way of putting it but true all the same Heaven out in the constellation Orion angels driving flying saucers kingdoms under the earth In her way she had been at least as crazy as Greg Stillson was in his Oh for Christs sake dont get off on that guy And when you send Greg Stillson to the House of Representatives you gonna say HOT DOG SOMEONE GIVES A RIP AT LAST He came to New Hampshire Route  A left turn would take him to Concord Berlin Ridders Mill Trimbull Johnny made the turn without even thinking about it His thoughts were elsewhere Roger Chatsworth no babe in the woods had laughed over Greg Stillson as if he were this years answer to George Carlin and Chevy Chase all rolled up into one Hes a clown Johnny And if that was all Stillson was then there was no problem was there A charming eccentric a piece of blank paper on which the electorate could write its message You other guys are so wasted that we decided to elect this fool for two years instead That was probably all Stillson was after all Just a harmless crazy there was no need at all to associate him with the patterned destructive madness of Frank Dodd And yet  somehow he did The road branched ahead Left branch to Berlin and Ridders Mill right branch to Trimbull and Concord Johnny turned right But it wouldnt hurt to just shake his hand would it Maybe not One more politician for his collection Some people collected stamps some coins but Johnny Smith collects handshakes and   and admit it Youve been looking for a wild card in the deck all along The thought shook him so badly that he almost pulled over to the side of the road He caught a glimpse of himself in the rearview mirror and it wasnt the contented everythingisrestingeasy face he had gotten up with that morning Now it was the press conference face and the face of the man who had crawled through the snow of the Castle Rock town common on his hands and knees The skin was too white the eyes circled with bruisedlooking brown rings the lines etched too deep No It isnt true But it was Now that it was out it couldnt be denied In the first twentythree years of his life he had shaken hands with exactly one politician that was when Ed Muskie had come to talk to his high school government class in  In the last seven months he had shaken hands with over a dozen big names Arid hadnt the thought flashed across the back of his mind as each one stuck out his hand Whats this guy all about Whats he going to tell me Hadnt he been looking all along for the political equivalent of Frank Dodd Yes It was true But the fact was none of them except Carter had told him much of anything and the feelings that he had gotten from Carter were not particularly alarming Shaking hands with Carter had not given him that sinking feeling he had gotten just from watching Greg Stillson on TV He felt as if Stillson might have taken the game of the Laughing Tiger a step further inside the beastskin a man yes But inside the manskin a beast  Whatever the progression had been Johnny found himself eating his picnic lunch in the Trimbull town park instead of the Fenway bleachers He had arrived shortly after noon and had seen a sign on the community notice board announcing the rally at three PM He drifted over to the park expecting to have the place pretty much to himself so long before the rally was scheduled to begin but others were already spreading blankets unlimbering Frisbees or settling down to their own lunches Up front a number of men were at work on the bandstand Two of them were decorating the waisthigh railings with bunting Another was on a ladder hanging colorful crepe streamers from the bandstands circular eave Others were setting up the sound system and as Johnny had guessed when he watched the CBS newsclip it was no fourhundreddollar podium PA set The speakers were AltecLansings and they were being carefully placed to give surroundsound The advance men but the image that persisted was that of roadies setting up for an Eagles or Geils band concert went about their work with businesslike precision The whole thing had a practiced professional quality to it that jarred with Stillsons image of the amiable Wild Man of Borneo The crowd mostly spanned about twenty years from midteens to midthirties They were having a good time Babies toddled around clutching melting Dairy Queens and Slush Puppies Women chatted together and laughed Men drank beer from styrofoam cups A few dogs bounced around grabbing what there was to be grabbed and the sun shone benignly down on everyone Test one of the men on the bandstand said laconically into the two mikes Testone testtwo  One of the speakers in the park uttered a loud feedback whine and the guy on the podium motioned that he wanted it moved backward This isnt the way you set up for a political speech and rally Johnny thought Theyre setting up for a lovefeast or a group grope Testone testtwo    test test test They were strapping the big speakers to the trees Johnny saw Not nailing them but strapping them Stillson was an ecology booster and someone had told his advance men not to hurt so much as one tree in one town park The operation gave him the feeling of having been honed down to the smallest detail This was no grabitandrunwithit deal Two yellow school buses pulled into the turnaround left of the small and already full parking lot The doors folded open and men and women got out talking animatedly to one another They were in sharp contrast to those already in the park because they were dressed in their best  men in suits or sports coats ladies in crisp skirtandblouse combinations or smart dresses They were gazing around with expressions of nearly childlike wonder and anticipation and Johnny grinned Ngos citizenship class had arrived He walked over to them Ngo was standing with a tall man in a corduroy suit and two women both Chinese Hi Ngo Johnny said Ngo grinned broadly Johnny he said Good to see you man It is being a great day for the state of New Hampshire right I guess so Johnny said Ngo introduced his companions The man in the corduroy suit was Polish The two women were sisters from Taiwan One of the women told Johnny that she was much hoping for shaking hands with the candidate after the program and then shyly she showed Johnny the autograph book in her handbag I am so glad to be here in America she said But it is strange is it not Mr Smith Johnny who thought the whole thing was strange agreed The citizenship classs two instructors were calling the group together Ill see you later Johnny Ngo said Ive got to be tripping Going Johnny said Yes thanks Have a fine time Ngo Oh yes I am sure I will And Ngos eyes seemed to glint with a secret amusement I am sure it will be most entertaining Johnny The group about forty in all went over to the south side of the park to have their picnic lunch Johnny went back to his own place and made himself eat one of his sandwiches It tasted like a combination of paper and library paste A thick feeling of tension had begun to creep into his body  By twothirty the park was completely full people were jammed together nearly shoulder to shoulder The town police augmented by a small contingent of State Police had closed off the streets leading to the Trimbull town park The resemblance to a rock concert was stronger than ever Bluegrass music poured from the speakers cheery and fast Fat white clouds drifted across the innocent blue sky Suddenly people started getting to their feet and craning their necks It was a ripple effect passing through the crowd Johnny got up too wondering if Stillson was going to be early Now he could hear the steady roar of motorcycle engines the beat swelling to fill the summer afternoon as they grew closer Johnny got an eyeful of sunarrows reflecting off chrome and a few moments later about ten cycles swung into the turnaround where the citizenship buses were parked There was no car with them Johnny guessed they were an advance guard His feeling of disquiet deepened The riders were neat enough dressed for the most part in clean faded jeans and white shirts but the bikes themselves mostly Harleys and BSAs had been customized almost beyond recognition apehanger handlebars raked chromium manifolds and strange fairings abounded Their owners killed the engines swung off and moved away toward the bandstand in single file Only one of them looked back His eyes moved without haste over the big crowd even from some distance away Johnny could see that the mans irises were a brilliant bottle green He seemed to be counting the house He glanced left at four or five town cops leaning against the chainlink backstop of the Little League ballfield He waved One of the cops leaned over and spit The act had a feeling of ceremony to it and Johnnys disquiet deepened further The man with the green eyes sauntered to the bandstand Above the disquiet which now lay like an emotional floor to his other feelings Johnny felt predominantly a wild mix of horror and hilarity He had a dreamlike sense of having somehow entered one of those paintings where steam engines are coming out of brick fireplaces or clockfaces are lying limply over tree limbs The cyclists looked like extras in an AmericanInternational bike movie who had all decided to Get Clean For Gene Their fresh faded jeans were snugged down over squaretoed engineer boots and on more than one pair Johnny could see chromed chains strapped down over the insteps The chrome twinkled savagely in the sun Their expressions were nearly all the same a sort of vacuous good humor that seemed directed at the crowd But beneath it there might have been simple contempt for the young mill workers the summer students who had come over from UNH in Durham and the factory workers who were standing to give them a round of applause Each of them wore a pair of political buttons One of them showed a construction workers yellow hard hat with a green ecology sticker on the front The other bore the motto STILLSONS GOT EM IN A FULLNELSON And sticking out of every right hip pocket was a sawedoff pool cue Johnny turned to the man next to him who was with his wife and small child Are those things legal he asked Who the hell cares the young guy responded laughing Theyre just for show anyway He was still applauding GogetemGreg he yelled The motorcycle honor guard deployed themselves around the bandstand in a circle and stood at parade rest The applause tapered off but conversation went on at a louder level The crowds mass mouth had received the meals appetizer and had found it good Brownshirts Johnny thought sitting down Brownshirts is all they are Well so what Maybe that was even good Americans had a rather low tolerance for the fascist approach  even rockribbed righties like Reagan didnt go for that stuff nothing but a pure fact no matter how many tantrums the New Left might want to throw or how many songs Joan Baez wrote Eight years before the fascist tactics of the Chicago police had helped lose the election for Hubert Humphrey Johnny didnt care how cleancut these fellows were if they were in the employ of a man running for the House of Representatives then Stillson couldnt be more than a few paces from overstepping himself If it wasnt quite so weird it really would be funny All the same he wished he hadnt come  Just before three oclock the thud of a big bass drum impressed itself on the air felt through the feet before actually heard by the ears Other instruments gradually began to surround it and all of them resolved into a marching band playing a Sousa tune Smalltown election hoopla all of a summers day The crowd came to its feet again and craned in the direction of the music Soon the band came in sight  first a batontwirler in a short skirt highstepping in white kidskin boots with pompons on them then two majorettes then two pimply boys with grimly set faces carrying a banner that proclaimed this was THE TRIMBULL HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND and you had by God better not forget it Then the band itself resplendent and sweaty in blinding white uniforms and brass buttons The crowd cleared a path for them and then broke into a wave of applause as they began to march in place Behind them was a white Ford van and standing spreadlegged on the roof face sunburned and split into a mammoth grin under his cockedback construction hat was the candidate himself He raised a batterypowered bullhorn and shouted into it with leatherlunged enthusiasm HI YALL Hi Greg The crowd gave it right back Greg Johnny thought a little hysterically Were on firstname terms with the guy Stillson leaped down from the roof of the van managing to make it look easy He was dressed as Johnny had seen him on the news jeans and a khaki shirt He began to work the crowd on his way to the bandstand shaking hands touching other hands outstretched over the heads of those in the first ranks The crowd lurched and swayed deliriously toward him and Johnny felt an answering lurch in his own guts Im not going to touch him No way But in front of him the crowd suddenly parted a little and he stepped into the gap and suddenly found himself in the front row He was close enough to the tuba player in the Trimbull High School Marching Band to have reached out and rapped his knuckles on the bell of his horn had he wanted to Stillson moved quickly through the ranks of the band to shake hands on the other side and Johnny lost complete sight of him except for the bobbing yellow helmet He felt relief That was all right then No harm no foul Like the pharisee in that famous story he was going to pass by on the other side Good Wonderful And when he made the podium Johnny was going to gather up his stuff and steal away into the afternoon Enough was enough The bikies had moved up on both sides of the path through the crowd to keep it from collapsing in on the candidate and drowning him in people All the chunks of pool cue were still in the back pockets but their owners looked tense and alert for trouble Johnny didnt know exactly what sort of trouble they expected  a Brownie Delight thrown in the candidates face maybe  but for the first time the bikies looked really interested Then something did happen but Johnny was unable to tell exactly what it had been A female hand reached for the bobbing yellow hard hat maybe just to touch it for good luck and one of Stillsons fellows moved in quickly There was a yell of dismay and the womans hand disappeared quickly But it was all on the other side of the marching band The din from the crowd was enormous and he thought again of the rock concerts he had been to This was what it would be like if Paul McCartney or Elvis Presley decided to shake hands with the crowd They were screaming his name chanting it GREG GREGGREG The young guy who had billeted his family next to Johnny was holding his son up over his head so the kid could see A young man with a large puckered burn scar on one side of his face was waving a sign that read LIVE FREE OR DIE HERES GREG IN YER EYE An achingly beautiful girl of maybe eighteen was waving a chunk of watermelon and pink juice was running down her tanned arm It was all mass confusion Excitement was humming through the crowd like a series of highvoltage electrical cables And suddenly there was Greg Stillson darting back through the band back to Johnnys side of the crowd He didnt pause but still found time to give the tuba player a hearty clap on the back Later Johnny mulled it over and tried to tell himself that there really hadnt been any chance or time to melt back into the crowd he tried to tell himself that the crowd had practically heaved him into Stilisons arms He tried to tell himself that Stillson had done everything but abduct his hand None of it was true There was time because a fat woman in absurd yellow damdiggers threw her arms around Stillsons neck and gave him a hearty kiss which Stillson returned with a laugh and a You bet Ill remember you hon The fat woman screamed laughter Johnny felt the familiar compact coldness come over him the trance feeling The sensation that nothing mattered except to know He even smiled a little but it wasnt his smile He put his hand out and Stilison seized it in both of his and began to pump it up and down Hey man hope youre gonna support us in Then Stillson broke off The way Eileen Magown had The way Dr James just like the soul singer Brown had The way Roger Dussault had His eyes went wide and then they filled with  fright No It was terror in Stillsons eyes The moment was endless Objective time was replaced by something else a perfect cameo of time as they stared into each others eyes For Johnny it was like being in that dull chrome corridor again only this time Stilison was with him and they were sharing sharing everything For Johnny it had never been this strong never Everything came at him at once crammed together and screaming like some terrible black freight train highballing through a narrow tunnel a speeding engine with a single glaring headlamp mounted up front and the headlamp was knowing everything and its light impaled Johnny Smith like a bug on a pin There was nowhere to run and perfect knowledge ran him down plastered him as flat as a sheet of paper while that nightrunning train raced over him He felt like screaming but had no taste for it no voice for it The one image he never escaped as the blue filter began to creep in was Greg Stillson taking the oath of office It was being administered by an old man with the humble frightened eyes of a fieldmouse trapped by a terribly proficient battlescarred tiger barnyard tomcat One of Stillsons hands clapped over a Bible one upraised It was years in the future because Stillson had lost most of his hair The old man was speaking Stillson was following Stillson was saying the blue filter is deepening covering things blotting them out bit by bit merciful blue filter Stillsons face is behind the blue  and the yellow   the yellow like tigerstripes he would do it So help him God His face was solemn grim even but a great hot joy clapped in his chest and roared in his brain Because the man with the scared fieldmouse eyes was the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court and oh dear God the filter the filter the blue filter the yellow stripes now all of it began to disappear slowly behind that blue filter  except it wasnt a filter it was something real It was in the future in the dead zone something in the future His Stillsons Johnny didnt know There was the sense of flying  flying through the blue  above scenes of utter desolation that could not quite be seen And cutting through this came the disembodied voice of Greg Stillson the voice of a cutrate God or a comicopera engine of the dead IM GONNA GO THROUGH THEM LIKE BUCKWHEAT THROUGH A GOOSE GONNA GO THROUGH THEM LIKE SHIT THROUGH A CANEBRAKE The tiger Johnny muttered thickly The tigers behind the blue Behind the yellow Then all of it pictures images and words broke up in the swelling soft roar of oblivion He seemed to smell some sweet coppery scent like burning hightension wires For a moment that inner eye seemed to open even wider searching the blue and yellow that had obscured everything seemed about to solidify into  into something and from somewhere inside distant and full of terror he heard a woman shriek Give him to me you bastard Then it was gone How long did we stand together like that he would ask himself later His guess was maybe five seconds Then Stillson was pulling his hand away ripping it away staring at Johnny with his mouth open the color draining away from beneath the deep tan of the summertime campaigner Johnny could see the fillings in the mans back teeth His expression was one of revolted horror Good Johnny wanted to scream Good Shake yourself to pieces Total yourself Destruct Implode Disintegrate Do the world a favor Two of the motorcycle guys were rushing forward and now the sawedoff pool cues were out and Johnny felt a stupid kind of terror because they were going to hit him hit him over the head with their cues they were going to make believe Johnny Smiths head was the eight ball and they were going to blast it right into the side pocket right back into the blackness of coma and he would never come out of it this time he would never be able to tell anyone what he had seen or change anything That sense of destruction  God It had been everything He tried to backpedal People scattered pressed back yelled with fear or perhaps with excitement Stillson was turning toward his bodyguards already regaining his composure shaking his head restraining them Johnny never saw what happened next He swayed on his feet head lowered blinking slowly like a drunk at the bitter end of a weeklong binge Then the soft swelling roar of oblivion overwhelmed him and Johnny let it he gladly let it He blacked out No the Trimbull chief of police said in answer to Johnnys question youre not charged with anything Youre not under detention And you dont have to answer any questions Wed just be very grateful if you would Very grateful the man in the conservative business suit echoed His name was Edgar Lancte He was with the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation He thought that Johnny Smith looked like a very sick man There was a puffed bruise above his left eyebrow that was rapidly turning purple When he blacked out Johnny had come down very hard  either on the shoe of a marchingbandsman or on the squaredoff toe of a motorcycle boot Lancte mentally favored the latter possibility And possibly the motorcycle boot had been in motion at the instant of contact Smith was too pale and his hands trembled badly as he drank the paper cup of water that Chief Bass had given him One eyelid was ticking nervously He looked like the classic wouldbe assassin although the most deadly thing in his personal effects had been a nailclipper Still Lancte would keep that impression in mind because he was what he was What can I tell you Johnny asked He had awakened on a cot in an unlocked cell Hed had a blinding headache It was draining away now leaving him feeling strangely hollow inside He felt a little as if his legitimate innards had been scooped out and replaced with Reddi Wip There was a high constant sound in his ears  not precisely a ringing more like a high steady hum It was nine PM The Stillson entourage had long since swept out of town All the hot dogs had been eaten You can tell us exactly what happened back there Bass said It was hot I guess I got overexcited and fainted You an invalid or something Lancte asked casually Johnny looked at him steadily Dont play games with me Mr Lancte If you know who I am then say so I know Lancte said Maybe you are psychic Nothing psychic about guessing an FBI agent might be up to a few games Johnny said Youre a Maine boy Johnny Born and bred Whats a Maine boy doing down in New Hampshire Tutoring The Chatsworth boy For the second time if you know why ask Unless you suspect me of something Lancte lit a Vantage Green Rich family Yes They are You a Stillson fan are you Johnny Bass asked Johnny didnt like fellows who used his first name on first acquaintance and both of these fellows were doing it It made him nervous Are you he asked Bass made an obscene blowing sound About five years ago we had a daylong folkrock concert in Trimbull Out on Hake Jamiesons land Town council had their doubts but they went ahead because the kids have got to have something We thought we were going to have maybe two hundred local kids in Hakes east pasture listening to music Instead we got sixteen hundred all of em smoking pot and drinking hard stuff straight out from the neck of the bottle They made a hell of a mess and the council got mad and said thered never be another one and they turned around all hurt arid weteyed and said Whassa matter No one got hurt did they It was supposed to be okay to make a helluva mess because no one got hurt I feel the same way about this guy Stilison I remember once You dont have any sort of grudge against Stillson do you Johnny Lancte asked Nothing personal between you and him He smiled a fatherly youcangetitoffyourchestifyouwantto smile I didnt even know who he was until six weeks ago Yes well but that really doesnt answer my question does it Johnny sat silent for a little while He disturbs me he said finally That doesnt really answer my question either Yes I think it does Youre not being as helpful as wed like Lancte said regretfully Johnny glanced over at Bass Does anybody who faints in your town at a public gathering get the FBI treatment Chief Bass Bass looked uncomfortable Well no Course not You were shaking hands with Stillson when you keeled over Lancte said You looked sick Stillson himself looked scared green Youre a very lucky young man Johnny Lucky his goodbuddies there didnt turn your head into a votive urn They thought youd pulled a piece on him Johnny was looking at Lancte with dawning surprise He looked at Bass then back to the FBI man You were there he said Bass didnt call you up on the phone You were there At the rally Lancte crushed out his cigarette Yes I was Why is the FBI interested in Stillson Johnny nearly barked the question Lets talk about you Johnny Whats your  No lets talk about Stillson Lets talk about his goodbuddies as you call them Is it legal for them to carry around sawedoff pool cues It is Bass said Lancte threw him a warning look but Bass either didnt see it or ignored it Cues baseball bats golf clubs No law against any of them I heard someone say those guys used to be iron riders Bike gang members Some of them used to be with a New Jersey club some used to be with a New York club thats Chief Bass Lancte interrupted I hardly think this is the time I cant see the harm of telling him Bass said Theyre bums rotten apples hairbags Some of them ganged together in the Hamptons back four or five years ago when they had the bad riots A few of them were affiliated with a bike club called the Devils Dozen that disbanded in  Stillsons ramrod is a guy named Sonny Elliman He used to be the president of the Devils Dozen Hes been busted half a dozen times but never convicted of anything Youre wrong about that Chief Lancte said lighting a fresh cigarette He was cited in Washington State in  for making an illegal left turn against traffic He signed the waiver and paid a twentyfive dollar fine Johnny got up and went slowly across the room to the water cooler where he drew himself a fresh cup of water Lancte watched him go with interest So you just fainted right Lancte said No Johnny said not turning around I was going to shoot him with a bazooka Then at the critical moment all my bionic circuits blew Lancte sighed Bass said Youre free to go any time Thank you But Ill tell you just the same way Mr Lancte here would tell you In the future Id stay away from Stillson rallies if I were you If you want to keep a whole skin that is Things have a way of happening to people Greg Stillson doesnt like Is that so Johnny asked He drank his water Those are matters outside your bailiwick Chief Bass Lancte said His eyes were like hazy steel and he was looking at Bass very hard All right Bass said mildly I dont see any harm in telling you that there have been other rally incidents Lancte said In Ridgeway a young pregnant woman was beaten so badly she miscarried This was just after the Stillson rally there that CBS filmed She said she couldnt ID her assailant but we feel it may have been one of Stillsons bikies A month ago a kid he was fourteen got himself a fractured skull He had a little plastic squirtgun He couldnt ID his assailant either But the squirtgun makes us believe it may have been a security overreaction How nicely put Johnny thought You couldnt find anyone who saw it happen Nobody who would talk Lancte smiled humorlessly and tapped the ash off his cigarette Hes the peoples choice Johnny thought of the young guy holding his son up so that the boy could see Greg Stillson Who the hell cares Theyre just for show anyway So hes got his own pet FBI agent Lancte shrugged and smiled disarmingly Well what can I say Except FYI its no tit assignment Johnny Sometimes I get scared The guy generates one hell of a lot of magnetism If he pointed me out from the podium and told the crowd at one of those rallies who I was I think theyd run me up the nearest lamppost Johnny thought of the crowd that afternoon and of the pretty girl hysterically waving her chunk of watermelon I think you might be right he said So if theres something you know that might help me Lancte leaned forward The disarming smile had become slightly predatory Maybe you even had a psychic flash about him Maybe thats what messed you up Maybe I did Johnny said unsmiling Well For one wild moment Johnny considered telling them everything Then he rejected it I saw him on TV I had nothing in particular to do today so I thought Id come over here and check him out in person I bet I wasnt the only outoftowner who did that You sure wasnt Bass said vehemently And thats all Lancte asked Thats all Johnny said and then hesitated Except I think hes going to win his election Were sure he is Lancte said Unless we can get something on him In the meantime Im in complete agreement with Chief Bass Stay away from Stillson rallies Dont worry Johnny crumpled up his paper cup and threw it away Its been nice talking to you two gentle men but Ive got a long drive back to Durham Going back to Maine soon Johnny Lancte asked casually Dont know He looked from Lancte slim and impeccable tapping out a fresh cigarette on the blank face of his digital watch to Bass a big tired man with a basset hounds face Do either of you think hell run for higher office If he gets this seat in the House of Representatives Jesus wept Bass muttered and rolled his eyes These guys come and go Lancte said His eyes so brown they were nearly black had never stopped studying Johnny Theyre like one of those rare radioactive elements that are so unstable that they dont last long Guys like Stillson have no permanent political base just a temporary coalition that holds together for a little while and then falls apart Did you see that crowd today College kids and mill hands yelling for the same guy Thats not politics thats something on the order of hula hoops or coonskin caps or Beatle wigs Hell get his term in the House and hell freeunch until  and thatll be it Count on it But Johnny wondered  The next day the left side of Johnnys forehead had become very colorful Dark purple  almost black  above the eyebrow shaded to red and then to a morbidly gay yellow at the temple and hairline His eyelid had puffed slightly giving him a leering sort of expression like the second banana in a burlesque review He did twenty laps in the pool and then sprawled in one of the deck chairs panting He felt terrible He had gotten less than four hours sleep the night before and all of what he had gotten had been dreamhaunted Hi Johnny how you doing man He turned around It was Ngo smiling gently He was dressed in his work clothes and wearing gardening gloves Behind him was a childs red wagon filled with small pine trees their roots wrapped in burlap Recalling what Ngo called the pines he said I see youre planting more weeds Ngo wrinkled his nose Sorry yes Mr Chatsworth is loving them I tell him but they are junk trees Everywhere there are these trees in New England His face goes like this  Now Ngos whole face wrinkled and he looked like a caricature of some late show monster  and he says to me Just plant them Johnny laughed That was Roger Chatsworth all right He liked things done his way How did you enjoy the rally Ngo smiled gently Very instructive he said There was no way to read his eyes He might not have noticed the sunrise on the side of Johnnys face Yes very instructive we are all enjoying ourselves Good And you Not so much Johnny said and touched the bruise lightly with his fingertips It was very tender Yes too bad you should put a beefsteak on it Ngo said still smiling gently What did you think about him Ngo What did your class think Your Polish friend Or Ruth Chen and her sister Going back we did not talk about it at our instructors request Think about what you have seen they say Next Tuesday we will write in class I think Yes I am thinking very much that we will A class composition What will you say in your composition Ngo looked at the blue summer sky He and the sky smiled at each other He was a small man with the first threads of gray in his hair Johnny knew almost nothing about him didnt know if he had been married had fathered children if he had fled before the Vietcong if he had been from Saigon or from one of the rural provinces He had no idea what Ngos political leanings were We talked of the game of the Laughing Tiger Ngo said Do you remember Yes Johnny said I will tell you of a real tiger When I was a boy there was a tiger who went bad near my village He was being le manger dhomme eater of men you understand except he was not that he was an eater of boys and girls and old women because this was during the war and there were no men to eat Not the war you know of but the Second World War He had gotten the taste for human meat this tiger Who was there to kill such an awful creature in a humble village where the youngest man is being sixty and with only one arm and the oldest boy is myself only seven years of age And one day this tiger was found in a pit that had been baited with the body of a dead woman It is a terrible thing to bait a trap with a human being made in the image of God I will say in my composition but it is more terrible to do nothing while a bad tiger carries away small children And I will say in my composition that this bad tiger was still alive when we found it It was having a stake pushed through its body but it was still alive We beat it to death with hoes and sticks Old men and women and children some children so excited and frightened they are wetting themselves in their pants The tiger fell in the pit and we beat it to death with our hoes because the men of the village had gone to fight the Japanese I am thinking that this Stillson is like that bad tiger with its taste for human meat I think a trap should be made for him and I think he should be falling into it And if he still lives I think he should be beaten to death He smiled gently at Johnny in the clear summer sunshine Do you really believe that Johnny asked Oh yes Ngo said He spoke lightly as if it were a matter of no consequence What my teacher will say when I am handing in such a composition I dont know He shrugged his shoulders Probably he will say Ngo you are not ready for the American Way But I will say the truth of what I feel What did you think Johnny His eyes moved to the bruise then moved away I think hes dangerous Johnny said I I know lies dangerous Do you Ngo remarked Yes I believe you do know it Your fellow New Hampshires they see him as an engaging clown They set him the way many of this world are seeing this black man Idi Amin Dada But you do not No Johnny said But to suggest he should be killed  Politically killed Ngo said smiling I am only suggesting he should be politically killed And if he cant be politically killed Ngo smiled at Johnny He unfolded his index finger cocked his thumb and then snapped it down Bam he said softly Bam bam ham No Johnny said surprised at the hoarseness in his own voice Thats never an answer Never No I thought it was an answer you Americans used quite often Ngo picked up the handle of the red wagon I must be planting these weeds Johnny So long man Johnny watched him go a small man in suntans and moccasins pulling a wagonload of baby pines He disappeared around the corner of the house No Killing only sows more dragons teeth I believe that I believe it with all my heart  On the first Tuesday in November which happened to be the second day in the month Johnny Smith sat slumped in the easy chair of his combined kitchenliving room and watched the election returns Chancellor and Brinkley were featuring a large electronic map that showed the results of the presidential race in a colorcode as each state came in Now at nearly midnight the race between Ford and Carter looked very clse But Carter would win Johnny had no doubt of it Greg Stillson had also won His victory had been extensively covered on the local newsbreaks but the national reporters had also taken some note of it comparing his victory to that of James Longley Maines independent governor two years before Chancellor said Late polls showing that the Republican candidate and incumbent Harrison Fisher was closing the gap were apparently in error NBC predicts that Stilison who campaigned in a construction workers hard hat and on a platform that included the proposal that all pollution be sent into outer space ended up with fortysix percent of the vote to Fishers thirtyone percent In a district where the Democrats have always been poor relations David Bowes could only poll twentythree percent of the vote And so Brinkley said its hot dog time down in New Hampshire   for the next two years at least He and Chancellor grinned A commercial came on Johnny didnt grin He was thinking of tigers The time between the Trimbull rally and election night had been busy for Johnny His work with Chuck had continued and Chuck continued to improve at a slow but steady pace He had taken two summer courses passed them both and retained his sports eligibility Now with the football season just ending it looked very much as if he would be named to the Gannett newspaper chains All New England team The careful almost ritualistic visits from the college scouts had already begun but they would have to wait another year the decision had already been made between Chuck and his father that he would spend a year at Stovington Prep a good private school in Vermont Johnny thought Stovington would probably be delirious at the news The Vermont school regularly fielded great soccer teams and dismal football teams They would probably give him a full scholarship and a gold key to the girls dorm in the bargain Johnny felt that it had been the right decision After it had been reached and the pressure on Chuck to take the SATs right away had eased off his progress had taken another big jump In late September Johnny had gone up to Pownal for the weekend and after an entire Friday night of watching his father fidget and laugh uproariously at jokes on TV that werent particularly funny he had asked Herb what the trouble was No trouble Herb said smiling nervously and rubbing his hands together like an accountant who has discovered that the company he just invested his life savings with is bankrupt No trouble at all what makes you think that son Well whats on your mind then Herb stopped smiling but he kept rubbing his hands together I dont really know how to tell you Johnny I mean Is it Charlene Well yes It is You popped the question Herb looked at Johnny humbly How do you feel about coming into a stepmother at the age of twentynine John Johnny grinned I feel fine about it Congratulations Dad Herb smiled relieved Well thanks I was a little scared to tell you I dont mind admitting it I know what you said when we talked about it before but people sometimes feel one way when somethings maybe and another way when its gonna be I loved your mom Johnny And I guess I always will I know that dad But Im alone and Charlenes alone and  well I guess we can put each other to good use Johnny went over to his father and kissed him All the best I know youll have it Youre a good son Johnny Herb took his handkerchief out of his back pocket and swiped at his eyes with it We thought wed lost you I did anyway Vera never lost hope She always believed Johnny I Dont Daddy Its over I have to he said Its been in my gut like a stone for a year and a half now I prayed for you to die Johnny My own son and I prayed for God to take you He wiped his tears again and put his handkerchief away Turned out God knew a smidge more than I did Johnny  would you stand up with me At my wedding Johnny felt something inside that was almost but not quite like sorrow That would be my pleasure he said Thanks Im glad Ive  that Ive said everything thats on my mind I feel better than I have in a long long time Have you set a date As a matter of fact we have How does January  sound to you Sounds good Johnny said You can count on me Were going to put both places on the market I guess Herb said Weve got our eye on a farm in Biddeford Nice place Twenty acres Half of it woodlot A new start Yes A new start thats good You wouldnt have any objections to us selling the home place Herb asked anxiously A little tug Johnny said Thats all Yeah thats what I feel A little tug He smiled Somewhere around the heart thats where mine is What about you About the same Johnny said Hows it going down there for you Good Your boys getting along Amazin well Johnny said using one of his fathers pet expressions and grinning How long do you think youll be there Working with Chuck I guess Ill stick with it through the school year if they want me Working oneon one has been a new kind of experience I like it And this has been a really good job Atypically good Id say What are you going to do after Johnny shook his head I dont know yet But I know one thing Whats that Im going out for a bottle of champagne Were going to get bombed His father had stood up on that September evening and clapped him on the back Make it two he said He still got the occasional letter from Sarah Hazlett She and Walt were expecting their second child in April Johnny wrote back his congratulations and his good wishes for Walts canvass And he thought sometimes about his afternoon with Sarah the long slow afternoon It wasnt a memory he allowed himself to take out too often he was afraid that constant exposure to the sunlight of recollection might cause it to wash out and fade like the reddishtinted proofs they used to give you of your graduation portraits He had gone out a few times this fall once with the older and newly divorced sister of the girl Chuck was seeing but nothing had developed from any of those dates Most of his spare time that fall he had spent in the company of Gregory Ammas Stillson He had become a Stillsonphile He kept three looseleaf notebooks in his bureau under his socks and underwear and Tshirts They were filled with notes speculations and Xerox copies of news items Doing this had made him uneasy At night as he wrote around the pastedup clippings with a fineline Pilot pen he sometimes felt like Arthur Bremmer or the Moore woman who had tried to shoot Jerry Ford He knew that if Edgar Lancte Fearless Minion of the Effa Bee Eye could see him doing this his phone living room and bathroom would be tapped in a jiffy There would be an Acme Furniture van parked across the street only instead of being full of furniture it would be loaded with cameras and mikes and God knew what else He kept telling himself that he wasnt Bremmer that Stilison wasnt an obsession but that got harder to believe after the long afternoons at the UNH library searching through old newspapers and magazines and feeding dimes into the photocopier It got harder to believe on the nights he burned the midnight oil writing out his thoughts and trying to make valid connections It grew wellnigh impossible to believe on those graveyardditch three AMs when he woke up sweating from the recurring nightmare The nightmare was nearly always the same a naked replay of his handshake with Stillson at the Trimbull rally The sudden blackness The feeling of being in a tunnel filled with the glare of the onrushing headlight a headlight bolted to some black engine of doom The old man with the humble frightened eyes administering an unthinkable oath of office The nuances of feeling coming and going like tight puffs of smoke And a series of brief images strung together in a flapping row like the plastic pennants over a usedcar dealers lot His mind whispered to him that these images were all related that they told a picturestory of a titanic approaching doom perhaps even the Armageddon of which Vera Smith had been so endlessly confident But what were the images What were they exactly They were hazy impossible to see except in vague outline because there was always that puzzling blue filter between the blue filter that was sometimes cut by those yellow markings like tiger stripes The only clear image in these dreamreplays came near the end the screams of the dying the smell of the dead And a single tiger padding through miles of twisted metal fused glass and scorched earth This tiger was always laughing and it seemed to be carrying something in its mouth  something blue and yellow and dripping blood There had been times in the fall when he thought that dream would send him mad Ridiculous dream the possibility it seemed to point to was impossible after all Best to drive it totally out of his mind But because he couldnt he researched Gregory Stillson and tried to tell himself it was only a harmless hobby and not a dangerous obsession Stillson had been born in Tulsa His father had been an oilfield roughneck who drifted from job to job working more often than some of his colleagues because of his tremendous size His mother might once have been pretty although there was only a hint of that in the two pictures that Johnny had been able to unearth If she had been the times and the man she had been married to had dimmed her prettiness quickly The pictures showed little more than another dustbowl face a southeast United States depression woman who was wearing a faded print dress and holding a baby  Greg  in her scrawny arms and squinting into the sun His father had been a domineering man who didnt think much of his son As a child Greg had been pallid and sickly There was no evidence that his father had abused the boy either mentally or physically but there was the suggestion that at the very least Greg Stillson had lived in a disapproving shadow for the first nine years of his life The one picture Johnny had of the father and son tgether was a happy one however it showed them together in the oil fields the fathers arm slung around the sons neck in a careless gesture of comradeship But it gave Johnny a little chill all the same Harry Stilison was dressed in working clothes twill pants and a doublebreasted khaki shirt and his hard hat was cocked jauntily back on his head Greg had begun school in Tulsa then had been switched to Oklahoma City when he was ten The previous summer his father had been killed in an oilderrick flameout Mary Lou Stillson had gone to Okie City with her boy because it was where her mother lived and where the war work was It was  and good times had come around again Gregs grades had been good until high school and then he began to get into a series of scrapes Truancy fighting hustling snooker downtown maybe hustling stolen goods uptown although that had never been proved In  when he had been a highschool junior he had pulled a twoday suspension for putting a cherrybomb firecracker in a lockerroom toilet In all of these confrontations with authority Mary Lou Stillson took her sons part The good times  at least for the likes of the Stillsons  had ended with the war work in  and Mrs Stillson seemed to think of it as a case of her and her boy against the rest of the world Her mother had died leaving her the small frame house and nothing else She hustled drinks in a roughneck bar for a while then waited table in an alllight beanery And when her boy got in trouble she went to bat for him never checking apparently to see if his hands were dirty or clean The pale sickly boy that his father had nicknamed Runt was gone by  As Greg Stillsons adolescence progressed his fathers physical legacy came out The boy shot up six inches and put on seventy pounds between thirteen and seventeen He did not play organized school sports but somehow managed to acquire a Charles Atlas bodybuilding gym and then a set of weights The Runt became a bad guy to mess with Johnny guessed he must have come close to dropping out of school on dozens of occasions He had probably avoided a bust out of sheer dumb luck If only he had taken at least one serious bust Johnny thought often It would have ended all these stupid worries because a convicted felon cant aspire to high public office Stillson had graduated  near the bottom of his class it was true  in June  Grades notwithstanding there was nothing wrong with his brains His eye was on the main chance He had a glib tongue and a winning manner He worked briefly that summer as a gas jockey Then in August of that year Greg Stillson had gotten Jesus at a tentrevival in Wildwood Green He quit his job at the  station and went into business as a rainmaker through the power of Jesus Christ our Lord Coincidentally or otherwise that had been one of the driest summers in Oklahoma since the days of the dust bowl The crops were already a dead loss and the livestock would soon follow if the shallowing wells went dry Greg had been invited to a meeting of the local ranchers association Johnny had found a great many stories about what had followed it was one of the high points of Stillsons career None of these Stories completely jibed and Johnny could understand why It had all the attributes of an American myth not much different from some of the stories about Davy Crockett Pecos Bill Paul Bunyan That something had happened was undeniable But the strict truth of it was already beyond reach One thing seemed sure That meeting of the ranchers association must have been one of the strangest ever held The ranchers had invited over two dozen rainmakers from various parts of the southeast and southwest About half of them were Negroes Two were Indians  a halfbreed Pawnee and a fullblooded Apache There was a peyotechewing Mexican Greg was one of about nine white fellows and the only hometown boy The ranchers heard the proposals of the rainmakers and dowsers one by one They gradually and naturally divided themselves into two groups those who would take half of their fee up front nonrefundable and those who wanted their entire fee up front nonrefundable When Greg Stillsons turn came he stood up hooked his thumbs into the belt loops of his jeans and was supposed to have said I guess you fellows know I got in the way of being able to make it rain after I gave my heart to Jesus Before that I was deep in sin and the ways of sin Now one of the main ways of sin is the way weve seen tonight and you spell that kind of sinning mostly with dollar signs The ranchers were interested Even at nineteen Stillson had been something of a comic spellbinder And he had made them an offer they couldnt refuse Because he was a bornagain Christian and because he knew that the love of money was the root of all evil he would make it rain and afterward they could pay him whatever they thought the job had been worth He was hired by acclamation and two days later he was down on his knees in the back of a flatbed farm truck cruising slowly along the highways and byways of central Oklahoma dressed in a black coat and a preachers lowcrowned hat praying for rain through a pair of loudspeakers hooked up to a Delco tractor battery People turned out by the thousands to get a look at him The end of the story was predictable but satisfying The skies grew cloudy during the afternoon of Gregs second day on the job and the next morning the rains came The rains came for three days and two nights flash floods killed four people whole houses with chickens perched on the roof peaks were washed down the Greenwood River the wells were filled the livestock was saved and The Oklahoma Ranchers and Cattlemens Association decided it probably would have happened anyway They passed the hat for Greg at their next meeting and the young rainmaker was given the princely sum of seventeen dollars Greg was not put out of countenance He used the seventeen dollars to place an ad in the Oklahoma City Herald The ad pointed out that about the same sort of thing had happened to a certain ratcatcher in the town of Hamlin Being a Christian the ad went on Greg Stillson was not in the way of taking children and he surely knew he had no legal recourse against a group as large and powerful as the Oklahoma Ranchers and Cattlemens Association But fair was fair wasnt it He had his elderly mother to support and she was in failing health The ad suggested that he had prayed his ass off for a bunch of rich ungrateful snobs the same sort of men that had tractored poor folks like the Joads off their land in the thirties The ad suggested that he had saved tens of thousands of dollars worth of livestock and had got seventeen dollars in return Because he was a good Christian this sort of ingratitude didnt bother him but maybe it ought to give the good citizens of the county some pause Rightthinking people could send contributions to Box  care of the Herald Johnny wondered how much Greg Stillson had actually received as a result of that ad Reports varied But that fall Greg had been tooling around town in a brandnew Mercury Three years worth of back taxes were paid on the small house left to them by Mary Loils mother Mary Lou herself who was not particularly sickly and no older than fortyfive blossomed out in a new raccoon coat Stillson had apparently discovered one of the great hidden muscles of principle which move the earth if those who receive will not pay those who have not often will for no good reason at all It may be the same principle that assures the politicians there will always be enough young men to feed the war machine The ranchers discovered they had stuck their collection hand into a hornets nest When members came in town crowds often gathered and jeered at them They were denounced from pulpits all across the county They found it suddenly difficult to sell the beef the rain had saved without shipping it a considerable distance In November of that memorable year two young men with brass knucks on their hands and nickelplated s in their pockets had turned up on Greg Stillsons doorstep apparently hired by the Ranchers and Cattlemens Association to suggest  as strenuously as necessary  that Greg would find the climate more congenial elsewhere Both of them ended up in the hospital One of them had a concussion The other had lost four of his teeth was suffering a rupture Both had been found on corner of Greg Stillsons block sans pants Their brass knucks bad been inserted in an anatomical location most commonly associated with sitting down and in case of one of these two young men minor surgery was necessary to remove the foreign objects The Association cried off At a meeting in early December an appropriation of  was made from its fund and a check in that amount was forwarded to Stillson He got what he wanted In  he and his mother moved to Nebraska The rainmaking business had gone bad and there were some who said the poolhall hustling had also gone bad Whatever the reason for moving they turned up in Omaha where Greg opened a housepainting business that bust two years later He did better as a salesman for TruthWay Bible Company of America He crisscrossed the cornbelt taking dinner with hundreds of hard working Godfearing farm families telling the story his conversion and selling Bibles plaques luminous Jesuses hymn books records tracts and a rabidly rightwing paperback called America the TruthWay CommunistJewish Conspiracy Against Our United States In  the aging Mercury was replaced with a brandnew Ford ranch wagon In  Mary Lou Stillson died of cancer and late that year Greg Stillson got out of the bornagain Bible business and drifted east He spent a year in New York City before moving upstate to Albany His year in New York been devoted to an effort at cracking the acting business It was one of the few jobs along with house painting that he hadnt been able to turn a buck at But probably not from lack of talent Johnny thought cynically Albany he had gone to work for Prudential and he stayed in the capital city until  As an insurance salesman he was an aimless sort of success There was no offer to join the company at the executive level no outbursts of Christian fervor During that fiveyear period the brash and brassy Greg Stillson of yore seemed to have gone into hibernation In all of his checkered career the woman in his life had been his mother He had never married had not even dated regularly as far as Johnny had been able to find out In  Prudential had offered him a position in Ridgeway New Hampshire and Greg had taken it At about the same time his period of hibernation seemed to end The gogo Sixties were gathering steam It was the era of the short skirt and do your own thing Greg became active in Ridgeway community affairs He joined the chamber of Commerce and the Rotary Club He got statewide coverage in  during a controversy over the parking meters downtown For six years various factions had been wrangling over them Greg suggested that if the meters be taken out and that collection boxes be put up in their stead Let people pay what they want some people had said that was the craziest idea they had ever heard Well Greg responded you might just be surprised Yes sir He was persuasive The town finally adopted the proposal on a provisional basis and the ensuing flood of nickels and dimes had surprised everyone but Greg He had discovered the principle years ago In  he made New Hampshire news again when he suggested in a long and carefully workedout letter to the Ridgeway newspaper that drug offenders be put to work on town public works projects such as parks and bike paths even weeding the grass on the traffic islands Thats the craziest idea I ever heard many said Well Greg responded try her out and if she dont work chuck her The town tried it out One pothead reorganized the entire town library from the outmoded Dewey decimal system to the more modern Library of Congress cataloguing system at no charge to the town A number of hippies busted at an hallucinogenic house party relandscaped the town park into an area showplace complete with duckpond and a playground scientifically designed to maximize effective playtime and minimize danger As Greg pointed out most of these drugusers got interested in all those chemicals in college but that was no reason why they shouldnt utilize all the other things they had learned in college At the same time Greg was revolutionizing his adopted home towns parking regulations and its handling of drug offenders he was writing letters to the Manchester UnionLeader the Boston Globe and the New York Times espousing hawkish positions on the war in Vietnam mandatory felony sentences for heroin addicts and a return to the death penalty especially for heroin pushers In his campaign for the House of Representatives he had claimed on several occasions to have been against the war from  on but the mans own published statements made that a flat lie In  Greg Stillson had opened his own insurance and realty company He was a great success In  he and three other businessmen had financed and built a shopping mall on the outskirts of Capital City the county seat of the district he now represented That was the year of the Arabian oil boycott also the year Greg started driving a Lincoln Continental It was also the year he ran for mayor of Ridgeway The mayor enjoyed a twoyear term and two years before in  he had been asked by both the Republicans and Democrats of the largish population  New England town to run He had declined both of them with smiling thanks In  he ran as an independent taking on a fairly popular Republican who was vulnerable because of his fervent support of President Nixon and a Democratic figurehead He donned his construction helmet for the first time His campaign slogan was Lets Build A Better Ridgeway He won in a landslide A year later in New Hampshires sister state of Maine the voters turned away from both the Democrat George Mitchell and the Republican James Erwin and elected an insurance man from Lewiston named James Longley their governor The lesson had not been lost on Gregory Ammas Stillson  Around the Xerox clippings were Johnnys notes and the questions he regularly asked himself He had been over his chain of reasoning so often that now as Chancellor and Brinkley continued to chronicle the election results he could have spouted the whole thing word for word First Greg Stillson shouldnt have been able to get elected His campaign promises were by and large jokes His background was all wrong His education was all wrong It stopped at the twelfthgrade level and until  he had been little more than a drifter In a country where the voters have decided that the lawyers should make the laws Stillsons only brushes with that force had been from the wrong side He wasnt married And his personal history was decidedly freaky Second the press had left him almost completely  and very puzzlingly  alone In an election year when Wilbur Mills had admitted to a mistress when Wayne Hays had been dislodged from his barnacleencrusted House seat because of his when even those in the houses of the mighty had not been immune from the roughandready frisking of the press the reporters should have had a field day with Stillson His colorful controversial personality seemed to stir only amused admiration from the national press and he seemed to make no one except maybe Johnny Smith  nervous His bodyguards had been HarleyDavidson beachhoppers only a few years ago and people had a way of getting hurt at Stillson rallies but no investigative reporter had done an indepth study of that At a campaign rally in Capital City  at that same mall Stillson had had a hand in developing  an eight yearold girl had suffered a broken arm and a dislocated neck her mother swore hysterically that one of those motorcycle maniacs had pushed her from the stage when the girl tried to climb up on the podium and get the Great Mans signature for her autograph book Yet there had only been a squib in the paper  Girl Hurt at Stillson Rally  quickly forgotten Stillson had made a financial disclosure that Johnny thought too good to be true In  Stillson had paid  in Federal taxes on an income of   no state income tax at all of course New Hampshire didnt have one He claimed all of his income came from his insurance and real estate agency plus a small pittance that was his salary as mayor There was no mention of the lucrative Capital City mall No explanation of the fact that Stillson lived in a house with an assessed value of  a house he owned free and clear In a season when the president of the United States was being dunned over what amounted to greens fees Stillsons weird financial disclosure statement raised zero eye brows Then there was his record as mayor His performance on the job was a lot better than his campaign performances would have led anyone to expect He was a shrewd and canny man with a rough but accurate grasp of human corporate and political psychology He had wound up his term in  with a fiscal surplus for the first time in ten years much to the delight of the taxpayers He pointed with justifiable pride to his parking program and what he called his Hippie WorkStudy Program Ridgeway had also been one of the first towns in the whole country to organize a Bicentennial Committee A company that made filing cabinets had located in Ridgeway and in recessionary times the unemployment rate locally was an enviable  percent All very admirable It was some of the other things that had happened while Stillson was mayor that made Johnny feel scared Funds for the town library had been cut from  to  and then in the last year of Stilisons term to  At the same time the municipal police appropriation had risen by forty percent Three new police cruisers had been added to the town motor pool and a collection of riot equipment Two new officers had also been added and the town council had agreed at Stillsons urging to institute a  policy on purchasing officers personal sidearms As a result several of the cops in this sleepy New England town had gone out and bought  Magnums the gun immortalized by Dirty Harry Callahan Also during Stillsons term as mayor the teen rec center had been closed a supposedly voluntary but policeenforced ten oclock curfew for people under sixteen had been instituted and welfare had been cut by thirtyfive percent Yes there were lots of things about Greg Stillson that scared Johnny The domineering father and laxly approving mother The political rallies that felt more like rock concerts The mans way with a crowd his bodyguards Ever since Sinclair Lewis people had been crying woe and doom and beware of the fascist state in America and it just didnt happen Well there had been Huey Long down there in Louisiana but Huey Long had  Had been assassinated Johnny closed his eyes and saw Ngo cocking his finger Bam bam bam Tiger tiger burning bright in the forests of the night What fearful hand or eye But you dont sow dragons teeth Not unless you want to get right down there with Frank Dodd in his hooded vinyl raincoat With the Oswalds and the Sirhans and the Bremmers Crazies of the world unite Keep your paranoid notebooks uptodate and thumb them over at midnight and when things start to reach a head inside you send away the coupon for the mailorder gun Johnny Smith meet Squeaky Fromme Nice to meet you Johnny everything youve got in that notebook makes perfect sense to me Want you to meet my spiritual master Johnny meet Charlie Charlie this is Johnny When you finish with Stillson were going to get off together and off the rest of the pigs so we can save the redwoods His head was swirling The inevitable headache was coming on It always led to this Greg Stilison always led him to this It was time to go to sleep and please God no dreams Still The Question He had written it in one of the notebooks and kept coming back to it He had written it in neat letters and then had drawn a triple circle around it as if to keep it in The Question was this If you could jump into a time machine and go back to  would you kill Hitler Johnny looked at his watch Quarter of one It was November  now and the Bicentennial election was a part of history Ohio was still undecided but Carter was leading No contest baby The hurly burlys done the elections lost and won Jerry Ford could hang up his jock at least until  Johnny went to the window and looked out The big house was dark but there was a light burning in Ngos apartment over the garage Ngo who would shortly be an American citizen was still watching the great American quadrennial ritual Old Bums Exit There New Bums Enter Here Maybe Gordon Strachan hadnt given the Watergate Committee such a bad answer at that Johnny went to bed After a long time he slept And dreamed of the laughing tiger Herb Smith took Charlene MacKenzie as his second wife on the afternoon of January   just as planned The ceremony took place in the Congregational Church at Southwest Bend The brides father an eightyyearold gentleman who was almost blind gave her away Johnny stood up with his dad and produced the ring flawlessly at the proper moment It was a lovely occasion Sarah Hazlett attended with her husband and their son who was leaving his babyhood behind now Sarah was pregnant and radiant a picture of happiness and fulfilment Looking at her Johnny was surprised by a stab of bitter jealousy like an unexpected attack of gas After a few moments it went away and Johnny went over and spoke to them at the reception following the wedding It was the first time he had met Sarahs husband He was a tall goodlooking man with a pencilline moustache and prematurely graying hair His canvass for the Maine state senate had been successful and he held forth on what the national elections had really meant and the difficulties of working with an independent governor while Denny pulled at the leg of his trousers and demanded more drink Daddy more drink moredrink Sarah said little but Johnny felt her brilliant eyes on him  an uncomfortable sensation but somehow not unpleasant A little sad maybe The liquor at the reception flowed freely and Johnny went two drinks beyond his usual two drink stopping point  the shock of seeing Sarah again maybe this time with her family or maybe only the realization written on Charlenes radiant face that Vera Smith really was gone and for all time So when he approached Hector MacKenzie father of the bride some fifteen minutes after the Hazletts had left he had a pleasant buzz on The old man was sitting in the corner by the demolished remains of the wedding cake his arthritisgnarled hands folded over his cane He was wearing dark glasses One bow had been mended with black electricians tape Beside him there stood two empty bottles of beer and another that was halffull He peered closely at Johnny Herbs boy aint you Yes sir A longer scrutiny Then Hector MacKenzie said Boy you dont look well Too many late nights I guess Look like you need a tonic Something to build you up You were in World War I werent you Johnny asked A number of medals including a Croix de Guerre were pinned to the old mans blue serge suit coat Indeed I was MacKenzie said brightening Served under Black Jack Pershing AEF  and  We went through the mud and the crud The wind blew and the shit flew Belleau Wood my boy Belleau Wood Its just a name in the history books now But I was there I saw men die there The wind blew and the shit flew and up from the trenches came the whole damn crew And Charlene said that your boy  her brother Buddy Yep Would have been your stepuncle boy Did we love that boy I guess we did His name was Joe but everyone called him Buddy almost from the day he was born Charlies mother started to die the day the telegram came Killed in the war wasnt he Yes he was the old man said slowly St Lo  Not that far from Belleau Wood not the way we measure things over here anyway They ended Buddys life with a bullet The Nazis Im working on an essay Johnny said feeling a certain drunken cunning at having brought the conversation around to his real object at last Im hoping to sell it to the Atlantic or maybe Harpers Writer are you The dark glasses glinted up at Johnny with renewed interest Well Im trying Johnny said Already he was beginning to regret his glibness Yes Im a writer I write in my notebooks after the dark of night has fallen Anyway the essays going to be about Hitler Hitler What about Hitler Well  suppose  just suppose you could hop into a time machine and go back to the year  In Germany And suppose you came across Hitler Would you kill him or let him live The old mans blank black glasses tilted slowly up to Johnnys face And now Johnny didnt feel drunk or glib or clever at all Everything seemed to depend on what this old man had to say Is it a joke boy No No joke One of Hector MacKenzies hands left the head of his cane It went to the pocket of his suit pants and fumbled there for what seemed an eternity At last it came out again It was holding a bonehandled pocket knife that had been rubbed as smooth and mellow as old ivory over the course of years The other hand came into play folding the knifes one blade out with all the incredible delicacy of arthritis It glimmered with bland wickedness under the light of the Congregational parish hall a knife that had traveled to France in  with a boy a boy who had been part of a boyarmy ready and willing to stop the dirty hun from bayoneting babies and raping nuns ready to show the Frenchies a thing or two in the bargain and the boys had been machinegunned the boys had gotten dysentery and the killer flu the boys had inhaled mustard gas and phosgene gas the boys had come out of Belleau Wood looking like haunted scarecrows who had seen the face of Lord Satan himself And it had all turned out to be for nothing it turned out that it all had to be done over again Somewhere music was playing People were laughing People were dancing A flashbar popped warm light Somewhere far away Johnny stared at the naked blade transfixed hypnotized by the play of the light over its honed edge See this MacKenzie asked softly Yes Johnny breathed Id seat this in his black lying murderers heart MacKenzie said Id put her in as far as shed go  and then Id twist her He twisted the knife slowly in his hand first clock then counterclock He smiled showing babysmooth gums and one leaning yellow tooth But first he said Id coat the blade with rat poison  Kill Hitler Roger Chatsworth said his breath coming out in little puffs The two of them were snowshoeing in the woods behind the Durham house The woods were very silent It was early March but this day was as smoothly and coldly silent as deep January Yes thats right Interesting question Roger said Pointless but interesting No I wouldnt I think Id join the party instead Try to change things from within It might have been possible to purge him or frame him always granting the foreknowledge of what was going to happen Johnny thought of the sawedoff pool cues He thought of the brilliant green eyes of Sonny Elliman It might also be possible to get yourself killed he said Those guys were doing more than singing beerhall songs back in  Yes thats true enough He cocked an eyebrow at Johnny What would you do I really dont know Johnny said Roger dismissed the subject How did your dad and his wife enjoy their honeymoon Johnny grinned They had gone to Miami Beach hotelworkers strike and all Charlene said she felt right at home making her own bed My dad says he feels like a freak sporting a sunburn in March But I think they both enjoyed it And theyve sold the houses Yes both on the same day Got almost what they wanted too Now if it wasnt for the goddam medical bills still hanging over my head itd be plain sailing Johnny Hmmm Nothing Lets go back Ive got some Chivas Regal if youve got a taste I believe I do Johnny said  They were reading Jude the Obscure now and Johnny had been surprised at how quickly and naturally Chuck had taken to it after some moaning and groaning over the first forty pages or so He confessed he had been reading ahead at night on his own and he intended to try something else by Hardy when he finished For the first time in his life he was reading for pleasure And like a boy who has just been initiated into the pleasures of sex by an older woman he was wallowing in it Now the book lay open but facedown in his lap They were by the pool again but it was still drained and both he and Johnny were wearing light jackets Overhead mild white clouds scudded across the sky trying desultorily to coalesce enough to make rain The feel of the air was mysterious and sweet spring was somewhere near It was April  Is this one of those trick questions Chuck asked Nope Well would they catch me Pardon That was a question none of the others had asked If I killed him Would they catch me Hang me from a lamppost Make me do the funky chicken six inches off the ground Well I dont know Johnny said slowly Yes I suppose they would catch you I dont get to escape in my time machine to a gloriously changed world huh Back to good old  No I dont think so Well it wouldnt matter Id kill him anyway Just like that Sure Chuck smiled a little Id rig myself up with one of those hollow teeth filled with quickacting poison or a razor blade in my shirt collar or something like that So if I did get caught they couldnt do anything too gross to me But Id do it If I didnt Id be afraid all those millions of people he ended up killing would haunt me to my grave To your grave Johnny said a little sickly Are you okay Johnny Johnny made himself return Chucks smile Fine I guess my heart just missed a beat or something Chuck went on with Jude under the milky cloudy sky  May The smell of cut grass was back for yet another return engagement  also those longrunning favorites honey suckle dust and roses In New England spring really only comes for one priceless week and then the deejays drag out the Beach Boys golden oldies the buzz of the cruising Honda is heard throughout the land and summer comes down with a hot thud On one of the last evenings of that priceless spring week Johnny sat in the guest house looking out into the night The spring dark was soft and deep Chuck was off at the senior prom with his current girl friend a more intellectual type than the last halfdozen She reads Chuck had confided to Johnny one man of the world to another Ngo was gone He had gotten his citizenship papers in late March had applied for a job as head groundskeeper at a North Carolina resort hotel in April had gone down for an interview three weeks ago and had been hired on the spot Before he left he had come to see Johnny You worry too much about tigers that are not there I think he said The tiger has stripes that will fade into the background so he will not be seen This makes the worried man see tigers everywhere Theres a tiger Johnny had answered Yes Ngo agreed Somewhere In the meantime you grow thin Johnny got up went to the fridge and poured himself a Pepsi He went outside with it to the little deck He sat down and sipped his drink and thought how lucky everyone was that time travel was a complete impossibility The moon came up an orange eye above the pines and beat a bloody path across the swimming pool The first frogs croaked and thumped After a little while Johnny went inside and poured a hefty dollop of Ron Rico into his Pepsi He went back outside and sat down again drinking and watching as the moon rose higher in the sky changing slowly from orange to mystic silent silver On June the rd  Chuck graduated from high school Johnny dressed in his best suit sat in the hot auditorium with Roger and Shelley Chatsworth and watched as he graduated fortythird in his class Shelley cried Afterward there was a lawn party at the Chatsworth home The day was hot and humid Thunderheads with purple bellies had formed in the west they dragged slowly back and forth across the horizon but seemed to come no closer Chuck flushed with three screwdrivers came over with his girl friend Patty Strachan to show Johnny his graduation present from his parents  a new Pulsar watch I told them I wanted that RD robot but this was the best they could do Chuck said and Johnny laughed They talked a while longer and then Chuck said with almost rough abruptness I want to thank you Johnny If it hadnt been for you I wouldnt be graduating today at all No that isnt true Johnny said He was a little alarmed to see that Chuck was on the verge of tears Class always tells man Thats what I keep telling him Chucks girl said Behind her glasses a cool and elegant beauty was waiting to come out Maybe Chuck said Maybe it does But I think I know which side my diploma is buttered on Thanks a hell of a lot He put his arms around Johnny and gave him a hug It came suddenly  a hard bright bolt of image that made Johnny straighten up and dap his hand against the side of his head as if Chuck had struck him instead of hugging him The image sank into his mind like a picture done by electroplate No he said No way You two stay right away from there Chuck drew back uneasily He had felt something Something cold and dark and incomprehensible Suddenly he didnt want to touch Johnny at that moment he never wanted to touch Johnny again It was as if he had found out what it would be like to lie in his own coffin and watch the lid nailed down Johnny he said and then faltered Whats whats Roger had been on his way over with drinks and now he paused puzzled Johnny was looking over Chucks shoulder at the distant thunderheads His eyes were vague and hazy He said You want to stay away from that place There are no lightning rods Johnny  Chuck looked at his father frightened Its like hes having some kind of  fit or something Lightning Johnny proclaimed in a carrying voice People turned their heads to look at him He spread his hands Flash fire The insulation in the walls The doors  jammed Burning people smell like hot pork Whats he talking about Chucks girl cried and conversation trickled to a halt Now everyone was looking at Johnny as they balanced plates of food and glasses Roger stepped over John Johnny I Whats wrong Wake up He snapped his fingers in front of Johnnys vague eyes Thunder muttered in the west the voice of giants over gin rummy perhaps Whats wrong Johnnys voice was clear and moderately loud carrying to each of the fiftysome people who were there  businessmen and their wives professors and their wives Durhams upper middle class Keep your son home tonight or hes going to burn to death with the rest of them There is going to be a fire a terrible fire Keep him away from Cathys Its going to be struck by lightning and it will burn flat before the first fire engine can arrive The insulation will burn They will find charred bodies six and seven deep in the exits and there will be no way to identify them except by their dental work It it Patty Strachan screamed then her hand going to her mouth her plastic glass tumbling to the lawn the ice cubes spilling out onto the grass and gleaming there like diamonds of improbable size She stood swaying for a moment and then she fainted going down in a pastel billow of party dress and her mother ran forward crying at Johnny as she passed Whats wrong with you What in Gods name is wrong with you Chuck stared at Johnny His face was paperwhite Johnnys eyes began to clear He looked around at the staring knots of people Im sorry he muttered Pattys mother was on her knees holding her daughters head in her arms and patting her cheeks lightly The girl began to stir and moan Johnny Chuck whispered and then without waiting for an answer went to his girl It was very still on the Chatsworth back lawn Everyone was looking at him They were looking at him because it had happened again They were looking at him the way the nurses had And the reporters They were crows strung out on a telephone line They were holding their drinks and their plates of potato salad and looking at him as if he were a bug a freak They were looking at him as if he had suddenly opened his pants and exposed himself to them He wanted to run he wanted to hide He wanted to puke Johnny Roger said putting an arm around him Come on in the house You need to get off your feet for Thunder rumbled far off Whats Cathys Johnny said harshly resisting the pressure of Rogers arm over his shoulders It isnt someones house because there were exit signs What is it Where is it Cant you get him out of here Pattys mother nearly screamed Hes upsetting her all over again Come on Johnny But Come on He allowed himself to be led away toward the guest house The sound of their shoes on the gravel drive was very loud There seemed to be no other sound They got as far as the pool and then the whispering began behind them Wheres Cathys Johnny asked again How come you dont know Roger asked You seemed to know everything else You scared poor Patty Strachan into a faint I cant see it Its in the dead zone What is it Lets get you upstairs first Im not sick Under strain then Roger said He spoke softly and soothingly the way people speak to the hopelessly mad The sound of his voice made Johnny afraid And the headache started to come He willed it back savagely They went up the stairs to the guest house  Feel any better Roger asked Whats Cathys Its a very fancy steakhouse and lounge in Somersworth Graduation parties at Cathys are something of a tradition God knows why Sure you dont want these aspirin No Dont let him go Roger Its going to be hit by lightning Its going to burn flat Johnny Roger Chatsworth said slowly and very kindly you cant know a thing like that Johnny drank ice water a small sip at a time and set the glass back down with a hand that shook slightly You said you checked into my background I thought Yes I did But youre drawing a mistaken conclusion I knew you were supposed to be a psychic or something but I didnt want a psychic I wanted a tutor Youve done a fine job as a tutor My personal belief is that there isnt any difference between good psychics and bad ones because I dont believe in any of that business Its as simple as that I dont believe it That makes me a liar then Not at all Roger said in that same kind low voice I have a foreman at the mill in Sussex who wont light three on a match but that doesnt make him a bad foreman I have friends who are devoutly religious and although I dont go to church myself theyre still my friends Your belief that you can see into the future or sight things at a distance never entered into my judgment of whether or not to hire  that isnt quite true It never entered into it once Id decided that it wouldnt interfere with your ability to do a good job with Chuck It hasnt But I no more believe that Cathys is going to burn down tonight than I believe the moon is green cheese Im not a liar just crazy Johnny said In a dull sort of way it was interesting Roger Dussault and many of the people who wrote Johnny letters had accused him of trickery but Chatsworth was the first to accuse him of having a Jeanne dArc complex Not that either Roger said Youre a young man who was involved in a terrible accident and who has fought his way back against terrible odds at what has probably been a terrible price That isnt a thing Id ever flap my jaw about freely Johnny but if any of those people out there on the lawn  including Pattys mother  want to jump to a lot of stupid conclusions theyll be invited to shut their mouths about things they dont understand Cathys Johnny said suddenly How did I know the name then And how did I know it wasnt someones house From Chuck Hes talked about the party a lot this week Not to me Roger shrugged Maybe he said something to Shelley or me while you were in earshot Your subconscious happened to pick it up and file it away Thats right Johnny said bitterly Anything we dont understand anything that doesnt fit into our scheme of the way things are well just file it under S for subconscious right The twentiethcentury god How many times have you done that when something ran counter to your pragmatic view of the world Roger Rogers eyes might have flickered a little  or it might have been imagination You associated lightning with the thunderstorm thats coming he said Dont you see that Its perfectly sim   Listen Johnny said Im telling you this as simply as I can That place is going to be struck by lightning Its going to burn down Keep Chuck home Ah God the headache was coming for him Coming like a tiger He put his hand to his forehead and rubbed it unsteadily Johnny youve been pushing much too hard Keep him home Johnny repeated Its his decision and I wouldnt presume to make it for him Hes free white and eighteen There was a tap at the door Johnny Come in Johnny said and Chuck himself came in He looked worried How are you Chuck asked Im all right Johnny said Ive got a headache thats all Chuck  please stay away from that place tonight Im asking you as a friend Whether you think like your dad or not Please No problem man Chuck said cheerfully and whumped down on the sofa He hooked a hassock over with one foot Couldnt drag Patty within a mile of that place with a twentyfoot towin chain You put a scare into her Im sorry Johnny said He felt sick and chilly with relief Im sorry but Im glad You had some kind of a flash didnt you Chuck looked at Johnny then at his father and then slowly back to Johnny I felt it It was bad Sometimes people do I understand its sort of nasty Well I wouldnt want it to happen again Chuck said But hey that place isnt really going to burn down is it Yes Johnny said You want to just keep away But He looked at his father troubled The senior class reserved the whole damn place The school encourages that you know Its safer than twenty or thirty different parties and a lot of people drinking on the back roads Theres apt to be  Chuck fell silent for a moment and then began to look frightened Theres apt to be two hundred couples there he said Dad I dont think he believes any of this Johnny said Roger stood up and smiled Well lets take a ride over to Somersworth and talk to the manager of the place he said It was a dull lawn party anyway And if you two still feel the same coming back we can have everyone over here tonight He glanced at Johnny Only condition being that you have to stay sober and help chaperon fellow Ill be glad to Johnny said But why if you dont believe it For your peace of mind Roger said and for Chucks And so that when nothing happens tonight I can say I told you so and then just laaaugh my ass off Well whatever thanks He was trembling worse than ever now that the relief had come but his headache had retreated to a dull throb One thing up front though Roger said I dont think we stand a snowballs chance in hell of getting the owner to cancel on your unsubstantiated word Johnny This is probably one of his big business nights each year Chuck said Well we could work something out Like what Well we could tell him a  spin some kind of yarn  Lie you mean No I wont do that Dont ask me Chuck Chuck nodded All right We better get going Roger said briskly Its quarter of five Well take the Mercedes over to Somersworth  Bruce Carrick the ownermanager was tending bar when the three of them came in at fiveforty Johnnys heart sank a little when he read the sign posted outside the lounge doors PRIVATE PARTY THIS EVENING ONLY  PM TO CLOSING SEE YOU TOMORROW Carrick was not exactly being run into the ground He was serving a few workmen who were drinking beer and watching the early news and three couples who were having cocktails He listened to Johnnys story with a face that grew ever more incredulous When he had finished Carrick said You say Smiths your name Yes thats right Mr Smith come on over to this window with me He led Johnny to the lobby window by the cloakroom door Look out there Mr Smith and tell me what you see Johnny looked out knowing what he would see Route  ran west now drying from a light afternoon sprinkle Above the sky was perfectly clear The thunderheads had passed Not much At least not now But But nothing Bruce Carrick said You know what I think You want to know frankly I think youre a nut Why you picked me for this royal screwing I dont know or care But if you got a second sonny Ill tell you the facts of life The senior class has paid me six hundred and fifty bucks for this bash Theyve hired a pretty good rock n roll band Oak from up in Maine The foods out there in the freezer all ready to go into the microwave The salads are on ice Drinks are extra and most of these kids are over eighteen and can drink all they want  and tonight they will who can blame them you only graduate from a high school once Ill take in two thousand dollars in the lounge tonight no sweat I got two extra barmen coming in I got six waitresses and a hostess If I should cancel this thing now I lose the whole night plus I got to pay back the sixfifty I already took for the meal I dont even get my regular dinner crowd because that signs been there all week Do you get the picture Are there lightning rods on this place Johnny asked Carrick threw his hands up I tell this guy the facts of life and he wants to discuss lightning rods Yeah I got lightning rods A guy came in here before I added on must be five years ago now He gave me a songanddance about improving my insurance rates So I bought the goddam lightning rods Are you happy Jesus Christ He looked at Roger and Chuck What are you two guys doing Why are you letting this asshole run around loose Get out why dont you I got a business to run Johnny Chuck began Never mind Roger said Lets go Thank you for your time Mr Carrick and for your polite and sympathetic attention Thanks for nothing Carrick said Bunch of nuts He strode back toward the lounge The three of them went out Chuck looked doubtfully at the flawless sky Johnny started toward the car looking only at his feet feeling stupid and defeated His headache thudded sickly against his temples Roger was standing with his hands in his back pockets looking up at the long low roof of the building What are you looking at Dad Chuck asked There are no lightning rods up there Roger Chatsworth said thoughtfully No lightning rods at all  The three of them sat in the living room of the big house Chuck by the telephone He looked doubtfully at his father Most of them wont want to change their plans this late he said Theyve got plans to go out thats all Roger said They can just as easily come here Chuck shrugged and began dialing They ended up with about half the couples who had been planning to go to Cathys that graduation evening and Johnny was never really sure why they came Some probably came simply because it sounded like a more interesting party and because the drinks were on the house But word traveled fast and the parents of a good many of the kids here had been at the lawn party that afternoon  as a result Johnny spent much of the evening feeling like an exhibit in a glass case Roger sat in the corner on a stool drinking a vodka martini His face was a studied mask Around quarter of eight he walked across the big bar playroom combination that took up threequarters of the basement level bent close to Johnny and bellowed over the roar of Elton John You want to go upstairs and play some cribbage Johnny nodded gratefully Shelley was in the kitchen writing letters She looked up when they came in and smiled I thought you two masochists were going to stay down there all night Its not really necessary you know Im sorry about all of this Johnny said I know how crazy it must seem It does seem crazy Shelley said No reason not to be candid about that But having them here is really rather nice I dont mind Thunder rumbled outside Johnny looked around Shelley saw it and smiled a little Roger had left to hunt for the cribbage board in the dining room welsh dresser Its just passing over you know she said A little thunder and a sprinkle of rain Yes Johnny said She signed her letter in a comfortable sprawl folded it sealed it addressed it stamped it You really experienced something didnt you Johnny Yes A momentary faintness she said Possibly caused by a dietary deficiency Youre much too thin Johnny It might have been a hallucination mightnt it No I dont think so Outside thunder growled again but distantly Im just as glad to have him home I dont believe in astrology and palmistry and clairvoyance and all of that but  Im just as glad to have him home Hes our only chick a pretty damned big chick now I suspect you re thinking but its easy to remember him riding the little kids merrygoround in the town park in his short pants Too easy perhaps And its nice to be able to share the the last rite of his boyhood with him Its nice that you feel that way Johnny said Suddenly he was frightened to find himself close to tears In the last six or eight months it seemed to him that his emotional control had slipped several notches Youve been good for Chuck I dont mean just teaching him to read In a lot of ways I like Chuck Yes she said quietly I know you do Roger came back with the cribbage board and a transistor radio tuned to WMTQ a classical station that broadcast from the top of Mount Washington A little antidote for Elton John Aerosmith Foghat et al he said How does a dollar a game sound Johnny It sounds fine Roger sat down rubbing his hands Oh youre goin home poor he said  They played cribbage and the evening passed Between each game one of them would go downstairs and make sure no one had decided to dance on the pool table or go out back for a little party of their own No one is going to impregnate anyone else at this party if I can help it Roger said Shelley had gone into the living room to read Once an hour the music on the radio would stop and the news would come on and Johnnys attention would falter a little But there was nothing about Cathys in Somersworth  not at eight nine or ten After the ten oclock news Roger said Getting ready to hedge your prediction a little Johnny No The weather forecast was for scattered thundershowers clearing after midnight The steady bass signature of KC and the Sunshine Band came up through the floor Partys getting loud Johnny remarked The hell with that Roger said grinning The partys getting drunk Spider Parmeleau is passed out in the corner and somebodys using him for a beer coaster Oh theyll have big heads in the morning you want to believe it I remember at my own graduation party Here is a bulletin from the WMTQ newsroom the radio said Johnny who had been shuffling sprayed cards all over the floor Relax its probably just something about that kidnapping down in Florida I dont think so Johnny said The broadcaster said It appears at this moment that the worst fire in New Hampshire history has claimed more than seventyfive young lives in the border town of Somersworth New Hampshire The fire occurred at a restaurantlounge called Cathys A graduation party was in progress when the fire broke out Somersworth fire chief Milton Hovey told reporters they have no suspicions of arson they believe that the fire was almost certainly caused by a bolt of lightning Roger Chatsworths face was draining of all color He sat bolt upright in his kitchen chair his eyes fixed on a point somewhere above Johnnys head His hands lay loosely on the table From below them came the babble of conversation and laughter intermingled now with the sound of Bruce Springsteen Shelley came into the room She looked from her husband to Johnny and then back again What is it Whats wrong Shut up Roger said  is still blazing and Hovey said that a final tally of the dead will probably not be known until early morning It is known that over thirty people mostly members of the Durham High School senior class have been taken to hospitals in surrounding areas to be treated for burns Forty people also mostly graduating students escaped from small bathroom windows at the rear of the lounge but others were apparently trapped in fatal pileups at the Was it Cathys Shelley Chatsworth screamed Was it that place Yes Roger said He seemed eerily calm Yes it was Downstairs there had been a momentary silence It was followed by a running thud of footsteps coming up the stairs The kitchen door burst open and Chuck came in looking for his mother Mom What is it Whats wrong It appears that we may owe you for our sons life Roger said in that same eerily calm voice Johnny had never seen a face that white Roger looked like a ghastly living waxwork It burned Chucks voice was incredulous Behind him others were crowding up the stairs now whispering in low affrighted voices Are you saying it burned down No one answered And then suddenly from somewhere behind him Patty Strachan began to talk in a high hysterical voice Its his fault that guy there He made it happen He set it on fire by his mind just like in that book Carrie You murderer Killer You  Roger turned toward her SHUT UP He roared Patty collapsed into wild sobs Burned Chuck repeated He seemed to be asking himself now inquiring if that could possibly be the right word Roger Shelley whispered Rog Honey There was a growing mutter on the stairs and in the playroom below like a stir of leaves The stereo clicked off The voices murmured Was Mike there Shannon went didnt she Are you sure Yes I was all ready to leave when Chuck called me My mother was there when that guy freaked out and she said she felt like a goose was walking on her grave she asked me to come here instead Was Casey there Was Ray there Was Maureen Ontello there Oh my God was she Was Roger stood up slowly and turned around I suggest he said that we find the soberest people here to drive and that we all go down to the hospital Theyll need blood donors Johnny sat like a stone He found himself wondering if he would ever move again Outside thunder rumbled And followed on its heels like an inner clap he heard his dying mothers voice Do your duty John August  Dear Johnny Finding you wasnt much of a trick  I sometimes think if you have enough free cash you can find anyone in this country and the cash I got Maybe Im risking your resentment stating it as baldly as that but Chuck and Shelley and I owe you too much to tell you less than the truth Money buys a lot but it cant buy off the lightning They found twelve boys still in the mens room opening off the restaurant the one where the window had been nailed shut The fire didnt reach there but the smoke did and all twelve of them were suffocated I havent been able to get that out of my mind because Chuck could have been one of those boys So I had you tracked down as you put it in your letter And for the same reason I cant leave you alone as you requested At least not until the enclosed check comes back canceled with your endorsement on the back Youll notice that its a considerably smaller check than the one you returned about a month ago I got in touch with the EMMC Accounts Department and paid your outstanding hospital bills with the balance of it Youre free and clear that way Johnny That I could do and I did it  with great pleasure I might add You protest you cant take the money I say you can and you will You will Johnny I traced you to Ft Lauderdale and if you leave there I will trace you to the next place you go even if you decide on Nepal Call me a louse who wont let go if you want to I see myself more as the Hound of Heaven I dont want to hound you Johnny I remember you telling me that day not to sacrifice my son I almost did And what about the others Eightyone dead thirty more terribly maimed and burned I think of Chuck saying maybe we could work out some kind of a story spin a yarn or something and me saying with all the righteousness of the totally stupid I wont do that Chuck Dont ask me Well I could have done something Thats what haunts me I could have given that butcher Carrick ooo to pay off his help and shut down for the night It would have come to about  a life So believe me when I say I dont want to hound you Im really too busy hounding myself to want to spare the time I think Ill be doing it for quite a few years to come Im paying up for refusing to believe anything I couldnt touch with one of my five senses And please dont believe that paying the bills and tendering this check is just a sop to my conscience Money cant buy off the lightning and it cant buy an end to bad dreams either The money is for Chuck although he knows nothing about it Take the check and Ill leave you in peace Thats the deal Send it on to UNICEF if you want or give it to a home for orphan bloodhounds or blow it all on the ponies I dont care Just take it Im sorry you felt you had to leave in such a hurry but I believe I understand We all hope to see you soon Chuck leaves for Stovington Prep on September  Johnny take the check Please All regards Roger Chatsworth September   Dear Johnny Will you believe that Im not going to let this go Please Take the check Regards Roger Dear Johnny September   Charlie and l were both so glad to know where you are and it was a relief to get a letter from you that sounded so natural and like yourself But there was one thing that bothered me very much son I called up Sam Weizak and read him that part of your letter about the increasing frequency of your headaches He advises you to see a doctor Johnny without delay He is afraid that a clot may have formed around the old scar tissue So that worries me and it worries Sam too Youve never looked really healthy since you came out of the coma Johnny and when I last saw you in early June I thought you looked very tired Sam didnt say but I know what hed really like you to do is to catch a plane out of Phoenix and come on home and let him be the one to look at you You certainly cant plead poverty now Roger Chatsworth has called here twice and I tell him what I can I think hes telling the truth when he says it isnt consciencemoney or a reward for saving his sons life I believe your mother would have said that the man is doing penance the only way he knows how Anyway youve taken it and I hope you dont mean it when you say you only did it to get him off your back I believe you have too much grit in you to do anything for a reason like that Now this is very hard for me to say but l will do the best I can Please come home Johnny The publicity has died down again I can hear you saying Oh bullshit it will never die down again not after this and I suppose you are right in a way but you are also wrong Over the phone Mr Chatsworth said If you talk to him try to make him understand that no psychic except Nostradamus has ever been much more than a ninedays wonder I worry about you a lot son I worry about you blaming yourself for the dead instead of blessing your self for the living the ones you saved the ones that were at the Chatsworths house that night I worry and I miss you too I miss you like the dickens as your grandmother used to say So please come home as soon as you can Dad PS Im sending the clippings about the fire and about your part in it Charlie collected them up As you will see you were correct in guessing that everyone who was at that lawn party will spill their guts to the papers I suppose these clippings may just upset you more and if they do just toss them away But Charlies idea was that you may look at them and say That wasnt as bad as I thought I can face that I hope it turns out that way Dad September   Dear Johnny I got your address from my dad How is the great American desert Seen any redskins haha Well here I am at Stovington Prep This place isnt so tough I am taking sixteen hours of credit Advanced chemistry is my favorite although its really something of a tit after the course at DHS I always had the feeling that our teacher there old Fearless Farnham would really have been more happy making doomsday weapons and blowing up the world In English we are reading three things by J D Salinger this first four weeks Catcher in the Rye Franny and Zooey and Raise High the Roof Beams Carpenters I like him a lot Our teacher told us he still lives over in NH but has given up writing That blows my mind Why would someone just give up when they are going great guns Oh well The football team here really sucks but Im learning to like soccer The coach says soccer is football for smart people and football is football for assholes I cant figure out yet if hes right or just jealous Im wondering if it would be oh to give out your address to some people who were at our party graduation night They want to write and say thanks One of them is Patty Strachans mother you will remember her the one that made such a pisshead of herself when her precious daughter fainted at the lawn party that afternoon She now figures that youre an ok person Im not going with Patty anymore by the way Im not much on longdistance courtships at my tender age haha and Patty is going to Vassar as you might have expected Ive met a foxy little chick here Well write when you can my man My dad made it sound like you were really bummed out for what reason I do not know since it seems to me that you did everything you could to make things turn out right Hes wrong isnt he Johnny Youre really not that bummed out are you Please write and tell me you are oh I worry about you Thats a laugh isnt it the original Alfred E Neuman worried about you but I am When you write tell me why Holden Caulfield always has to have the blues so much when he isnt even black Chuck PS The foxy chicks name is Stephanie Wyman and have already turned her on to Something Wicked This Way Comes She also likes a punkrock group called The Ramones you should hear them they are hilarious C October   Dear Johnny Okay thats better you sound ok Laughed my ass off about your job with the Phoenix Public Works Dept I have no sympathy at all for your sunburn after four outings as a Stovington Tiger Coach is right l guess football is football for assholes at least at this place Our record is  and in the game we won I scored three touchdowns hyperventilated my stupid self and blacked out Scared Steff into a tizzy haha f waited to write so I could answer your question about how the Home Folks feel about Greg Stillson now that he is on the job J was home this last weekend and Ill tell you all I can Asked my dad first and he said Is Johnny still interested in that guy I said Hes showing his fundamental bad taste by wanting your opinion Then he goes to my mother See prep school is turning him into a smartass I thought it would Well to make a long story short  most people are pretty surprised by how well Stillsons doing My dad said this If people of a congressmans home district had to give a report card on how well the guy was doing after four months Stillson would get mostly Bs plus an A for his work on Carters energy bill and his own home heatingoil ceiling bill Also an A for effort Dad told me to tell you that maybe he was wrong about Stillson being the village fool Other comments from people I talked to when I was home they like it around here that he doesnt dress up in a business suit Mrs Jarvis who runs the QuikPik sorry about the spelling man but thats what they call it says she thinks Stillson is not afraid of the big interests Henry Burke who runs The Bucket  that el scuzzo tavern downtown  says he thinks Stilison has done a doubledamn good lob Most other comments are similar They contrast what Stillson has done with what Carter hasnt done most of them are really disappointed in him and are kicking themselves for having voted for him I asked some of them if they werent worried that those iron horsemen were still hanging around and that fellow Sonny Elliman was serving as one of Stillsons aides None of them seemed too upset The guy who runs the Record Rock put it to be this way If Tom Hayden can go straight and Eldridge Cleave can get Jesus why cant some bikies join the establishment Forgive and forget So there you are I would write more but football practice is coming up This weekend we are scheduled to be trounced by the Barre Wildcats I just hope I survive the season Keep well my man Chuck From the New York Times March   FBI AGENT MURDERED IN OKLAHOMA Special to the Times  Edgar Lancte  a tenyear veteran of the FBI was apparently murdered last night in an Oklahoma City parking garage Police say that a dynamite bomb wired to the ignition of his car exploded when Mr Lancte turned the key The ganglandstyle execution was similar in style to the murder of Arizona investigative reporter Don Bolles two years ago but FBI chief William Webster would not speculate on any possible connection Mr Webster would also neither confirm nor deny that Mr Lancte had been investigating shady land deals and possible links to local politicians There appears to be some mystery surrounding exactly what Mr Lanctes current assignment was and one source in the Justice Department claims that Mr Lancte was not investigating possible land fraud at all but a national security matter Mr Lancte joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in  and The notebooks in Johnnys bureau drawer grew from four to five and by the fall of  to seven In the fall of  between the deaths of two popes in rapid succession Greg Stillson had become national news He was reelected to the House of Representatives in a landslide and with the country tending toward Proposition  conservativism he had formed the America Now party Most startling several members of the House had reneged on their original party standing and had joined up as Greg liked to put it Most of them held very similar beliefs which Johnny had defined as superficially liberal on domestic issues and moderate to very conservative on issues of foreign policy There was not a one of them who had voted on the Carter side of the Panama Canal treaties And when you peeled back the liberal veneer on domestic positions they turned out to be pretty conservative too The America Now party wanted bad trouble for bigtime dopers they wanted the cities to have to sink or swim on their own There is no need for a struggling dairy farmer to have to subsidize New York Citys methadone programs with his taxes Greg proclaimed they wanted a crackdown on welfare benefits to whores pimps bums and people with a felony bust on their records they wanted sweeping tax reforms to be paid for by sweeping social services cutbacks All of it was an old song but Gregs America Now party had set it to a pleasing new tune Seven congressmen swung over before the offyear elections and two senators Six of the Congressmen were reelected and both of the senators Of the nine eight had been Republicans whose base had been whittled away to a pinhead Their switch of party and subsequent reelections one wag had quipped was a better trick than the one that had followed Lazarus come forth Some were already saying that Greg Stillson might be a power to be reckoned with and not that many years down the road either He had not been able to send all the worlds pollution out to Jupiter and the rings of Saturn but he had succeeded in running at least two of the rascals out  one of them a congressman who had been feathering his nest as the silent partner in a parkinglot kickback scheme and one of them a presidential aide with a penchant for gay bars His oilceiling bill had shown vision and boldness and his careful guidance of its passage from committee to final vote had shown a downhome countryboy shrewdness Nineteenhundred eighty would be too early for Greg and  might be too tempting to resist but if he managed to stay cool until  if he continued to build his base and the winds of change did not shift radically enough to blow his fledgling party away why anything might happen The Republicans had fallen to squabbling splinters and assuming that Mondale or Jerry Brown or even Howard Baker might follow Carter as president who was to follow then Even  might not be too late for him He was a relatively young man Yes  sounded about right There were several political cartoons in Johnnys notebooks All of them showed Stillsons infectious slantwise grin and in all of them he was wearing his construction helmet One by Oliphant showed Greg rolling a barrel of oil marked PRICE CEILINGS straight down the middle aisle of the House the helmet cocked back on his head Up front was Jimmy Carter scratching his head and looking puzzled he was not looking Gregs way at all and the implication seemed to be that he was going to get run down The caption read OUTTA MY WAY JIMMY The helmet The helmet somehow bothered Johnny more than anything else The Republicans had their elephant the democrats their donkey and Greg Stillson had his construction helmet In Johnnys dreams it sometimes seemed that Stillson was wearing a motorcycle helmet And sometimes it was a coalscuttle helmet  In a separate notebook he kept the clippings his father had sent him concerning the fire at Cathys He had gone over them again and again although for reasons that Sam Roger or even his father could not have suspected PSYCHIC PREDICTS FIRE MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE DIED TOO TEARFUL THANKFUL MOM PROCLAIMS the tearful thankful mom in question had been Patty Strachans Psychic Who Cracked Castle Rock Murders Predicts Flash Fire ROADHOUSE DEATHTOLL REACHES  FATHER SAYS JOHNNY SMITH HAS LEFT NEW ENGLAND REFUSES TO SAY WHERE Pictures of him Pictures of his father Pictures of that longago wreck on Route  in Cleaves Mills back in the days when Sarah Bracknell had been his girl Now Sarah was a woman the mother of two and in his last letter Herb had said Sarah was showing a few gray hairs It seemed impossible to believe that he himself was thirtyone Impossible but true Around all these clippings were his own jottings his painful efforts to get it straight in his mind once and for all None of them understood the true importance of the fire its implication on the much larger matter of what to do about Greg Stillson He had written I have to do something about Stillson I have to I was right about Cathys and Im going to be right about this There is absolutely no question in my mind He is going to become president and he is going to start a war  or cause one through simple mismanagement of the office which amounts to the same thing The question is How drastic are the measures that need to be taken Take Cathys as a testtube case It almost could have been sent to me as a sign God Im starting to sound like my mother but there it is Okay I knew there was going to be a fire and that people were going to die Was that sufficient to save them Answer it was not sufficient to save all of them because people only truly believe after the fact The ones who came to the Chatsworth house instead of going to Cathys were saved but its important to remember that RC didnt have the party because he believed my prediction He was very upfront about that He had the party because he thought it would help me have peace of mind He was  humoring me He believed after Patty Strachans mother believed after Afterafterafter By then it was too late for the dead and the burned So Question  Could I have changed the outcome Yes I could have driven a car right through the front of the place Or I could have burned it down myself that afternoon Question  What would the results of either action have been to me Imprisonment probably If I took the car option and then lightning struck it later that night I suppose I could have argued  no it doesnt wash Common experience may recognize some sort of psychic ability in the human mind but the law sure as hell doesnt I think now if I had it to do over again I would do one of those things and never mind the consequences to me Is it psssible that I didnt completely believe my own prediction The matter of Stillson is horribly similar in all respects except thank God that I have a lot more lead time So back to square one I dont want Greg Stillson to become President How can I change that outcome  Go back to New Hampshire and line up as he puts it Try to throw a few monkey wrenches into the America Now party Try to sabotage him Theres dirt enough under the rug Maybe I could sweep some of it out  Hire someone else to get the dirt on him Theres enough of Rogers money left over to hire someone good On the other hand I got the feeling that Lancte was pretty good And Lanctes dead  Wound or cripple him The way Arthur Bremmer crippled Wallace the way whoeveritwas crippled Larry Flynt  Kill him Assassinate him Now some of the drawbacks The first option isnt sure enough I could end up doing nothing more constructive than getting myself trounced the way Hunter Thompson did when he was researching his first book that one on the Hells Angels Even worse this fellow Elliman may be familiar with what I look like as a result of what happened at the Trimbull rally Isnt it more or less SOP to keep a file on people who may be dangerous to your guys I wouldnt be surprised to find out that Stillson had one guy on his payroll whose only job was to keep updated files on weird people and kooks Which definitely includes me Then theres the second option Suppose all the dirt has already come out If Stillson has already formed his higher political aspirations  and all his actions seem to point that way  he may already have cleaned up his act And another thing dirt under the rug is only as dirty as the press wants to make it and the press likes Stillson He cultivates them In a novel I suppose I would turn private detective myself and get the goods on him but the sad fact is that I wouldnt know where to begin You could argue that my ability to read people to find things out that have been lost to quote Sam would give me a boost If I could find out something about Lancte that would turn the trick But isnt it likely that Stillson delegates all that to Sonny Elliman And I cannot even be sure despite my suspicions that Edgar Lancte was still on Stillsons trail when he was murdered It is possible that I might hang Sonny Elliman and still not finish Stillson Overall the second alternative is lust not sure enough The stakes are enormous so much so that I dont even dare let myself think about the big picture very often It brings on a very bitchkitty of a headache every time I have even considered in my wilder moments trying to hook him on drugs the way the character Gene Hackman played in The French Connection II was or driving him batty with LSD slipped into his Dr Pepper or whatever it is he drinks But all of that is copshow makebelieve Gordon Liddy shit The problems are so great that this option doesnt even bear much talking about Maybe I could kidnap him After all the guy is only a US representative I wouldnt know where to get heroin or morphine but I could get plenty of LSD from Larry McNaughton right here in the good old Phoenix Public Works Department He has pills for every purpose But suppose if were willing to suppose the foreging that he just enjoyed his trips Shooting and crippling him Maybe I could and maybe I couldnt I guess under the right circumstances I could  like the rally in Trimbull Suppose I did After what happened in Laurel George Wallace was never really a potent political force again On the other hand FDR campaigned from his wheelchair and even turned it into an asset That leaves assassination the Big Casino This is the one unarguable alternative You cant run for president if youre a corpse If I could pull the trigger And if I could what would the results be to me As Bob Dylan says Honey do you have to ask me that There were a great many other notes and jottings but the only other really important one was written out and neatly boxed Suppose outright murder does turnout to be the only alternative And suppose it turned out that I could pull the trigger Murder is still wrong Murder is wrong Murder is wrong There may yet be an answer Thank God theres years of time  But for Johnny there wasnt In early December of  shortly after another congressman Leo Ryan of California had been shot to death on a jungle airstrip in the South American country of Guayana Johnny Smith discovered he had almost run out of time At  PM On December   Bud Prescott waited on a tall and rather haggardlooking young man with graying hair and badly bloodshot eyes Bud was one of three clerks working in the th Street Phoenix Sporting Goods Store on the day after Christmas and most of the business was exchanges  but this fellow was a paying customer He said he wanted to buy a good rifle lightweight boltaction Bud showed him several The day after Christmas was a slow one on the guncounter when men got guns for Christmas very few of them wanted to exchange them for something else This fellow looked them all over carefully and finally settled on a Remington   caliber a very nice gun with a light kick and a flat trajectory He signed the gunbook John Smith and Bud thought If I never saw me an alias before in my life theres one there John Smith paid cash  took the twenties right out of a wallet that was bulging with them Took the rifle right over the counter Bud thinking to poke him a little told him he could have his initials burned into the stock no extra charge John Smith merely shook his head When Smith left the store Bud noticed that he was limping noticeably Would never be any problem identifying that guy again he thought not with that limp and those scars running up and down his neck  At   AM on December  a thin man who walked with a limp came into Phoenix Office Supply Inc and approached Dean Clay a salesman there Clay said later that he noticed what his mother had always called a firespot in one of the mans eyes The customer said he wanted to buy a large attache case and eventually picked out a handsome cowhide item top of the line priced at  And the man with the limp qualified for the cash discount by paying with new twenties The whole transaction from looking to paying took no more than ten minutes The fellow walked out of the store and turned right toward the downtown area and Dean Clay never saw him again until he saw his picture in the Phoenix Sun  Late that same afternoon a tall man with graying hair approached Bonita Alvarezs window in the Phoenix Amtrak terminal and inquired about traveling from Phoenix to New York by train Bonita showed him the connections He followed them with his finger and then carefully jotted them all down He asked Bonnie Alvarez if she could ticket him to depart on January  Bonnie danced her fingers over her computer console and said that she could Then why dont you  the tall man began and then faltered He put one hand up to his head Are you all right sir Fireworks the tall man said She told the police later on that she was quite sure that was what he said Fireworks Sir Are you all right Headache he said Excuse me He tried to smile but the effort did not improve his drawn youngold face much Would you like some aspirin I have some No thanks Itll pass She wrote the tickets and told him he would arrive at New Yorks Grand Central Station on January  at midafternoon How much is that She told him and added Will that be cash or charge Mr Smith Cash he said and pulled it right out of his wallet a whole handful of twenties and tens She counted it gave him his change his receipt his tickets Your train leaves at   AM Mr Smith she said Please be here and ready to entrain at   All right he said Thank you Bonnie gave him the big professional smile but Mr Smith was already turning away His face was very pale and to Bonnie he looked like a man who was in a great deal of pain She was very sure that he had said fireworks  Elton Curry was a conductor on Amtraks PhoenixSalt Lake run The tall man appeared promptly at  AM on January  and Elton helped him up the steps and into the car because he was limping quite badly He was carrying a rather old tartan traveling bag with scuffmarks and fraying edges in one hand In the other he carried a brandnew cowhide attache case He carried the attache case as if it were quite heavy Can I help you with that sir Elton asked meaning the attache case but it was the traveling bag that the passenger handed him along with his ticket No Ill take that when were underway sir All right Thank you A very polite sort of fellow Elton Curry told the FBI agents who questioned him later And he tipped well  January   was a gray overcast day in New York snow threatened but did not fall George Clements taxi was parked in front of the Biltmore Hotel across from Grand Central The door opened and a fellow with graying hair got in moving carefully and a little painfully He placed a traveling bag and an attache case beside him on the seat dosed the door then put his head back against the seat and closed his eyes for a moment as if he was very very tired Where we goin my friend George asked His fare looked at a slip of paper Port Authority Terminal he said George got going You look a little white around the gills my friend My brotherinlaw looked like that when he was havin his gallstone attacks You got stones No My brotherinlaw he says gallstones hurt worse than anything Except maybe kidney stones You know what I told him I told him he was full of shit Andy I says youre a great guy I love ya but youre full of shit You ever had cancer Andy I says I asks him that you know did he ever have cancer I mean everybody knows cancers the worst George took a long look in his rearview mirror Im asking yu sincerely my friend  are you okay Because Im telling you the truth you look like death warmed over The passenger answered Im fine I was  thinking of another taxi ride Several years ago Oh right George said sagely exactly as if he knew what the man was talking about Well New York was full of kooks there was no denying that And after this brief pause for reflection he went on talking about his brotherinlaw  Mommy is that man sick Shhh Yeah but is he Danny be quiet She smiled at the man on the other side of the Greyhounds aisle an apologetic kidswillsayanythingwontthey smile but the man appeared not to have heard The poor guy did look sick Danny was only four but he was right about that The man was looking listlessly out at the snow that had begun to fall shortly after they crossed the Connecticut state line He was much too pale much too thin and there was a hideous Frankenstein scar running up out of his coat collar to just under his jaw It was as if someone had tried taking his head clean off at sometime in the nottoodistant past  tried and almost succeeded The Greyhound was on its way to Portsmouth New Hampshire and they would arrive at   tonight if the snow didnt slow things down too much Julie Brown and her son were going to see Julies motherinlaw and as usual the old bitch would spoil Danny rotten  and Danny didnt have far to go I wanna go see him No Danny I wanna see if hes sick No Yeah but what if hes dine ma Dannys eyes positively glowed at this entrancing possibility He might be dine right now Danny shut up Hey mister Danny cried You dine or anything Danny you shut your mouth  Julie hissed her cheeks burning with embarrassment Danny began to cry then not real crying but that snotty Icantgetmyownway whining that always made her want to grab him and pinch his arms until he really had something to cry about At times like this riding the bus into evening through another cruddy snowstorm with her son whining beside her she wished her own mother had sterilized her several years before she had reached the age of consent That was when the man across the aisle turned his head and smiled at her  a tired painful smile but rather sweet for all that She saw that his eyes were terribly bloodshot as if he had been crying She tried to smile back but it felt false and uneasy on her lips That red left eye  and the scar running up his neck  made that half of his face look sinister and unpleasant She hoped that the man across the aisle wasnt going all the way to Portsmouth but as it turned out he was She caught sight of him in the terminal as Dannys gram swept the boy giggling happily into her arms She saw him limping toward the terminal doors a scuffed traveling bag in one hand a new attache case in the other And for just a moment she felt a terrible chill cross her back It was really worse than a limp  it was very nearly a headlong lurch But there was something implacable about it she told the New Hampshire state police later It was as if he knew exactly where he was going and nothing was going to stop him from getting there Then he passed out into the darkness and she lost sight of him  Timmesdale New Hampshire is a small town west of Durham just inside the third congressional district It is kept alive by the smallest of the Chatsworth Mills which hulks like a sootstained brick ogre on the edge of Timmesdale Stream Its one modest claim to fame according to the local Chamber of Commerce is that it was the first town in New Hampshire to have electric streetlights One evening in early January a young man with prematurely graying hair and a limp walked into the Timmesdale Pub the towns only beer joint Dick ODonnell the owner was tending the bar The place was almost empty because it was the middle of the week and another norther was brewing Two or three inches had piled up out there already and more was on the way The man with the limp stamped off his shoes came to the bar and ordered a Pabst ODonnell served him The fellow had two more making them last watching the TV over the bar The color was going bad had been for a couple of months now and The Fonz looked like an aging Rumanian ghoul ODonnell couldnt remember having seen this guy around Like another ODonnell asked coming back to the bar after serving the two old bags in the corner One more wont hurt the fellow said He pointed to a spot above the TV You met him I guess It was a framed blowup of a political cartoon It showed Greg Stilison his construction helmet cocked back on his head throwing a fellow in a business suit down the Capitol steps The fellow in the business suit was Louis Quinn the congressman who had been caught taking kickbacks in the parkinglot scam some fourteen months ago The cartoon was titled GIVING EM THE BUMS RUSH and across the corner it had been signed in a scrawling hand For Dick ODonnell who keeps the best damn saloon in the third district Keep drawing them Dick  Greg Stillson Betcha butt I did ODonnell said He gave a speech in here the last time he canvassed for the House Had signs out all over town come on into the Pub at two oclock Saturday afternoon and have one on Greg That was the best damn days business Ive ever done People was only supposed to have one on him but he ended up grabbing the whole tab Cant do much better than that can you Sounds like you think hes one hell of a guy Yeah I do ODonnell said Id be tempted to put my bare knuckles on anyone who said the other way Well I wont try you The fellow put down three quarters Have one on me Well okay Dont mind if I do Thanks mister Johnny Smith is my name Why pleased to meet you Johnny Dicky ODonnell thats me He drew himself a beer from the tap Yeah Gregs done this part of New Hampshire a lotta good And theres a lotta people afraid to come right out and say it but Im not Ill say it right out loud Some day Greg Stillsons apt to be president You think so I do ODonnell said coming back to the bar New Hampshires not big enough to hold Greg Hes one hell of a politician and coming from me thats something I thought the whole crew was nothin but a bunch of crooks and lollygags I still do but Gregs an exception to the rule Hes a square shooter If you told me five years ago Id be sayin somethin like that I woulda laughed in your face Youd be more likely to find me readin poitry than seein any good in a politician I woulda said But goddammit hes a man Johnny said Most of these guys want to be your buddy while theyre running for office but when they get in its fuck you Jack I got mine until the next election I come from Maine myself and the one time I wrote Ed Muskie you know what I got A form letter Ah thats a Polack for you ODonnell said What do you expect from a Polack Listen Greg comes back to the district every damn weekend Now does that sound like fuck you Jack I got mine to you Every weekend huh Johnny sipped his beer Where Trimbull Ridgeway The big towns Hes got a system ODonnell said in the reverent tones of a man who has never been able to work one out for himself Fifteen towns from the big places like Capital City right down to the little burgs like Timmesdale and Coorters Notch He hits one a week until hes gone through the whole list and then he starts at the top again You know how big Coorters Notch is They got eight hundred souls up there So what do you think about a guy who takes a weekend off from Washington and comes down to Coorters Notch to freeze his balls off in a cold meetin hall Does that sound like fuck you Jack I got mine to you No it doesnt Johnny said truthfully What does he do Just shake hands No hes got a hall in every town Reserves it for all day Saturday He gets in there about ten in the morning and people can come by and talk to him Tell him their idears you know If they got questions he answers them If he cant answer them he goes back to Washington and finds the answer He looked at Johnny triumphantly When was he here in Timmesdale last Couple of months ago ODonnell said He went to the cash register and rummaged through a pile of papers beside it He came up with a dogeared clipping and laid it on the bar beside Johnny Heres the list You just take a look at that and see what you think The clipping was from the Ridgeway paper It was fairly old now The story was headlined STILLS ON ANNOUNCES FEEDBACK CENTERS The first paragraph looked as though it might have been lifted straight from the Stillson press kit Below it was the list of towns where Greg would be spending his weekends and the proposed dates He was not due in Timmesdale again until midMarch I think it looks pretty good Johnny said Yeah I think so Lotta people think so By this dipping he must have been ill Goorters Notch just last weekend Thats right ODonnell said and laughed Good old Coorters Notch Want another beer Johnny Only if youll join me Johnny said and laid a couple of bucks on the bar Well I dont care if I do One of the two barbags had put some money in the juke and Tammy Wynette sounding old and tired and not happy to be here began singing Stand By Your Man Hey Dick the other cawed You ever hear of service in this place Shut your head  he hollered back Fuck  YOU she called and cackled Goddammit Clarice I told you about saying the effword in my bar I told you Oh get off it and lets have some beer I hate those two old cunts ODonnell muttered to Johnny Couple of old alky dieseldykes thats what they are They been here a million years and I wouldnt be surprised if they both lived to spit on my grave Its a hell of a world sometimes Yes it is Pardon me Ill be right back I got a girl but she only comes in Fridays and Saturdays in the winter ODonnell drew two schooners of beer and brought them over to the table He said something to them and Clarice replied Fuck  YOU and cackled again The beerjoint was filled with the ghosts of dead hamburgers Tammy Wynette sang through the popcorncrackle of an old record The radiators thudded dull heat into the room and outside snow spatted dryly against the glass Johnny rubbed his temples He had been in this bar before in a hundred other small towns His head ached When he had shaken ODonnells hand he knew that the barkeep had a big old mongrel dog that he had trained to sic on command His one great dream was that some night a burglar would break into his house and he would legally be able to sic that big old dog onto him and there would be one less goddam hippie pervo junkie in the world Oh his head ached ODonnell came back wiping his hands on his apron Tammy Wynette finished up and was replaced with Red Sovine who had a CB call for the Teddy Bear Thanks again for the suds ODonnell said drawing two My pleasure Johnny said still studying the dipping Coorters Notch last week Jackson this coming weekend I never heard of that one Must be a pretty small town huh Just a burg ODonnell agreed They used to have a ski resort but it went broke Lotta unemployment up that way They do some woodpulping and a little shirttail farming But he goes up there by the Jesus Talks to em Listens to their bitches Where you from up in Maine Johnny Lewiston Johnny lied The dipping said that Greg Stillson would meet with interested persons at the town hall Guess you came down for the skiing huh No I hurt my leg a while back I dont ski anymore Just passing through Thanks for letting me look at this Johnny handed the clipping back Its quite interesting ODonnell put it carefully back with his other papers He had an empty bar a dog back home that would sic on command and Greg Stillson Greg had been in his bar Johnny found himself abruptly wishing himself dead If this talent was a gift from God then God was a dangerous lunatic who ought to be stopped If God wanted Greg Stilison dead why hadnt he sent him down the birth canal with the umbilical cord wrapped around his throat Or strangled him on a piece of meat Or electrocuted him while he was changing the radio station Drowned him in the ole swimming hole Why did God have to have Johnny Smith to do his dirty work It wasnt his responsibility to save the world that was for the psychos and only psychos would presume to try it He suddenly decided he would let Greg Stillson live and spit in Gods eye You okay Johnny ODonnell asked Huh Yeah sure You looked sorta funny for just a second there Chuck Chatsworth saying if I didnt Id be afraid all those people he killed would haunt me to my grave Out woolgathering I guess Johnny said I want you to know its been a pleasure drinking with you Well the same goes back to you ODonnell said looking pleased I wish more people passing through felt that way They go through here headed for the ski resorts you know The big places Thats where they take their money If I thought theyd stop in Id fix this place up like theyd like Posters you know of Switzerland and Colorado A fireplace Load the juke up with rock n roll records instead of that shitkicking music Id you know Id like that He shrugged Im not a bad guy hell Of course not Johnny said getting off the stool and thinking about the dog trained to sic and the hopedfor hippie junkie burglar Well tell your friends Im here ODonnell said For sure Johnny said Hey Dick one of the barbags hollered Ever hear of servicewithasmile in this place Why dont you get stuffed ODonnell yelled at her flushing Fuck  YO U Clarice called back and cackled Johnny slipped quietly out into the gathering storm  He was staying at the Holiday Inn in Portsmouth When he got back that evening he told the desk clerk to have his bill ready for checkout in the morning In his room he sat down at the impersonal Holiday Inn writing desk took out all the stationery and grasped the Holiday Inn pen His head was throbbing but there were letters to be written His momentary rebellion  if that was what it had been  had passed His unfinished business with Greg Stillson remained Ive gone crazy he thought Thats really it Ive gone entirely off my chump He could see the headlines now PSYCHO SHOOTS NH REP MADMAN ASSASSINATES STILLS ON HAIL OF BULLETS CUTS DOWN US REPRESENTATIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE And Inside View of course would have a field day SELFPROCLAIMED SEER KILLS STILLSON  NOTED PSYCHIATRISTS TELL WHY SMITH DID IT With a sidebar by that fellow Dees maybe telling how Johnny had threatened to get his shotgun and shoot me a trespasser Crazy The hospital debt was paid but this would leave a new bill of particulars behind and his father would have to pay for it He and his new wife would spend a lot of days in the limelight of his reflected notoriety They would get the hate mail Everyone he had known would be interviewed  the Chatsworths Sam Sheriff George Bannerman Sarah Well maybe they wouldnt get as far as Sarah After all it wasnt as though he were planning to shoot the president At least not yet Theres a lotta people afraid to come right out and say it but Im not Ill say it right out loud Some day Greg Stillsons apt to be president Johnny rubbed his temples The headache came in low slow waves and none of this was getting his letters written He drew the first sheet of stationery toward him picked up the pen and wrote Dear Dad Outside snow struck the window with that dry sandy sound that means serious business Finally the pen began to move across the paper slowly at first then gaining speed Johnny came up wooden steps that had been shoveled clear of snow and salted down He went through a set of double doors and into a foyer plastered with specimen ballots and notices of a special town meeting to be held here in Jackson on the third of February There was also a notice of Greg Stillsons impending visit and a picture of The Man Who himself hard hat cocked back on his head grinning that hard slantwise Were wise to em aint we pard grin Set a little to the right of the green door leading into the meeting hall itself was a sign that Johnny hadnt expected and he pondered it in silence for several seconds his breath pluming white from his lips DRIVER EXAMINATIONS TODAY this sign read It was set on a wooden easel HAVE PAPERS READY He opened the door went into the stuporous glow of heat thrown by a big woodstove and there sat a cop at a desk The cop was wearing a ski parka unzipped There were papers scattered across his desk and there was also a gadget for examining visual acuity The cop looked up at Johnny and he felt a sinking sensation in his gut Can I help you sir Johnny fingered the camera slung around his neck Well I wondered if it would be all right to look around a little bit he said Im on assignment from Yankee magazine Were doing a spread on town hall architecture in Maine New Hampshire and Vermont Taking a lot of pictures you know Go right to it the cop said My wife reads Yankee all the time Puts me to sleep Johnny smiled New England architecture has a tendency toward well starkness Starkness the cop repeated doubtfully and then let it go Next please A young man approached the desk the cop was sitting behind He handed an examination sheet to the cop who took it and said Look into the viewer please and identify the traffic signs and signals which I will show you The young man peered into the viewing machine The cop put an answerkey over the young mans exam sheet Johnny moved down the center aisle of the Jackson town hall and clicked a picture of the rostrum at the front Stop sign the young man said from behind him The next ones a yield sign  and the next one is a traffic information sign  no right turn no left turn like that He hadnt expected a cop in the town hall he hadnt even bothered to buy film for the camera he was using as a prop But now it was too late to back out anyway This was Friday and Stillson would be here tomorrow if things went the way they were supposed to go He would be answering questions and listening to suggestions from the good people of Jackson There would be a fairsized entourage with him A couple of aides a couple of advisors  and several others young men in sober suits and sports jackets who had been wearing jeans and riding motorcycles not so long ago Greg Stillson was still a firm believer in guards for the body At the Trimbull rally they had been carrying sawedoff pool cues Did they carry guns now Would it be so difficult for a US representative to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon Johnny didnt think so He could count on one good chance only he would have to make the most of it So it was important to look the place over to try and decide if he could take Stillson in here or if it would be better to wait in the parking lot with the window rolled down and the rifle on his lap So he had come and here he was casing the joint while a state cop gave driverpermit exams not thirty feet away There was a bulletin board on his left and Johnny snapped his unloaded camera at it  why in Gods name hadnt he taken another two minutes and bought himself a roll of film The board was covered with chatty smalltown intelligence concerning bakedbean suppers an upcoming high school play doglicensing information and of course more on Greg A file card said that Jacksons first selectman was looking for someone who could take shorthand and Johnny studied this as though it were of great interest to him while his mind moved into high gear Of course if Jackson looked impossible  or even chancy  he could wait until next week where Stillson would be doing the whole thing all over again in the town of Upson Or the week after in Trimbull Or the week after that Or never It should be this week It ought to be tomorrow He snapped the big woodstove in the corner and then glanced upward There was a balcony up there No  not precisely a balcony more like a gallery with a waisthigh railing and wide whitepainted slats with small decorative diamonds and curlicues cut into the wood It would be very possible for a man to crouch behind that railing and look through one of those doodads At the right moment he could just stand up and What kind of camera is that Johnny looked around sure it was the cop The cop would ask to see his filmless camera  and then he would want to see some ID  and then it would be all over But it wasnt the cop It was the young man who had been taking his drivers permit test He was about twenty two with long hair and pleasant frank eyes He was wearing a suede coat and faded jeans A Nikon Johnny said Good camera man Im a real camera nut How long have you been working for Yankee Well Im a free lance Johnny said I do stuff for them sometimes for Country Journal sometimes for Downeast you know Nothing national like People or Life No At least not yet What fstop do you use in here What in hell is an fstop Johnny shrugged I play it mostly by ear By eye you mean the young man said smiling Thats right by eye Get lost kid please get lost Im interested in freeandng myself the young man said and grinned My big dream is to take a picture some day like the flagraising at Iwo Jima I heard that was staged Johnny said Well maybe Maybe But its a classic Or how about the first picture of a UFO coming in for a landing Id sure like that Anyway Ive got a portfolio of stuff Ive taken around here Whos your contact at Yankee Johnny was sweating now Actually they contacted me on this one he said It was a Mr Clawson you can come over now the cop said sounding impatient Id like to go over these answers with you Whoops his masters voice Clawson said See you later man He hurried off and Johnny let out his breath in a silent whispering sigh It was time to get out and quickly He snapped another two or three pictures just so it wouldnt look like a complete rout but he was barely aware of what he was looking at through the viewfinder Then he left The young man in the suede jacket  Clawson  had forgotten all about him He had apparently flunked the written part of his exam He was arguing strenuously with the cop who was only shaking his head Johnny paused for a moment in the town halls entryway To his left was a cloakroom To his right was a closed door He tried it and found it unlocked A narrow flight of stairs led upward into dimness The actual offices would be up there of course And the gallery I He was staying at the Jackson House a pleasant little hotel on the main drag It had been carefully renovated and the renovations had probably cost a lot of money but the place would pay for itself the owners must have reckoned because of the new Jackson Mountain ski resort Only the resort had gone bust and now the pleasant little hotel was barely hanging on The night clerk was dozing over a cup of coffee when Johnny went out at four oclock on Saturday morning the attache case in his left hand He had slept little last night slipping into a short light doze after midnight He had dreamed It was  again It was carnival time He and Sarah stood in front of the Wheel of Fortune and again he had that feeling of crazy enormous power In his nostrils he could smell burning rubber Come on a voice said softly behind him I love to watch this guy take a beatin He turned and it was Frank Dodd dressed in his black vinyl raincoat his throat slit from ear to ear in a wide red grin his eyes sparkling with dead vivaciousness He turned back to the booth scared  but now the pitchman was Greg Stillson grinning knowingly at him his yellow hard hat tipped cockily back on his skull Heyheyhey Stillson chanted his voice deep and resonant and ominous Lay em down where you want em down fella What do you say Want to shoot the moon Yes he wanted to shoot the moon But as Stillson set the Wheel in motion he saw that the entire outer circle had turned green Every number was doublezero Every number was a house number He had jerked awake and spent the rest of the night looking out the frostrimmed window into darkness The headache hed had ever since arriving in Jackson the day before was gone leaving him feeling weak but composed He sat with his hands in his lap He didnt think about Greg Stillson he thought about the past He thought about his mother putting a BandAid on a scraped knee he thought about the time the dog had torn off the back of Grandma Nellies absurd sundress and how he had laughed and how Vera had swatted him one and cut his forehead with the stone in her engagement ring he thought about his father showing him how to bait a fishing hook and saying It doesnt hurt the worms Johnny at least I dont think it does He thought about his father giving him a pocketknife for Christmas when he was seven and saying very seriously Im trusting you Johnny All those memories had come back in a flood Now he stepped off into the deep cold of the morning his shoes squeaking on the path shoveled through the snow His breath plumed out in front of him The moon was down but the stars were sprawled across the black sky in idiots profusion Gods jewel box Vera always called it Youre looking into Gods jewel box Johnny He walked down Main Street and he stopped in front of the tiny Jackson post office and fumbled the letters out of his coat pocket Letters to his father to Sarah to Sam Weizak to Bannerman He set the attache case down between his feet opened the mailbox that stood in front of the neat little brick building and after one brief moment of hesitation dropped them in He could hear them drop down inside surely the first letters mailed in Jackson this new day and the sound gave him a queer sense of finality The letters were mailed there was no stopping now He picked up the case again and walked on The only sound was the squeak of his shoes on the snow The big thermometer over the door of the Granite State Savings Bank stood at  degrees and the air had that feeling of total silent inertia that belongs exclusively to cold New Hampshire mornings Nothing moved The roadway was empty The windshields of the parked cars were blinded with cataracts of frost Dark windows drawn shades To Johnny it all seemed somehow dreadful and at the same time holy He fought the feeling This was no holy business he was on He crossed Jasper Street and there was the town hall standing white and austerely elegant behind its plowed banks of twinkling snow What are you going to do if the front doors locked Smart guy Well he would find a way to cross that bridge if he had to Johnny looked around but there was no one to see him If this had been the president coming for one of his famous town meetings everything would have been different of course The place would have been blocked off since the night before and men would be stationed inside already But this was only a US representative one of over four hundred no big deal No big deal yet Johnny went up the steps and tried the door The knob turned easily and he stepped into the cold entryway and pulled the door shut behind him Now the headache was coming back pulsing along with the steady thick beat of his heart He set his case down and massaged his temples with his gloved fingers There was a sudden low scream The coatcloset door was opening very slowly and then something white was falling out of the shadows toward him Johnny barely held back a cry For one moment he thought it was a body falling out of the closet like something from a spook movie But it was only a heavy cardboard sign that read PLEASE HAVE PAPERS IN ORDER BEFORE APPEARING FOR EXAMINATION He set it back in place and then turned to the doorway giving upon the stairs This door was now locked He leaned down to get a better look at it in the dim white glow of the streetlight that filtered in the one window It was a spring lock and he thought he might be able to open it with a coat hanger He found one in the coat closet and hooked the neck of it into the crack between the door and the jamb He worked it down to the lock and began to fumble around His head was thudding fiercely now At last he heard the bolt snap back as the wire caught it He pulled the door open He picked up his attache case and went through still holding the coat hanger He pulled the door closed behind him and heard it lock again He went up the narrow stairs which creaked and groaned under his weight At the top of the stairs there was a short hallway with several doors on either side He walked down the hall past TOWN MANAGER and TOWN SELECTMEN past TAX ASSESSOR and MENS and OSEER OF THE POOR and LADIES There was an unmarked door at the end It was unlocked and he came out onto the gallery above the rear of the meeting hall which was spread out below him in a crazy quilt of shadows He closed the door behind him and shivered a little at the soft stir of echoes in the empty hall His footfalls also echoed back as he walked to the right along the rear gallery then turned left Now he was walking along the righthand side of the hall about twentyfive feet above the floor He stopped at a point above the woodstove and directly across from the podium where Stillson would be standing in about fiveandahalf hours He sat down croslegged and rested for a while Tried to get in control of the headache with some deep breathing The woodstove wasnt operating and he felt the cold settling steadily against him  and then into him Previews of the winding shroud When he had begun to feel a little better he thumbed the catches on the attache case The double dick echoed back as his footfalls had done and this time it was the sound of cocking pistols Western justice he thought for no reason at all That was what the prosecutor had said when the jury found Claudine Longet guilty of shooting her lover Shes found out what western justice means Johnny looked down into the case and rubbed his eyes His vision doubled briefly and then things came together again He was getting an impression from the very wood he was sitting on A very old impression if it had been a photograph it would have been sepiatoned Men standing here and smoking cigars talking and laughing and waiting for town meeting to begin Had it been   There was something ghostly about it that made him feel uneasy One of them had been talking about the price of whiskey and cleaning his nose with a silver toothpick and and two years before he had poisoned his wife Johnny shivered Whatever the impression was it didnt matter It was an impression of a man who was long dead now The rifle gleamed up at him When men do it in wartime they give them medals he thought He began to assemble the rifle Each click I echoed back just once solemnly the sound of a cocking pistol He loaded the Remington with five bullets He placed it across his knees And waited  Dawn came slowly Johnny dozed a little but he was too cold now to do more than doze Thin sketchy dreams haunted what sleep he did get He came fully awake at a little past seven The door below was thrown open with a crash and he had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out Whos there It was the custodian Johnny put his eye to one of the diamond shapes cut into the balustrade and saw a burly man who was bundled up in a thick Navy pea coat He was coming up the center aisle with an armload of firewood He was humming Red River Valley He dropped the armload of wood into the woodbox with a crash and then disappeared below Johnny A second later he heard the thin screcing noise of the stoves firebox door being swung open Johnny suddenly thought of the plume of vapor be was producing every time he exhaled Suppose the custodian looked up Would he be able to see that He tried to slow the rate of his breathing but that made his head ache worse and his vision doubled alarmingly Now there was the crackle of paper being crumpled then the scratch of a match A faint whiff of sulphur in the cold air The custodian went on humming Red River Valley and then broke into loud and tuneless song From this valley they say you are going we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smiiiiile Now a different crackling sound Fire Thats got it you sucker the custodian said from directly below Johnny and then there was the sound of the firebox door being slammed shut again Johnny pressed both hands over his mouth like a bandage suddenly afflicted with suicidal amusement He saw himself rising up from the floor of the gallery as thin and white as any selfrespecting ghost He saw himself spreading his arms like wings and his fingers like talons and calling down in hollow tones Thats got you you sucker He held the laughter behind his hands His head throbbed like a tomato full of hot expanding blood His vision jittered and blurred crazily Suddenly he wanted very badly to move away from the impression of the man who had been cleaning his nose with the silver toothpick but he didnt dare make a sound Dear Jesus what if he had to sneeze Suddenly with no warning a terrible wavering shriek filled the hall drilling into Johnnys ears like thin silver nails climbing making his head vibrate He opened his mouth to screamIt cut off Oh you whore the custodian said conversationally Johnny looked through the diamond and saw the custodian standing behind the podium and fiddling with a microphone The mike cord snaked down to a small portable amp The custodian went down the few steps from the podium to the floor and pulled the amplifier farther from the mike then fooled with the dials on top of it He went back to the mike and turned it on again There was another feedback whine this one lower and then tapering away entirely Johnny pressed his hands tight against his forehead and rubbed them back and forth The custodian tapped on the mike with his thumb and the sound filled the big empty room It sounded like a fist knocking on a coffin lid Then his voice still tuneless but now amplified to the point of monstrosity a giants voice bludgeoning into Johnnys head FROM THIS VALLEEE THEY SAY YOU ARE GOING Stop it Johnny wanted to scream Oh please stop it Im going crazy cant you stop it The singing ended with a loud amplified snap and the custodian said in his own voice Thats got you whore He walked out of Johnnys line of sight again There was a sound of tearing paper and the low popping sounds of twine being snapped Then the custodian reappeared whistling and holding a large stack of booklets He began to place them at close intervals along the benches When he had finished that chore the custodian buttoned his coat and left the hall The door slammed hollowly shut behind him Johnny looked at his watch It was   The town hall was warming up a little He sat and waited The headache was still very bad but oddly enough it was easier to bear than it had ever been before All he had to do was tell himself that he wouldnt have to bear it for long  The doors slammed open again promptly at nine oclock startling him out of a catnap His hands clamped tightly over the rifle and then relaxed He put his eye to the diamondshaped peephole Four men this time One of them was the custodian the collar of his pea coat turned up against his neck The other three were wearing topcoats with suits underneath Johnny felt his heartbeat quicken One of them was Sonny Elliman His hair was cut short now and handsomely styled but the brilliant green eyes had not changed Everything set he asked Check for yourself the custodian said Dont be offended Dad one of the others replied They were moving to the front of the hall One of them clicked the amplifier on and then clicked it off again satisfied People round these parts act like he was the bloody emperor the custodian grumbled He is be is the third man said  Johnny thought he also recognized this fellow from the Trimbull rally Havent you got wise to that yet Pop Have you been upstairs Elliman asked the custodian and Johnny went cold Stairway doors locked the custodian answered Same as always I gave her a shake Johnny silently gave thanks for the spring lock on the door Ought to check it out Elliman said The custodian uttered an exasperated laugh I dont know about you guys he said Who are you expecting The Phantom of the Opera Come on Sonny the fellow Johnny thought he recognized said Theres nobody up there We just got time for a coffee if we shag ass down to that resrunt on the corner Thats not coffee Sonny said Fucking mud is all that is Just run upstairs first and make sure no ones there Moochie We go by the book Johnny licked his lips and clutched the gun He looked up and down the narrow gallery To his right it ended in a blank wall To his left it went back to the suite of offices and either way it made no difference If he moved they would hear him This empty the town hall served as a natural amplifier He was stuck There were footfalls down below Then the sound of the door between the hall and the entryway being opened and closed Johnny waited frozen and helpless Just below him the custodian and the other two were talking but he heard nothing they said His head had turned on his neck like some slow engine and he stared down the length of the gallery waiting for the fellow Sonny Elliman had called Moochie to appear at the end of it His bored expression would suddenly turn to shock and incredulity his mouth would open Hey Sonny theres a guy up here Now he could hear the muffled sound of Moochie climbing the stairs He tried to think of something anything Nothing came They were going to discover him it was less than a minute away now and he didnt have any idea of how to stop it from happening No matter what he did his one chance was on the verge of being blown Doors began to open and close the sound of each drawing closer and less muffled A drop of sweat spilled from Johnnys forehead and darkened the leg of his jeans He could remember each door he had come past on his way here Moochie had checked TOWN MANAGER and TOWN SELECTMEN and TAX ASSESSOR Now he was opening the door of MENS now he was glancing through the office that belonged to the OSEER OF THE POOR now the LADIES room The next door would be the one leading to the galleries It opened There was the sound of two footfalls as Moochie approached the railing of the short gallery that ran along the back of the hall Okay Sonny You satisfied Everything look good Looks like a fucking dump Moochie responded and there was a burst of laughter from below Well come on down and lets go for coffee the third man said And incredibly that was it The door slammed to The footsteps retreated back down the hall and then down the steps to the first floor Johnny went limp and for a moment everything swam away from him into shades of gray The slam of the entryway door as they went out for their coffee brought him partially out of it Below the custodian presented his judgment Bunch of whores Then he left too and for the next twenty minutes or so there was only Johnny  Around  O AM the people of Jackson began to file into their town hall The first to appear was a trio of old ladies dressed in formal black chattering together like magpies Johnny watched them pick seats close to the stove  almost entirely out of the field of his vision  and pick up the booklets that had been left on the seats The booklets appeared to be filled with glossy pictures of Greg Stillson I just love that man one of the three said Ive gotten his autograph three times and Ill get it again today Ill be bound That was all the talk there was about Greg Stillson The ladies went on to discuss the impending Old Home Sunday at the Methodist Church Johnny almost directly over the stove went from very cold to very hot He had taken advantage of the slack tide between the departure of Stillsons security people and the arrival of the first townfolk using it to shed both his jacket and his outer shirt He kept wiping sweat from his face with a handkerchief and the linen was streaked with blood as well as sweat His bad eye was kicking up again and his vision was constantly blurred and reddish The door below opened there was the hearty tromptromptromp of men stamping snow from their pacs and then four men in checked woolen jackets came down the aisle and sat in the front row One of them launched immediately into a Frenchman joke A young woman of about twentythree arrived with her son who looked about four The boy was wearing a blue snowmobile suit with bright yellow markings and he wanted to know if he could talk into the microphone No dear the woman said and they went down behind the men The boy immediately began to kick his feet against the bench in front of him and one of the men glanced back over his shoulder Sean stop that she said Quarter of ten now The door was opening and closing with a steady regularity Men and women of all types and occupations and ages were filling up the hall There was a drifting hum of conversation and it was edged with an indefinable sense of anticipation They werent here to quiz their dulyelected representative they were waiting for a bonafide star turn in their small community Johnny knew that most meetyourcandidate and meetyourrepresentative sessions were attended by a handful of diehards in the nearly empty meeting halls During the election of  a debate between Maines Bill Cohen and his challenger Leighton Cooney had attracted all of twentysix people press aside The skullsessions were so much windowdressing a selftestimonial to wave when election time came around again Most could have been held in a middlingsized closet But by  AM every seat in the town hall was taken and there were twenty or thirty standees at the back Every time the door opened Johnnys hands tensed down on the rifle And he was still not positive he could do it no matter what the stakes Five past ten past Johnny began to think Stillson had been held up or was perhaps not coming at all And the feeling which moved stealthily through him was one of relief Then the door opened again and a hearty voice called Hey How ya doin Jackson NH A startled pleased murmur Someone called ecstatically Greg How are you Well Im feeling perky Stillson came right back How the heck are you A spatter of applause quickly swelled to a roar of approval Hey all right Greg shouted over it He moved quickly down the aisle shaking hands toward the podium Johnny watched him through his loophole Stillson was wearing a heavy rawhide coat with a sheepskin collar and today the hard hat had been replaced with a woolen ski cap with a bright red tassel He paused at the head of the aisle and waved at the three or four press in attendance Flashbulbs popped and the applause got its second wind shaking the rafters And Johnny Smith suddenly knew it was now or never The feelings he had had about Greg Stillson at the Trimbull rally suddenly swept over him again with a certain and terrible clarity Inside his aching tortured head he seemed to hear a dull wooden sound two things coming together with a terrible force at one single moment It was perhaps the sound of destiny It would be too easy to delay to let Stillson talk and talk Too easy to let him get away to Sit up here with bis head in his hands waiting as the crowd thinned out waiting as the custodian returned to dismantle the sound system and sweep up the litter all the time kidding himself that there would be next week in another town The time was now indisputably now and every human being on earth suddenly had a stake in what happened in this backwater meetinghouse That thudding sound in his head like poles of destiny coming together Stillson was mounting the steps to the podium The area behind him was clear The three men in their open topcoats were lounging against the far wall Johnny stood up  Everything seemed to happen in slow motion There were cramps in his legs from sitting so long His knees popped like dud firecrackers Time seemed frozen the applause went on and on even though heads were turning necks were craning someone screamed through the applause and still it went on someone had screamed because there was a man in the gallery and the man was holding a rifle and this was something they had all seen on TV it was a situation with classic elements that they all recognized In its own way it was as American as The Wonderful World of Disney The politician and the man in a high place with the gun Greg Stillson turned toward him his thick neck craning wrinkling into creases The red puff on the top of his ski cap bobbed Johnny put the rifle to his shoulder It seemed to float up there and he felt the thud as it socketed home next to the joint there He thought of shooting partridge with his dad as a boy They had gone deerhunting but the only time Johnny had ever seen one he had not been able to pull the trigger the buck fever had gotten him It was a secret as shameful as masturbation and he had never told anyone There was another scream One of the old ladies was clutching her mouth and Johnny saw there was artificial fruit scattered along the wide brim of her black hat Faces turned up to him big white zeros Open mouths small black zeros The little boy in the snowmobile suit was pointing His mother was trying to shield him Stillson was in the gunsight suddenly and Johnny remembered to flick off the rifles safety Across the way the men in the topcoats were reaching inside their jackets and Sonny Elliman his green eyes blazing was hollering Down Greg get DOWN But Stillson stared up into the gallery and for the second time their eyes locked together in a perfect sort of understanding and Stillson only ducked at the same instant Johnny fired The rifles roar was loud filling the place and the slug took away nearly one whole corner of the podium peeling it back to the bare bright wood Splinters flew One of them struck the microphone and there was another monstrous whine of feedback that suddenly ended in a guttural lowkey buzzing Johnny pumped another cartridge into the chamber and fired again This time the slug punched a hole through the dusty carpeting of the dais The crowd had started to move panicky as cattle They all drove into the center aisle The people who had been standing at the rear escaped easily but then a bottleneck of cursing screaming men and women formed in the double doorway There were popping noises from the other side of the hall and suddenly part of the gallery railing splintered up in front of Johnnys eyes Something screamed past his ear a second later Then an invisible finger gave the collar of his shirt a flick All three of them across the way were holding handguns and because Johnny was up in the gallery their field of fire was crystal clear  but Johnny doubted if they would have bothered overmuch about innocent bystanders anyway One of the trio of old women grabbed Moochies arm She was sobbing trying to ask something He flung her away and steadied his gun in both hands There was a stink of gunpowder in the hall now It had been about twenty seconds since Johnny had stood up Down Down Greg Stillson was still standing at the edge of the dais crouching slightly looking up Johnny brought the rifle down and for an instant Stilison was deadbang in front sight Then a pistolslug grooved his neck knocking him backward and his own shot went wild into the air The window across the way dissolved in a tinkling rain of glass Thin screams drifted up from below Blood poured down and across his shoulder and chest Oh youre doing a great job of killing him he thought hysterically and pushed back to the railing again He levered another cartridge into the breech and threw it to his shoulder again Now Stilison was on the move He darted down the steps to floorevel and then glanced up at Johnny again Another bullet whizzed by his temple Im bleeding like a stuck pig he thought Come on Come on and get this over The bottleneck at the entryway broke and now people began to pour out A puff of smoke rose from the barrel of one of the pistols across the way there was a bang and the invisible finger that had flicked his collar a few seconds ago now drew a line of fire across the side of Johnnys head It didnt matter Nothing mattered except taking Stillson He brought the rifle down again Make this one count Stillson moved with good speed for such a big man The darkhaired young woman Johnny had noticed earlier was about halfway up the center aisle holding her crying son in her arms still trying to shield him with her body And what Stillson did then so dumbfounded Johnny that he almost dropped the rifle altogether He snatched the boy from his mothers arms whirled toward the gallery holding the boys body in front of him It was no longer Greg Stillson in the front sight but a small squirming figure in the filter blue filter yellow stripes tiger stripes a dark blue snowmobile suit with bright yellow piping Johnnys mouth dropped open It was Stillson all right The tiger But he was behind the filter now What does it mean Johnny screamed but no sound passed his lips The mother screamed shrilly then but Johnny had heard it all somewhere before Tommy Give him to me TOMMY GIVE HIM TO ME YOU BASTARD Johnnys head was swelling blackly expanding like a bladder Everything was starting to fade The only brightness left was centered around the notched gunsight the gunsight now laid directly over the chest of that blue snowmobile suit Do it oh for Christs sake you have to do it hell get away And now  perhaps it was only his blurring eyesight that made it seem so  the blue snowmobile suit began to spread its color washing out to the light robins egg color of the vision the dark yellow stretching striping until everything began to be lost in it behind the filter yes hes behind the filter but what does it mean does it mean its safe or just that hes beyond my reach what does it Warm fire flashed somewhere below and was gone Some dim part of Johnnys mind registered it as a flashbulb Stilison shoved the woman away and backed toward the door eyes squeezed into calculating pirates slits He held the squirming boy firmly by the neck and the crotch Cant Oh dear God forgive me I cant Two more bullets struck him then one high in the chest driving him back against the wall and bouncing him off it the second into the left side of his midsection spinning him around into the gallery railing He was dimly aware that he had lost the rifle It struck the gallery floor and discharged pointblank into the wall Then his upper thighs crashed into the ballustrade and he was falling The town hall turned over twice before his eyes and then there was a splintering crash as he struck two of the benches breaking his back and both legs He opened his mouth to scream but what came out was a great gush of blood He lay in the splintered remains of the benches he had struck and thought Its over I punked out Blew it Hands were on him not gentle They were turning him over Elliman Moochie and the other guy were there Elliman was the one who had turned him over Stillson came shoving Moochie aside Never mind this guy he said harshly Find the son of a bitch that took that picture Smash his camera Moochie and the other guy left Somewhere close by the woman with the dark hair was crying out behind a kid hiding behind a kid and Ill tell everybody Shut her up Sonny Stillson said Sure Sonny said and left Stillsons side Stillson got down on his knees above Johnny Do we know each other fella No sense lying Youve had the course Johnny whispered We knew each other It was that Trimbull rally wasnt it Johnny nodded Stillson got up abruptly and with the last bit of his strength Johnny reached out and grasped his ankle It was only for a second Stillson pulled free easily But it was long enough Everything had changed People were drawing near him now but he saw only feet and legs no faces It didnt matter Everything had changed He began to cry a little Touching Stillson this time had been like touching a blank Dead battery Fallen tree Empty house Bare bookshelves Wine bottles ready for candles Fading Going away The feet and legs around him were becoming misty and indistinct He heard their voices the excited gabble of speculation but not the words Only the sound of the words and even that was fading blurring into a high sweet humming sound He looked over his shoulder and there was the corridor he had emerged from so long ago He had come out of that corridor and into this bright placental place Only then his mother had been alive and his father had been there calling him by name until he broke through to them Now it was only time to go back Now it was right to go back I did it Somehow I did it I dont understand how but I have He let himself drift toward that corridor with the dark chrome walls not knowing if there might be something at the far end of it or not content to let time show him that The sweet hum of the voices faded The misty brightness faded But he was still he  Johnny Smith  intact Get into the corridor he thought All right He thought that if he could get into that corridor he would be able to walk PART THREE Notes from the Dead Zone  Dear Dad Portsmouth NH January  This is a terrible letter to have to write and I will try to keep it short When you get it I guess I will probably be dead An awful thing has happened to me and I think now that it may have started a long time before the car accident and the coma You know about the psychic business of course and you may remember Mom swearing on her deathbed that God had meant for it to be this way that God had something for me to do She asked me not to run from it and I promised her that I wouldnt  not meaning it seriously but wanting her mind to be easy Now it looks as if she was right in a funny sort of way I still dont really believe in God not in a real Being who plans for us and gives us all little jobs to do like Boy Scouts winning merit badges on The Great Hike of Life But neither do I believe that all the things that have happened to me are blind chance In the summer of  Dad I went to a Greg Stillson rally in Trim bull which is in New Hampshires third district He was running for the first time then you may recall When he was on his way to the speakers rostrum he shook a lot of hands and one of them was mine This is the part you may find hard to believe even though you have seen the ability in action l had one of my flashes only this one was no flash Dad It was a vision either in the biblical sense or in something very near it Oddly enough it wasnt as clear as some of my other insights have been  there was a Puzzling blue glow over everything that has never been there before  but it was incredibly powerful I saw Greg Stillson as president of the United States How far in the future I cant say except that he had lost most of his hair I would say fourteen years or perhaps eighteen at the most Now my ability is to see and not to interpret and in this case my ability to see was impeded by that funny blue filter but l saw enough If Stillson becomes president hes going to worsen an international situation that is going to be pretty awful to begin with If Stillson becomes president he is going to end up precipitating a fullscale nuclear war I believe that the initial flash point for this war is going to be in South Africa And I also believe that in the short bloody course of this war its not going to be just two or three nations throwing warheads but maybe as many as twenty  plus terrorist groups Daddy I know how crazy this must look It looks crazy to me But I have no doubts no urge to look back over my shoulder and try to secondguess this thing into something less real and urgent than it is You never knew no one did  but l didnt run away from the Chatsworths because of that restaurant fire I guess I was running away from Greg Stillson and the thing I am supposed to do Like Elijah hiding in his cave or Jonah who ended up in the fishs belly I thought I would just wait and see you know Wait and see if the preconditions for such a horrible future began to come into place I would probably be waiting still but in the fall of last year the headaches began to get worse and there was an incident on the roadcrew I was working with l guess Keith Strang the foreman would remember that  Excerpt from testimony given before the socalled Stillson Committee chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine The questioner is Mr Norman D Verizer the Committees Chief Counsel The witness is Mr Keith Strang of  Desert Boulevard Phoenix Arizona Date of testimony August   Verizer And at this time John Smith was in the employ of the Phoenix Public Works Department was he not Strang Yes Sir he was V This was early December of  S Yes Sir V And did something happen on December  that you particularly remember Something concerning John Smith S Yes Sir It sure did V Tell the Committee about that if you would S Well I had to go back to the central motor pool to get two fortygallon drums of orange paint We were lining roads you understand Johnny  thats Johnny Smith was out on Rosemont Avenue on the day youre talking about putting down new lane markings Well I got back out there at approximately fourfifteen  about fortyfive minutes before knockingoff time  and this fellow Herman Joellyn that youve already talked to he comes up to me and says You better check on Johnny Keith Somethings wrong with Johnny I tried to talk to him and he acted like he didnt hear He almost run me down You better get him straight Thats what he said So I said Whats wrong with him Hermie And Hermie says Check it out for yourself theres something offwhack with that dude So I drove on up the road and at first everything was all right and then  wow V What did you see S Before I saw Johnny you mean V Yes thats right S The line he was putting down started to go haywire Just a little bit at first  a jig here and there a little bubble  it wasnt perfectly straight you know And Johnny had always been the best liner on the whole crew Then it started to get really bad It started to go all over the road in these big loops and swirls Some places it was like hed gone right round in circles a few times For about a hundred yards hed put the stripe right along the dirt shoulder V What did you do S I stopped him That is eventually I stopped him I pulled up right beside the lining machine and started yelling at him Must have yelled half a dozen times It was like he didnt hear Then he swooped that thing toward me and put a helluva ding in the side of the car I was driving Highway Department Property too So I laid on the horn and yelled at him again and that seemed to get through to him He threw it in neutral and looked over at me I asked him what in the name of God he thought he was doing V And what was his response S He said hi That was all Hi Keith Like everything was hunkydory V And your response was S My response was pretty blue I was mad And Johnny is just standing there looking all around and holding onto the side of the liner like he would fall down if he let go That was when I realized how sick he looked He was always thin you know but now he looked as white as paper and the side of his mouth was kind of you know drawn down At first he didnt even seem to get what I was saying Then he looked around and saw the way that line was  all over the road V And he said S Said he was sorry Then he kind of  I dont know staggered and put one hand up to his face So I asked him what was wrong with him and he said oh a lot of confused stuff It didnt mean anything Cohen Mr Strang the Committee is particularly interested in anything Mr Smith said that might cast a light on this matter Can you remember what he said S Well at first he said there was nothing wrong except that it smelled like rubber tires Tires on fire Then he said That battery will explode if you try to jump it And something like I got potatoes in the chest and both radios are in the sun So its all out for the trees Thats the best I can remember Like I say it was all confused and crazy V What happened then S He started to fall down So I grabbed him by the shoulder and his hand  he had been holding it against the side of his face  it came away And I saw his right eye was full of blood Then he passed out V But he said one more thing before he passed out did he not S Yes Sir he did V And what was that S He said Well worry about Stillson later Daddy hes in the dead zone now V Are you sure thats what he said S Yes Sir I am Ill never forget it   and when I woke up I was in the small equipment shed at the base of Rosemont Drive Keith said Id better get to see a doctor right away and I wasnt to come back to work until I did I was scared Dad but not for the reasons Keith thought I guess Anyway I made an appointment to see a neurologist that Sam Weizak had mentioned to me in a letter he wrote in early November You see I had written to Sam telling him that I was afraid to drive a car because I was having some incidents of double vision Sam wrote back right away and told me to go see this Dr Vann  said he considered the symptoms very alarming but wouldnt presume to diagnose longdistance I didnt go right away I guess your mind can screw you over pretty well and l kept thinking right up to the incident with the roadlining machine  that it was just a phase I was going through and that it would get better I guess I just didnt want to think about the alternative But the roadlining incident was too much I went because I was getting scared  not just for myself because of what I knew So I went to see this Dr Vann and he gave me the tests and then he laid it out for me It turned out I didnt have as much time as I thought because  Excerpt from testimony given before the socalled Stillson Committee chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine The questioner is Mr Norman D Verizer the Committees Chief Counsel The witness is Dr Quentin M Vann of  Parkland Drive Phoenix Arizona Date of testimony August   Verizer After your tests were complete and your diagnosis was complete you saw John Smith in your office didnt you Vann Yes It was a difficult meeting Such meetings are always difficult Ve Can you give us the substance of what passed between you Va Yes Under these unusual circumstances I believe that the doctorpatient relationship may be waived I began by pointing out to Smith that he had had a terribly frightening experience He agreed His right eye was still extremely bloodshot but it was better He had ruptured a small capillary If I may refer to the chart Material deleted and condensed at this point Ve And after making this explanation to Smith Va He asked me for the bottom line That was his phrase the bottom line In a quiet way he impressed me with his calmness and his courage Ve And the bottom line was what Dr Vann Va Ah I thought that would be clear by now John Smith had an extremely welldeveloped brain tumor in the parietal lobe Disorder among spectators short recess Ve Doctor Im sorry about this interruption Id like to remind the spectators that this Committee is in session and that it is an investigatory body not a freakshow Ill have order or Ill have the SergeantatArms clear the room Va That is quite all right Mr Verizer Ve Thank you Doctor Can you tell the Committee how Smith took the news Va He was calm Extraordinarily calm I believe that in his heart he had formed his own diagnosis and that his and mine happened to coincide He said that he was badly scared however And he asked me how long he had to live Ve What did you tell him Va I said that at that point such a question was meaningless because our options were all still open I told him he would need an operation I should point out that at this time I had no knowledge of his coma and his extraordinary  almost miraculous  recovery Ve And what was his response Va He said there would be no operation He was quiet but very very firm No operation I said that I hoped he would reconsider because to turn such an operation down would be to sign his own deathwarrant Ve Did Smith make any response to this Va He asked me to give him my best opinion on how long he could live without such an operation Ve Did you give him your opinion Va I gave him a ballpark estimate yes I told him that tumors have extremely erratic growth patterns and that I had known patients whose tumors had fallen dormant for as long as two years but that such a dormancy was quite rare I told him that without an operation he might reasonably expect to live from eight to twenty months Ve But he still declined the operation is that right Va Yes that is so Ve Did something unusual happen as Smith was leaving Va I would say it was extremely unusual Ve Tell the Committee about that if you would Va I touched his shoulder meaning to restrain him I suppose I was unwilling to see the man leave under those circumstances you understand And I felt something coming from him when I did  it was a sensation like an electric shock but it was also an oddly draining debilitating sensation As if he were drawing something from me I will grant you that this is an extremely subjective description but it comes from a man trained in the art and craft of professional observation It was not pleasant I assure you I drew away from him and he suggested I call my wife because Strawberry had hurt himself seriously Ve Strawberry Va Yes thats what he said My wifes brother  his name is Stanbury Richards My youngest son always called him Uncle Strawberry when he was very small That association didnt occur until later by the way That evening I suggested to my wife that she call her brother who lives in the town of Goose Lake New York Ve Did she call him Va Yes she did They had a very nice chat Ve And was Mr Richards  your brotherinlaw  was he all right Va Yes he was fine But the following week he fell from a ladder while painting his house and broke his back Ve Dr Vann do you believe John Smith saw that happen Do you believe that he had a precognitive vision concerning your wifes brother Va I dont know But I believe that it may have been so Ve Thank you Dr Va May I say one more thing Ve Of course Va If he did have such a curse  yes I would call it a curse  I hope God will show pity to that mans tortured soul  and I know Dad that people are going to say that I did what I am planning to do because of the tumor but Daddy dont believe them It isnt true The tumor is only the accident finally catching up with me the accident which I now believe never stopped happening The tumor lies in the same area that was injured in the crash the same area that I now believe was probably bruised when I was a child and took a fall one day while skating on Runaround Pond That was when I had the first of my flashes although even now I cannot remember exactly what it was And I had another just before the accident at the Esty Fair Ask Sarah about that one Im sure she remembers The tumor lies in that area which I always called the dead zone And that turned out to be right didnt it All too bitterly right God  destiny providence fate whatever you want to call it seems to be reaching out with its steady and unarguable hand to put the scales back in balance again Perhaps l was meant to die in that carcrash or even earlier that day on the Runaround And I believe that when Ive finished what I have to finish the scales will come completely back into balance again Daddy I love you The worst thing next to the belief that the gun is the only way out of this terrible deadlock I find myself in is knowing that Ill be leaving you behind to bear the grief and hate of those who have no reason to believe Stillson is anything but a good and just man  Excerpt from testimony given before the socalled Stillson Committee chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine The questioner is Mr Albert Renfrew the Committees Deputy Counsel The witness is Dr Samuel Weizak of  Harlow Court Bangor Maine Date of testimony August   Renfrew We are now approaching the hour of adjournment Dr Weizak and on behalf of the Committee I would like to thank you for the last four long hours of testimony You have offered a great deal of light on the situation Weizak That is quite all right R I have one final question for you Dr Weizak one which seems to me to be of nearly ultimate importance it speaks to an issue which John Smith himself raised in the letter to his father which has been entered into evidence That question is W No R I beg your pardon W You are preparing to ask me if Johnnys tumor pulled the trigger that day in New Hampshire are you not R In a manner of speaking I suppose W The answer is no Johnny Smith was a thinking reasoning human being until the end of his life The letter to his father shows this his letter to Sarah Hazlett also shows this He was a man with a terrible Godlike power perhaps a curse as my colleague Dr Vann has called it  but he was neither unhinged nor acting upon fantasies caused by cranial pressure  if such a thing is even possible R But isnt it true that Charles Witman the socalled Texas Tower Sniper had W Yes yes he had a tumor So did the pilot of the Eastern Airlines airplane that crashed in Florida some years ago And it has never been suggested that the tumor was a precipitating cause in either case I would point out to you that other infamous creatures Richard Speck the socalled Son of Sam and Adolf Hitler  needed no brain tumors to cause them to act in a homicidal manner Or Frank Dodd the murderer Johnny himself uncovered in the town of Castle Rock However misguided this Committee may find Johnnys act to have been it was the act of a man who was sane In great mental agony perhaps  but sane   and most of all dont believe that I did this without the longest and most agonizing reflection If by killing him I could be sure that the human race was gaining another four years another two even another eight months in which to think it over it would be worth it Its wrong but it may turn out right I dont know But I wont play Hamlet any longer I know how dangerous Stillson is Daddy I love you very much Believe it Your Son Johnny  Excerpt from testimony given before the socalled Stillson Committee chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine The questioner is Mr Albert Renfrew the Committees Deputy Counsel The witness is Mr Stuart Clawson of the Blackstrap Road in Jackson New Hampshire Renfrew And you say you just happened to grab your camera Mr Clawson Clawson Yeah Just as I went out the door I almost didnt even go that day even though I like Greg Stillson  well I did like him before all of this anyway The town hall just seemed like a bummer to me you know R Because of your drivers exam C You got it Flunking that permit test was one colossal bummer But at the end I said what the hell And I got the picture Wow I got it That pictures going to make me rich I guess Just like the flagraising on Iwo Jima R I hope you dont get the idea that the entire thing was staged for your benefit young man C Oh no Not at all I only meant well  I dont know what I meant But it happened right in front of me and  I dont know Jeez I was just glad I had my Nikon thats all R You just snapped the photo when Stillson picked up the child C Matt Robeson yessir R And this is a blowup of that photo C Thats my picture yes R And after you took it what happened C Two of those goons ran after me They were yelling Give us the camera kid Drop it Shi  uh stuff like that R And you ran C Did I run Holy God I guess I ran They chased me almost all the way to the town garage One of them almost had me but he slipped on the ice and fell down Cohen Young man Id like to suggest that you won the most important footrace of your life when you outran those two thugs C Thank you Sir What Stillson did that day maybe you had to be there but  holding a little kid in front of you thats pretty low I bet the people in New Hampshire wouldnt vote for that guy for dogcatcher Not for R Thank you Mr Clawson The witness is excused  October again Sarah had avoided this trip for a very long time but now the time had come and it could be put off no longer She felt that She had left both children with Mrs Ablanap  they had househelp now and two cars instead of the little red Pinto Walts income was scraping near thirty thousand dollars a year  and had come by herself to Pownal through the burning blaze of late autumn Now she pulled over on the shoulder of a pretty little country road got out and crossed to the small cemetery on the other side A small tarnished plaque on one of the stone posts announced that this was THE BIRCHES It was enclosed by a rambling rock wall and the grounds were neatly kept A few faded flags remained from Memorial Day five months ago Soon they would be buried under snow She walked slowly not hurrying the breeze catching the hem of her dark green skirt and fluttering it Here were generations of BOWDENS here was a whole family of MARSTENS here grouped around a large marble memorial were PILLSBURYS going back to  And near the rear wall she found a relatively new stone which read simply JOHN SMITH Sarah knelt beside it hesitated touched it She let her fingertips skate thoughtfully over its polished surface  Dear Sarah January   Ive just written my father a very important letter and it took me nearly an hour and a half to work my way through it I just dont have the energy to repeat the effort so I am going to suggest that you call him as soon as you receive this Go do it now Sarah before you read the rest of this So now in all probability you know I just wanted to tell you that Ive been thinking a lot about our date at the Esty Fair just recently If I had to guess the two things that you remember most about it Id guess the run of luck I had on the Wheel of Fortune remember the kid who kept saying I love to see this guy take a beatin and the mask I wore to fool you That was supposed to be a big joke but you got mad and our date damn near went right down the drain Maybe if it had l wouldnt be here now and that taxi driver would still be alive On the other hand maybe nothing at all of importance changes in the future and I would have been handed the same bullet to eat a week or a month or a year later Well we had our chance and it came up on one of the house numbers  double zero I guess But I wanted you to know that I think of you Sarah For me there really hasnt been anyone else and that night was the best night for us  Hello Johnny she murmured and the wind walked softly through the trees that burned and blazed a red leaf flipped its way across the bright blue sky and landed unnoticed in her hair Im here I finally came Speaking out loud should have also seemed wrong speaking to the dead in a graveyard was the act of a crazy person she would have said once But now emotion surprised her emotion of such force and intensity that it caused her throat to ache and her hands to suddenly clap shut It was all right to speak to him maybe after all it had been nine years and this was the end of it After this there would be Walt and the children and lots of smiles from one of the chairs behind her husbands speaking podium the endless smiles from the background and an occasional feature article in the Sunday supplements if Walts political career skyrocketed as he so calmly expected it to do The future was a little more gray in her hair each year never going braless because of the sag becoming more careful about makeup the future was exercise classes at the YWCA in Bangor and shopping and taking Denny to the first grade and Janis to nursery school the future was New Years Eve parties and funny hats as her life rolled into the sciencefictiony decade of the s and also into a queer and almost unsuspected state  middle age She saw no county fairs in her future The first slow scalding tears began to come Oh Johnny she said Everything was supposed to be different wasnt it It wasnt supposed to end like this She lowered her head her throat working painfully and to no effect The sobs came anyway and the bright sunlight broke into prisms of light The wind which had seemed so warm and Indian summery now seemed as chill as February on her wet cheeks Not fair she cried into the silence of BOWDENS and MARSTENS and PILLSBURYS that dead congregation of listeners who testified to nothing more or less than life is quick and dead is dead Oh God not fair And that was when the hand touched her neck   and that night was the best night for us although there are still times when its hard for me to believe there ever was such a year as  and upheaval on the campuses and Nixon was president no pocket calculators no home video tape recorders no Bruce Springsteen or punkrock bands either And at other times it seems like that time is only a handsbreadth away that I can almost touch it that if I could put my arms around you or touch your cheek or the back of your neck I could carry you away with me into a different future with no pain or darkness or bitter choices Well we all do what we can and it has to be good enough  and if it isnt good enough it has to do I only hope that you will think of me as well as you can dear Sarah All my best and all my love Johnny  She drew her breath in raggedly her back straightening her eyes going wide and round Johnny It was gone Whatever it had been it was gone She stood and turned around and of course there was nothing there But she could see him standing there his hands jammed deep into his pockets that easy crooked grin on his pleasantratherthanhandsome face leaning lanky and at ease against a monument or one of the stone gateposts or maybe just a tree gone red with falls dying fire No big deal Sarah  you still sniffin that wicked cocaine Nothing there but Johnny somewhere near maybe everywhere We all do what we can and it has to be good enough  and if it isnt good enough it has to do Nothing is ever lost Sarah Nothing that cant be found Same old Johnny she whispered and walked out of the cemetery and crossed the road She paused for a moment looking back The warm October wind gusted strongly and great shades of light and shadow seemed to pass across the world The trees rustled secretly Sarah got in her car and drove away
