To Don Grant whos taken a chance on these novels one by one The Drawing of the Three is the second volume of a long tale called The Dark Tower a tale inspired by and to some degree dependent upon Robert Brownings narrative poem Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came which in its turn owes a debt to King Lear The first volume The Gunslinger tells how Roland the last gunslinger of a world which has moved on finally catches up with the man in black a sorcerer he has chased for a very long timeDjust how long we do not yet know The man in black turns out to be a fellow named Walter who falsely claimed the friendship of Rolands father in those days before the world moved on Rolands goal is not this halfhuman creature but the Dark Tower  the man in blackDand more specifically what the man in black knowsD is his first step on his road to that mysterious place Who exactly is Roland What was his world like before it moved on What is the Tower and why does he pursue it We have only fragmentary answers Roland is a gunslinger a kind of knight one of those charged with holding a world Roland remembers as being filled with love and light as it is to keep it from moving on We know that Roland was forced to an early trial of manhood after discovering that his mother had become the mistress of Marten a much greater sorcerer than Walter who unknown to Rolands father is Martens ally we know Marten has planned Rolands discovery expecting Roland to fail and to be sent West we know that Roland triumphs in his test What else do we know That the gunslingers world is not completely unlike our own Artifacts such as gasoline pumps and certain songs Hey Jude for instance or the bit of doggerel that begins Beans beans the musical fruit  have survived so have customs and rituals oddly like those from our own romanticized view of the American west And there is an umbilicus which somehow connects our world to the world of the gunslinger At a waystation on a longdeserted coachroad in a great and sterile desert Roland meets a boy named Jake who died in our world A boy who was in fact pushed from a streetcorner by the ubiquitous and iniquitous man in black The last thing Jake who was on his way to school with his bookbag in one hand and his lunchbox in the other remembers of his worldDour worldDis being crushed beneath the wheels of a Cadillac  and dying Before reaching the man in black Jake dies again this time because the gunslinger faced with the secondmost agonizing choice of his life elects to sacrifice this symbolic son Given a choice between the Tower and child possibly between damnation and salvation Roland chooses the Tower Go then Jake tells him before plunging into the abyss There are other worlds than these The final confrontation between Roland and Walter occurs in a dusty golgotha of decaying bones The dark man tells Rolands future with a deck of Tarot cards These cards showing a man called The Prisoner a woman called The Lady of Shadows and a darker shape that is simply Death but not for you gunslinger the man in black tells him are prophecies which become the subject of this volume  and Rolands second step on the long and difficult path to the Dark Tower The Gunslinger ends with Roland sitting upon the beach of the Western Sea  watching the sunset The man in black is dead the gunslingers own future course unclear The Drawing of the Three begins on that same beach less than seven hours later The gunslinger came awake from a confused dream which seemed to consist of a single image that of the Sailor in the Tarot deck from which the man in black had dealt or purported to deal the gunslingers own moaning future He drowns gunslinger the man in black was saying and no one throws out the line The boy Jake But this was no nightmare It was a good dream It was good because he was the one drowning and that meant he was not Roland at all but Jake and he found this a relief because it would be far better to drown as Jake than to live as himself a man who had for a cold dream betrayed a child who had trusted him Good all right Ill drown he thought listening to the roar of the sea Let me drown But this was not the sound of the open deeps it was the grating sound of water with a throatful of stones Was he the Sailor If so why was land so close And in fact was he not on the land It felt as ifD Freezing cold water doused his boots and ran up his legs to his crotch His eyes flew open then and what snapped him out of the dream wasnt his freezing balls which had suddenly shrunk to what felt like the size of walnuts nor even the horror to his right but the thought of his guns his guns and even more important his shells Wet guns could be quickly disassembled wiped dry oiled wiped dry again oiled again and reassembled wet shells like wet matches might or might not ever be usable again The horror was a crawling thing which must have been cast up by a previous wave It dragged a wet gleaming body laboriously along the sand It was about four feet long and about four yards to the right It regarded Roland with bleak eyes on stalks Its long serrated beak dropped open and it began to make a noise that was weirdly like human speech plaintive even desperate questions in an alien tongue Didachick Dumachum Dadacham Dedacheck The gunslinger had seen lobsters This wasnt one although lobsters were the only things he had ever seen which this creature even vaguely resembled It didnt seem afraid of him at all The gunslinger didnt know if it was dangerous or not He didnt care about his own mental confusionDhis temporary inability to remember where he was or how he had gotten there if he had actually caught the man in black or if all that had only been a dream He only knew he had to get away from the water before it could drown his shells He heard the grinding swelling roar of water and looked from the creature it had stopped and was holding up the claws with which it had been pulling itself along looking absurdly like a boxer assuming his opening stance which Cort had taught them was called The Honor Stance to the incoming breaker with its curdle of foam It hears the wave the gunslinger thought Whatever it is its got ears He tried to get up but his legs too numb to feel buckled under him Im still dreaming he thought but even in his current confused state this was a belief much too tempting to really be believed He tried to get up again almost made it then fell back The wave was breaking There was no time again He had to settle for moving in much the same way the creature on his right seemed to move he dug in with both hands and dragged his butt up the stony shingle away from the wave He didnt progress enough to avoid the wave entirely but he got far enough for his purposes The wave buried nothing but his boots It reached almost to his knees and then retreated Perhaps the first one didnt go as far as I thought PerhapsD There was a halfmoon in the sky A caul of mist covered it but it shed enough light for him to see that the holsters were too dark The guns at least had suffered a wetting It was impossible to tell how bad it had been or if either the shells currently in the cylinders or those in the crossed gunbelts had also been wetted Before checking he had to get away from the water Had toD Dodachock This was much closer In his worry over the water he had forgotten the creature the water had cast up He looked around and saw it was now only four feet away Its claws were buried in the stone  and shelllittered sand of the shingle pulling its body along It lifted its meaty serrated body making it momentarily resemble a scorpion but Roland could see no stinger at the end of its body Another grinding roar this one much louder The creature immediately stopped and raised its claws into its own peculiar version of the Honor Stance again This wave was bigger Roland began to drag himself up the slope of the strand again and when he put out his hands the clawed creature moved with a speed of which its previous movements had not even hinted The gunslinger felt a bright flare of pain in his right hand but there was no time to think about that now He pushed with the heels of his soggy boots clawed with his hands and managed to get away from the wave Didachick the monstrosity enquired in its plaintive Wont you help me Cant you see I am desperate voice and Roland saw the stumps of the first and second fingers of his right hand disappearing into the creatures jagged beak It lunged again and Roland lifted his dripping right hand just in time to save his remaining two fingers Dumachum Dadacham The gunslinger staggered to his feet The thing tore open his dripping jeans tore through a boot whose old leather was soft but as tough as iron and took a chunk of meat from Rolands lower calf He drew with his right hand and realized two of the fingers needed to perform this ancient killing operation were gone only when the revolver thumped to the sand The monstrosity snapped at it greedily No bastard Roland snarled and kicked it It was like kicking a block of rock  one that bit It tore away the end of Rolands right boot tore away most of his great toe tore the boot itself from his foot The gunslinger bent picked up his revolver dropped it cursed and finally managed What had once been a thing so easy it didnt even bear thinking about had suddenly become a trick akin to juggling The creature was crouched on the gunslingers boot tearing at it as it asked its garbled questions A wave rolled toward the beach the foam which curdled its top looking pallid and dead in the netted light of the halfmoon The lobstrosity stopped working on the boot and raised its claws in that boxers pose Roland drew with his left hand and pulled the trigger three times Click click click Now he knew about the shells in the chambers at least He holstered the left gun To holster the right he had to turn its barrel downward with his left hand and then let it drop into its place Blood slimed the worn ironwood handgrips blood spotted the holster and the old jeans to which the holster was thongtied It poured from the stumps where his fingers used to be His mangled right foot was still too numb to hurt but his right hand was a bellowing fire The ghosts of talented and longtrained fingers which were already decomposing in the digestive juices of that things guts screamed that they were still there that they were burning Isee serious problems ahead the gunslinger thought remotely The wave retreated The monstrosity lowered its claws tore a fresh hole in the gunslingers boot and then decided the wearer had been a good deal more tasty than this bit of skin it had somehow sloughed off Dudachum it asked and scurried toward him with ghastly speed The gunslinger retreated on legs he could barely feel realizing that the creature must have some intelligence it had approached him cautiously perhaps from a long way down the strand not sure what he was or of what he might be capable If the dousing wave hadnt wakened him the thing would have torn off his face while he was still deep in his dream Now it had decided he was not only tasty but vulnerable easy prey It was almost upon him a thing four feet long and a foot high a creature which might weigh as much as seventy pounds and which was as singlemindedly carnivorous as David the hawk he had had as a boyDbut without Davids dim vestige of loyalty The gunslingers left bootheel struck a rock jutting from the sand and he tottered on the edge of falling Dodachock the thing asked solicitously it seemed and peered at the gunslinger from its stalky waving eyes as its claws reached  and then a wave came and the claws went up again in the Honor Stance Yet now they wavered the slightest bit and the gunslinger realized that it responded to the sound of the wave and now the sound wasDfor it at leastDfading a bit He stepped backward over the rock then bent down as the wave broke upon the shingle with its grinding roar His head was inches from the insectile face of the creature One of its claws might easily have slashed the eyes from his face but its trembling claws so like clenched fists remained raised to either side of its parrotlike beak The gunslinger reached for the stone over which he had nearly fallen It was large halfburied in the sand and his mutilated right hand howled as bits of dirt and sharp edges of pebble ground into the open bleeding flesh but he yanked the rock free and raised it his lips pulled away from his teeth DadaD the monstrosity began its claws lowering and opening as the wave broke and its sound receded and the gunslinger swept the rock down upon it with all his strength There was a crunching noise as the creatures segmented back broke It lashed wildly beneath the rock its rear half lifting and thudding lifting and thudding Its interrogatives became buzzing exclamations of pain Its claws opened and shut upon nothing Its maw of a beak gnashed up clots of sand and pebbles And yet as another wave broke it tried to raise its claws again and when it did the gunslinger stepped on its head with his remaining boot There was a sound like many small dry twigs being broken Thick fluid burst from beneath the heel of Rolands boot splashing in two directions It looked black The thing arched and wriggled in a frenzy The gunslinger planted his boot harder A wave came The monstrositys claws rose an inch  two inches  trembled and then fell twitching open and shut The gunslinger removed his boot The things serrated beak which had separated two fingers and one toe from his living body slowly opened and closed One antenna lay broken on the sand The other trembled meaninglessly The gunslinger stamped down again And again He kicked the rock aside with a grunt of effort and marched along the right side of the monstrositys body stamping methodically with his left boot smashing its shell squeezing its pale guts out onto dark gray sand It was dead but he meant to have his way with it all the same he had never in all his long strange time been so fundamentally hurt and it had all been so unexpected He kept on until he saw the tip of one of his own fingers in the dead things sour mash saw the white dust beneath the nail from the golgotha where he and the man in black had held their long palaver and then he looked aside and vomited The gunslinger walked back toward the water like a drunken man holding his wounded hand against his shirt looking back from time to time to make sure the thing wasnt still alive like some tenacious wasp you swat again and again and still twitches stunned but not dead to make sure it wasnt following asking its alien questions in its deadly despairing voice Halfway down the shingle he stood swaying looking at the place where he had been remembering He had fallen asleep apparently just below the high tide line He grabbed his purse and his torn boot In the moons glabrous light he saw other creatures of the same type and in the caesura between one wave and the next heard their questioning voices The gunslinger retreated a step at a time retreated until he reached the grassy edge of the shingle There he sat down and did all he knew to do he sprinkled the stumps of fingers and toe with the last of his tobacco to stop the bleeding sprinkled it thick in spite of the new stinging his missing great toe had joined the chorus and then he only sat sweating in the chill wondering about infection wondering how he would make his way in this world with two fingers on his right hand gone when it came to the guns both hands had been equal but in all other things his right had ruled wondering if the thing had some poison in its bite which might already be working its way into him wondering if morning would ever come PRISONER Three This is the number of your fate Three Yes three is mystic Three stands at the heart of the mantra Which three The first is darkhaired He stands on the brink of robbery and murder A demon has infested him The name of the demon is HEROIN Which demon is that I know it not even from nursery stories He tried to speak but his voice was gone the voice of the oracle StarSlut Whore of the Winds both were gone he saw a card fluttering down from nowhere to nowhere turning and turning in the lazy dark On it a baboon grinned from over the shoulder of a young man with dark hair its disturbingly human fingers were buried so deeply in the young mans neck that their tips had disappeared in flesh Looking more closely the gunslinger saw the baboon held a whip in one of those clutching strangling hands The face of the ridden man seemed to writhe in wordless terror The Prisoner the man in black who had once been a man the gunslinger trusted a man named Walter whispered chummily A trifle upsetting isnt he A trifle upsettinga trifle upsettinga trifleD  The gunslinger snapped awake waving at something with his mutilated hand sure that in a moment one of the monstrous shelled things from the Western Sea would drop on him desperately enquiring in its foreign tongue as it pulled his face off his skull Instead a seabird attracted by the glister of the morning sun on the buttons of his shirt wheeled away with a frightened squawk Roland sat up His hand throbbed wretchedly endlessly His right foot did the same Both fingers and toe continued to insist they were there The bottom half of his shirt was gone what was left resembled a ragged vest He had used one piece to bind his hand the other to bind his foot Go away he told the absent parts of his body You are ghosts now Go away It helped a little Not much but a little They were ghosts all right but lively ghosts The gunslinger ate jerky His mouth wanted it little his stomach less but he insisted When it was inside him he felt a little stronger There was not much left though he was nearly up against it Yet things needed to be done He rose unsteadily to his feet and looked about Birds swooped and dived but the world seemed to belong to only him and them The monstrosities were gone Perhaps they were nocturnal perhaps tidal At the moment it seemed to make no difference The sea was enormous meeting the horizon at a misty blue point that was impossible to determine For a long moment the gunslinger forgot his agony in its contemplation He had never seen such a body of water Had heard of it in childrens stories of course had even been assured by his teachersDsome at leastDthat it existedDbut to actually see it this immensity this amazement of water after years of arid land was difficult to accept  difficult to even see He looked at it for a long time enrapt making himself see it temporarily forgetting his pain in wonder But it was morning and there were still things to be done He felt for the jawbone in his back pocket careful to lead with the palm of his right hand not wanting the stubs of his fingers to encounter it if it was still there changing that hands ceaseless sobbing to screams It was All right Next He clumsily unbuckled his gunbelts and laid them on a sunny rock He removed the guns swung the chambers out and removed the useless shells He threw them away A bird settled on the bright gleam tossed back by one of them picked it up in its beak then dropped it and flew away The guns themselves must be tended to should have been tended to before this but since no gun in this world or any other was more than a club without ammunition he laid the gunbelts themselves over his lap before doing anything else and carefully ran his left hand over the leather Each of them was damp from buckle and clasp to the point where the belts would cross his hips from that point they seemed dry He carefully removed each shell from the dry portions of the belts His right hand kept trying to do this job insisted on forgetting its reduction in spite of the pain and he found himself returning it to his knee again and again like a dog too stupid or fractious to heel In his distracted pain he came close to swatting it once or twice I see serious problems ahead he thought again He put these shells hopefully still good in a pile that was dishearteningly small Twenty Of those a few would almost certainly misfire He could depend on none of them He removed the rest and put them in another pile Thirtyseven Well you werent heavy loaded anyway he thought but he recognized the difference between fiftyseven live rounds and what might be twenty Or ten Or five Or one Or none He put the dubious shells in a second pile He still had his purse That was one thing He put it in his lap and then slowly disassembled his guns and performed the ritual of cleaning By the time he was finished two hours had passed and his pain was so intense his head reeled with it conscious thought had become difficult He wanted to sleep He had never wanted that more in his life But in the service of duty there was never any acceptable reason for denial Cort he said in a voice that he couldnt recognize and laughed dryly Slowly slowly he reassembled his revolvers and loaded them with the shells he presumed to be dry When the job was done he held the one made for his left hand cocked it  and then slowly lowered the hammer again He wanted to know yes Wanted to know if there would be a satisfying report when he squeezed the trigger or only another of those useless clicks But a click would mean nothing and a report would only reduce twenty to nineteen  or nine  or three  or none He tore away another piece of his shirt put the other shellsDthe ones which had been wettedDin it and tied it using his left hand and his teeth He put them in his purse Sleep his body demanded Sleep you must sleep now before dark theres nothing left youre used upD He tottered to his feet and looked up and down the deserted strand It was the color of an undergarment which has gone a long time without washing littered with seashells which had no color Here and there large rocks protruded from the grossgrained sand and these were covered with guano the older layers the yellow of ancient teeth the fresher splotches white The hightide line was marked with drying kelp He could see pieces of his right boot and his waterskins lying near that line He thought it almost a miracle that the skins hadnt been washed out to sea by highsurging waves Walking slowly limping exquisitely the gunslinger made his way to where they were He picked up one of them and shook it by his ear The other was empty This one still had a little water left in it Most would not have been able to tell the difference between the two but the gunslinger knew each just as well as a mother knows which of her identical twins is which He had been travelling with these waterskins for a long long time Water sloshed inside That was goodDa gift Either the creature which had attacked him or any of the others could have torn this or the other open with one casual bite or slice of claw but none had and the tide had spared it Of the creature itself there was no sign although the two of them had finished far above the tideline Perhaps other predators had taken it perhaps its own kind had given it a burial at sea as the elaphaunts giant creatures of whom he had heard in childhood stories were reputed to bury their own dead He lifted the waterskin with his left elbow drank deeply and felt some strength come back into him The right boot was of course ruined  but then he felt a spark of hope The foot itself was intactDscarred but intactDand it might be possible to cut the other down to match it to make something which would last at least awhile Faintness stole over him He fought it but his knees unhinged and he sat down stupidly biting his tongue You wont fall unconscious he told himself grimly Not here not where another of those things can come back tonight and finish the job So he got to his feet and tied the empty skin about his waist but he had only gone twenty yards back toward the place where he had left his guns and purse when he fell down again halffainting He lay there awhile one cheek pressed against the sand the edge of a seashell biting against the edge of his jaw almost deep enough to draw blood He managed to drink from the waterskin and then he crawled back to the place where he had awakened There was a Joshua tree twenty yards up the slopeDit was stunted but it would offer at least some shade To Roland the twenty yards looked like twenty miles Nonetheless he laboriously pushed what remained of his possessions into that little puddle of shade He lay there with his head in the grass already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time Not noon  but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close He held on a moment longer turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes looking for the telltale red lines of infection of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him The palm of his hand was a dull red Not a good sign Ijerk off lefthanded he thought at least thats something Then darkness took him and he slept for the next sixteen hours with the sound of the Western Sea pounding ceaselessly in his dreaming ears  When the gunslinger awoke again the sea was dark but there was faint light in the sky to the east Morning was on its way He sat up and waves of dizziness almost overcame him He bent his head and waited When the faintness had passed he looked at his hand It was infected all right  a telltale red swelling that spread up the palm and to the wrist It stopped there but already he could see the faint beginnings of other red lines which would lead eventually to his heart and kill him He felt hot feverish I need medicine he thought But there is no medicine here Had he come this far just to die then He would not And if he were to die in spite of his determination he would die on his way to the Tower How remarkable you are gunslinger the man in black tittered inside his head How indomitable How romantic in your stupid obsession Fuck you he croaked and drank Not much water left either There was a whole sea in front of him for all the good it could do him water water everywhere but not a drop to drink Never mind He buckled on his gunbelts tied themDthis was a process which took so long that before he was done the first faint light of dawn had brightened to the days actual prologueDand then tried to stand up He was not convinced he could do it until it was done Holding to the Joshua tree with his left hand he scooped up the notquiteempty waterskin with his right arm and slung it over his shoulder Then his purse When he straightened the faintness washed over him again and he put his head down waiting willing The faintness passed Walking with the weaving wavering steps of a man in the last stages of ambulatory drunkenness the gunslinger made his way back down to the strand He stood looking at an ocean as dark as mulberry wine and then took the last of his jerky from his purse He ate half and this time both mouth and stomach accepted a little more willingly He turned and ate the other half as he watched the sun come up over the mountains where Jake had diedDfirst seeming to catch on the cruel and treeless teeth of those peaks then rising above them Roland held his face to the sun closed his eyes and smiled He ate the rest of his jerky He thought Very well I am now a man with no food with two less fingers and one less toe than I was born with I am a gunslinger with shells which may not fire I am sickening from a monsters bite and have no medicine I have a days water if Im lucky I may be able to walk perhaps a dozen miles if I press myself to the last extremity I am in short a man on the edge of everything Which way should he walk He had come from the east he could not walk west without the powers of a saint or a savior That left north and south North That was the answer his heart told There was no question in it North The gunslinger began to walk  He walked for three hours He fell twice and the second time he did not believe he would be able to get up again Then a wave came toward him close enough to make him remember his guns and he was up before he knew it standing on legs that quivered like stilts He thought he had managed about four miles in those three hours Now the sun was growing hot but not hot enough to explain the way his head pounded or the sweat pouring down his face nor was the breeze from the sea strong enough to explain the sudden fits of shuddering which sometimes gripped him making his body lump into gooseflesh and his teeth chatter Fever gunslinger the man in black tittered Whats left inside you has been touched afire The red lines of infection were more pronounced now they had marched upward from his right wrist halfway to his elbow He made another mile and drained his waterbag dry He tied it around his waist with the other The landscape was monotonous and unpleasing The sea to his right the mountains to his left the gray shelllittered sand under the feet of his cutdown boots The waves came and went He looked for the lobstrosities and saw none He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere a man from another time who it seemed had reached a point of pointless ending Shortly before noon he fell again and knew he could not get up This was the place then Here This was the end after all On his hands and knees he raised his head like a groggy fighter  and some distance ahead perhaps a mile perhaps three it was difficult to judge distances along the unchanging reach of the strand with the fever working inside him making his eyeballs pulse in and out he saw something new Something which stood upright on the beach What was it three Didnt matter three is the number of your fate The gunslinger managed to get to his feet again He croaked something some plea which only the circling seabirds heard and how happy they would be to gobble my eyes from my head he thought how happy to have such a tasty bit and walked on weaving more seriously now leaving tracks behind him that were weird loops and swoops He kept his eyes on whatever it was that stood on the strand ahead When his hair fell in his eyes he brushed it aside It seemed to grow no closer The sun reached the roof of the sky where it seemed to remain far too long Roland imagined he was in the desert again somewhere between the last outlanders hut the musical fruit the more you eat the more you toot and the waystation where the boy your Isaac had awaited his coming His knees buckled straightened buckled straightened again When his hair fell in his eyes once more he did not bother to push it back did not have the strength to push it back He looked at the object which now cast a narrow shadow back toward the upland and kept walking He could make it out now fever or no fever It was a door Less than a quarter of a mile from it Rolands knees buckled again and this time he could not stiffen their hinges He fell his right hand dragged across gritty sand and shells the stumps of his fingers screamed as fresh scabs were scored away The stumps began to bleed again So he crawled Crawled with the steady rush roar and retreat of the Western Sea in his ears He used his elbows and his knees digging grooves in the sand above the twist of dirty green kelp which marked the hightide line He supposed the wind was still blowingDit must be for the chills continued to whip through his bodyDbut the only wind he could hear was the harsh gale which gusted in and out of his own lungs The door grew closer Closer At last around three oclock of that long delirious day with his shadow beginning to grow long on his left he reached it He sat back on his haunches and regarded it wearily It stood six and a half feet high and appeared to be made of solid ironwood although the nearest ironwood tree must grow seven hundred miles or more from here The doorknob looked as if it were made of gold and it was filigreed with a design which the gunslinger finally recognized it was the grinning face of the baboon There was no keyhole in the knob above it or below it The door had hinges but they were fastened to nothingDor so it seems the gunslinger thought This is a mystery a most marvellous mystery but does it really matter You are dying Your own mystery  the only one that really matters to any man or woman in the endDapproaches All the same it did seem to matter This door This door where no door should be It simply stood there on the gray strand twenty feet above the high tide line seemingly as eternal as the sea itself now casting the slanted shadow of its thickness toward the east as the sun westered Written upon it in black letters twothirds of the way up written in the high speech were two words THE PRISONER A demon has infested him The name of the demon is HEROIN The gunslinger could hear a low droning noise At first he thought it must be the wind or a sound in his own feverish head but he became more and more convinced that the sound was the sound of motors  and that it was coming from behind the door Open it then Its not locked You know its not locked Instead he tottered gracelessly to his feet and walked above the door and around to the other side There was no other side Only the dark gray strand stretching back and back Only the waves the shells the hightide line the marks of his own approachDbootprints and holes that had been made by his elbows He looked again and his eyes widened a little The door wasnt here but its shadow was He started to put out his right handDoh it was so slow learning its new place in what was left of his lifeDdropped it and raised his left instead He groped feeling for hard resistance If I feel it Ill knock on nothing the gunslinger thought That would be an interesting thing to do before dying His hand encountered thin air far past the place where the doorDeven if invisibleDshould have been Nothing to knock on And the sound of motorsDif thats what it really had beenDwas gone Now there was just the wind the waves and the sick buzzing inside his head The gunslinger walked slowly back to the other side of what wasnt there already thinking it had been a hallucination to start with aD He stopped At one moment he had been looking west at an uninterrupted view of a gray rolling wave and then his view was interrupted by the thickness of the door He could see its keyplate which also looked like gold with the latch protruding from it like a stubby metal tongue Roland moved his head an inch to the north and the door was gone Moved it back to where it had been and it was there again It did not appear it was just there He walked all the way around and faced the door swaying He could walk around on the sea side but he was convinced that the same thing would happen only this time he would fall down I wonder if I could go through it from the nothing side Oh there were all sorts of things to wonder about but the truth was simple here stood this door alone on an endless stretch of beach and it was for only one of two things opening or leaving closed The gunslinger realized with dim humor that maybe he wasnt dying quite as fast as he thought If he had been would he feel this scared He reached out and grasped the doorknob with his left hand Neither the deadly cold of the metal or the thin fiery heat of the runes engraved upon it surprised him He turned the knob The door opened toward him when he pulled Of all the things he might have expected this was not any of them The gunslinger looked froze uttered the first scream of terror in his adult life and slammed the door There was nothing for it to bang shut on but it banged shut just the same sending seabirds screeching up from the rocks on which they had perched to watch him  What he had seen was the earth from some high impossible distance in the skyDmiles up it seemed He had seen the shadows of clouds lying upon that earth floating across it like dreams He had seen what an eagle might see if one could fly thrice as high as any eagle could To step through such a door would be to fall screaming for what might be minutes and to end by driving ones self deep into the earth No you saw more He considered it as he sat stupidly on the sand in front of the closed door with his wounded hand in his lap The first faint traceries had appeared above his elbow now The infection would reach his heart soon enough no doubt about that It was the voice of Cort in his head Listen to me maggots Listen for your lives for thats what it could mean some day You never see all that you see One of the things they send you to me for is to show you what you dont see in what you seeDwhat you dont see when youre scared or fighting or running or fucking No man sees all that he sees but before youre gunslingersDthose of you who dont go west that isDyoull see more in one single glance than some men see in a lifetime And some of what you dont see in that glance youll see afterwards in the eye of your memoryDif you live long enough to remember that is Because the difference between seeing and not seeing can be the difference between living and dying He had seen the earth from this huge height and it had somehow been more dizzying and distorting than the vision of growth which had come upon him shortly before the end of his time with the man in black because what he had seen through the door had been no vision and what little remained of his attention had registered the fact that the land he was seeing was neither desert nor sea but some green place of incredible lushness with interstices of water that made him think it was a swamp butD What little remained of your attention the voice of Cort mimicked savagely You saw more Yes He had seen white White edges Bravo Roland Cort cried in his mind and Roland seemed to feel the swat of that hard callused hand He winced He had been looking through a window The gunslinger stood with an effort reached forward felt cold and burning lines of thin heat against his palm He opened the door again  The view he had expectedDthat view of the earth from some horrendous unimaginable heightDwas gone He was looking at words he didnt understand He almost understood them it was as if the Great Letters had been twisted Above the words was a picture of a horseless vehicle a motorcar of the sort which had supposedly filled the world before it moved on Suddenly he thought of the things Jake had said when at the way station the gunslinger had hypnotized him This horseless vehicle with a woman wearing a fur stole laughing beside it could be whatever had run Jake over in that strange other world This is that other world the gunslinger thought Suddenly the view  It did not change it moved The gunslinger wavered on his feet feeling vertigo and a touch of nausea The words and the picture descended and now he saw an aisle with a double row of seats on the far side A few were empty but there were men in most of them men in strange dress He supposed they were suits but he had never seen any like them before The things around their necks could likewise be ties or cravats but he had seen none like these either And so far as he could tell not one of them was armedDhe saw no dagger nor sword let alone a gun What kind of trusting sheep were these Some read papers covered with tiny words  words broken here and there with picturesDwhile others wrote on papers with pens of a sort the gunslinger had never seen But the pens mattered little to him It was the paper He lived in a world where paper and gold were valued in rough equivalency He had never seen so much paper in his life Even now one of the men tore a sheet from the yellow pad which lay upon his lap and crumpled it into a ball although he had only written on the top half of one side and not at all on the other The gunslinger was not too sick to feel a twinge of horror and outrage at such unnatural profligacy Beyond the men was a curved white wall and a row of windows A few of these were covered by some sort of shutters but he could see blue sky beyond others Now a woman approached the doorway a woman wearing what looked like a uniform but of no sort Roland had ever seen It was bright red and part of it was pants He could see the place where her legs became her crotch This was nothing he had ever seen on a woman who was not undressed She came so close to the door that Roland thought she would walk through and he blundered back a step lucky not to fall She looked at him with the practiced solicitude of a woman who is at once a servant and no ones mistress but her own This did not interest the gunslinger What interested him was that her expression never changed It was not the way you expected a womanDanybody for that matterDto look at a dirty swaying exhausted man with revolvers crisscrossed on his hips a bloodsoaked rag wrapped around his right hand and jeans which looked as if theyd been worked on with some kind of buzzsaw Would you like  the woman in red asked There was more but the gunslinger didnt understand exactly what it meant Food or drink he thought That red clothDit was not cotton Silk It looked a little like silk butD Gin a voice answered and the gunslinger understood that Suddenly he understood much more It wasnt a door It was eyes Insane as it might seem he was looking at part of a carriage that flew through the sky He was looking through someones eyes Whose But he knew He was looking through the eyes of the prisoner As if to confirm this idea mad as it was what the gunslinger was looking at through the doorway suddenly rose and slid sidewards The view turned that feeling of vertigo again a feeling of standing still on a plate with wheels under it a plate which hands he could not see moved this way and that and then the aisle was flowing past the edges of the doorway He passed a place where several women all dressed in the same red uniforms stood This was a place of steel things and he would have liked to make the moving view stop in spite of his pain and exhaustion so he could see what the steel things wereDmachines of some sort One looked a bit like an oven The army woman he had already seen was pouring the gin which the voice had requested The bottle she poured from was very small It was glass The vessel she was pouring it into looked like glass but the gunslinger didnt think it actually was What the doorway showed had moved along before he could see more There was another of those dizzying turns and he was looking at a metal door There was a lighted sign in a small oblong This word the gunslinger could read VACANT it said The view slid down a little A hand entered it from the right of the door the gunslinger was looking through and grasped the knob of the door the gunslinger was looking at He saw the cuff of a blue shirt slightly pulled back to reveal crisp curls of black hair Long fingers A ring on one of them with a jewel set into it that might have been a ruby or a firedim or a piece of trumpery trash The gunslinger rather thought it this lastDit was too big and vulgar to be real The metal door swung open and the gunslinger was looking into the strangest privy he had ever seen It was all metal The edges of the metal door flowed past the edges of the door on the beach The gunslinger heard the sound of it being closed and latched He was spared another of those giddy spins so he supposed the man through whose eyes he was watching must have reached behind himself to lock himself in Then the view did turnDnot all the way around but halfDand he was looking into a mirror seeing a face he had seen once before  on a Tarot card The same dark eyes and spill of dark hair The face was calm but pale and in the eyesDeyes through which he saw now reflected back at himDRoland saw some of the dread and horror of that baboonridden creature on the Tarot card The man was shaking Hes sick too Then he remembered Nort the weedeater in Tull He thought of the Oracle A demon has infested him The gunslinger suddenly thought he might know what HEROIN was after all something like the devilgrass A trifle upsetting isnt he Without thought with the simple resolve that had made him the last of them all the last to continue marching on and on long after Cuthbert and the others had died or given up committed suicide or treachery or simply recanted the whole idea of the Tower with the singleminded and incurious resolve that had driven him across the desert and all the years before the desert in the wake of the man in black the gunslinger stepped through the doorway  Eddie ordered a gin and tonicDmaybe not such a good idea to be going into New York Customs drunk and he knew once he got started he would just keep on goingDbut he had to have something When you got to get down and you cant find the elevator Henry had told him once you got to do it any way you can Even if its only with a shovel Then after hed given his order and the stewardess had left he started to feel like he was maybe going to vomit Not for sure going to vomit only maybe but it was better to be safe Going through Customs with a pound of pure cocaine under each armpit with gin on your breath was not so good going through Customs that way with puke drying on your pants would be disaster So better to be safe The feeling would probably pass it usually did but better to be safe Trouble was he was going cool turkey Cool not cold More words of wisdom from that great sage and eminent junkie Henry Dean They had been sitting on the penthouse balcony of the Regency Tower not quite on the nod but edging toward it the sun warm on their faces done up so good  back in the good old days when Eddie had just started to snort the stuff and Henry himself had yet to pick up his first needle Everybody talks about going cold turkey Henry had said but before you get there you gotta go cool turkey And Eddie stoned out of his mind had cackled madly because he knew exactly what Henry was talking about Henry however had not so much as cracked a smile In some ways cool turkeys worse than cold turkey Henry said At least when you make it to cold turkey you KNOW youre gonna puke you KNOW youre going to shake you KNOW youre gonna sweat until it feels like youre drowning in it Cool turkey is like the curse of expectation Eddie remembered asking Henry what you called it when a needlefreak which in those dim dead days which must have been all of sixteen months ago they had both solemnly assured themselves they would never become got a hot shot You call that baked turkey Henry had replied promptly and then had looked surprised the way a person does when hes said something that turned out to be a lot funnier than he actually thought it would be and they looked at each other and then they were both howling with laughter and clutching each other Baked turkey pretty funny not so funny now Eddie walked up the aisle past the galley to the head checked the signDVACANTDand opened the door Hey Henry o great sage if eminent junkie big brother while were on the subject of our feathered friends you want to hear my definition of cooked goose Thats when the Customs guy at Kennedy decides theres something a little funny about the way you look or its one of the days when they got the dogs with the PhD noses out there instead of at Port Authority and they all start to bark and pee all over the floor and its you theyre all just about strangling themselves on their chokechains trying to get to and after the Customs guys toss all your luggage they take you into the little room and ask you if youd mind taking off your shirt and you say yeah I sure would Id mind like hell I picked up a little cold down in the Bahamas and the airconditioning in here is real high and Im afraid it might turn into pneumonia and they say oh is that so do you always sweat like that when the airconditionings too high Mr Dean you do well excuse us all to hell now do it and you do it and they say maybe you better take off the tshirt too because you look like maybe you got some kind of a medical problem buddy those bulges under your pits look like maybe they could be some kind of lymphatic tumors or something and you dont even bother to say anything else its like a centerfielder who doesnt even bother to chase the ball when its hit a certain way he just turns around and watches it go into the upper deck because when its gone its gone so you take off the tshirt and hey looky here youre some lucky kid those arent tumors unless theyre what you might call tumors on the corpus of society yukyukyuk those things look more like a couple of baggies held there with Scotch strapping tape and by the way dont worry about that smell son thats just goose Its cooked He reached behind him and pulled the locking knob The lights in the head brightened The sound of the motors was a soft drone He turned toward the mirror wanting to see how bad he looked and suddenly a terrible pervasive feeling swept over him a feeling of being watched Hey come on quit it he thought uneasily Youre supposed to be the most unparanoid guy in the world Thats why they sent you Thats whyD But it suddenly seemed those were not his own eyes in the mirror not Eddie Deans hazel almostgreen eyes that had melted so many hearts and allowed him to part so many pretty sets of legs during the last third of his twentyone years not his eyes but those of a stranger Not hazel but a blue the color of fading Levis  Eyes that were chilly precise unexpected marvels of calibration Bombardiers eyes Reflected in them he sawDclearly sawDa seagull swooping down over a breaking wave and snatching something from it He had time to think What in Gods name is this shit and then he knew it wasnt going to pass he was going to throw up after all In the halfsecond before he did in the halfsecond he went on looking into the mirror he saw those blue eyes disappear  but before that happened there was suddenly the feeling of being two people  of being possessed like the little girl in The Exorcist Clearly he felt a new mind inside his own mind and heard a thought not as his own thought but more like a voice from a radio Ive come through Im in the skycarriage There was something else but Eddie didnt hear it He was too busy throwing up into the basin as quietly as he could When he was done before he had even wiped his mouth something happened which had never happened to him before For one frightening moment there was nothingDonly a blank interval As if a single line in a column of newsprint had been neatly and completely inked out What is this Eddie thought helplessly What the hell is this shit Then he had to throw up again and maybe that was just as well whatever you might say against it regurgitation had at least this much in its favor as long as you were doing it you couldnt think of anything else  Ive come through Im in the skycarriage the gunslinger thought And a second later He sees me in the mirror  Roland pulled backDdid not leave but pulled back like a child retreating to the furthest corner of a very long room He was inside the skycarriage he was also inside a man who was not himself Inside The Prisoner In that first moment when he had been close to the front it was the only way he could describe it he had been more than inside he had almost been the man He felt the mans illness whatever it was and sensed that the man was about to retch Roland understood that if he needed to he could take control of this mans body He would suffer his pains would be ridden by whatever demonape rode him but if he needed to he could Or he could stay back here unnoticed When the prisoners fit of vomiting had passed the gunslinger leaped forward  this time all the way to the front He understood very little about this strange situation and to act in a situation one does not understand is to invite the most terrible consequences but there were two things he needed to knowDand he needed to know them so desperately that the needing outweighed any consequences which might arise Was the door he had come through from his own world still there And if it was was his physical self still there collapsed untenanted perhaps dying or already dead without his selfs self to go on unthinkingly running lungs and heart and nerves Even if his body still lived it might only continue to do so until night fell Then the lobstrosities would come out to ask their questions and look for shore dinners He snapped the head which was for a moment his head around in a fast backward glance The door was still there still behind him It stood open on his own world its hinges buried in the steel of this peculiar privy And yes there he lay Roland the last gunslinger lying on his side his bound right hand on his stomach Im breathing Roland thought Illhave to go back and move me But there are things to do first Things  He let go of the prisoners mind and retreated watching waiting to see if the prisoner knew he was there or not  After the vomiting stopped Eddie remained bent over the basin eyes tightly closed Blanked there for a second Dont know what it was Did I look around He groped for the faucet and ran cool water Eyes still closed he splashed it over his cheeks and brow When it could be avoided no longer he looked up into the mirror again His own eyes looked back at him There were no alien voices in his head No feeling of being watched You had a momentary fugue Eddie the great sage and eminent junkie advised him A not uncommon phenomenon in one who is going cool turkey Eddie glanced at his watch An hour and a half to New York  The plane was scheduled to land at  EDT  but it was really going to be high noon Showdown time He went back to his seat His drink was on the divider He took two sips and the stew came back to ask him if she could do any thing else for him He opened his mouth to say no  and then there was another of those odd blank moments  Id like something to eat please the gunslinger said through Eddie Deans mouth Well be serving a hot snack inD Im really starving though the gunslinger said with perfect truthfulness Anything at all even a popkinD Popkin the army woman frowned at him and the gunslinger suddenly looked into the prisoners mind Sandwich  the word was as distant as the murmur in a conch shell A sandwich even the gunslinger said The army woman looked doubtful Well  I have some tuna fish  That would be fine the gunslinger said although he had never heard of tooter fish in his life Beggars could not be choosers You do look a little pale the army woman said I thought maybe it was airsickness Pure hunger She gave him a professional smile Ill see what I can rustle up Russel the gunslinger thought dazedly In his own world to russel was a slang verb meaning to take a woman by force Never mind Food would come He had no idea if he could carry it back through the doorway to the body which needed it so badly but one thing at a time one thing at a time Russel he thought and Eddie Deans head shook as if in disbelief Then the gunslinger retreated again  Nerves the great oracle and eminent junkie assured him Just nerves All part of the cool turkey experience little brother But if nerves was what it was how come he felt this odd sleepiness stealing over himDodd because he should have been itchy ditsy feeling that urge to squirm and scratch that came before the actual shakes even if he had not been in Henrys cool turkey state there was the fact that he was about to attempt bringing two pounds of coke through US Customs a felony punishable by not less than ten years in federal prison and he seemed to suddenly be having blackouts as well Still that feeling of sleepiness He sipped at his drink again then let his eyes slip shut Whyd you black out I didnt or shed be running for all the emergency gear they carry Blanked out then Its no good either way You never blanked out like that before in your life Nodded out yeah but never blanked out Something odd about his right hand too It seemed to throb vaguely as if he had pounded it with a hammer He flexed it without opening his eyes No ache No throb No blue bombardiers eyes As for the blankouts they were just a combination of going cool turkey and a good case of what the great oracle and eminent et cetera would no doubt call the smugglers blues But Im going to sleep just the same he thought How bout that Henrys face drifted by him like an untethered balloon Dont worry Henry was saying Youll be all right little brother You fly down there toNassau check in at the Aquinas therell be a man come by Friday night One of the good guys Hell fix you leave you enough stuff to take you through the weekend Sunday night he brings the coke and you give him the key to the safe deposit box Monday morning you do the routine just like Balazar said This guy will play he knows how its supposed to go Monday noon you fly out and with a face as honest as yours youll breeze through Customs and well be eating steak inSparksbefore the sun goes down Its gonna be a breeze little brother nothing but a cool breeze But it had been sort of a warm breeze after all The trouble with him and Henry was they were like Charlie Brown and Lucy The only difference was once in awhile Henry would hold onto the football so Eddie could kick itDnot often but once in awhile Eddie had even thought while in one of his heroin dazes that he ought to write Charles Schultz a letter Dear Mr Schultz he would say Youre missing a bet by ALWAYS having Lucy pull the football up at the last second She ought to hold it down there once in awhile Nothing Charlie Brown could ever predict you understand Sometimes shed maybe hold it down for him to kick three even four times in a row then nothing for a month then once and then nothing for three or four days and then you know you get the idea That would REALLY fuck the kid up wouldnt it Eddie knew it would really fuck the kid up From experience he knew it One of the good guys Henry had said but the guy who showed up had been a sallowskinned thing with a British accent a hairline moustache that looked like something out of a s filmnoire and yellow teeth that all leaned inward like the teeth of a very old animal trap You have the key Senor he asked except in that British public school accent it came out sounding like what you called your last year of high school The keys safe Eddie said if thats what you mean Then give it to me Thats not the way it goes Youre supposed to have something to take me through the weekend Sunday night youre supposed to bring me something I give you the key Monday you go into town and use it to get something else I dont know what cause thats not my business Suddenly there was a small flat blue automatic in the sallowskinned things hand Why dont you just give it to me Senor I will save time and effort you will save your life There was deep steel in Eddie Dean junkie or no junkie Henry knew it more important Balazar knew it That was why he had been sent Most of them thought he had gone because he was hooked through the bag and back again He knew it Henry knew it Balazar too But only he and Henry knew he would have gone even if he was as straight as a stake For Henry Balazar hadnt got quite that far in his figuring but fuck Balazar Why dont you just put that thing away you little scuzz Eddie asked Or do you maybe want Balazar to send someone down here and cut your eyes out of your head with a rusty knife The sallow thing smiled The gun was gone like magic in its place was a small envelope He handed it to Eddie Just a little joke you know If you say so I see you Sunday night He turned toward the door I think you better wait The sallow thing turned back eyebrows raised You think I wont go if I want to go I think if you go and this is bad shit Ill be gone tomorrow Then youll be in deep shit The sallow thing turned sulky It sat in the rooms single easy chair while Eddie opened the envelope and spilled out a small quantity of brown stuff It looked evil He looked at the sallow thing I know how it looks it looks like shit but thats just the cut the sallow thing said Its fine Eddie tore a sheet of paper from the notepad on the desk and separated a small amount of the brown powder from the pile He fingered it and then rubbed it on the roof of his mouth A second later he spat into the wastebasket You want to die Is that it You got a deathwish Thats all there is The sallow thing looked more sulky than ever I have a reservation out tomorrow Eddie said This was a lie but he didnt believe the sallow thing had the resources to check it TWA I did it on my own just in case the contact happened to be a fuckup like you I dont mind Itll be a relief actually I wasnt cut out for this sort of work The sallow thing sat and cogitated Eddie sat and concentrated on not moving He felt like moving felt like slipping and sliding hipping and bopping shucking and jiving scratching his scratches and cracking his crackers He even felt his eyes wanting to slide back to the pile of brown powder although he knew it was poison He had fixed at ten that morning the same number of hours had gone by since then But if he did any of those things the situation would change The sallow thing was doing more than cogitating it was watching him trying to calculate the depth of him I might be able to find something it said at last Why dont you try Eddie said But come eleven I turn out the light and put the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door and anybody that knocks after I do that I call the desk and say someones bothering me send a security guy You are a fuck the sallow thing said in its impeccable British accent No Eddie said a fuck is what you expected I came with my legs crossed You want to be here before eleven with something that I can useDit doesnt have to be great just something I can useDor you will be one dead scuzz  The sallow thing was back long before eleven he was back by ninethirty Eddie guessed the other stuff had been in his car all along A little more powder this time Not white but at least a dull ivory color which was mildly hopeful Eddie tasted It seemed all right Actually better than all right Pretty good He rolled a bill and snorted Well then until Sunday the sallow thing said briskly getting to its feet Wait Eddie said as if he were the one with the gun In a way he was The gun was Balazar Emilio Balazar was a highcaliber big shot in New York s wonderful world of drugs Wait the sallow thing turned and looked at Eddie as if he believed Eddie must be insane For what Well I was actually thinking of you Eddie said If I get really sick from what I just put into my body its off If I die of course its off I was just thinking that if I only get a little sick I might give you another chance You know like that story about how some kid rubs a lamp and gets three wishes It will not make you sick Thats China White If thats China White Eddie said Im Dwight Gooden Who Never mind The sallow thing sat down Eddie sat by the motel room desk with the little pile of white powder nearby the DCon or whatever it had been had long since gone down the John On TV the Braves were getting shellacked by the Mets courtesy of WTBS and the big satellite dish on the Aquinas Hotels roof Eddie felt a faint sensation of calm which seemed to come from the back of his mind  except where it was really coming from he knew from what he had read in the medical journals was from the bunch of living wires at the base of his spine that place where heroin addiction takes place by causing an unnatural thickening of the nerve stern Want to take a quick cure he had asked Henry once Break your spine Henry Your legs stop working and so does your cock but you stop needing the needle right away Henry hadnt thought it was funny In truth Eddie hadnt thought it was that funny either When the only fast way you could get rid of the monkey on your back was to snap your spinal cord above that bunch of nerves you were dealing with one heavy monkey That was no capuchin no cute little organ grinders mascot that was a big mean old baboon Eddie began to sniffle Okay he said at last Itll do You can vacate the premises scuzz The sallow thing got up I have friends he said They could come in here and do things to you Youd beg to tell me where that key is Not me champ Eddie said Not this kid And smiled He didnt know how the smile looked but it must not have looked all that cheery because the sallow thing vacated the premises vacated them fast vacated them without looking back When Eddie Dean was sure he was gone he cooked Fixed Slept  As he was sleeping now The gunslinger somehow inside this mans mind a man whose name he still did not know the lowling the prisoner thought of as the sallow thing had not known it and so had never spoken it watched this as he had once watched plays as a child before the world had moved on  or so he thought he watched because plays were all he had ever seen If he had ever seen a moving picture he would have thought of that first The things he did not actually see he had been able to pluck from the prisoners mind because the associations were close It was odd about the name though He knew the name of the prisoners brother but not the name of the man himself But of course names were secret things full of power And neither of the things that mattered was the mans name One was the weakness of the addiction The other was the steel buried inside that weakness like a good gun sinking in quicksand This man reminded the gunslinger achingly of Cuthbert Someone was coming The prisoner sleeping did not hear The gunslinger not sleeping did and came forward again  Great Jane thought He tells me how hungry he is and I fix something up for him because hes a little bit cute and then he falls asleep on me Then the passengerDa guy of about twenty tall wearing clean slightly faded bluejeans and a paisley shirtDopened his eyes a little and smiled at her Thankee sai he saidDor so it sounded Almost archaic  or foreign Sleeptalk thats all Jane thought Youre welcome She smiled her best stewardess smile sure he would fall asleep again and the sandwich would still be there uneaten when it was time for the actual meal service Well that was what they taught you to expect wasnt it She went back to the galley to catch a smoke She struck the match lifted it halfway to her cigarette and there it stopped unnoticed because that wasnt all they taught you to expect I thought he was a little bit cute Mostly because of his eyes His hazel eyes But when the man in A had opened his eyes a moment ago they hadnt been hazel they had been blue Not sweetsexy blue like Paul Newmans eyes either but the color of icebergs TheyD Ow The match had reached her fingers She shook it out Jane Paula asked You all right Fine Daydreaming She lit another match and this time did the job right She had only taken a single drag when the perfectly reasonable explanation occurred to her He wore contacts Of course The kind that changed the color of your eyes He had gone into the bathroom He had been in there long enough for her to worry about him being airsickDhe had that pallid complexion the look of a man who is not quite well But he had only been taking out his contact lenses so he could nap more comfortably Perfectly reasonable You may feel something a voice from her own notsodistant past spoke suddenly Some little tickle You may see something just a little bit wrong Colored contact lenses Jane Dorning personally knew over two dozen people who wore contacts Most of them worked for the airline No one ever said anything about it but she thought maybe one reason was they all sensed the passengers didnt like to see flight personnel wearing glassesDit made them nervous Of all those people she knew maybe four who had colorcontacts Ordinary contact lenses were expensive colored ones cost the earth All of the people of Janes acquaintance who cared to lay out that sort of money were women all of them extremely vain So what Guys can be vain too Why not Hes goodlooking No He wasnt Cute maybe but that was as far as it went and with the pallid complexion he only made it to cute by the skin of his teeth So why the colorcontacts Airline passengers are often afraid of flying In a world where hijacking and drugsmuggling had become facts of life airline personnel are often afraid of passengers The voice that had initiated these thoughts had been that of an instructor at flight school a tough old battleaxe who looked as if she could have flown the mail with Wiley Post saying Dont ignore your suspicions If you forget every thing else youve learned about coping with potential or actual terrorists remember this dont ignore your suspicions In some cases youll get a crew wholl say during the debriefing that they didnt have any idea until the guy pulled out a grenade and said hang a left forCubaor everyone on the aircraft is going to join the jetstream But in most cases you get two or three different peopleDmostly flight attendants which you women will be in less than a monthDwho say they felt something Some little tickle A sense that the guy in C or the young woman in A was a little wrong They felt something but they did nothing Did they get fired for that Christ no You cant put a guy in restraints because you dont like the way he scratches his pimples The real problem is they felt something and then forgot The old battleaxe had raised one blunt finger Jane Dorning along with her fellow classmates had listened raptly as she said If you feel that little tickle dont do anything but that includes not forgetting Because theres always that one little chance that you just might be able to stop something before it gets started something like an unscheduled twelveday layover on the tarmac of some shitpot Arab country Just colored contacts but  Thankee sai Sleeptalk Or a muddled lapse into some other language She would watch Jane decided And she would not forget  Now the gunslinger thought Now well see wont we He had been able to come from his world into this body through the door on the beach What he needed to find out was whether or not he could carry things back Oh not himself he was confident that he could return through the door and reenter his own poisoned sickening body at any time he should desire But other things Physical things Here for instance in front of him was food something the woman in the uniform had called a tooterfish sandwich The gunslinger had no idea what tooterfish was but he knew a popkin when he saw it although this one looked curiously uncooked His body needed to eat and his body would need to drink but more than either his body needed some sort of medicine It would die from the lobstrositys bite without it There might be such medicine in this world in a world where carriages rode through the air far above where even the strongest eagle could fly anything seemed possible But it would not matter how much powerful medicine there was here if he could carry nothing physical through the door You could live in this body gunslinger the voice of the man in black whispered deep inside his head Leave that piece of breathing meat over there for the lobsterthings Its only a husk anyway He would not do that For one thing it would be the most murderous sort of thievery because he would not be content to be just a passenger for long looking out of this mans eyes like a traveller looking out of a coach window at the passing scenery For another he was Roland If dying was required he intended to die as Roland He would die crawling toward the Tower if that was what was required Then the odd harsh practicality that lived beside the romantic in his nature like a tiger with a roe reasserted itself There was no need to think of dying with the experiment not yet made He picked up the popkin It had been cut in two halves He held one in each hand He opened the prisoners eyes and looked out of them No one was looking at him although in the galley Jane Dorning was thinking about him and very hard Roland turned toward the door and went through holding the popkinhalves in his hands  First he heard the grinding roar of an incoming wave next he heard the argument of many seabirds arising from the closest rocks as he struggled to a sitting position cowardly buggers were creeping up he thought and they would have been taking pecks out of me soon enough still breathing or noDtheyre nothing but vultures with a coat of paint then he became aware that one popkin halfDthe one in his right handDhad tumbled onto the hard gray sand because he had been holding it with a whole hand when he came through the door and now wasDor had beenDholding it in a hand which had suffered a forty per cent reduction He picked it up clumsily pinching it between his thumb and ring finger brushed as much of the sand from it as he could and took a tentative bite A moment later he was wolfing it not noticing the few bits of sand which ground between his teeth Seconds later he turned his attention to the other half It was gone in three bites The gunslinger had no idea what tooterfish wasDonly that it was delicious That seemed enough  In the plane no one saw the tuna sandwich disappear No one saw Eddie Deans hands grasp the two halves of it tightly enough to make deep thumbindentations in the white bread No one saw the sandwich fade to transparency then disappear leaving only a few crumbs About twenty seconds after this had happened Jane Dorning snuffed her cigarette and crossed the head of the cabin She got her book from her totebag but what she really wanted was another look at A He appeared to be deeply asleep  but the sandwich was gone Jesus Jane thought He didnt eat it he swallowed it whole And now hes asleep again Are you kidding Whatever was tickling at her about A Mr NowTheyreHazelNowTheyreBlue kept right on tickling Something about him was not right Something Eddie was awakened by an announcement from the copilot that they should be landing at Kennedy International where the visibility was unlimited the winds out of the west at ten miles an hour and the temperature a jolly seventy degrees in fortyfive minutes or so He told them that if he didnt get another chance he wanted to thank them one and all for choosing Detta He looked around and saw people checking their duty declaration cards and their proofs of citizenshipDcoming in from Nassau your drivers license and a credit card with a stateside bank listed on it was supposed to be enough but most still carried passportsDand Eddie felt a steel wire start to tighten inside him He still couldnt believe he had gone to sleep and so soundly He got up and went to the restroom The bags of coke under his arms felt as if they were resting easily and firmly fitting as nicely to the contours of his sides as they had in the hotel room where a softspoken American named William Wilson had strapped them on Following the strapping operation the man whose name Poe had made famous  Wilson had only looked blankly at Eddie when Eddie made some allusion to this handed over the shirt Just an ordinary paisley shirt a little faded the sort of thing any fratboy might wear back on the plane following a short preexams holiday  except this one was specially tailored to hide unsightly bulges You check everything once before you set down just to be sure Wilson said but youre gonna be fine Eddie didnt know if he was going to be fine or not but he had another reason for wanting to use the John before the FASTEN SEATBELTS light came on In spite of all temptationDand most of last night it hadnt been temptation but raging needDhe had managed to hold onto the last little bit of what the sallow thing had had the temerity to call China White Clearing customs from Nassau wasnt like clearing customs from Haiti or Quincon or Bogota  but there were still people watching Trained people He needed any and every edge he could get If he could go in there a little cooled out just a little it might be the one thing that put him over the top He snorted the powder flushed the little twist of paper it had been in down the John then washed his hands Of course if you make it youll never know will you he thought No He wouldnt And wouldnt care On his way back to his seat he saw the stewardess who had brought him the drink he hadnt finished She smiled at him He smiled back sat down buckled his seatbelt took out the flight magazine turned the pages and looked at pictures and words Neither made any impression on them That steel wire continued to tighten around his gut and when the FASTEN SEATBELTS light did come on it took a double turn and cinched tight The heroin had hitDhe had the sniffles to prove itDbut he sure couldnt feel it One thing he did feel shortly before landing was another of those unsettling periods of blankness  short but most definitely there The  banked over the water of Long Island Sound and started in  Jane Dorning had been in the business class galley helping Peter and Anne stow the last of the aftermeal drinks glasses when the guy who looked like a college kid went into the first class bathroom He was returning to his seat when she brushed aside the curtain between business and first and she quickened her step without even thinking about it catching him with her smile making him look up and smile back His eyes were hazel again All right all right He went into the John and took them out before his nap he went into the John and put them in again afterwards For Christs sake Janey Youre being a goose She wasnt though It was nothing she could put her finger on but she was not being a goose Hes too pale So what Thousands of people are too pale including your own mother since her gall bladder went to hell He had very arresting blue eyesDmaybe not as cute as the hazel contactsDbut certainly arresting So why the bother and expense Because he likes designer eyes Isnt that enough No Shortly before FASTEN SEATBELTS and final crosscheck she did something she had never done before she did it with that tough old battleaxe of an instructor in mind She filled a Thermos bottle with hot coffee and put on the red plastic top without first pushing the stopper into the bottles throat She screwed the top on only until she felt it catch the first thread Susy Douglas was making the final approach announcement telling the geese to extinguish their cigarettes telling them they would have to stow what they had taken out telling them a Detta gate agent would meet the flight telling them to check and make sure they had their dutydeclaration cards and proofs of citizenship telling them it would now be necessary to pick up all cups glasses and speaker sets Im surprised we dont have to check to make sure theyre dry Jane thought distractedly She felt her own steel wire wrapping itself around her guts cinching them tight Get my side Jane said as Susy hung up the mike Susy glanced at the Thermos then at Janes face Jane Are you sick You look as white as aD Im not sick Get my side Ill explain when you get back Jane glanced briefly at the jumpseats beside the lefthand exit door I want to ride shotgun JaneD Get my side All right Susy said All right Jane No problem Jane Dorning sat down in the jumpseat closest to the aisle She held the Thermos in her hands and made no move to fasten the webharness She wanted to keep the Thermos in complete control and that meant both hands Susy thinks Ive flipped out Jane hoped she had IfCaptain McDonald lands hard Im going to have blisters all over my hands She would risk it The plane was dropping The man in A the man with the twotone eyes and the pale face suddenly leaned down and pulled his travelling bag from under the seat This is it Jane thought This is where he brings out the grenade or the automatic weapon or whatever the hell hes got And the moment she saw it the very moment she was going to flip the red top off the Thermos in her slightly trembling hands and there was going to be one very surprised Friend of Allah rolling around on the aisle floor of Detta Flight  while his skin boiled on his face A unzipped the bag Jane got ready  The gunslinger thought this man prisoner or not was probably better at the fine art of survival than any of the other men he had seen in the aircarriage The others were fat things for the most part and even those who looked reasonably fit also looked open unguarded their faces those of spoiled and cosseted children the faces of men who would fight  eventuallyDbut who would whine almost endlessly before they did you could let their guts out onto their shoes and their last expressions would not be rage or agony but stupid surprise The prisoner was better  but not good enough Not at all The army woman She saw something I dont know what but she saw something wrong Shes awake to him in a way shes not to the others The prisoner sat down Looked at a limpcovered book he thought of as a MagdaSeen although who Magda might have been or what she might have seen mattered not a whit to Roland The gunslinger did not want to look at a book amazing as such things were he wanted to look at the woman in the army uniform The urge to come forward and take control was very great But he held against it  at least for the time being The prisoner had gone somewhere and gotten a drug Not the drug he himself took nor one that would help cure the gunslingers sick body but one that people paid a lot of money for because it was against the law He would give this drug to his brother who would in turn give it to a man named Balazar The deal would be complete when Balazar traded them the kind of drug they took for this oneDif that was the prisoner was able to correctly perform a ritual unknown to the gunslinger and a world as strange as this must of necessity have many strange rituals it was called Clearing the Customs But the woman sees him Could she keep him from Clearing the Customs Roland thought the answer was probably yes And then Gaol And if the prisoner were gaoled there would be no place to get the sort of medicine his infected dying body needed He must Clear the Customs Roland thought He must And he must go with his brother to this man Balazar Its not in the plan the brother wont like it but he must Because a man who dealt in drugs would either know a man or be a man who also cured the sick A man who could listen to what was wrong and then  maybe  He must Clear the Customs the gunslinger thought The answer was so large and simple so close to him that he very nearly did not see it at all It was the drug the prisoner meant to smuggle in that would make Clearing the Customs so difficult of course there might be some sort of Oracle who might be consulted in the cases of people who seemed suspicious Otherwise Roland gleaned the Clearing ceremony would be simplicity itself as crossing a friendly border was in his own world One made the sign of fealty to that kingdoms monarchDa simple token gestureDand was allowed to pass He was able to take things from the prisoners world to his own The tooterfish popkin proved that He would take the bags of drugs as he had taken the popkin The prisoner would Clear the Customs And then Roland would bring the bags of drugs back Can you Ah here was a question disturbing enough to distract him from the view of the water below  they had gone over what looked like a huge ocean and were now turning back toward the coastline As they did the water grew steadily closer The aircarriage was coming down Eddies glance was brief cursory the gunslingers as rapt as the child seeing his first snowfall He could take things from this world that he knew But bring them back again That was a thing of which he as yet had no knowing He would have to find out The gunslinger reached into the prisoners pocket and closed the prisoners fingers over a coin Roland went back through the door  The birds flew away when he sat up They hadnt dared come as close this time He ached he was woozy feverish  yet it was amazing how much even a little bit of nourishment had revived him He looked at the coin he had brought back with him this time It looked like silver but the reddish tint at the edge suggested it was really made of some baser metal On one side was a profile of a man whose face suggested nobility courage stubbornness His hair both curled at the base of the skull and pigged at the nape of the neck suggested a bit of vanity as well He turned the coin over and saw something so startling it caused him to cry out in a rusty croaking voice On the back was an eagle the device which had decorated his own banner in those dim days when there had still been kingdoms and banners to symbolize them Times short Go back Hurry But he tarried a moment longer thinking It was harder to think inside this headDthe prisoners was far from clear but it was temporarily at least a cleaner vessel than his own To try the coin both ways was only half the experiment wasnt it He took one of the shells from his cartridge belt and folded it over the coin in his hand Roland stepped back through the door  The prisoners coin was still there firmly curled within the pocketed hand He didnt have to come forward to check on the shell he knew it hadnt made the trip He came forward anyway briefly because there was one thing he had to know Had to see So he turned as if to adjust the little paper thing on the back of his seat by all the gods that ever were there was paper everywhere in this world and looked through the doorway He saw his body collapsed as before now with a fresh trickle of blood flowing from a cut on his cheekDa stone must have done it when he left himself and crossed over The cartridge he had been holding along with the coin lay at the base of the door on the sand Still enough was answered The prisoner could Clear the Customs Their guards o the watch might search him from head to toe from asshole to appetite and back again Theyd find nothing The gunslinger settled back content unaware at least for the time being that he still had not grasped the extent of his problem  The  came in low and smooth over the salt marshes of Long Island  leaving sooty trails of spent fuel behind The landing gear came down with a rumble and a thump  A the man with the twotone eyes straightened up and Jane sawDactually sawDa snubnosed Uzi in his hands before she realized it was nothing but his duty declaration card and a little zipper bag of the sort which men sometimes use to hold their passports The plane settled like silk Letting out a deep shaking shudder she tightened the red top on the Thermos Call me an asshole she said in a low voice to Susy buckling the crossover belts now that it was too late She had told Susy what she suspected on the final approach so Susy would be ready You have every right No Susy said You did the right thing I overreacted And dinners on me Like hell it is And dont look at him Look at me Smile Janey Jane smiled Nodded Wondered what in Gods name was going on now You were watching his hands Susy said and laughed Jane joined in I was watching what happened to his shirt when he bent over to get his bag Hes got enough stuff under there to stock a Woolworths notions counter Only I dont think hes carrying the kind of stuff you can buy at Woolworths Jane threw back her head and laughed again feeling like a puppet How do we handle it Susy had five years seniority on her and Jane who only a minute ago had felt she had the situation under some desperate kind of control now only felt glad to have Susy beside her We dont Tell the Captain while were taxiing in The Captain speaks to customs Your friend there gets in line like everyone else except then he gets pulled out of line by some men who escort him to a little room Its going to be the first in a very long succession of little rooms for him I think Jesus Jane was smiling but chills alternately hot and cold were racing through her She hit the poprelease on her harness when the reverse thrusters began to wind down handed the Thermos to Susy then got up and rapped on the cockpit door Not a terrorist but a drugsmuggler Thank God for small favors Yet in a way she hated it He had been cute Not much but a little  He still doesnt see the gunslinger thought with anger and dawning desperation Gods Eddie had bent to get the papers he needed for the ritual and when he looked up the army woman was staring at him her eyes bulging her cheeks as white as the paper things on the backs of the seats The silver tube with the red top which he had at first taken for some kind of canteen was apparently a weapon She was holding it up between her breasts now Roland thought that in a moment or two she would either throw it or spin off the red top and shoot him with it Then she relaxed and buckled her harness even though the thump told both the gunslinger and the prisoner the aircarriage had already landed She turned to the army woman she was sitting with and said something The other woman laughed and nodded but if that was a real laugh the gunslinger thought he was a rivertoad The gunslinger wondered how the man whose mind had become temporary home for the gunslingers own ka could be so stupid Some of it was what he was putting into his body of course  one of this worlds versions of devilweed Some but not all He was not soft and unobservant like the others but in time he might be They are as they are because they live in the light the gunslinger thought suddenly That light of civilization you were taught to adore above all other things They live in a world which has not moved on If this was what people became in such a world Roland was not sure he didnt prefer the dark That was before the world moved on people said in his own world and it was always said in tones of bereft sadness  but it was perhaps sadness without thought without consideration She thought IheDmeant to grab a weapon when IheDbent down to get the papers When she saw the papers she relaxed and did what everyone else did before the carriage came down to the ground again Now she and her friend are talking and laughing but their facesDher face especially the face of the woman with the metal tubeDare not right They are talking all right but they are only pretending to laugh and that is because what they are talking about is Ihim The aircarriage was now moving along what seemed a long concrete road one of many Mostly he watched the women but from the edges of his vision the gunslinger could see other aircarriages moving here and there along other roads Some lumbered some moved with incredible speed not like carriages at all but like projectiles fired from guns or cannons preparing to leap into the air As desperate as his own situation had become part of him wanted very much to come forward and turn his head so he could see these vehicles as they leaped into the sky They were manmade but every bit as fabulous as the stories of the Grand Featherex which had supposedly once lived in the distant and probably mythical kingdom of GarlanDmore fabulous perhaps simply because these were manmade The woman who had brought him the popkin unfastened her harness this less than a minute since she had fastened it and went forward to a small door Thats where the driver sits the gunslinger thought but when the door was opened and she stepped in he saw it apparently took three drivers to operate the aircarriage and even the brief glimpse he was afforded of what seemed like a million dials and levers and lights made him understand why The prisoner was looking at all but seeing nothingDCort would have first sneered then driven him through the nearest wall The prisoners mind was completely occupied with grabbing the bag under the seat and his light jacket from the overhead bin  and facing the ordeal of the ritual The prisoner saw nothing the gunslinger saw everything The woman thought him a thief or a madman HeDor perhaps it was I yes thats likely enoughDdid something tomake her think that She changed her mind and then the other woman changed it back only now I think they know whats really wrong They know hes going to try to profane the ritual Then in a thunderclap he saw the rest of his problem First it wasnt just a matter of taking the bags into his world as he had the coin the coin hadnt been stuck to the prisoners body with the gluestring the prisoner had wrapped around and around his upper body to hold the bags tight to his skin This gluestring was only part of his problem The prisoner hadnt missed the temporary disappearance of one coin among many but when he realized that whatever it was he had risked his life for was suddenly gone he was surely going to raise the racks  and what then It was more than possible that the prisoner would begin to behave in a manner so irrational that it would get him locked away in gaol as quickly as being caught in the act of profanation The loss would be bad enough for the bags under his arms to simply melt away to nothing would probably make him think he really had gone mad The aircarriage oxlike now that it was on the ground labored its way through a left turn The gunslinger realized that he had no time for the luxury of further thought He had to do more than come forward he must make contact with Eddie Dean Right now  Eddie tucked his declaration card and passport in his breast pocket The steel wire was now turning steadily around his guts sinking in deeper and deeper making his nerves spark and sizzle And suddenly a voice spoke in his head Not a thought a voice Listen to me fellow Listen carefully And if you would remain safe let your face show nothing which might further rouse the suspicions of those army women God knows theyre suspicious enough already Eddie first thought he was still wearing the airline earphones and picking up some weird transmission from the cockpit But the airline headphones had been picked up five minutes ago His second thought was that someone was standing beside him and talking He almost snapped his head to the left but that was absurd Like it or not the raw truth was that the voice had come from inside his head Maybe he was receiving some sort of transmissionDAM FM or VHF on the fillings in his teeth He had heard of such thD Straighten up maggot Theyre suspicious enough without you looking as if youve gone crazy Eddie sat up fast as if he had been whacked That voice wasnt Henrys but it was so much like Henrys when they had been just a couple of kids growing up in the Projects Henry eight years older the sister who had been between them now only a ghost of memory Selina had been struck and killed by a car when Eddie was two and Henry ten That rasping tone of command came out whenever Henry saw him doing something that might end with Eddie occupying a pine box long before his time  as Selina had What in the blue fuck is going on here Youre not hearing voices that arent there the voice inside his head returned No not Henrys voiceDolder dryer  stronger But like Henrys voice  and impossible not to believe Thats the first thing Youre not going crazy I AM another person This is telepathy Eddie was vaguely aware that his face was completely expressionless He thought that under the circumstances that ought to qualify him for the Best Actor of the Year Academy Award He looked out the window and saw the plane closing in on the Detta section of Kennedys International Arrivals Building  Idont know that word But I do know that those army women know you are carrying  There was a pause A feelingDodder beyond tellingDof phantom fingers rummaging through his brain as if he were a living card catalogue  heroin or cocaine I cant tell which exceptDexcept it must be cocaine because youre carrying the one you dont take to buy the one you do What army women Eddie muttered in a low voice He was completely unaware that he was speaking aloud What in the hell are you talking abD That feeling of being slapped once more  so real he felt his head ring with it Shut your mouth you damned jackass All right all right Christ Now that feeling of rummaging fingers again Army stewardesses the alien voice replied Do you understand me I have no time to con your every thought prisoner What did youD Eddie began then shut his mouth What did you call me Never mind Just listen Time is very very short They know The army stewardesses know you have this cocaine How could they Thats ridiculous I dont know how they came by their knowledge and it doesnt matter One of them told the drivers The drivers will tell whatever priests perform this ceremony this Clearing of CustomsD The language of the voice in his head was arcane the terms so offkilter they were almost cute  but the message came through loud and clear Although his face remained expressionless Eddies teeth came together with a painful click and he drew a hot little hiss in through them The voice was saying the game was over He hadnt even gotten off the plane and the game was already over But this wasnt real No way this could be real It was just his mind doing a paranoid little jig at the last minute that was all He would ignore it Just ignore it and it would go awaD You will NOT ignore it or you will go to jail and I will die the voice roared Who in the name of God are you Eddie asked reluctantly fearfully and inside his head he heard someone or something let out a deep and gusty sigh of relief  He believes the gunslinger thought Thank all the gods that are or ever were he believes  The plane stopped The FASTEN SEATBELTS light went out The jetway rolled forward and bumped against the forward port door with a gentle thump They had arrived  There is a place where you can put it while you perform the Clearing of Customs the voice said A safe place Then when you are away you can get it again and take it to this man Balazar People were standing up now getting things out of the overhead bins and trying to deal with coats which were according to the cockpit announcement too warm to wear Get your bag Get your jacket Then go into the privy again PrD Oh Bathroom Head Ifthey think Ive got dope theyll think Im trying to dump it But Eddie understood that part didnt matter They wouldnt exactly break down the door because that might scare the passengers And theyd know you couldnt flush two pounds of coke down an airline toilet and leave no trace Not unless the voice was really telling the truth  that there was some safe place But how could there be Never mind damn you MOVE Eddie moved Because he had finally come alive to the situation He was not seeing all Roland with his many years and his training of mingled torture and precision could see but he could see the faces of the stewsDthe real faces the ones behind the smiles and the helpful passing of garment bags and cartons stowed in the forward closet He could see the way their eyes flicked to him whiplash quick again and again He got his bag He got his jacket The door to the jetway had been opened and people were already moving up the aisle The door to the cockpit was open and here was the Captain also smiling  but also looking at the passengers in first class who were still getting their things together spotting himDno targeting himDand then looking away again nodding to someone tousling a youngsters head He was cold now Not cold turkey just cold He didnt need the voice in his head to make him cold ColdDsometimes that was okay You just had to be careful you didnt get so cold you froze Eddie moved forward reached the point where a left turn would take him into the jetwayDand then suddenly put his hand to his mouth I dont feel well he murmured Excuse me He moved the door to the cockpit which slightly blocked the door to the first class head and opened the bathroom door on the right Im afraid youll have to exit the plane the pilot said sharply as Eddie opened the bathroom door ItsD I believe Im going to vomit and I dont want to do it on your shoes Eddie said or mine either A second later he was in with the door locked The Captain was saying something Eddie couldnt make it out didnt want to make it out The important thing was that it was just talk not yelling he had been right no one was going to start yelling with maybe two hundred and fifty passengers still waiting to deplane from the single forward door He was in he was temporarily safe  but what good was it going to do him If youre there he thought you better do something very quick whoever you are For a terrible moment there was nothing at all That was a short moment but in Eddie Deans head it seemed to stretch out almost forever like the Bonomos Turkish Taffy Henry had sometimes bought him in the summer when they were kids if he were bad Henry beat the shit out of him if he were good Henry bought him Turkish Taffy That was the way Henry handled his heightened responsibilities during summer vacation God oh Christ I imagined it all oh Jesus how crazy could I have bD Get ready a grim voice said Icant do it alone I can COME FORWARD but I cant make you COME THROUGH You have to do it with me Turn around Eddie was suddenly seeing through two pairs of eyes feeling with two sets of nerves but not all the nerves of this other person were here parts of the other were gone freshly gone screaming with pain sensing with ten senses thinking with two brains his blood beating with two hearts He turned around There was a hole in the side of the bathroom a hole that looked like a doorway Through it he could see a gray grainy beach and waves the color of old athletic socks breaking upon it He could hear the waves He could smell salt a smell as bitter as tears in his nose Go through Someone was thumping on the door to the bathroom telling him to come out that he must deplane at once Go through damn you Eddie moaning stepped toward the doorway  stumbled  and fell into another world  He got slowly to his feet aware that he had cut his right palm on an edge of shell He looked stupidly at the blood welling across his lifeline then saw another man rising slowly to his feet on his right Eddie recoiled his feelings of disorientation and dreamy dislocation suddenly supplanted by sharp terror this man was dead and didnt know it His face was gaunt the skin stretched over the bones of his face like strips of cloth wound around slim angles of metal almost to the point where the cloth must tear itself open The mans skin was livid save for hectic spots of red high on each cheekbone on the neck below the angle of jaw on either side and a single circular mark between the eyes like a childs effort to replicate a Hindu caste symbol Yet his eyesDblue steady saneDwere alive and full of terrible and tenacious vitality He wore dark clothes of some homespun material the shirt its sleeves rolled up was a black faded almost to gray the pants something that looked like bluejeans Gunbelts crisscrossed his hips but the loops were almost all empty The holsters held guns that looked like sDbut s of an incredibly antique vintage The smooth wood of their handgrips seemed to glow with their own inner light Eddie who didnt know he had any intention of speakingDanything to sayDheard himself saying something nevertheless Are you a ghost Not yet the man with the guns croaked The devilweed Cocaine Whatever you call it Take off your shirt Your armsD Eddie had seen them The arms of the man who looked like the extravagant sort of gunslinger one would only see in a spaghetti western were glowing with lines of bright baleful red Eddie knew well enough what lines like that meant They meant bloodpoisoning They meant the devil was doing more than breathing up your ass he was already crawling up the sewers that led to your pumps Never mind my fucking arms the pallid apparition told him Take off your shirt and get rid of it He heard waves he heard the lonely hoot of a wind that knew no obstruction he saw this mad dying man and nothing else but desolation yet from behind him he heard the murmuring voices of deplaning passengers and a steady muffled pounding Mr Dean That voice he thought is in another world Not really doubting it just trying to pound it through his head the way youd pound a nail through a thick piece of mahogany Youll really have toD You can leave it pick it up later the gunslinger croaked Gods dont you understand I have to talk here It hurts And there is no time you idiot There were men Eddie would have killed for using such a word  but he had an idea that he might have a job killing this man even though the man looked like killing might do him good Yet he sensed the truth in those blue eyes all questions were canceled in their mad glare Eddie began to unbutton his shirt His first impulse was to simply tear it off like Clark Kent while Lois Lane was tied to a railroad track or something but that was no good in real life sooner or later you had to explain those missing buttons So he slipped them through the loops while the pounding behind him went on He yanked the shirt out of his jeans pulled it off and dropped it revealing the strapping tape across his chest He looked like a man in the last stages of recovery from badly fractured ribs He snapped a glance behind him and saw an open door  its bottom jamb had dragged a fan shape in the gray grit of the beach when someoneDthe dying man presumablyDhad opened it Through the doorway he saw the firstclass head the basin the mirror  and in it his own desperate face black hair spilled across his brow and over his hazel eyes In the background he saw the gunslinger the beach and soaring seabirds that screeched and squabbled over God knew what He pawed at the tape wondering how to start how to find a loose end and a dazed sort of hopelessness settled over him This was the way a deer or a rabbit must feel when it got halfway across a country road and turned its head only to be fixated by the oncoming glare of headlights It had taken William Wilson the man whose name Poe had made famous twenty minutes to strap him up They would have the door to the firstclass bathroom open in five seven at most I cant get this shit off he told the swaying man in front of him I dont know who you are or where I am but Im telling you theres too much tape and too little time  Deere the copilot suggested Captain McDonald ought to lay off pounding on the door when McDonald in his frustration at As lack of response began to do so Wheres he going to go Deere asked Whats he going to do Flush himself down the John Hes too big But if hes carryingD McDonald began Deere who had himself used cocaine on more than a few occasions said If hes carrying hes carrying heavy He cant get rid of it Turn off the water McDonald snapped suddenly Already have the navigator who had also tooted more than his flute on occasion said But I dont think it matters You can dissolve what goes into the holding tanks but you cant make it not there They were clustered around the bathroom door with its OCCUPIED sign glowing jeerily all of them speaking in low tones The DEA guys drain it draw off a sample and the guys hung He could always say someone came in before him and dumped it McDonald replied His voice was gaining a raw edge He didnt want to be talking about this he wanted to be doing something about it even though he was acutely aware that the geese were still filing out many looking with more than ordinary curiosity at the flightdeck crew and stewardesses gathered around the bathroom door For their part the crew were acutely aware that an act that wasDwell overly overtDcould provoke the terrorist boogeyman that now lurked in the back of every airtravelers mind McDonald knew his navigator and flight engineer were right he knew that the stuff was apt to be in plastic bags with the scuzzballs prints on them and yet he felt alarm bells going off in his mind Something was not right about this Something inside of him kept screaming Fast one Fast one as if the fellow from A were a riverboat gambler with palmed aces he was all ready to play Hes not trying to flush the John Susy Douglas said Hes not even trying to run the basin faucets Wed hear them sucking air if he was I hear something butD Leave McDonald said curtly His eyes flicked to Jane Dorning You too Well take care of this Jane turned to go cheeks burning Susy said quietly Jane birddogged him and I spotted the bulges under his shirt I think well stay Captain McDonald If you want to bring charges of insubordination you can But I want you to remember that you may be raping the hell out of what could be a really big DEA bust Their eyes locked flint sparking off steel Susy said Ive flown with you seventy eighty times Mac Im trying to be your friend McDonald looked at her a moment longer then nodded Stay then But I want both of you back a step toward the cockpit He stood on his toes looked back and saw the end of the line now just emerging from tourist class into business Two minutes maybe three He turned to the gate agent at the mouth of the hatch who was watching them closely He must have sensed some sort of problem because he had unholstered his walkietalkie and was holding it in his hand Tell him I want customs agents up here McDonald said quietly to the navigator Three or four Armed Now The navigator made his way through the line of passengers excusing himself with an easy grin and spoke quietly to the gate agent who raised his walkietalkie to his mouth and spoke quietly into it McDonaldDwho had never put anything stronger than aspirin into his system in his entire life and that only rarelyDturned to Deere His lips were pressed into a thin white line like a scar As soon as the last of the passengers are off were breaking that shithouse door open he said I dont care if Customs is here or not Do you understand Roger Deere said and watched the tail of the line make its way into first class  Get my knife the gunslinger said Its in my purse He gestured toward a cracked leather bag lying on the sand It looked more like a big packsack than a purse the kind of thing you expected to see hippies carrying as they made their way along the Appalachian Trail getting high on nature and maybe a bomber joint every now and then except this looked like the real thing not just a prop for some airheads selfimage something that had done years and years of hardDmaybe desperateDtravelling Gestured but did not point Couldnt point Eddie realized why the man had a swatch of dirty shirting wrapped around his right hand some of his fingers were gone Get it he said Cut through the tape Try not to cut yourself Its easy to do Youll have to be careful but youll have to move fast just the same There isnt much time I know that Eddie said and knelt on the sand None of this was real That was it that was the answer As Henry Dean the great sage and eminent junkie would have put it Flipflop hippetyhop offa your rocker and over the top lifes a fiction and the worlds a lie so put on some Creedence and lets get high None of it was real it was all just an extraordinarily vivid nodder so the best thing was just to ride low and go with the flow It sure was a vivid nodder He was reaching for the zipperDor maybe it would be a velcro stripDon the mans purse when he saw it was held together by a crisscross pattern of rawhide thongs some of which had broken and been carefully reknotted  reknotted small enough so they would still slide through the grommetted eyelets Eddie pulled the dragknot at the top spread the bags opening and found the knife beneath a slightly damp package that was the piece of shirting tied around the bullets Just the handle was enough to take his breath away  it was the true mellow graywhite of pure silver engraved with a complex series of patterns that caught the eye drew itD Pain exploded in his ear roared across his head and momentarily puffed a red cloud across his vision He fell clumsily over the open purse struck the sand and looked up at the pale man in the cutdown boots This was no nodder The blue eyes blazing from that dying face were the eyes of all truth Admire it later prisoner the gunslinger said For now just use it He could feel his ear throbbing swelling Why do you keep calling me that Cut the tape the gunslinger said grimly If they break into yon privy while youre still over here Ive got a feeling youre going to be here for a very long time And with a corpse for company before long Eddie pulled the knife out of the scabbard Not old more than old more than ancient The blade honed almost to the point of invisibility seemed to be all age caught in metal Yeah it looks sharp he said and his voice wasnt steady  The last passengers were filing out into the jetway One of them a lady of some seventy summers with that exquisite look of confusion which only firsttime fliers with too many years or too little English seem capable of wearing stopped to show Jane Dorning her tickets How will I ever find my plane to Montreal  she asked And what about my bags Do they do my Customs here or there There will be a gate agent at the top of the jetway who can give you all the information you need maam Jane said Well I dont see why you cant give me all the information I need the old woman said That jetway thing is still full of people Move on please madam Captain McDonald said We have a problem Well pardon me for living the old woman said huffily I guess I just fell off the hearse And strode past them nose tilted like the nose of a dog scenting a fire still some distance away totebag clutched in one hand ticketfolder with so many boardingpass stubs sticking out of it that one might have been tempted to believe the lady had come most of the way around the globe changing planes at every stop along the way in the other Theres a lady who may never fly Dettas big jets again Susy murmured I dont give a fuck if she flies stuffed down the front of Supermans Jockies McDonald said She the last Jane darted past them glanced at the seats in business class then poked her head into the main cabin It was deserted She came back and reported the plane empty McDonald turned to the jetway and saw two uniformed Customs agents fighting their way through the crowd excusing themselves but not bothering to look back at the people they jostled aside The last of these was the old lady who dropped her ticketfolder Papers flew and fluttered everywhere and she shrilled after them like an angry crow Okay McDonald said you guys stop right there Sir were Federal Customs officersD Thats right and I requested you and Im glad you came so fast Now you just stand right there because this is my plane and that guy in there is one of my geese Once hes off the plane and into the jetway hes your goose and you can cook him any way you want He nodded to Deere Im going to give the son of a bitch one more chance and then were going to break the door in Okay by me Deere said McDonald whacked on the bathroom door with the heel of his hand and yelled Come on out my friend Im done asking There was no answer Okay McDonald said Lets do it  Dimly Eddie heard an old woman say Well pardon me for living I guess I just fell off the hearse He had parted half the strapping tape When the old woman spoke his hand jerked a little and he saw a trickle of blood run down his belly Shit Eddie said It cant be helped now the gunslinger said in his hoarse voice Finish the job Or does the sight of blood make you sick Only when its my own Eddie said The tape had started just above his belly The higher he cut the harder it got to see He got another three inches or so and almost cut himself again when he heard McDonald speaking to the Customs agents Okay you guys stop right there I can finish and maybe cut myself wide open or you can try Eddie said I cant see what Im doing My fucking chins in the way The gunslinger took the knife in his left hand The hand was shaking Watching that blade honed to a suicidal sharpness shaking like that made Eddie extremely nervous Maybe I better chance it mysD Wait The gunslinger stared fixedly at his left hand Eddie didnt exactly disbelieve in telepathy but he had never exactly believed in it either Nevertheless he felt something now something as real and palpable as heat baking out of an oven After a few seconds he realized what it was the gathering of this strange mans will How the hell can he be dying if I can feel the force of him that strongly The shaking hand began to steady down Soon it was barely shivering After no more than ten seconds it was as solid as a rock Now the gunslinger said He took a step forward raised the knife and Eddie felt something else baking off himDrancid fever Are you lefthanded Eddie asked No the gunslinger said Oh Jesus Eddie said and decided he might feel better if he closed his eyes for a moment He heard the harsh whisper of the masking tape parting There the gunslinger said stepping back Now pull it off as far as you can Ill get the back No polite little knocks on the bathroom door now this was a hammering fist The passengers are out Eddie thought No more Mr Nice Guy Oh shit Come on out my friend Im done asking Yank it the gunslinger growled Eddie grabbed a thick tab of strapping tape in each hand and yanked as hard as he could It hurt hurt like hell Stop bellyaching he thought Things could be worse You could be hairychested like Henry He looked down and saw a red band of irritated skin about seven inches wide across his sternum Just above the solar plexus was the place where he had poked himself Blood welled in a dimple and ran down to his navel in a scarlet runnel Beneath his armpits the bags of dope now dangled like badly tied saddlebags Okay the muffled voice beyond the bathroom door said to someone else Lets dD Eddie lost the rest of it in the unexpected riptide of pain across his back as the gunslinger unceremoniously tore the rest of the girdle from him He bit down against a scream Put your shirt on the gunslinger said His face which Eddie had thought as pallid as the face of a living man could become was now the color of ancient ashes He held the girdle of tape now sticking to itself in a meaningless tangle the big bags of white stuff looking like strange cocoons in his left hand then tossed it aside Eddie saw fresh blood seeping through the makeshift bandage on the gunslingers right hand Do it fast There was a thudding sound This wasnt someone pounding for admittance Eddie looked up in time to see the bathroom door shudder to see the lights in there flicker They were trying to break it in He picked his shirt up with fingers that suddenly seemed too large too clumsy The left sleeve was turned inside out He tried to stuff it back through the hole got his hand stuck for a moment then yanked it out so hard he pulled the sleeve back again with it Thud and the bathroom door shivered again Gods how can you be so clumsy the gunslinger moaned and rammed his own fist into the left sleeve of Eddies shirt Eddie grabbed the cuff as the gunslinger pulled back Now the gunslinger held the shirt for him as a butler might hold a coat for his master Eddie put it on and groped for the lowest button Not yet the gunslinger barked and tore another piece away from his own diminishing shirt Wipe your gut Eddie did the best he could The dimple where the knife had actually pierced his skin was still welling blood The blade was sharp all right Sharp enough He dropped the bloody wad of the gunslingers shirt on the sand and buttoned his shirt Thud This time the door did more than shudder it buckled in its frame Looking through the doorway on the beach Eddie saw the bottle of liquid soap fall from where it had been standing beside the basin It landed on his zipper bag He had meant to stuff his shirt which was now buttoned and buttoned straight for a wonder into his pants Suddenly a better idea struck him He unbuckled his belt instead Theres no time for that The gunslinger realized he was trying to scream and was unable That doors only got one hit left in it I know what Im doing Eddie said hoping he did and stepped back through the doorway between the worlds unsnapping his jeans and raking the zipper down as he went After one desperate despairing moment the gunslinger followed him physical and full of hot physical ache at one moment nothing but cool ka in Eddies head at the next  One more McDonald said grimly and Deere nodded Now that all the passengers were out of the jetway as well as the plane itself the Customs agents had drawn their weapons Now The two men drove forward and hit the door together It flew open a chunk of it hanging for a moment from the lock and then dropping to the floor And there sat Mr A with his pants around his knees and the tails of his faded paisley shirt concealingDbarelyDhis jackhandle Well it sure does look like we caught him in the act Captain McDonald thought wearily Only trouble is the act we caught him in wasnt against the law last I heard Suddenly he could feel the throb in his shoulder where he had hit the doorDwhat three times four Out loud he barked What in hells name are you doing in there mister Well I was taking a crap  A said but if all you guys got a bad problem I guess I could wipe myself in the terminalD And I suppose you didnt hear us smart guy Couldnt reach the door A put out his hand to demonstrate and although the door was now hanging askew against the wall to his left McDonald could see his point I suppose I could have gotten up but I like had a desperate situation on my hands Except it wasnt exactly on my hands if you get my drift Nor did I want it on my hands if you catch my further drift A smiled a winning slightly daffy smile which looked to Captain McDonald approximately as real as a ninedollar bill Listening to him youd think no one had ever taught him the simple trick of leaning forward Get up McDonald said Be happy to If you could just move the ladies back a little A smiled charmingly I know its outdated in this day and age but I cant help it Im modest Fact is Ive got a lot to be modest about He held up his left hand thumb and forefinger roughly half an inch apart and winked at Jane Dorning who blushed bright red and immediately disappeared up the jetway closely followed by Susy You dont look modest Captain McDonald thought You look like a cat that just got the cream thats what you look like When the stews were out of sight A stood and pulled up his shorts and jeans He then reached for the flush button and Captain McDonald promptly knocked his hand away grabbed his shoulders and pivoted him back toward the aisle Deere hooked a restraining hand into the back of his pants Dont get personal Eddie said His voice was light and just rightDhe thought so anywayDbut inside everything was in free fall He could feel that other feel him clearly He was inside his mind watching him closely standing steady meaning to move in if Eddie fucked up God it all had to be a dream didnt it Didnt it Stand still Deere said Captain McDonald peered into the toilet No shit he said and when the navigator let out a bray of involuntary laughter McDonald glared at him Well you know how it is Eddie said Sometimes you get lucky and its just a false alarm I let off a couple of real rippers though I mean were talking swamp gas If youd lit a match in here three minutes ago you could have roasted a Thanksgiving turkey you know It must have been something I ate before I got on the plane I gD Get rid of him McDonald said and Deere still holding Eddie by the back of the pants propelled him out of the plane and into the jetway where each Customs officer took one arm Hey Eddie cried I want my bag And I want my jacket Oh we want you to have all your stuff one of the officers said His breath heavy with the smell of Maalox and stomach acid puffed against Eddies face Were very interested in your stuff Now lets go little buddy Eddie kept telling them to take it easy mellow out he could walk just fine but he thought later the tips of his shoes only touched the floor of the jetway three or four times between the s hatch and the exit to the terminal where three more Customs officers and half a dozen airport security cops stood the Customs guys waiting for Eddie the cops holding back a small crowd that stared at him with uneasy avid interest as he was led away Eddie Dean was sitting in a chair The chair was in a small white room It was the only chair in the small white room The small white room was crowded The small white room was smoky Eddie was in his underpants Eddie wanted a cigarette The other sixDno sevenDmen in the small white room were dressed The other men were standing around him enclosing him ThreeDno fourDof them were smoking cigarettes Eddie wanted to jitter and jive Eddie wanted to hop and bop Eddie sat still relaxed looking at the men around him with amused interest as if he wasnt going crazy for a fix as if he wasnt going crazy from simple claustrophobia The other in his mind was the reason why He had been terrified of the other at first Now he thanked God the other was there The other might be sick dying even but there was enough steel left in his spine for him to have some left to loan this scared twentyoneyearold junkie That is a very interesting red mark on your chest one of the Customs men said A cigarette hung from the corner of his mouth There was a pack in his shirt pocket Eddie felt as if he could take about five of the cigarettes in that pack line his mouth with them from corner to corner light them all inhale deeply and be easier in his mind It looks like a stripe It looks like you had something taped there Eddie and all at once decided it would be a good idea to rip it off and get rid of it I picked up an allergy in the Bahamas  Eddie said I told you that I mean weve been through all of this several times Im trying to keep my sense of humor but its getting harder all the time Fuck your sense of humor another said savagely and Eddie recognized that tone It was the way he himself sounded when hed spent half a night in the cold waiting for the man and the man didnt come Because these guys were junkies too The only difference was guys like him and Henry were their junk What about that hole in your gut Whered that come from Eddie Publishers Clearing House A third agent was pointing at the spot where Eddie had poked himself It had finally stopped dribbling but there was still a dark purple bubble there which looked more than ready to break open at the slightest urging Eddie indicated the red band where the tape had been It itches he said This was no lie I fell asleep on the planeDcheck the stew if you dont believe meD Why wouldnt we believe you Eddie I dont know Eddie said Do you usually get big drug smugglers who snooze on their way in He paused gave them a second to think about it then held out his hands Some of the nails were ragged Others were jagged When you went cool turkey he had discovered your nails suddenly became your favorite munchies Ive been pretty good about not scratching but I must have dug myself a damned good one while I was sleeping Or while you were on the nod That could be a needlemark Eddie could see they both knew better You shot yourself up that close to the solar plexus which was the nervous systems switchboard you werent ever going to shoot yourself up again Give me a break Eddie said You were in my face so close to look at my pupils I thought you were going to soulkiss me You know I wasnt on the nod The third Customs agent looked disgusted For an innocent lambikins you know an awful lot about dope Eddie What I didnt pick up on Miami Vice I got from The Readers Digest Now tell me the truthDhow many times are we going to go through this A fourth agent held up a small plastic Baggie In it were several fibers These are filaments Well get lab confirmation but we know what sort they are Theyre filaments of strapping tape I didnt take a shower before I left the hotel Eddie said for the fourth time I was out by the pool getting some sun Trying to get rid of the rash The allergy rash I fell asleep I was damned lucky to make the plane at all I had to run like hell The wind was blowing I dont know what stuck to my skin and what didnt Another reached out and ran a finger up the three inches of flesh from the inner bend of Eddies left elbow And these arent needle tracks Eddie shoved the hand away Mosquito bites I told you Almost healed Jesus Christ you can see that for yourself They could This deal hadnt come up overnight Eddie had stopped armpopping a month ago Henry couldnt have done that and that was one of the reasons it had been Eddie had to be Eddie When he absolutely had to fix he had taken it very high on his upper left thigh where his left testicle lay against the skin of the leg  as he had the other night when the sallow thing had finally brought him some stuff that was okay Mostly he had just snorted something with which Henry could no longer content himself This caused feelings Eddie couldnt exactly define  a mixture of pride and shame If they looked there if they pushed his testicles aside he could have some serious problems A bloodtest could cause him problems even more serious but that was one step further than they could go without some sort of evidenceDand evidence was something they just didnt have They knew everything but could prove nothing All the difference between world and want his dear old mother would have said Mosquito bites Yes And the red marks an allergic reaction Yes I had it when I went to the Bahamas  it just wasnt that bad He had it when he went down there one of the men said to another Uhhuh the second said You believe it Sure You believe in Santa Claus Sure When I was a kid I even had my picture taken with him once He looked at Eddie You got a picture of this famous red mark from before you took your little trip Eddie Eddie didnt reply If youre clean why wont you take a bloodtest This was the first guy again the guy with the cigarette in the corner of his mouth It had almost burned down to the filter Eddie was suddenly angryDwhitehot angry He listened inside Okay the voice responded at once and Eddie felt more than agreement he felt a kind of gotothewall approval It made him feel the way he felt when Henry hugged him tousled his hair punched him on the shoulder and said You done good kidDdont let it go to your head but you done good You know Im clean He stood up suddenlyDso suddenly they moved back He looked at the smoker who was closest to him And Ill tell you something babe if you dont get that coffinnail out my face Im going to knock it out The guy recoiled You guys have emptied the craptank on that plane already God youve had enough time to have been through it three times Youve been through my stuff I bent over and let one of you stick the worlds longest finger up my ass If a prostate check is an exam that was a motherfucking safari I was scared to look down I thought Id see that guys fingernail sticking out of my cock He glared around at them Youve been up my ass youve been through my stuff and Im sitting here in a pair of Jockies with you guys blowing smoke in my faces You want a bloodtest Kay Bring in someone to do it They murmured looked at each other Surprised Uneasy But if you want to do it without a court order Eddie said whoever does it better bring a lot of extra hypos and vials because Ill be damned if Im gonna piss alone I want a Federal marshal in here and I want each one of you to take the same goddam test and I want your names and IDs on each vial and I want them to go into that Federal marshals custody And whatever you test mine forDcocaine heroin bennies pot whateverDI want those same tests performed on the samples from you guys And then I want the results turned over to my lawyer Oh boy YOUR LAWYER one of them cried Thats what it always comes down to with you shitbags doesnt it Eddie Youll hear from MY LAWYER Ill sic MY LAWYER on you That crap makes me want to puke As a matter of fact I dont currently have one Eddie said and this was the truth I didnt think I needed one You guys changed my mind You got nothing because I have nothing but the rock and roll just doesnt stop does it So you want me to dance Great Ill dance But Im not gonna do it alone You guysll have to dance too There was a thick difficult silence Id like you to take down your shorts again please Mr Dean one of them said This guy was older This guy looked like he was in charge of things Eddie thought that maybeDjust maybeDthis guy had finally realized where the fresh tracks might be Until now they hadnt checked His arms his shoulders his legs  but not there They had been too sure they had a bust Im through taking things off taking things down and eating this shit Eddie said You get someone in here and well do a bunch of bloodtests or Im getting out Now which do you want That silence again And when they started looking at each other Eddie knew he had won WE won he amended Whats your name fella Roland Yours is Eddie Eddie Dean You listen good Listen and watch Give him his clothes the older man said disgustedly He looked at Eddie I dont know what you had or how you got rid of it but I want you to know that were going to find out The old dude surveyed him So there you sit There you sit almost grinning What you say doesnt make me want to puke What you are does I make you want to puke Thats affirmative Oh boy Eddie said I love it Im sitting here in a little room and Ive got nothing on but my underwear and theres seven guys around me with guns on their hips and make you want to puke Man you have got a problem Eddie took a step toward him The Customs guy held his ground for a moment and then something in Eddies eyesDa crazy color that seemed halfhazel halfblueDmade him step back against his will IM NOT CARRYING Eddie roared QUIT NOW JUST QUIT LET ME ALONE The silence again Then the older man turned around and yelled at someone Didnt you hear me Get his clothes And that was that  You think were being tailed the cabbie asked He sounded amused Eddie turned forward Why do you say that You keep looking out the back window I never thought about being tailed Eddie said This was the absolute truth He had seen the tails the first time he looked around Tails not tail He didnt have to keep looking around to confirm their presence Outpatients from a sanitarium for the mentally retarded would have trouble losing Eddies cab on this late May afternoon traffic on the LIE was sparse Im a student of traffic patterns thats all Oh the cabbie said In some circles such an odd statement would have prompted questions but New York cab drivers rarely question instead they assert usually in a grand manner Most of these assertions begin with the phrase This city as if the words were a religious invocation preceding a sermon  which they usually were Instead this one said Because if you did think we were being tailed were not Id know This city Jesus Ive tailed plenty of people in my time Youd be surprised how many people jump into my cab and say Follow that car I know sounds like something you only hear in the movies right Right But like they say art imitates life and life imitates art It really happens And as for shaking a tail its easy if you know how to set the guy up You  Eddie tuned the cabbie down to a background drone listening just enough so he could nod in the right places When you thought about it the cabbies rap was actually quite amusing One of the tails was a dark blue sedan Eddie guessed that one belonged to Customs The other was a panel truck with GINELLIS PIZZA written on the sides There was also a picture of a pizza only the pizza was a smiling boys face and the smiling boy was smacking his lips and written under the picture was the slogan UMMMMM Itsa GOOOOD Pizza Only some young urban artist with a spraycan and a rudimentary sense of humor had drawn a line through PIZZA and had printed PUSSY above it Ginelli There was only one Ginelli Eddie knew he ran a restaurant called Four Fathers The pizza business was a sideline a guaranteed stiff an accountants angel Ginelli and Balazar They went together like hot dogs and mustard According to the original plan there was to have been a limo waiting outside the terminal with a driver ready to whisk him away to Balazars place of business which was a midtown saloon But of course the original plan hadnt included two hours in a little white room two hours of steady questioning from one bunch of Customs agents while another bunch first drained and then raked the contents of Flight s wastetanks looking for the big carry they also suspected the big carry that would be unflushable undissolvable When he came out there was no limo of course The driver would have had his instructions if the mule isnt out of the terminal fifteen minutes or so after the rest of the passengers have come out drive away fast The limo driver would know better than to use the cars telephone which was actually a radio that could easily be monitored Balazar would call people find out Eddie had struck trouble and get ready for trouble of his own Balazar might have recognized Eddies steel but that didnt change the fact that Eddie was a junkie A junkie could not be relied upon to be a standup guy This meant there was a possibility that the pizza truck just might pull up in the lane next to the taxi someone just might stick an automatic weapon out of the pizza trucks window and then the back of the cab would become something that looked like a bloody cheesegrater Eddie would have been more worried about that if they had held him for four hours instead of two and seriously worried if it had been six hours instead of four But only two  he thought Balazar would trust him to have hung on to his lip at least that long He would want to know about his goods The real reason Eddie kept looking back was the door It fascinated him As the Customs agents had halfcarried halfdragged him down the stairs to Kennedys administration section he had looked back over his shoulder and there it had been improbable but indubitably inarguably real floating along at a distance of about three feet He could see the waves rolling steadily in crashing on the sand he saw that the day over there was beginning to darken The door was like one of those trick pictures with a hidden image in them it seemed you couldnt see that hidden part for the life of you at first but once you had you couldnt unsee it no matter how hard you tried It had disappeared on the two occasions when the gunslinger went back without him and that had been scaryDEddie had felt like a child whose nightlight has burned out The first time had been during the customs interrogation Ihave to go Rolands voice had cut cleanly through whatever question they were currently throwing at him Ill only be a few moments Dont be afraid Why Eddie asked Why do you have to go Whats wrong one of the Customs guys had asked him All of a sudden you look scared All of a sudden he had felt scared but of nothing this yoyo would understand He looked over his shoulder and the Customs men had also turned They saw nothing but a blank white wall covered with white panels drilled with holes to damp sound Eddie saw the door its usual three feet away now it was embedded in the rooms wall an escape hatch none of his interrogators could see He saw more He saw things coming out of the waves things that looked like refugees from a horror movie where the effects are just a little more special than you want them to be special enough so everything looks real They looked like a hideous crossbreeding of prawn lobster and spider They were making some weird sound You getting the jimjams one of the Customs guys had asked Seeing a few bugs crawling down the wall Eddie That was so close to the truth that Eddie had almost laughed He understood why the man named Roland had to go back though Rolands mind was safe enoughDat least for the time beingDbut the creatures were moving toward his body and Eddie had a suspicion that if Roland did not soon vacate it from the area it currently occupied there might not be any body left to go back to Suddenly in his head he heard David Lee Roth bawling Oh lyyyyy aint got no body  and this time he did laugh He couldnt help it Whats so funny the Customs agent who had wanted to know if he was seeing bugs asked him This whole situation Eddie had responded Only in the sense of peculiar not hilarious I mean if it was a movie it would be more like Fellini than Woody Allen if you get what I mean Youll be all right Roland asked Yeah fine TCB man I dont understand Go take care of business Oh All right Ill not be long And suddenly that other had been gone Simply gone Like a wisp of smoke so thin that the slightest vagary of wind could blow it away Eddie looked around again saw nothing but drilled white panels no door no ocean no weird monstrosities and he felt his gut begin to tighten There was no question of believing it had all been a hallucination after all the dope was gone and that was all the proof Eddie needed But Roland had  helped somehow Made it easier You want me to hang a picture there one of the Customs guys asked No Eddie said and blew out a sigh I want you to let me out of here Soon as you tell us what you did with the skag another said or was it coke And so it started again round and round she goes and where she stops nobody knows Ten minutes laterDten very long minutesDRoland was suddenly back in his mind One second gone next second there Eddie sensed he was deeply exhausted Taken care of he asked Yes Im sorry it took so long A pause Ihad to crawl Eddie looked around again The doorway had returned but now it offered a slightly different view of that world and he realized that as it moved with him here it moved with Roland there The thought made him shiver a little It was like being tied to this other by some weird umbilicus The gunslingers body lay collapsed in front of it as before but now he was looking down a long stretch of beach to the braided hightide line where the monsters wandered about growling and buzzing Each time a wave broke all of them raised their claws They looked like the audiences in those old documentary films where Hitlers speaking and everyone is throwing that old seig heil salute like their lives depended on itDwhich they probably did when you thought about it Eddie could see the tortured markings of the gunslingers progress in the sand As Eddie watched one of the horrors reached up lightning quick and snared a seabird which happened to swoop too close to the beach The thing fell to the sand in two bloody spraying chunks The parts were covered by the shelled horrors even before they had stopped twitching A single white feather drifted up A claw snatched it down Holy Christ Eddie thought numbly Look at thosesnappers Why do you keep looking back there the guy in charge had asked From time to time I need an antidote Eddie said From what Your face  The cab driver dropped Eddie at the building in CoOp City  thanked him for the dollar tip and drove off Eddie just stood for a moment zipper bag in one hand his jacket hooked over a finger of the other and slung back over his shoulder Here he shared a twobedroom apartment with his brother He stood for a moment looking up at it a monolith with all the style and taste of a brick Saltines box The many windows made it look like a prison cellblock to Eddie and he found the view as depressing as RolandDthe otherD did amazing Never even as a child did I see a building so high Roland said And there are so many of them Yeah Eddie agreed We live like a bunch of ants in a hill It may look good to you but Ill tell you Roland it gets old It gets old in a hurry The blue car cruised by the pizza truck turned in and approached Eddie stiffened and felt Roland stiffen inside him Maybe they intended to blow him away after all The door Roland asked Shall we go through Do you wish it Eddie sensed Roland was readyDfor anythingDbut the voice was calm Not yet Eddie said Could be they only want to talk But be ready He sensed that was an unnecessary thing to say he sensed that Roland was readier to move and act in his deepest sleep than Eddie would ever be in his most wideawake moment The pizza truck with the smiling kid on the side closed in The passenger window rolled down and Eddie waited outside the entrance to his building with his shadow trailing out long in front of him from the toes of his sneakers waiting to see which it would beDa face or a gun  The second time Roland left him had been no more than five minutes after the Customs people had finally given up and let Eddie go The gunslinger had eaten but not enough he needed to drink most of all he needed medicine Eddie couldnt yet help him with the medicine Roland really needed although he suspected the gunslinger was right and Balazar could  if Balazar wanted to but simple aspirin might at least knock down the fever that Eddie had felt when the gunslinger stepped close to sever the top part of the tape girdle He paused in front of the newsstand in the main terminal Do you have aspirin where you come from I have never heard of it Is it magic or medicine Both I guess Eddie went into the newsstand and bought a tin of ExtraStrength Anacin He went over to the snack bar and bought a couple of footlong dogs and an extralarge Pepsi He was putting mustard and catsup on the franks Henry called the footlongs Godzilladogs when he suddenly remembered this stuff wasnt for him For all he knew Roland might not like mustard and catsup For all he knew Roland might be a veggie For all he knew this crap might kill Roland Well too late now Eddie thought When Roland spokeDwhen Roland actedD Eddie knew all this was really happening When he was quiet that giddy feeling that it must be a dream  an extraordinarily vivid dream he was having as he slept on Detta  inbound to KennedyDinsisted on creeping back Roland had told him he could carry the food into his own world He had already done something similar once he said when Eddie was asleep Eddie found it all but impossible to believe but Roland assured him it was true Well we still have to be damned careful Eddie said Theyve got two Customs guys watching me Us Whatever the hell I am now I know we have to be careful Roland returned There arent two there are five Eddie suddenly felt one of the weirdest sensations of his entire life He did not move his eyes but felt them moved Roland moved them A guy in a muscle shirt talking into a telephone A woman sitting on a bench rooting through her purse A young black guy who would have been spectacularly handsome except for the harelip which surgery had only partially repaired looking at the teeshirts in the newsstand Eddie had come from not long since There was nothing wrong about any of them on top but Eddie recognized them for what they were nonetheless and it was like seeing those hidden images in a childs puzzle which once seen could never be unseen He felt dull heat in his cheeks because it had taken the other to point out what he should have seen at once He had spotted only two These three were a little better but not that much the eyes of the phoneman werent blank imagining the person he was talking to but aware actually looking and the place where Eddie was  that was the place to which the phonemans eyes just happened to keep returning The pursewoman didnt find what she wanted or give up but simply went on rooting endlessly And the shopper had had a chance to look at every shirt on the spindlerack at least a dozen times All of a sudden Eddie felt five again afraid to cross the street without Henry to hold his hand Never mind Roland said And dont worry about the food either Ive eaten bugs while they were still lively enough for some of them to go running down my throat Yeah Eddie replied but this isNew York He took the dogs and the soda to the far end of the counter and stood with his back to the terminals main concourse Then he glanced up in the lefthand corner A convex mirror bulged there like a hypertensive eye He could see all of his followers in it but none was close enough to see the food and cup of soda and that was good because Eddie didnt have the slightest idea what was going to happen to it Put the astin on the meatthings Then hold everything in your hands Aspirin Good Call It flutergork if you want pr Eddie Just do it He took the Anacin out of the stapled bag he had stuffed in his pocket almost put it down on one of the hotdogs and suddenly realized that Roland would have problems just getting what Eddie thought of as the poisonproofingDoff the tin let alone opening it He did it himself shook three of the pills onto one of the napkins debated then added three more Three now three later he said Ifthere is a later All right Thank you Now what Hold all of it Eddie had glanced into the convex mirror again Two of the agents were strolling casually toward the snack bar maybe not liking the way Eddies back was turned maybe smelling a little prestidigitation in progress and wanting a closer look If something was going to happen it better happen quick He put his hands around everything feeling the heat of the dogs in their soft white rolls the chill of the Pepsi In that moment he looked like a guy getting ready to carry a snack back to his kids  and then the stuff started to melt He stared down eyes widening widening until it felt to him that they must soon fall out and dangle by their stalks He could see the hotdogs through the rolls He could see the Pepsi through the cup the icechoked liquid curving to conform to a shape which could no longer be seen Then he could see the red Formica counter through the footlongs and the white wall through the Pepsi His hands slid toward each other the resistance between them growing less and less  and then they closed against each other palm to palm The food  the napkins  the Pepsi Cola  the six Anacin  all the things which had been between his hands were gone Jesus jumped up and played the fiddle Eddie thought numbly He flicked his eyes up toward the convex mirror The doorway was gone  just as Roland was gone from his mind Eat hearty my friend Eddie thought  but was this weird alien presence that called itself Roland his friend That was far from proved wasnt it He had saved Eddies bacon true enough but that didnt mean he was a Boy Scout All the same he liked Roland Feared him  but liked him as well Suspected that in time he could love him as he loved Henry Eat well stranger he thought Eat well stay alive and come back Close by were a few mustardstained napkins left by a previous customer Eddie balled them up tossed them in the trashbarrel by the door on his way out and chewed air as if finishing a last bite of something He was even able to manufacture a burp as he approached the black guy on his way toward the signs pointing the way to LUGGAGE and GROUND TRANSPORTATION Couldnt find a shirt you liked Eddie asked I beg your pardon the black guy turned from the American Airlines departures monitor he was pretending to study I thought maybe you were looking for one that said PLEASE FEED ME I AM A US GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE Eddie said and walked on As he headed down the stairs he saw the purserooter hurriedly snap her purse shut and get to her feet Oh boy this is gonna be like the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade It had been one fuck of an interesting day and Eddie didnt think it was over yet  When Roland saw the lobsterthings coming out of the waves again their coming had nothing to do with tide then it was the dark that brought them he left Eddie Dean to move himself before the creatures could find and eat him The pain he had expected and was prepared for He had lived with pain so long it was almost an old friend He was appalled however by the rapidity with which his fever had increased and his strength decreased If he had not been dying before he most assuredly was now Was there something powerful enough in the prisoners world to keep that from happening Perhaps But if he didnt get some of it within the next six or eight hours he thought it wouldnt matter If things went much further no medicine or magic in that world or any other that would make him well again Walking was impossible He would have to crawl He was getting ready to start when his eye fixed upon the twisted band of sticky stuff and the bags of devilpowder If he left the stuff here the lobstrosities would almost surely tear the bags open The seabreeze would scatter the powder to the four winds Which is where it belongs the gunslinger thought grimly but he couldnt allow it When the time came Eddie Dean would be in a long tub of trouble if he couldnt produce that powder It was rarely possible to bluff men of the sort he guessed this Balazar to be He would want to see what he had paid for and until he saw it Eddie would have enough guns pointed at him to equip a small army The gunslinger pulled the twisted rope of gluestring over to him and slung it over his neck Then he began to work his way up the beach He had crawled twenty yardsDalmost far enough to consider himself safe he judgedDwhen the horrible yet cosmically funny funny realization that he was leaving the doorway behind came to him What in Gods name was he going through this for He turned his head and saw the doorway not down on the beach but three feet behind him For a moment Roland could only stare and realize what he would have known already if not for the fever and the sound of the Inquisitors drumming their ceaseless questions at Eddie Where did you how did you why did you when did you questions that seemed to merge eerily with the questions of the scrabbling horrors that came crawling and wriggling out of the waves Dadachock Dadachum Didachick as mere delirium Not so Now I take it with me everywhere I go he thought just as he does It comes with us everywhere now following like a curse you can never get rid of All of this felt so true as to be unquestionable  and so did one other thing If the door between them should close it would be closed forever When that happens Roland thought grimly he must be on this side With me What a paragon of virtue you are gunslinger the man in black laughed He seemed to have taken up permanent residence inside Rolands head You have killed the boy that was the sacrifice that enabled you to catch me and I suppose to create the door between worlds Now you intend to draw your three one by one and condemn all of them to something you would not have for yourself a lifetime in an alien world where they may die as easily as animals in a zoo set free in a wild place The Tower Roland thought wildly Once Ive gotten to the Tower and done whatever it is Im supposed to do there accomplished whatever fundamental act of restoration or redemption for which I was meant then perhaps theyD But the shrieking laughter of the man in black the man who was dead but lived on as the gunslingers stained conscience would not let him go on with the thought Neither however could the thought of the treachery he contemplated turn him aside from his course He managed another ten yards looked back and saw that even the largest of the crawling monsters would venture no further than twenty feet above the hightide line He had already managed three times that distance Its well then Nothing is well the man in black replied merrily and you know it Shut up the gunslinger thought and for a wonder the voice actually did Roland pushed the bags of devildust into the cleft between two rocks and covered them with handfuls of sparse sawgrass With that done he rested briefly head thumping like a hot bag of waters skin alternately hot and cold then rolled back through the doorway into that other world that other body leaving the increasing deadly infection behind for a little while  The second time he returned to himself he entered a body so deeply asleep that he thought for a moment it had entered a comatose state  a state of such lowered bodily function that in moments he would feel his own consciousness start down a long slide into darkness Instead he forced his body toward wakefulness punched and pummelled it out of the dark cave into which it had crawled He made his heart speed up made his nerves reaccept the pain that sizzled through his skin and woke his flesh to groaning reality It was night now The stars were out The popkinthings Eddie had bought him were small bits of warmth in the chill He didnt feel like eating them but eat them he would First though  He looked at the white pills in his hand Astin Eddie called it No that wasnt quite right but Roland couldnt pronounce the word as the prisoner had said it Medicine was what it came down to Medicine from that other world Ifanything from your world is going to do for me Prisoner Roland thought grimly I think its more apt to be your potions than your popkins Still he would have to try it Not the stuff he really neededDor so Eddie believedDbut something which might reduce his fever Three now three later If there is a later He put three of the pills in his mouth then pushed the coverDsome strange white stuff that was neither paper nor glass but which seemed a bit like bothDoff the paper cup which held the drink and washed them down The first swallow amazed him so completely that for a moment he only lay there propped against a rock his eyes so wide and still and full of reflected starlight that he would surely have been taken for dead already by anyone who happened to pass by Then he drank greedily holding the cup in both hands the rotted pulsing hurt in the stumps of his fingers barely noticed in his total absorption with the drink Sweet Gods such sweetness Such sweetness SuchD One of the small flat icecubes in the drink caught in his throat He coughed pounded his chest and choked it out Now there was a new pain in his head the silvery pain that comes with drinking something too cold too fast He lay still feeling his heart pumping like a runaway engine feeling fresh energy surge into his body so fast he felt as if he might actually explode Without thinking of what he was doing he tore another piece from his shirtDsoon it would be no more than a rag hanging around his neckDand laid it across one leg When the drink was gone he would pour the ice into the rag and make a pack for his wounded hand But his mind was elsewhere Sweet it cried out again and again trying to get the sense of it or to convince itself there was sense in it much as Eddie had tried to convince himself of the other as an actual being and not some mental convulsion that was only another part of himself trying to trick him Sweet Sweet Sweet The dark drink was laced with sugar even more than MartenDwho had been a great glutton behind his grave ascetics exteriorDhad put in his coffee in mornings and at Downers Sugar white powder  The gunslingers eyes wandered to the bags barely visible under the grass he had tossed over them and wondered briefly if the stuff in this drink and the stuff in the bags might be one and the same He knew that Eddie had understood him perfectly over here where they were two separate physical creatures he suspected that if he had crossed bodily to Eddies world and he understood instinctively it could be done  although if the door should shut while he was there he would be there forever as Eddie would be here forever if their positions were reversed he would have understood the language just as perfectly He knew from being in Eddies mind that the languages of the two worlds were similar to begin with Similar but not the same Here a sandwich was a popkin There to rustle was finding something to eat So  was it not possible that the drug Eddie called cocaine was in the gunslingers world called sugar Reconsideration made it seem unlikely Eddie had bought this drink openly knowing that he was being watched by people who served the Priests of Customs Further Roland sensed he had paid comparatively little for it Less even than for the popkins of meat No sugar was not cocaine but Roland could not understand why anyone would want cocaine or any other illegal drug for that matter in a world where such a powerful one as sugar was so plentiful and cheap He looked at the meat popkins again felt the first stirrings of hunger  and realized with amazement and confused thankfulness that he felt better The drink Was that it The sugar in the drink That might be part of itDbut a small part Sugar could revive ones strength for awhile when it was flagging this was something he had known since he was a child But sugar could not dull pain or damp the feverfire in your body when some infection had turned it into a furnace All the same that was exactly what had happened to him  was still happening The convulsive shuddering had stopped The sweat was drying on his brow The fishhooks which had lined his throat seemed to be disappearing Incredible as it was it was also an inarguable fact not just imagination or wishful thinking in point of fact the gunslinger had not been capable of such frivolity as the latter in unknown and unknowable decades His missing fingers and toes still throbbed and roared but he believed even these pains to be muted Roland put his head back closed his eyes and thanked God God and Eddie Dean Dont make the mistake of putting your heart near his hand Roland a voice from the deeper ranges of his mind spokeDthis was not the nervous titterybitchy voice of the man in black or the rough one of Cort to the gunslinger it sounded like his father You know that what hes done for you he has done out of his own personal need just as you know that those men  Inquisitors though they may beDare partly or completely right about him He is a weak vessel and the reason they took him was neither false nor base There is steel in him I dispute it not But there is weakness as well He is like Hax the cook Hax poisoned reluctantly but reluctance has never stilled the screams of the dying as their intestines rupture And there is yet another reason to beware  But Roland needed no voice to tell him what that other reason was He had seen that in Jakes eyes when the boy finally began to understand his purpose Dont make the mistake of putting your heart near his hand Good advice You did yourself ill to feel well of those to whom ill must eventually be done Remember your duty Roland Ive never forgotten it he husked as the stars shone pitilessly down and the waves grated on the shore and the lobster monstrosities cried their idiot questions Im damned for my duty And why should the damned turn aside He began to eat the meat popkins which Eddie called dogs Roland didnt much care for the idea of eating dog and these things tasted like gutterleavings compared to the tooterfish but after that marvellous drink did he have any right to complain He thought not Besides it was late in the game to worry overmuch about such niceties He ate everything and then returned to the place where now Eddie was in some magical vehicle that rushed along a metal road filled with other such vehicles  dozens maybe hundreds and not a horse pulling a single one  Eddie stood ready as the pizza truck pulled up Roland stood even more ready inside of him Just another version of Dianas Dream Roland thought What was in the box The golden bowl or the bitersnake And just as she turns the key and puts her hands upon the lid she hears her mother calling Wake up Diana Its time to milk Okay Eddie thought Which is it gonna be The lady or the tiger A man with a pale pimply face and big buck teeth looked out of the pizza trucks passenger window It was a face Eddie knew Hi Col  Eddie said without much enthusiasm Beyond Col Vincent sitting behind the wheel was Old DoubleUgly which was what Henry called Jack Andolini But Henry never called him that to his face Eddie thought No of course not Calling Jack something like that to his face would be a wonderful way to get yourself killed He was a huge man with a bulging cavemans forehead and a prothagonous jaw to match He was related to Enrico Balazar by marriage  a niece a cousin some fucking thing His gigantic hands clung to the wheel of the delivery truck like the hands of a monkey clinging to a branch Coarse sprouts of hair grew from his ears Eddie could only see one of those ears now because Jack Andolini remained in profile never looking around Old DoubleUgly But not even Henry who Eddie had to admit was not always the most perceptive guy in the world had ever made the mistake of calling him Old DoubleStupid Colin Vincent was no more than a glorified gofer Jack however had enough smarts behind that Neanderthal brow to be Balazars number one lieutenant Eddie didnt like the fact that Balazar had sent a man of such importance He didnt like it at all Hi Eddie Col said Heard you had some trouble Nothing I couldnt handle Eddie said He realized he was scratching first one arm then the other one of the typical junkie moves he had tried so hard to keep away from while they had him in custody He made himself stop But Col was smiling and Eddie felt an urge to slam a fist all the way through that smile and out the other side He might have done it too  except for Jack Jack was still staring straight ahead a man who seemed to be thinking his own rudimentary thoughts as he observed the world in the simple primary colors and elementary motions which were all a man of such intellect or so youd think looking at him could perceive Yet Eddie thought Jack saw more in a single day than Col Vincent would in his whole life Well good Col said Thats good Silence Col looked at Eddie smiling waiting for Eddie to start the Junkie Shuffle again scratching shifting from foot to foot like a kid who needs to go to the bathroom waiting mostly for Eddie to ask what was up and by the way did they just happen to have any stuff on them Eddie only looked back at him not scratching now not moving at all A faint breeze blew a RingDing wrapper across the parking lot The scratchy sound of its skittering passage and the wheezy thump of the pizza trucks loose valves were the only sounds Col s knowing grin began to falter Hop in Eddie Jack said without looking around Lets take a ride Where Eddie asked knowing Balazars Jack didnt look around He flexed his hands on the wheel once A large ring solid gold except for the onyx stone which bulged from it like the eye of a giant insect glittered on the third finger of his right as he did it He wants to know about his goods I have his goods Theyre safe Fine Then nobody has anything to worry about Jack Andolini said and did not look around I think I want to go upstairs first Eddie said I want to change my clothes talk to HenryD And get fixed up dont forget that Col said and grinned his big yellowtoothed grin Except you got nothing to fix with little chum Dadachum the gunslinger thought in Eddies mind and both of them shuddered a little Col observed the shudder and his smile widened Oh here it is after all that smile said The good old Junkie Shuffle Had me worried there for a minute Eddie The teeth revealed by the smiles expansion were not an improvement on those previously seen Whys that Mr Balazar thought it would be better to make sure youguys had a clean place Jack said without looking around He went on observing the world an observer would have believed it impossible for such a man to observe In case anyone showed up People with a Federal search warrant for instance Col said His face hung and leered Now Eddie could feel Roland also wanting to drive a fist through the rotted teeth that made that grin so reprehensible so somehow irredeemable The unanimity of feeling cheered him up a little He sent in a cleaning service to wash the walls and vacuum the carpets and he aint going to charge you a red cent for it Eddie Now youll ask what Ive got Col s grin said Oh yeah now youll ask Eddie my boy Because you may not love the candyman but you do love the candy dont you And now that you know Balazars made sure your own private stash is goneD A sudden thought both ugly and frightening flashed through his mind If the stash was goneD Wheres Henry he said suddenly so harshly that Col drew back surprised Jack Andolini finally turned his head He did so slowly as if it was an act he performed only rarely and at great personal cost You almost expected to hear old oilless hinges creaking inside the thickness of his neck Safe he said and then turned his head back to its original position again just as slowly Eddie stood beside the pizza truck fighting the panic trying to rise in his mind and drown coherent thought Suddenly the need to fix which he had been holding at bay pretty well was overpowering He had to fix With a fix he could think get himself under controlD Quit it Roland roared inside his head so loud Eddie winced and Col  mistaking Eddies grimace of pain and surprise for another little step in the Junkie Shuffle began to grin again Quit it Ill be all the goddamned control you need You dont understand Hes my brother Hes my fucking brother Balazars got my brother You speak as if it was a word Id never heard before Do you fear for him Yes Christ yes Then do what they expect Cry Pule and beg Ask for this fix of yours Im sure they expect you to and Im sure they have it Do all those things make them sure of you and you can be sure all your fears will be justified I dont understand what you mD I mean if you show a yellow gut you will go far toward getting your precious brother killed Is that what you want All right Ill be cool It may not sound that way but Ill be cool Is that what you call it All right then Yes Be cool This isnt the way the deal was supposed to go down Eddie said speaking past Col and directly at Jack Andolinis tufted ear This isnt why I took care of Balazars goods and hung onto my lip while some other guy would have been puking out five names for every year off on the pleabargain Balazar thought your brother would be safer with him Jack said not looking around He took him into protective custody Well good Eddie said You thank him for me and you tell him that Im back his goods are safe and I can take care of Henry just like Henry always took care of me You tell him Ill have a sixpack on ice and when Henry walks in the place were going to split it and then well get in our car and come on into town and do the deal like it was supposed to be done Like we talked about it Balazar wants to see you Eddie Jack said His voice was implacable immovable His head did not turn Get in the truck Stick it where the sun doesnt shine motherfucker Eddie said and started for the doors to his building  It was a short distance but he had gotten barely halfway when Andolinis hand clamped on his upper arm with the paralyzing force of a visegrip His breath as hot as a bulls on the back of Eddies neck He did all this in the time you would have thought looking at him it would have taken his brain to convince his hand to pull the doorhandle up Eddie turned around Be cool Eddie Roland whispered Cool Eddie responded I could kill you for that Andolini said No one tells me stick it up my ass especially no shitass little junkie like you Kill shit Eddie screamed at himDbut it was a calculated scream A cool scream if you could dig that They stood there dark figures in the golden horizontal light of late spring sundown in the wasteland of housing developments that is the Bronxs CoOp City and people heard the scream and people heard the word kill and if their radios were on they turned them up and if their radios were off they turned them on and then turned them up because it was better that way safer Rico Balazar broke his word I stood up for him and he didnt stand up for me So I tell you to stick it up your fuckin ass I tell him to stick it up his fuckin ass I tell anybody I want to stick it up his fuckin ass Andolini looked at him His eyes were so brown the color seemed to have leaked into his corneas turning them the yellow of old parchment Itell President Reagan to stick it up his ass if he breaks his word to me and fuck his fuckin rectal palp or whatever it is The words died away in echoes on brick and concrete A single child his skin very black against his white basketball shorts and hightopped sneakers stood in the playground across the street watching them a basketball held loosely against his side in the crook of his elbow You done Andolini asked when the last of the echoes were gone Yes Eddie said in a completely normal tone of voice Okay Andolini said He spread his anthropoid fingers and smiled  and when he smiled two things happened simultaneously the first was that you saw a charm that was so surprising it had a way of leaving people defenseless the second was that you saw how bright he really was How dangerously bright Now can we start over Eddie brushed his hands through his hair crossed his arms briefly so he could scratch both arms at the same time and said I think we better because this is going nowhere Okay Andolini said No one has said nothing and no one has ranked out nobody And without turning his head or breaking the rhythm of his speech he added Get back in the truck dumb wit Col Vincent who had climbed cautiously out of the delivery truck through the door Andolini had left open retreated so fast he thumped his head He slid across the seat and slouched in his former place rubbing it and sulking You gotta understand the deal changed when the Customs people put the arm on you Andolini said reasonably Balazar is a big man He has interests to protect People to protect One of those people it just so happens is your brother Henry You think thats bullshit If you do you better think about the way Henry is now Henrys fine Eddie said but he knew better and he couldnt keep the knowing out of his voice He heard it and knew Jack Andolini heard it too These days Henry was always on the nod it seemed like There were holes in his shirts from cigarette burns He had cut the shit out of his hand using the electric canopener on a can of Calo for Potzie their cat Eddie didnt know how you cut yourself with an electric canopener but Henry had managed it Sometimes the kitchen table would be powdery with Henrys leavings or Eddie would find blackened curls of char in the bathroom sink Henry he would say Henry you gotta take care of this this is getting out of hand youre a bust walking around and waiting to happen Yeah okay little brother Henry would respond zero perspiration I got it all under control but sometimes looking at Henrys ashy face and burned out eyes Eddie knew Henry was never going to have anything under control again What he wanted to say to Henry and couldnt had nothing to do with Henry getting busted or getting them both busted What he wanted to say was Henry its like youre looking for a room to die in Thats how it looks to me and I want you to fucking quit it Because if you die what did I live for Henry isnt fine Jack Andolini said He needs someone to watch out for him He needsDwhats that song say A bridge over troubled waters Thats what Henry needs A bridge over troubled waters IlRoche is being that bridge Il Roche is a bridge to hell Eddie thought Out loud he said Thats where Henry is At Balazars place Yes I give him his goods he gives me Henry And your goods Andolini said dont forget that The deal goes back to normal in other words Right Now tell me you think thats really gonna happen Come on Jack Tell me I wanna see if you can do it with a straight face And if you can do it with a straight face I wanna see how much your nose grows I dont understand you Eddie Sure you do Balazar thinks Ive got his goods If he thinks that he must be stupid and I know hes not stupid I dont know what he thinks Andolini said serenely Its not my job to know what he thinks He knows you had his goods when you left the Islands he knows Customs grabbed you and then let you go he knows youre here and not on your way to Rikers he knows his goods have to be somewhere And he knows Customs is still all over me like a wetsuit on a skindiver because you know it and you sent him some kind of coded message on the trucks radio Something like Double cheese hold the anchovies right Jack Jack Andolini said nothing and looked serene Only you were just telling him something he already knew Like connecting the dots in a picture you can already see what it is Andolini stood in the golden sunset light that was slowly turning furnace orange and continued to look serene and continued to say nothing at all He thinks they turned me He thinks theyre running me He thinks I might be stupid enough to run I dont exactly blame him I mean why not A smackhead will do anything You want to check see if Im wearing a wire I know youre not Andolini said I got something in the van Its like a fuzzbuster only it picks up shortrange radio transmissions And for what its worth I dont think youre running for the Feds Yeah Yeah So do we get in the van and go into the city or what Do I have a choice No Roland said inside his head No Andolini said Eddie went back to the van The kid with the basketball was still standing across the street his shadow now so long it was a gantry Get out of here kid Eddie said You were never here you never saw nothing or no one Fuck off The kid ran Col was grinning at him Push over champ Eddie said I think you oughtta sit in the middle Eddie Push over Eddie said again Col looked at him then looked at Andolini who did not look at him but only pulled the drivers door closed and looked serenely straight ahead like Buddha on his day off leaving them to work the seating arrangements out for themselves Col glanced back at Eddies face and decided to push over They headed into New YorkDand although the gunslinger who could only stare wonderingly at spires even greater and more graceful bridges that spanned a wide river like steel cobwebs and rotored aircarriages that hovered like strange manmade insects did not know it the place they were headed for was the Tower  Like Andolini Enrico Balazar did not think Eddie Dean was running for the Feds like Andolini Balazar knew it The bar was empty The sign on the door read CLOSED TONITE ONLY Balazar sat in his office waiting for Andolini and Col Vincent to arrive with the Dean kid His two personal bodyguards Claudio Andolini Jacks brother and Cimi Dretto were with him They sat on the sofa to the left of Balazars large desk watching fascinated as the edifice Balazar was building grew The door was open Beyond the door was a short hallway To the right it led to the back of the bar and the little kitchen beyond where a few simple pasta dishes were prepared To the left was the accountants office and the storage room In the accountants office three more of Balazars gentlemenDthis was how they were known  were playing Trivial Pursuit with Henry Dean Okay George Biondi was saying heres an easy one Henry Henry You there Henry Earth to Henry Earth people need you Come in Henry I say again come in HD Im here Im here Henry said His voice was the slurry muddy voice of a man who is still asleep telling his wife hes awake so shell leave him alone for another five minutes Okay The category is Arts and Entertainment The question is  Henry Dont you fuckin nod off on me asshole Im not Henry cried back querulously Okay The question is What enormously popular novel by William Peter Blatty set in the posh Washington DC suburb of Georgetown  concerned the demonic possession of a young girl Johnny Cash Henry replied Jesus Christ Tricks Postino yelled Thats what you say to every thin Johnny Cash thats what you say to fuckin everythin Johnny Cash is everything Henry replied gravely and there was a moment of silence palpable in its considering surprise  then a gravelly burst of laughter not just from the men in the room with Henry but the two other gentlemen sitting in the storage room You want me to shut the door Mr Balazar Cimi asked quietly No thats fine Balazar said He was secondgeneration Sicilian but there was no trace of accent in his speech nor was it the speech of a man whose only education had been in the streets Unlike many of his contemporaries in the business he had finished high school Had in fact done more for two years he had gone to business schoolDNYU His voice like his business methods was quiet and cultured and American and this made his physical aspect as deceiving as Jack Andolinis People hearing his clear unaccented American voice for the first time almost always looked dazed as if hearing a particularly good piece of ventriloquism He looked like a farmer or innkeeper or smalltime mafioso who had been successful more by virtue of being at the right place at the right time than because of any brains He looked like what the wiseguys of a previous generation had called a Mustache Pete He was a fat man who dressed like a peasant This evening he wore a plain white cotton shirt open at the throat there were spreading sweatstains beneath the arms and plain gray twill pants On his fat sockless feet were brown loafers so old they were more like slippers than shoes Blue and purple varicose veins squirmed on his ankles Cimi and Claudio watched him fascinated In the old days they had called him IlRocheD The Rock Some of the oldtimers still did Always in the righthand top drawer of his desk where other businessmen might keep pads pens paperclips things of that sort Enrico Balazar kept three decks of cards He did not play games with them however He built with them He would take two cards and lean them against each other making an A without the horizontal stroke Next to it he would make another Ashape Over the top of the two he would lay a single card making a roof He would make A after A overlaying each until his desk supported a house of cards You bent over and looked in you saw something that looked like a hive of triangles Cimi had seen these houses fall over hundreds of times Claudio had also seen it happen from time to time but not so frequently because he was thirty years younger than Cimi who expected to soon retire with his bitch of a wife to a farm they owned in northern New Jersey where he would devote all his time to his garden  and to outliving the bitch he had married not his motherinlaw he had long since given up any wistful notion he might once have had of eating fettucini at the wake of La Monstra La Monstra was eternal but for outliving the bitch there was at least some hope his father had had a saying which when translated meant something like God pisses down the back of your neck every day but only drowns you once and while Cimi wasnt completely sure he thought it meant God was a pretty good guy after all and so he could hope to outlive the one if not the other but had only seen Balazar put out of temper by such a fall on a single occasion Mostly it was something errant that did it  someone closing a door hard in another room or a drunk stumbling against a wall there had been times when Cimi saw an edifice Mr Balazar whom he still called Da Boss like a character in a Chester Gould comic strip had spent hours building fall down because the bass on the juke was too loud Other times these airy constructs fell down for no perceptible reason at all OnceDthis was a story he had told at least five thousand times and one of which every person he knew with the exception of himself had tiredDDa Boss had looked up at him from the ruins and said You see this Cimi For every mother who ever cursed God for her child dead in the road for every father who ever cursed the man who sent him away from the factory with no job for every child who was ever born to pain and asked why this is the answer Our lives are like these things I build Sometimes they fall down for a reason sometimes they fall down for no reason at all Carlocimi Dretto thought this the most profound statement of the human condition he had ever heard That one time Balazar had been put out of temper by the collapse of one of his structures had been twelve maybe fourteen years ago There was a guy who came in to see him about booze A guy with no class no manners A guy who smelled like he took a bath once a year whether he needed it or not A mick in other words And of course it was booze With micks it was always booze never dope And this mick he thought what was on Da Bosss desk was a joke Make a wish he yelled after Da Boss had explained to him in the way one gentleman explains to another why it was impossible for them to do business And then the mick one of those guys with curly red hair and a complexion so white he looked like he had TB or something one of those guys whose names started with O and then had that little curly mark between the O and the real name had blown on Da Bosss desk like a nino blowing out the candles on a birthday cake and cards flew everywhere around Balazars head and Balazar had opened the left top drawer in his desk the drawer where other businessmen might keep their personal stationery or their private memos or something like that and he had brought out a  and he had shot the Mick in the head and Balazars expression never changed and after Cimi and a guy named Truman Alexander who had died of a heart attack four years ago had buried the Mick under a chickenhouse somewhere outside of Sedonville Connecticut Balazar had said to Cimi Its up to men to build things paisan Its up to God to blow them down You agree Yes Mr Balazar Cimi had said He did agree Balazar had nodded pleased You did like I said You put him someplace where chickens or ducks or something like that could shit on him Yes Thats very good Balazar said calmly and took a fresh deck of cards from the right top drawer of his desk One level was not enough for Balazar  IlRoche Upon the roof of the first level he would build a second only not quite so wide on top of the second a third on top of the third a fourth He would go on but after the fourth level he would have to stand to do so You no longer had to bend much to look in and when you did what you saw wasnt rows of triangle shapes but a fragile bewildering and impossibly lovely hall of diamondshapes You looked in too long you felt dizzy Once Cimi had gone in the Mirror Maze at Coney and he had felt like that He had never gone in again Cimi said he believed no one believed him the truth was no one cared one way or the other he had once seen Balazar build something which was no longer a house of cards but a tower of cards one which stood nine levels high before it collapsed That no one gave a shit about this was something Cimi didnt know because everyone he told affected amazement because he was close to Da Boss But they would have been amazed if he had had the words to describe itDhow delicate it had been how it reached almost three quarters of the way from the top of the desk to the ceiling a lacy construct of jacks and deuces and kings and tens and Big Akers a red and black configuration of paper diamonds standing in defiance of a world spinning through a universe of incoherent motions and forces a tower that seemed to Cimis amazed eyes to be a ringing denial of all the unfair paradoxes of life If he had known how he would have said I looked at what he built and to me it explained the stars  Balazar knew how everything would have to be The Feds had smelled EddieDmaybe he had been stupid to send Eddie in the first place maybe his instincts were failing him but Eddie had seemed somehow so right so perfect His uncle the first man he had worked for in the business said there were exceptions to every rule but one Never trust a junkie Balazar had said nothingDit was not the place of a boy of fifteen to speak even if only to agreeDbut privately had thought the only rule to which there was no exception was that there were some rules for which that was not true But if Tio Verone were alive today Balazar thought he would laugh at you and say look Rico you always were too smart for your own good you knew the rules you kept your mouth shut when it was respectful to keep it shut but you always had that snot look in your eyes You always knew too much about how smart you were and so you finally fell into the pit of your own pride just like I always knew you would He made an A shape and overlaid it They had taken Eddie and held him awhile and then let him go Balazar had grabbed Eddies brother and the stash they shared That would be enough to bring him  and he wanted Eddie He wanted Eddie because it had only been two hours and two hours was wrong They had questioned him at Kennedy not at rd Street  and that was wrong too That meant Eddie had succeeded in ditching most or all of the coke Or had he He thought He wondered Eddie had walked out of Kennedy two hours after they took him off the plane That was too short a time for them to have sweated it out of him and too long for them to have decided he was clean that some stew had made a rash mistake He thought He wondered Eddies brother was a zombie but Eddie was still smart Eddie was still tough He wouldnt have turned in just two hours  unless it was his brother Something about his brother But still how come no rd Street  How come no Customs van the ones that looked like Post Office trucks except for the wire grilles on the back windows Because Eddie really had done something with the goods Ditched them Hidden them Impossible to hide goods on an airplane Impossible to ditch them Of course it was also impossible to escape from certain prisons rob certain banks beat certain raps But people did Harry Houdini had escaped from straitjackets locked trunks fucking bank vaults But Eddie Dean was no Houdini Was he He could have had Henry killed in the apartment could have had Eddie cut down on the LIE or better yet also in the apartment where it would look to the cops like a couple of junkies who got desperate enough to forget they were brothers and killed each other But it would leave too many questions unanswered He would get the answers here prepare for the future or merely satisfy his curiosity depending on what the answers were and then kill both of them A few more answers two less junkies Some gain and no great loss In the other room the game had gotten around to Henry again Okay Henry George Biondi said Be careful because this one is tricky The category is Geography The question is What is the only continent where kangaroos are a native form of life  A hushed pause Johnny Cash Henry said and this was followed by a bullthroated roar of laughter The walls shook Cimi tensed waiting for Balazars house of cards which would become a tower only if God or the blind forces that ran the universe in His name willed it to fall down The cards trembled a bit If one fell all would fall None did Balazar looked up and smiled at Cimi Piasan he said II Dio est bono il Dio est malo temps est pocopoco tu est une grande peeparollo Cimi smiled Si senor he said lo grande peeparollo lo va fanculo por tu None va fanculo catzarro Balazar said Eddie Dean va fanculo He smiled gently and began on the second level of his tower of cards  When the van pulled to the curb near Balazars place Col Vincent happened to be looking at Eddie He saw something impossible He tried to speak and found himself unable His tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth and all he could get out was a muffled grunt He saw Eddies eyes change from brown to blue  This time Roland made no conscious decision to come forward He simply leaped without thinking a movement as involuntary as rolling out of a chair and going for his guns when someone burst into a room The Tower he thought fiercely Its the Tower my God the Tower is in the sky the Tower I see the Tower in the sky drawn in lines of red fire Cuthbert Alan Desmond The Tower The TD But this time he felt Eddie struggling  not against him but trying to talk to him trying desperately to explain something to him The gunslinger retreated listeningDlistening desperately as above a beach some unknown distance away in space and time his mindless body twitched and trembled like the body of a man experiencing a dream of highest ecstasy or deepest horror  Sign Eddie was screaming into his own head  and into the head of that other Its a sign just a neon sign I dont know what tower it is youre thinking about but this is just a bar Balazars place TheLeaningTower he named it that after the one inPisa Its just a sign thats supposed to look like the fuckingLeaningTowerofPisa Let up Let up You want to get us killed before we have a chance to go at them Pitsa the gunslinger replied doubtfully and looked again A sign Yes all right he could see now it was not the Tower but a Signpost It leaned to one side and there were many scalloped curves and it was a marvel but that was all He could see now that the sign was a thing made of tubes tubes which had somehow been filled with glowing red swampfire In some places there seemed to be less of it than others in those places the lines of fire pulsed and buzzed He now saw letters below the tower which had been made of shaped tubes most of them were Great Letters TOWER he could read and yes LEANING LEANING TOWER  The first word was three letters the first T the last E the middle one which he had never seen Tre he asked Eddie THE It doesnt matter Do you see its just a sign Thats what matters Isee the gunslinger answered wondering if the prisoner really believed what he was saying or was only saying it to keep the situation from spilling over as the tower depicted in those lines of fire seemed about to do wondering if Eddie believed any sign could be a trivial thing Then ease off Do you hear me Ease off Be cool Roland asked and both felt Roland smile a little in Eddies mind Be cool right Let me handle things Yes All right He would let Eddie handle things For awhile  Col Vincent finally managed to get his tongue off the roof of his mouth Jack His voice was as thick as shag carpet Andolini turned off the motor and looked at him irritated His eyes What about his eyes Yeah what about my eyes Eddie asked Col looked at him The sun had gone down leaving nothing in the air but the days ashes but there was light enough for Col to see that Eddies eyes were brown again If they had ever been anything else You saw it part of his mind insisted but had he Col was twentyfour and for the last twentyone of those years no one had really believed him trustworthy Useful sometimes Obedient almost always  if kept on a short leash Trustworthy No Col had eventually come to believe it himself Nothing he muttered Then lets go Andolini said They got out of the pizza van With Andolini on their left and Vincent on their right Eddie and the gunslinger walked into The Leaning Tower In a blues tune from the twenties Billie Holiday who would one day discover the truth for herself sang Doctor tole me daughter you got to quit it fastBecause one more rocket gonna be your last Henry Deans last rocket went up just five minutes before the van pulled up in front of The Leaning Tower and his brother was herded inside Because he was on Henrys right George BiondiDknown to his friends as Big George and to his enemies as Big NoseDasked Henrys questions Now as Henry sat nodding and blinking owlishly over the board Tricks Postino put the die in a hand which had already gone the dusty color that results in the extremities after longterm heroin addiction the dusty color which is the precursor of gangrene Your turn Henry Tricks said and Henry let the die fall from his hand When he went on staring into space and showed no intention of moving his game piece Jimmy Haspio moved it for him Look at this Henry he said You got a chance to score a piece of the pie Reeses Pieces Henry said dreamily and then looked around as if awakening Wheres Eddie Hell be here pretty soon Tricks soothed him Just play the game How about a fix Play the game Henry Okay okay stop leaning on me Dont lean on him Kevin Blake said to Jimmy Okay I wont Jimmy said You ready George Biondi said and gave the others an enormous wink as Henrys chin floated down to his breastbone and then slowly rose once moreDit was like watching a soaked log not quite ready to give in and sink for good Yeah Henry said Bring it on Bring it on Jimmy Haspio cried happily You bring that fucker Tricks agreed and they all roared with laughter in the other room Balazars edifice now three levels high trembled again but did not fall Okay listen close George said and winked again Although Henry was on a Sports category George announced the category was Arts and Entertainment What popular country and western singer had hits with A Boy Named Sue Folsom Prison Blues and numerous other shitkicking songs Kevin Blake who actually could add seven and nine if you gave him poker chips to do it with howled with laughter clutching his knees and nearly upsetting the board Still pretending to scan the card in his hand George continued This popular singer is also known as The Man in Black His first name means the same as a place you go to take a piss and his last name means what you got in your wallet unless youre a fucking needle freak There was a long expectant silence Walter Brennan Henry said at last Bellows of laughter Jimmy Haspio clutched Kevin Blake Kevin punched Jimmy in the shoulder repeatedly In Balazars office the house of cards which was now becoming a tower of cards trembled again Quiet down Cimi yelled Da Boss is buildin They quieted at once Right George said You got that one right Henry It was a toughie but you came through Always do Henry said Always come through in the fuckin clutch How about a fix Good idea George said and took a RoiTan cigar box from behind him From it he produced a hypo He stuck it into the scarred vein above Henrys elbow and Henrys last rocket took off  The pizza vans exterior was grungy but underneath the roadfilth and spraypaint was a hightech marvel the DEA guys would have envied As Balazar had said on more than one occasion you couldnt beat the bastards unless you could compete with the bastardsDunless you could match their equipment It was expensive stuff but Balazars side had an advantage they stole what the DEA had to buy at grossly inflated prices There were electronics company employees all the way down the Eastern Seaboard willing to sell you top secret stuff at bargain basement prices These catzzaroni Jack Andolini called them Silicon Valley CokeHeads practically threw the stuff at you Under the dash was a fuzzbuster a UHF police radar jammer a highrangehigh frequency radio transmissions detector an hrhf jammer a transponderamplifier that would make anyone trying to track the van by standard triangulation methods decide it was simultaneously in Connecticut Harlem and Montauk Sound a radiotelephone  and a small red button which Andolini pushed as soon as Eddie Dean got out of the van In Balazars office the intercom uttered a single short buzz Thats them he said Claudio let them in Cimi you tell everyone to dummy up So far as Eddie Dean knows no ones with me but you and Claudio Cimi go in the storeroom with the other gentlemen They went Cimi turning left Claudio Andolini going right Calmly Balazar started on another level of his edifice  Just let me handle it Eddie said again as Claudio opened the door Yes the gunslinger said but remained alert ready to come forward the instant it seemed necessary Keys rattled The gunslinger was very aware of odorsDold sweat from Col Vincent on his right some sharp almost acerbic aftershave from Jack Andolini on his left and as they stepped into the dimness the sour tang of beer The smell of beer was all he recognized This was no tumbledown saloon with sawdust on the floor and planks set across sawhorses for a bar  it was as far from a place like Shebs in Tull as you could get the gunslinger reckoned Glass gleamed mellowly everywhere more glass in this one room than he had seen in all the years since his childhood when supplylines had begun to break down partially because of interdicting raids carried out by the rebel forces of Parson the Good Man but mostly he thought simply because the world was moving on Farson had been a symptom of that great movement not the cause He saw their reflections everywhereDon the walls on the glassfaced bar and the long mirror behind it he could even see them reflected as curved miniatures in the graceful bellshapes of wine glasses hung upside down above the bar  glasses as gorgeous and fragile as festival ornaments In one corner was a sculpted creation of lights that rose and changed rose and changed rose and changed Gold to green green to yellow yellow to red red to gold again Written across it in Great Letters was a word he could read but which meant nothing to him ROCKOLA Never mind There was business to be done here He was no tourist he must not allow himself the luxury of behaving like one no matter how wonderful or strange these things might be The man who had let them in was clearly the brother of the man who drove what Eddie called the van as in vanguard Roland supposed although he was much taller and perhaps five years younger He wore a gun in a shoulderrig Wheres Henry Eddie asked I want to see Henry He raised his voice Henry Hey Henry No reply only silence in which the glasses hung over the bar seemed to shiver with a delicacy that was just beyond the range of a human ear Mr Balazar would like to speak to you first You got him gagged and tied up somewhere dont you Eddie asked and before Claudio could do more than open his mouth to reply Eddie laughed No what am I thinking aboutDyou got him stoned thats all Why would you bother with ropes and gags when all you have to do to keep Henry quiet is needle him Okay Take me to Balazar Lets get this over with  The gunslinger looked at the tower of cards on Balazars desk and thought Another sign Balazar did not look upDthe tower of cards had grown too tall for that to be necessaryDbut rather over the top His expression was one of pleasure and warmth Eddie he said Im glad to see you son I heard you had some trouble at Kennedy I aint your son Eddie said flatly Balazar made a little gesture that was at the same time comic sad and untrustworthy You hurt me Eddie it said you hurt me when you say a thing like that Lets cut through it Eddie said You know it comes down to one thing or the other either the Feds are running me or they had to let me go You know they didnt sweat it out of me in just two hours And you know if they had Id be down at rd Street  answering questions between an occasional break to puke in the basin Are they running you Eddie Balazar asked mildly No They had to let me go Theyre following but Im not leading So you ditched the stuff Balazar said Thats fascinating You must tell me how one ditches two pounds of coke when that one is on a jet plane It would be handy information to have Its like a locked room mystery story I didnt ditch it Eddie said but I dont have it anymore either So who does Claudio asked then blushed when his brother looked at him with dour ferocity He does Eddie said smiling and pointed at Enrico Balazar over the tower of cards Its already been delivered For the first time since Eddie had been escorted into the office a genuine expression illuminated Balazars face surprise Then it was gone He smiled politely Yes he said To a location which will be revealed later after you have your brother and your goods and are gone To Iceland  maybe Is that how its supposed to go No Eddie said You dont understand Its here Delivery right to your door Just like we agreed Because even in this day and age there are some people who still believe in living up to the deal as it was originally cut Amazing I know but true They were all staring at him Howm I doing Roland Eddie asked I think you are doing very well But dont let this man Balazar get his balance Eddie I think hes dangerous You think so huh Well Im one up on you there my friend I know hes dangerous Very fucking dangerous He looked at Balazar again and dropped him a little wink Thats why youre the one whos gotta be concerned with the Feds now not me If they turn up with a search warrant you could suddenly find yourself fucked without even opening your legs Mr Balazar Balazar had picked up two cards His hands suddenly shook and he put them aside It was minute but Roland saw it and Eddie saw it too An expression of uncertaintyDeven momentary fear perhapsDappeared and then disappeared on his face Watch your mouth with me Eddie Watch how you express yourself and please remember that my time and my tolerance for nonsense are both short Jack Andolini looked alarmed He made a deal with them Mr Balazar This little shit turned over the coke and they planted it while they were pretending to question him No one has been in here Balazar said No one could get close Jack and you know it Beepers go when a pigeon farts on the roof ButD Even if they had managed to set us up somehow we have so many people in their organization we could drill fifteen holes in their case in three days Wed know who when and how Balazar looked back at Eddie Eddie he said you have fifteen seconds to stop bullshitting Then Im going to have Cimi Dretto step in here and hurt you Then after he hurts you for awhile he will leave and from a room close by you will hear him hurting your brother Eddie stiffened Easy the gunslinger murmured and thought All you have to do to hurt him is to say his brothers name Its like poking an open sore with a stick Im going to walk into your bathroom Eddie said He pointed at a door in the far left corner of the room a door so unobtrusive it could almost have been one of the wall panels Im going in by myself Then Im going to walk back out with a pound of your cocaine Half the shipment You test it Then you bring Henry in here where I can look at him When I see him see hes okay you are going to give him our goods and hes going to ride home with one of your gentlemen While he does me andRoland he almost said  me and the rest of the guys we both know you got here can watch you build that thing When Henrys home and safeDwhich means no one standing there with a gun in his earDhes going to call and say a certain word This is something we worked out before I left Just in case The gunslinger checked Eddies mind to see if this was true or bluff It was true or at least Eddie thought it was Roland saw Eddie really believed his brother Henry would die before saying that word in falsity The gunslinger was not so sure You must think I still believe in Santa Claus Balazar said I know you dont Claudio Search him Jack you go in my bathroom and search it Everything Is there any place in there I wouldnt know about Andolini asked Balazar paused for a long moment considering Andolini carefully with his dark brown eyes There is a small panel on the back wall of the medicine cabinet he said I keep a few personal things in there It is not big enough to hide a pound of dope in but maybe you better check it Jack left and as he entered the little privy the gunslinger saw a flash of the same frozen white light that had illuminated the privy of the aircarriage Then the door shut Balazars eyes flicked back to Eddie Why do you want to tell such crazy lies he asked almost sorrowfully I thought you were smart Look in my face Eddie said quietly and tell me that I am lying Balazar did as Eddie asked He looked for a long time Then he turned away hands stuffed in his pockets so deeply that the crack of his peasants ass showed a little His posture was one of sorrowDsorrow over an erring sonDbut before he turned Roland had seen an expression on Balazars face that had not been sorrow What Balazar had seen in Eddies face had left him not sorrowful but profoundly disturbed Strip Claudio said and now he was holding his gun on Eddie Eddie started to take his clothes off  I dont like this Balazar thought as he waited for Jack Andolini to come back out of the bathroom He was scared suddenly sweating not just under his arms or in his crotch places where he sweated even when it was the dead of winter and colder than a welldiggers beltbuckle but all over Eddie had gone off looking like a junkieDa smart junkie but still a junkie someone who could be led anywhere by the skag fishhook in his ballsDand had come back looking like  like what Like hed grown in some way changed Its like somebody poured two quarts of fresh guts down his throat Yes That was it And the dope The fucking dope Jack was tossing the bathroom and Claudio was checking Eddie with the thorough ferocity of a sadistic prison guard Eddie had stood with a stolidity Balazar would not previously have believed possible for him or any other doper while Claudio spat four times into his left palm rubbed the snotflecked spittle all over his right hand then rammed it up Eddies asshole to the wrist and an inch or two beyond There was no dope in his bathroom no dope on Eddie or in him There was no dope in Eddies clothes his jacket or his travelling bag So it was all nothing but a bluff Look in my face and tell me that I am lying So he had What he saw was upsetting What he saw was that Eddie Dean was perfectly confident he intended to go into the bathroom and come back with half of Balazars goods Balazar almost believed it himself Claudio Andolini pulled his arm back His fingers came out of Eddie Deans asshole with a plopping sound Claudios mouth twisted like a fishline with knots in it Hurry up Jack I got this junkies shit on my hand Claudio yelled angrily If Id known you were going to be prospecting up there Claudio I would have wiped my ass with a chairleg last time I took a dump Eddie said mildly Your hand would have come out cleaner and I wouldnt be standing here feeling like I just got raped by Ferdinand the Bull Jack Go on down to the kitchen and clean yourself up Balazar said quietly Eddie and I have got no reason to hurt each other Do we Eddie No Eddie said Hes clean anyway Claudio said Well clean aint the word What I mean is he aint holding You can be goddam sure of that He walked out holding his dirty hand in front of him like a dead fish Eddie looked calmly at Balazar who was thinking again of Harry Houdini and Blackstone and Doug Henning and David Copperfield They kept saying that magic acts were as dead as vaudeville but Henning was a superstar and the Copperfield kid had blown the crowd away the one time Balazar had caught his act in Atlantic City  Balazar had loved magicians from the first time he had seen one on a streetcorner doing cardtricks for pocketchange And what was the first thing they always did before making something appearDsomething that would make the whole audience first gasp and then applaud What they did was invite someone up from the audience to make sure that the place from which the rabbit or dove or barebreasted cutie or the whatever was to appear was perfectly empty More than that to make sure there was no way to get anything inside I think maybe hes done it I dont know how and I dont care The only thing I know for sure is that I dont like any of this not one damn bit  George Biondi also had something not to like He doubted if Eddie Dean was going to be wild about it either George was pretty sure that at some point after Cimi had come into the accountants office and doused the lights Henry had died Died quietly with no muss no fuss no bother Had simply floated away like a dandelion spore on a light breeze George thought maybe it had happened right around the time Claudio left to wash his shitty hand in the kitchen Henry George muttered in Henrys ear He put his mouth so close that it was like kissing a girls ear in a movie theater and that was pretty fucking gross especially when you considered that the guy was probably deadDit was like narcophobia or whatever the fuck they called itDbut he had to know and the wall between this office and Balazars was thin Whats wrong George Tricks Postino asked Shut up Cimi said His voice was the low rumble of an idling truck They shut up George slid a hand inside Henrys shirt Oh this was getting worse and worse That image of being with a girl in a movie theater wouldnt leave him Now here he was feeling her up only it wasnt a her but a him this wasnt just narcophobia it was fucking faggot narcophobia and Henrys scrawny junkies chest wasnt moving up and down and there wasnt anything inside going thumpthumpthump For Henry Dean it was all over for Henry Dean the ballgame had been rained out in the seventh inning Wasnt nothing ticking but his watch He moved into the heavy Old Country atmosphere of olive oil and garlic that surrounded Cimi Dretto I think we might have a problem George whispered  Jack came out of the bathroom Theres no dope in there he said and his flat eyes studied Eddie And if you were thinking about the window you can forget it Thats tengauge steel mesh I wasnt thinking about the window and it is in there Eddie said quietly You just dont know where to look Im sorry Mr Balazar Andolini said but this crock is getting just a little too full for me Balazar studied Eddie as if he hadnt even heard Andolini He was thinking very deeply Thinking about magicians pulling rabbits out of hats You got a guy from the audience to check out the fact that the hat was empty What other thing that never changed That no one saw into the hat but the magician of course And what had the kid said Im going to walk into your bathroom Im going in by myself Knowing how a magic trick worked was something he usually wouldnt want to know knowing spoiled the fun Usually This however was a trick he couldnt wait to spoil Fine he said to Eddie If its in there go get it Just like you are Bareass Good Eddie said and started toward the bathroom door But not alone Balazar said Eddie stopped at once his body stiffening as if Balazar had shot him with an invisible harpoon and it did Balazars heart good to see it For the first time something hadnt gone according to the kids plan Jacks going with you No Eddie said at once Thats not what ID Eddie Balazar said gently you dont tell me no Thats one thing you never do  Its all right the gunslinger said Let him come But but  Eddie was close to gibbering barely holding onto his control It wasnt just the sudden curveball Balazar had thrown him it was his gnawing worry over Henry and growing steadily ascendant over all else his need for a fix Let him come It will be all right Listen Eddie listened  Balazar watched him a slim naked man with only the first suggestion of the junkies typical cavechested slouch his head cocked to one side and as he watched Balazar felt some of his confidence evaporate It was as if the kid was listening to a voice only he could hear The same thought passed through Andolinis mind but in a different way Whats this He looks like the dog on those old RCA Victor records Col had wanted to tell him something about Eddies eyes Suddenly Jack Andolini wished he had listened Wish in one hand shit in the other he thought If Eddie had been listening to voices inside his head they had either quit talking or he had quit paying attention Okay he said Come along Jack Ill show you the Eighth Wonder of the World He flashed a smile that neither Jack Andolini or Enrico Balazar cared for in the slightest Is that so Andolini pulled a gun from the clamshell holster attached to his belt at the small of his back Am I gonna be amazed Eddies smile widened Oh yeah I think this is gonna knock your socks off  Andolini followed Eddie into the bathroom He was holding the gun up because his wind was up Close the door Eddie said Fuck you Andolini answered Close the door or no dope Eddie said Fuck you Andolini said again Now a little scared feeling that there was something going on that he didnt understand Andolini looked brighter than he had in the van He wont close the door Eddie yelled at Balazar Im getting ready to give up on you Mr Balazar You probably got six wiseguys in this place every one of them with about four guns and the two of you are going batshit over a kid in a crapper Ajunkie kid Shut the fucking door Jack Balazar shouted Thats right Eddie said as Jack Andolini kicked the door shut behind him Is you a man or is you a mD Oh boy aint I had enough of this turd Andolini said to no one in particular He raised the gun butt forward meaning to pistolwhip Eddie across the mouth Then he froze gun drawn up across his body the snarl that bared his teeth slackening into a slackjawed gape of surprise as he saw what Col Vincent had seen in the van Eddies eyes changed from brown to blue Now grab him a low commanding voice said and although the voice came from Eddies mouth it was not Eddies voice Schizo Jack Andolini thought Hes gone schizo gone fucking schiD But the thought broke off when Eddies hands grabbed his shoulders because when that happened Andolini saw a hole in reality suddenly appear about three feet behind Eddie No not a hole Its dimensions were too perfect for that It was a door Hail Mary fulla grace Jack said in a low breathy moan Through that doorway which hung in space a foot or so above the floor in front of Balazars private shower he could see a dark beach which sloped down to crashing waves Things were moving on that beach Things He brought the gun down but the blow which had been meant to break off all of Eddies front teeth at the gumline did no more than mash Eddies lips back and bloody them a little All the strength was running out of him Jack could feel it happening I told you it was gonna knock your socks off Jack Eddie said and then yanked him Jack realized what Eddie meant to do at the last moment and began to fight like a wildcat but it was too lateDthey were tumbling backward through that doorway and the droning hum of New York City at night so familiar and constant you never even heard it unless it wasnt there anymore was replaced by the grinding sound of the waves and the grating questioning voices of dimly seen horrors crawling to and fro on the beach  Well have to move very fast or well find ourselves basted in a hot oast Roland had said and Eddie was pretty sure the guy meant that if they didnt shuck and jive at damn near the speed of light their gooses were going to be cooked He believed it too When it came to hard guys Jack Andolini was like Dwight Gooden you could rock him yes you could shock him maybe but if you let him get away in the early innings he was going to stomp you flat later on Left hand Roland screamed at himself as they went through and he separated from Eddie Remember Left hand Left hand He saw Eddie and Jack stumble backward fall and then go rolling down the rocky scree that edged the beach struggling for the gun in Andolinis hand Roland had just time to think what a cosmic joke it would be if he arrived back in his own world only to discover that his physical body had died while he had been away  and then it was too late Too late to wonder too late to go back  Andolini didnt know what had happened Part of him was sure he had gone crazy part was sure Eddie had doped him or gassed him or something like that part believed that the vengeful God of his childhood had finally tired of his evils and had plucked him away from the world he knew and set him down in this weird purgatory Then he saw the door standing open spilling a fan of white light  the light from Balazars JohnDonto the rocky groundDand understood it was possible to get back Andolini was a practical man above all else He would worry about what all this meant later on Right now he intended to kill this creeps ass and get back through that door The strength that had gone out of him in his shocked surprise now flooded back He realized Eddie was trying to pull his small but very efficient Colt Cobra out of his hand and had nearly succeeded Jack pulled it back with a curse tried to aim and Eddie promptly grabbed his arm again Andolini hoisted a knee into the big muscle of Eddies right thigh the expensive gabardine of Andolinis slacks was now crusted with dirty gray beach sand and Eddie screamed as the muscle seized up Roland he cried Help me For Christs sake help me Andolini snapped his head around and what he saw threw him offbalance again There was a guy standing there  only he looked more like a ghost than a guy Not exactly Casper the Friendly Ghost either The swaying figures white haggard face was rough with beardstubble His shirt was in tatters which blew back behind him in twisted ribbons showing the starved stack of his ribs A filthy rag was wrapped around his right hand He looked sick sick and dying but even so he also looked tough enough to make Andolini feel like a softboiled egg And the joker was wearing a pair of guns They looked older than the hills old enough to have come from a Wild West museum  but they were guns just the same they might even really work and Andolini suddenly realized he was going to have to take care of the whitefaced man right away  unless he really was a spook and if that was the case it wouldnt matter fuckall so there was really no sense worrying about it Andolini let go of Eddie and snaprolled to the right barely feeling the edge of rock that tore open his fivehundreddollar sport jacket At the same instant the gunslinger drew lefthanded and his draw was as it had always been sick or well wide awake or still half asleep faster than a streak of blue summer lightning Im beat Andolini thought full of sick wonder Christ hes faster than anybody I ever saw Im beat holy Mary Mother of God hes gonna blow me away hes gD The man in the ragged shirt pulled the trigger of the revolver in his left hand and Jack Andolini thoughtDreally thoughtDhe was dead before he realized there had been only a dull click instead of a report Misfire Smiling Andolini rose to his knees and raised his own gun I dont know who you are but you can kiss your ass goodbye you fucking spook he said  Eddie sat up shivering his naked body pocked with goosebumps He saw Roland draw heard the dry snap that should have been a bang saw Andolini come up on his knees heard him say something and before he really knew what he was doing his hand had found a ragged chunk of rock He pulled it out of the grainy earth and threw it as hard as he could It struck Andolini high on the back of the head and bounced away Blood sprayed from a ragged hanging flap in Jack Andolinis scalp Andolini fired but the bullet that surely would have killed the gunslinger otherwise went wild  Not really wild the gunslinger could have told Eddie When you feel the wind of the slug on your cheek you cant really call it wild He thumbed the hammer of his gun back and pulled the trigger again as he recoiled from Andolinis shot This time the bullet in the chamber firedDthe dry authoritative crack echoed up and down the beach Gulls asleep on rocks high above the lobstrosities awoke and flew upward in screaming startled packs The gunslingers bullet would have stopped Andolini for good in spite of his own involuntary recoil but by then Andolini was also in motion falling sideways dazed by the blow on the head The crack of the gunslingers revolver seemed distant but the searing poker it plunged into his left arm shattering the elbow was real enough It brought him out of his daze and he rose to his feet one arm hanging broken and useless the gun wavering wildly about in his other hand looking for a target It was Eddie he saw first Eddie the junkie Eddie who had somehow brought him to this crazy place Eddie was standing there as naked as the day he had been born shivering in the chilly wind clutching himself with both arms Well he might die here but he would at least have the pleasure of taking Eddie Fucking Dean with him Andolini brought his gun up The little Cobra now seemed to weigh about twenty pounds but he managed  This better not be another misfire Roland thought grimly and thumbed the hammer back again Below the din of the gulls he heard the smooth oiled click as the chamber revolved  It was no misfire  The gunslinger hadnt aimed at Andolinis head but at the gun in Andolinis hand He didnt know if they still needed this man but they might he was important to Balazar and because Balazar had proved to be every bit as dangerous as Roland had thought he might be the best course was the safest one His shot was good and that was no surprise what happened to Andolinis gun and hence to Andolini was Roland had seen it happen but only twice in all the years he had seen men fire guns at each other Bad luck for you fellow the gunslinger thought as Andolini wandered off toward the beach screaming Blood poured down his shirt and pants The hand which had been holding the Colt Cobra was missing below the middle of the palm The gun was a senseless piece of twisted metal lying on the sand Eddie stared at him stunned No one would ever misjudge Jack Andolinis caveman face again because now he had no face where it had been there was now nothing but a churned mess of raw flesh and the black screaming hole of his mouth My God what happened My bullet must have struck the cylinder of his gun at the second he pulled the trigger the gunslinger said He spoke as dryly as a professor giving a police academy ballistics lecture The result was an explosion that tore the back off his gun I think one or two of the other cartridges may have exploded as well Shoot him Eddie said He was shivering harder than ever and now it wasnt just the combination of night air sea breeze and naked body that was causing it Kill him Put him out of his misery for Gods s   Too late the gunslinger said with a cold indifference that chilled Eddies flesh all the way in to the bone And Eddie turned away just too late to avoid seeing the lobstrosities swarm over Andolinis feet tearing off his Gucci loafers  with the feet still inside them of course Screaming waving his arms spasmodically before him Andolini fell forward The lobstrosities swarmed greedily over him questioning him anxiously all the while they were eating him alive Dadachack Didachick Dumachum Dodachock Jesus Eddie moaned What do we do now Now you get exactly as much of the devilpowder the gunslinger said cocaine Eddie heard as you promised the man Balazar Roland said no more and no less And we go back He looked levelly at Eddie Only this time I have to go back with you As myself Jesus Christ Eddie said Can you do that And at once answered his own question Sure you can But why Because you cant handle this alone Roland said Come here Eddie looked back at the squirming hump of clawed creatures on the beach He had never liked Jack Andolini but he felt his stomach roll over just the same Come here Roland said impatiently Weve little time and I have little liking for what I must do now Its something Ive never done before Never thought I would do His lips twisted bitterly Im getting used to doing things like that Eddie approached the scrawny figure slowly on legs that felt more and more like rubber His bare skin was white and glimmering in the alien dark Just who are you Roland he thought What are you And that heat I feel baking off youDis it just fever Or some kind of madness I think it might be both God he needed a fix More he deserved a fix Never done what before he asked What are you talking about Take this Roland said and gestured at the ancient revolver slung low on his right hip Did not point there was no finger to point with only a bulky ragwrapped bundle Its no good to me Not now perhaps never again I  Eddie swallowed I dont want to touch it I dont want you to either the gunslinger said with curious gentleness but Im afraid neither of us has a choice Theres going to be shooting There is Yes The gunslinger looked serenely at Eddie Quite a lot of it I think  Balazar had become more and more uneasy Too long They had been in there too long and it was too quiet Distantly maybe on the next block he could hear people shouting at each other and then a couple of rattling reports that were probably firecrackers  but when you were in the sort of business Balazar was in firecrackers werent the first thing you thought of A scream Was that a scream Never mind Whatevers happening on the next block has nothing to do with you Youre turning into an old woman All the same the signs were bad Very bad Jack he yelled at the closed bathroom door There was no answer Balazar opened the left front drawer of his desk and took out the gun This was no Colt Cobra cozy enough to fit in a clamshell holster it was a  Magnum  Cimi he shouted I want you He slammed the drawer The tower of cards fell with a soft sighing thump Balazar didnt even notice Cimi Dretto all two hundred and fifty pounds of him filled the doorway He saw that Da Boss had pulled his gun out of the drawer and Cimi immediately pulled his own from beneath a plaid jacket so loud it could have caused flashburns on anyone who made the mistake of looking at it too long I want Claudio and Tricks he said Get them quick The kid is up to something We got a problem Cimi said Balazars eyes flicked from the bathroom door to Cimi Oh I got plenty of those already he said Whats this new one Cimi Cimi licked his lips He didnt like telling Da Boss bad news even under the best of circumstances when he looked like this  Well he said and licked his lips You seeD Will you hurry the fuck up Balazar yelled  The sandalwood grips of the revolver were so smooth that Eddies first act upon receiving it was to nearly drop it on his toes The thing was so big it looked prehistoric so heavy he knew he would have to lift it twohanded The recoil he thought is apt to drive me right through the nearest wall Thats if it fires at all Yet there was some part of him that wanted to hold it that responded to its perfectly expressed purpose that sensed its dim and bloody history and wanted to be part of it No one but the best ever held this baby in his hand Eddie thought Until now at least Are you ready Roland asked No but lets do it Eddie said He gripped Rolands left wrist with his left hand Roland slid his hot right arm around Eddies bare shoulders Together they stepped back through the doorway from the windy darkness of the beach in Rolands dying world to the cool fluorescent glare of Balazars private bathroom in The Leaning Tower Eddie blinked adjusting his eyes to the light and heard Cimi Dretto in the other room We got a problem Cimi was saying Dont we all Eddie thought and then his eyes riveted on Balazars medicine chest It was standing open In his mind he heard Balazar telling Jack to search the bathroom and heard Andolini asking if there was any place in there he wouldnt know about Balazar had paused before replying There is a small panel on the back wall of the medicine cabinet he had said Ikeep a few personal things in there Andolini had slid the metal panel open but had neglected to close it Roland he hissed Roland raised his own gun and pressed the barrel against his lips in a shushing gesture Eddie crossed silently to the medicine chest A few personal things  there was a bottle of suppositories a copy of a blearily printed magazine called Childs Play the cover depicting two naked girls of about eight engaged in a soulkiss  and eight or ten sample packages of Keflex Eddie knew what Keflex was Junkies prone as they were to infections both general and local usually knew Keflex was an antibiotic Oh I got plenty of those already Balazar was saying He sounded harried Whats this new one Cimi If this doesnt knock out whatevers wrong with him nothing will Eddie thought He began to grab the packages and went to stuff them into his pockets He realized he had no pockets and uttered a harsh bark that wasnt even close to laughter He began to dump them into the sink He would have to pick them up later  if there was a later Well Cimi was saying you seeD Will you hurry the fuck up Balazar yelled Its the kids big brother Cimi said and Eddie froze with the last two packages of Keflex still in his hand his head cocked He looked more like the dog on the old RCA Victor records than ever What about him Balazar asked impatiently Hes dead Cimi said Eddie dropped the Keflex into the sink and turned toward Roland They killed my brother he said  Balazar opened his mouth to tell Cimi not to bother him with a bunch of crap when he had important things to worry aboutDlike this impossibletoshake feeling that the kid was going to fuck him Andolini or no Andolini  when he heard the kid as clearly as the kid had no doubt heard him and Cimi They killed my brother the kid said Suddenly Balazar didnt care about his goods about the unanswered questions or anything except bringing this situation to a screeching halt before it could get any weirder Kill him Jack he shouted There was no response Then he heard the kid say it again They killed my brother They killed Henry Balazar suddenly knewDknewD it wasnt Jack the kid was talking to Get all the gentlemen he said to Cimi All of them Were gonna burn his ass and when hes dead were gonna take him in the kitchen and Im gonna personally chop his head off  They killed my brother the prisoner said The gunslinger said nothing He only watched and thought The bottles In the sink Thats what I need or what he thinks I need The packets Dont forget Dont forget From the other room Kill him Jack Neither Eddie nor the gunslinger took any notice of this They killed my brother They killed Henry In the other room Balazar was now talking about taking Eddies head as a trophy The gunslinger found some odd comfort in this not everything in this world was different from his own it seemed The one called Cimi began shouting hoarsely for the others There was an ungentlemanly thunder of running feet Do you want to do something about it or do you just want to stand here Roland asked Oh I want to do something about it Eddie said and raised the gunslingers revolver Although only moments ago he had believed he would need both hands to do it he found that he could do it easily And what is it you want to do Roland asked and his voice seemed distant to his own ears He was sick full of fever but what was happening to him now was the onset of a different fever one which was all too familiar It was the fever that had overtaken him in Tull It was battlefire hazing all thought leaving only the need to stop thinking and start shooting I want to go to war Eddie Dean said calmly You dont know what youre talking about Roland said but you are going to find out When we go through the door you go right I have to go left My hand Eddie nodded They went to their war  Balazar had expected Eddie or Andolini or both of them He had not expected Eddie and an utter stranger a tall man with dirty grayblack hair and a face that looked as if it had been chiseled from obdurate stone by some savage god For a moment he was not sure which way to fire Cimi however had no such problems Da Boss was mad at Eddie Therefore he would punch Eddies clock first and worry about the other catzarro later Cimi turned ponderously toward Eddie and pulled the trigger of his automatic three times The casings jumped and gleamed in the air Eddie saw the big man turning and went into a mad slide along the floor whizzing along like some kid in a disco contest a kid so jivedup he didnt realize hed left his entire John Travolta outfit underwear included behind he went with his wang wagging and his bare knees first heating and then scorching as the friction built up Holes punched through plastic that was supposed to look like knotty pine just above him Slivers of it rained down on his shoulders and into his hair Dont let me die naked and needing a fix God he prayed knowing such a prayer was more than blasphemous it was an absurdity Still he was unable to stop it Ill die but please just let me have one moreD The revolver in the gunslingers left hand crashed On the open beach it had been loud over here it was deafening Oh Jeez Cimi Dretto screamed in a strangled breathy voice It was a wonder he could scream at all His chest suddenly caved in as if someone had swung a sledgehammer at a barrel His white shirt began to turn red in patches as if poppies were blooming on it Oh Jeez Oh Jeez Oh JD Claudio Andolini shoved him aside Cimi fell with a thud Two of the framed pictures on Balazars wall crashed down The one showing Da Boss presenting the Sportsman of the Year trophy to a grinning kid at a Police Athletic League banquet landed on Cimis head Shattered glass fell on his shoulders oh jeez he whispered in a fainting little voice and blood began to bubble from his lips Claudio was followed by Tricks and one of the men who had been waiting in the storage room Claudio had an automatic in each hand the guy from the storage room had a Remington shotgun sawed off so short that it looked like a derringer with a case of the mumps Tricks Postino was carrying what he called The Wonderful Rambo MachineDthis was an M rapidfire assault weapon Wheres my brother you fucking needlefreak Claudio screamed Whatd you do to Jack He could not have been terribly interested in an answer because he began to fire with both weapons while he was still yelling Im dead Eddie thought and then Roland fired again Claudio Andolini was propelled backwards in a cloud of his own blood The automatics flew from his hands and slid across Balazars desk They thumped to the carpet amid a flutter of playing cards Most of Claudios guts hit the wall a second before Claudio caught up with them Get him Balazar was shrieking Get the spook The kid aint dangerous Hes nothing but a bareass junkie Get the spook Blow him away He pulled the trigger on the  twice The Magnum was almost as loud as Rolands revolver It did not make neat holes in the wall against which Roland crouched the slugs smashed gaping wounds in the fake wood to either side of Rolands head White light from the bathroom shone through the holes in ragged rays Roland pulled the trigger of his revolver Only a dry click Misfire Eddie the gunslinger yelled and Eddie raised his own gun and pulled the trigger The crash was so loud that for a moment he thought the gun had blown up in his hand as Jacks had done The recoil did not drive him back through the wall but it did snap his arm up in a savage arc that jerked all the tendons under his arm He saw part of Balazars shoulder disintegrate into red spray heard Balazar screech like a wounded cat and yelled The junkie aint dangerous was that what you said Was that it you numb fuck You want to mess with me and my brother Ill show you whos dangerous Ill shD There was a boom like a grenade as the guy from the storage room fired the sawedoff Eddie rolled as the blast tore a hundred tiny holes in the walls and bathroom door His naked skin was seared by shot in several places and Eddie understood that if the guy had been closer where the things pattern was tight he would have been vaporized Hell Im dead anyway he thought watching as the guy from the storage room worked the Remingtons jack pumping in fresh cartridges then laying it over his forearm He was grinning His teeth were very yellowDEddie didnt think they had been acquainted with a toothbrush in quite some time Christ Im going to get killed by some fuckhead with yellow teeth and I dont even know his name Eddie thought dimly At least I put one in Balazar At least I did that much He wondered if Roland had another shot He couldnt remember I got him Tricks Postino yelled cheerfully Gimme a clear field Dario And before the man named Dario could give him a clear field or anything else Tricks opened up with The Wonderful Rambo Machine The heavy thunder of machinegun fire filled Balazars office The first result of this barrage was to save Eddie Deans life Dario had drawn a bead on him with the sawedoff but before he could pull its double triggers Tricks cut him in half Stop it you idiot Balazar screamed But Tricks either didnt hear couldnt stop or wouldnt stop Lips pulled back from his teeth so that his spitshining teeth were bared in a huge sharks grin he raked the room from one end to the other blowing two of the wall panels to dust turning framed photographs into clouds of flying glass fragments hammering the bathroom door off its hinges The frosted glass of Balazars shower stall exploded The March of Dimes trophy Balazar had gotten the year before bonged like a bell as a slug drove through it In the movies people actually kill other people with handheld rapidfire weapons In real life this rarely happens If it does it happens with the first four or five slugs fired as the unfortunate Dario could have testified if he had ever been capable of testifying to anything again After the first four or five two things happen to a manDeven a powerful oneDtrying to control such a weapon The muzzle begins to rise and the shooter himself begins to turn either right or left depending on which unfortunate shoulder he has decided to bludgeon with the weapons recoil In short only a moron or a movie star would attempt the use of such a gun it was like trying to shoot someone with a pneumatic drill For a moment Eddie was incapable of any action more constructive than staring at this perfect marvel of idiocy Then he saw other men crowding through the door behind Tricks and raised Rolands revolver Got him Tricks was screaming with the joyous hysteria of a man who has seen too many movies to be able to distinguish between what the script in his head says should be happening and what really is Got him I got him I gD Eddie pulled the trigger and vaporized Tricks from the eyebrows up Judging from the mans behavior that was not a great deal Jesus Christ when these things do shoot they really blow holes in things he thought There was a loudKABLAM from Eddies left Something tore a hot gouge in his underdeveloped left bicep He saw Balazar pointing the Mag at him from behind the corner of his cardlittered desk His shoulder was a dripping red mass Eddie ducked as the Magnum crashed again  Roland managed to get into a crouch aimed at the first of the new men coming in through the door and squeezed the trigger He had rolled the cylinder dumped the used loads and the duds onto the carpet and had loaded this one fresh shell He had done it with his teeth Balazar had pinned Eddie down Ifthis ones a dud I think were both gone It wasnt The gun roared recoiled in his hand and Jimmy Haspio spun aside the  he had been holding falling from his dying fingers Roland saw the other man duck back and then he was crawling through the splinters of wood and glass that littered the floor He dropped his revolver back into its holster The idea of reloading again with two of his right fingers missing was a joke Eddie was doing well The gunslinger measured just how well by the fact that he was fighting naked That was hard for a man Sometimes impossible The gunslinger grabbed one of the automatic pistols Claudio Andolini had dropped What are the rest of you guys waiting for Balazar screamed Jesus Eat these guys Big George Biondi and the other man from the supply room charged in through the door The man from the supply room was bawling something in Italian Roland crawled to the corner of the desk Eddie rose aiming toward the door and the charging men He knows Balazars there waiting but he thinks hes the only one of us with a gun now Roland thought Here is another one ready to die for you Roland What great wrong did you ever do that you should inspire such terrible loyalty in so many Balazar rose not seeing the gunslinger was now on his flank Balazar was thinking of only one thing finally putting an end to the goddam junkie who had brought this ruin down on his head No the gunslinger said and Balazar looked around at him surprise stamped on his features Fuck yD Balazar began bringing the Magnum around The gunslinger shot him four times with Claudios automatic It was a cheap little thing not much better than a toy and touching it made his hand feel dirty but it was perhaps fitting to kill a despicable man with a despicable weapon Enrico Balazar died with an expression of terminal surprise on what remained of his face Hi George Eddie said and pulled the trigger of the gunslingers revolver That satisfying crash came again No duds in this baby Eddie thought crazily Iguess I must have gotten the good one George got off one shot before Eddies bullet drove him back into the screaming man bowling him over like a ninepin but it went wild An irrational but utterly persuasive feeling had come over him a feeling that Rolands gun held some magical talismanic power of protection As long as he held it he couldnt be hurt Silence fell then a silence in which Eddie could hear only the man under Big George moaning when George landed on Rudy Vechhio which was this unfortunate fellows name he had fractured three of Vechhios ribs and the high ringing in his own ears He wondered if he would ever hear right again The shooting spree which now seemed to be over made the loudest rock concert Eddie had ever been to sound like a radio playing two blocks over by comparison Balazars office was no longer recognizable as a room of any kind Its previous function had ceased to matter Eddie looked around with the wide wondering eyes of a very young man seeing something like this for the first time but Roland knew the look and the look was always the same Whether it was an open field of battle where thousands had died by cannon rifle sword and halberd or a small room where five or six had shot each other it was the same place always the same place in the end another deadhouse stinking of gunpowder and raw meat The wall between the bathroom and the office was gone except for a few struts Broken glass twinkled everywhere Ceiling panels that had been shredded by Tricks Postinos gaudy but useless M fireworks display hung down like pieces of peeled skin Eddie coughed dryly Now he could hear other soundsDa babble of excited conversation shouted voices outside the bar and in the distance the warble of sirens How many the gunslinger asked Eddie Can we have gotten all of them Yes I thinkD I got something for you Eddie Kevin Blake said from the hallway I thought you might want it like for a souvenir you know What Balazar had not been able to do to the younger Dean brother Kevin had done to the elder He lobbed Henry Deans severed head through the doorway Eddie saw what it was and screamed He ran toward the door heedless of the splinters of glass and wood that punched into his bare feet screaming shooting firing the last live shell in the big revolver as he went No Eddie Roland screamed but Eddie didnt hear He was beyond hearing He hit a dud in the sixth chamber but by then he was aware of nothing but the fact that Henry was dead Henry they had cut off his head some miserable son of a bitch had cut off Henrys head and that son of a bitch was going to pay oh yes you could count on that So he ran toward the door pulling the trigger again and again unaware that nothing was happening unaware that his feet were red with blood and Kevin Blake stepped into the doorway to meet him crouched low a Llama  automatic in his hand Kevins red hair stood around his head in coils and springs and Kevin was smiling  Hell be low the gunslinger thought knowing he could have to be lucky to hit his target with this untrustworthy little toy even if he had guessed right When he saw the ruse of Balazars soldier was going to draw Eddie out Roland rose to his knees and steadied his left hand on his right fist grimly ignoring the screech of pain making that fist caused He would have one chance only The pain didnt matter Then the man with the red hair stepped into the doorway smiling and as always Rolands brain was gone his eye saw his hand shot and suddenly the redhead was lying against the wall of the corridor with his eyes open and a small blue hole in his forehead Eddie was standing over him screaming and sobbing dryfiring the big revolver with the sandalwood grips again and again as if the man with the red hair could never be dead enough The gunslinger waited for the deadly crossfire that would cut Eddie in half and when it didnt come he knew it was truly over If there had been other soldiers they had taken to their heels He got wearily to his feet reeled and then walked slowly over to where Eddie Dean stood Stop it he said Eddie ignored him and went on dryfiring Rolands big gun at the dead man Stop it Eddie hes dead Theyre all dead Your feet are bleeding Eddie ignored him and went on pulling the revolvers trigger The babble of excited voices outside was closer So were the sirens The gunslinger reached for the gun and pulled on it Eddie turned on him and before Roland was entirely sure what was happening Eddie struck him on the side of the head with his own gun Roland felt a warm gush of blood and collapsed against the wall He struggled to stay on his feetDthey had to get out of here quick But he could feel himself sliding down the wall in spite of his every effort and then the world was gone for a little while in a drift of grayness  He was out for no more than two minutes and then he managed to get things back into focus and make it to his feet Eddie was no longer in the hallway Rolands gun lay on the chest of the dead man with the red hair The gunslinger bent fighting off a wave of dizziness picked it up and dropped it into its holster with an awkward crossbody movement I want my damned fingers back he thought tiredly and sighed He tried to walk back into the ruins of the office but the best he could manage was an educated stagger He stopped bent and picked up all of Eddies clothes that he could hold in the crook of his left arm The howlers had almost arrived Roland believed the men winding them were probably militia a Marshall s posse something of that sort  but there was always the possibility they might be more of Balazars men Eddie he croaked His throat was sore and throbbing again worse even than the swollen place on the side of his head where Eddie had struck him with the revolver Eddie didnt notice Eddie was sitting on the floor with his brothers head cradled against his belly He was shuddering all over and crying The gunslinger looked for the door didnt see it and felt a nasty jolt that was nearly terror Then he remembered With both of them on this side the only way to create the door was for him to make physical contact with Eddie He reached for him but Eddie shrank away still weeping Dont touch me he said Eddie its over Theyre all dead and your brothers dead too Leave my brother out of this Eddie shrieked childishly and another fit of shuddering went through him He cradled the severed head to his chest and rocked it He lifted his streaming eyes to the gunslingers face All the times he took care of me man he said sobbing so hard the gunslinger could barely understand him All the times Why couldnt I have taken care of him just this once after all the times he took care of me He took care of you all right Roland thought grimly Look at you sitting there and shaking like a man whos eaten an apple from the fever tree He took care of you just fine We have to go Go for the first time some vague understanding came into Eddies face and it was followed immediately by alarm I aint going nowhere Especially not back to that other place where those big crabs or whatever they are ate Jack Someone was hammering on the door yelling to open up Do you want to stay here and explain all these bodies the gunslinger asked I dont care Eddie said Without Henry it doesnt matter Nothing does Maybe it doesnt matter to you Roland said but there are others involved prisoner Dont call me that Eddie shouted Illcall you that until you show me you can walk out of the cell youre in Roland shouted back It hurt his throat to yell but he yelled just the same Throw that rotten piece of meat away and stop puling Eddie looked at him cheeks wet eyes wide and frightened THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE an amplified voice said from outside To Eddie the voice sounded eerily like the voice of a gameshow host THE SWAT SQUAD HAS ARRIVEDDI REPEAT THE SWAT SQUAD HAS ARRIVED Whats on the other side of that door for me Eddie asked the gunslinger quietly Go on and tell me If you can tell me maybe Ill come But if you lie Ill know Probably death the gunslinger said But before that happens I dont think youll be bored I want you to join me on a quest Of course all will probably end in deathDdeath for the four of us in a strange place But if we should win through  His eyes gleamed If we win through Eddie youll see something beyond all the beliefs of all your dreams What thing The Dark Tower  Where is this Tower Far from the beach where you found me How far I know not What is it I dont know that eitherDexcept that it may be a kind of  of a bolt A central linchpin that holds all of existence together All existence all time and all size You said four Who are the other two I know them not for they have yet to be drawn As I was drawn Or as youd like to draw me Yes From outside there was a coughing explosion like a mortar round The glass of The Leaning Towers front window blew in The barroom began to fill with choking clouds of teargas Well Roland asked He could grab Eddie force the doorway into existence by their contact and pummel them both through But he had seen Eddie risk his life for him he had seen this hagridden man behave with all the dignity of a born gunslinger in spite of his addiction and the fact that he had been forced to fight as naked as the day he was born and he wanted Eddie to decide for himself Quests adventures towers worlds to win Eddie said and smiled wanly Neither of them turned as fresh teargas rounds flew through the windows to explode hissing on the floor The first acrid tendrils of the gas were now slipping into Balazars office Sounds better than one of those Edgar Rice Burroughs books about Mars Henry used to read me sometimes when we were kids You only left out one thing Whats that The beautiful barebreasted girls The gunslinger smiled On the way to the Dark Tower  he said anything is possible Another shudder wracked Eddies body He raised Henrys head kissed one cool ashcolored cheek and laid the gorestreaked relic gently aside He got to his feet Okay he said I didnt have anything else planned for tonight anyway Take these Roland said and shoved the clothes at him Put on your shoes if nothing else Youve cut your feet On the sidewalk outside two cops wearing Plexiglas faceplates flak jackets and Kevlar vests smashed in The Leaning Towers front door In the bathroom Eddie dressed in his underpants his Adidas sneakers and nothing else handed the sample packages of Keflex to Roland one by one and Roland put them into the pockets of Eddies jeans When they were all safely stowed Roland slid his right arm around Eddies neck again and Eddie gripped Rolands left hand again The door was suddenly there a rectangle of darkness Eddie felt the wind from that other world blow his sweaty hair back from his forehead He heard the waves rolling up that stony beach He smelled the tang of sour seasalt And in spite of everything all his pain and sorrow he suddenly wanted to see this Tower of which Roland spoke He wanted to see it very much And with Henry dead what was there in this world for him Their parents were dead and there hadnt been a steady girl since he got heavily into the smack three years agoDjust a steady parade of sluts needlers and nosers None of them straight Fuck that action They stepped through Eddie actually leading a little On the other side he was suddenly wracked with fresh shudders and agonizing musclecrampsDthe first symptoms of serious heroin withdrawal And with them he also had the first alarmed second thoughts Wait he shouted I want to go back for a minute His desk His desk or the other office The skag If they were keeping Henry doped theres gotta be junk Heroin I need it I need it He looked pleadingly at Roland but the gunslingers face was stony That part of your life is over Eddie he said He reached out with his left hand No Eddie screamed clawing at him No you dont get it man I need it I NEED IT He might as well have been clawing stone The gunslinger swept the door shut It made a dull clapping sound that bespoke utter finality and fell backward onto the sand A little dust puffed up from its edges There was nothing behind the door and now no word written upon it This particular portal between the worlds had closed forever NO Eddie screamed and the gulls screamed back at him as if in jeering contempt the lobstrosities asked him questions perhaps suggesting he could hear them a little better if he were to come a little closer and Eddie fell over on his side crying and shuddering and jerking with cramps Your need will pass the gunslinger said and managed to get one of the sample packets out of the pocket of Eddies jeans which were so like his own Again he could read some of these letters but not all Cheeflet the word looked like Cheeflet Medicine from that other world Kill or cure Roland murmured and dryswallowed two of the capsules Then he took the other three astin and lay next to Eddie and took him in his arms as well as he could and after some difficult time both of them slept SHUFFLE The time following that night was broken time for Roland time that didnt really exist as time at all What he remembered was only a series of images moments conversation without context images flashing past like oneeyed jacks and treys and nines and the Bloody Black Bitch Queen of Spiders in a cardsharps rapid shuffle Later on he asked Eddie how long that time lasted but Eddie didnt know either Time had been destroyed for both of them There is no time in hell and each of them was in his own private hell Roland the hell of the fever and infection Eddie the hell of withdrawal It was less than a week Eddie said Thats all I know for sure How do you know that A weeks worth of pills was all I had to give you After that you were gonna have to do the one thing or the other on your own Get well or die Right shuffle Theres a gunshot as twilight draws down to dark a dry crack impinging on the inevitable and ineluctable sound of the breakers dying on the desolate beach KABLAM He smells a whiff of gunpowder Trouble the gunslinger thinks weakly and gropes for revolvers that arent there Oh no its the end its  But theres no more as something starts to smell shuffle good in the dark Something after all this long dark dry time something is cooking Its not just the smell He can hear the snap and pop of twigs can see the faint orange flicker of a campfire Sometimes when the seabreeze gusts he smells fragrant smoke as well as that mouthwatering other smell Food he thinks My God am I hungry If Im hungry maybeIm getting well Eddie he tries to say but his voice is all gone His throat hurts hurts so bad We should have brought some astin too he thinks and then tries to laugh all the drugs for him none for Eddie Eddie appears Hes got a tin plate one the gunslinger would know anywhere it came after all from his own purse On it are steaming chunks of whitishpink meat What he tries to ask and nothing comes out but a squeaky little farting sound Eddie reads the shape of his lips I dont know he says crossly All I know is it didnt kill me Eat it damn you He sees Eddie is very pale Eddie is shaking and he smells something coming from Eddie that is either shit or death and he knows Eddie is in a bad way He reaches out a groping hand wanting to give comfort Eddie strikes it away Ill feed you he says crossly Fucked if I know why I ought to kill you I would if I didnt think that if you could get through into my world once maybe you could do it again Eddie looks around And if it wasnt that Id be alone Except for them He looks back at Roland and a fit of shuddering runs through himDit is so fierce that he almost spills the chunks of meat on the tin plate At last it passes Eat God damn you The gunslinger eats The meat is more than not bad the meat is delicious He manages three pieces and then everything blurs into a new shuffle effort to speak but all he can do is whisper The cup of Eddies ear is pressed against his lips except every now and then it shudders away as Eddie goes through one of his spasms He says it again North Up  up the beach How do you know Just know he whispers Eddie looks at him Youre crazy he says The gunslinger smiles and tries to black out but Eddie slaps him slaps him hard Rolands blue eyes fly open and for a moment they are so alive and electric Eddie looks uneasy Then his lips draw back in a smile that is mostly snarl Yeah you can drone off he said but first you gotta take your dope Its time Sun says it is anyway I guess I was never no Boy Scout so I dont know for sure But I guess its close enough for Government work Open wide Roland Open wide for Dr Eddie you kidnapping fuck The gunslinger opens his mouth like a baby for the breast Eddie puts two of the pills in his mouth and then slops fresh water carelessly into Rolands mouth Roland guesses it must be from a hill stream somewhere to the east It might be poison Eddie wouldnt know fair water from foul On the other hand Eddie seems fine himself and theres really no choice is there No He swallows coughs and nearly strangles while Eddie looks at him indifferently Roland reaches for him Eddie tries to draw away The gunslingers bullshooter eyes command him Roland draws him close so close he can smell the stink of Eddies sickness and Eddie can smell the stink of his the combination sickens and compels them both Only two choices here Roland whispers Dont know how it is in your world but only two choices here Stand and maybe live or die on your knees with your head down and the stink of your own armpits in your nose Nothing  He hacks out a cough Nothing to me Who are you Eddie screams at him Your destiny Eddie the gunslinger whispers Why dont you just eat shit and die Eddie asks him The gunslinger tries to speak but before he can he floats off as the cards shuffle KABLAM Roland opens his eyes on a billion stars wheeling through the blackness then closes them again He doesnt know whats going on but he thinks everythings okay The decks still moving the cards still shuffle More of the sweet tasty chunks of meat He feels better Eddie looks better too But he also looks worried Theyre getting closer he says They may be ugly but they aint completely stupid They know what I been doing Somehow they know and they dont dig it Every night they get a little closer It might be smart to move on when daybreak comes if you can Or it might be the last daybreak we ever see What This is not exactly a whisper but a husk somewhere between a whisper and real speech Them Eddie says and gestures toward the beach Dadachack dumachum and all that shit I think theyre like us RolandDall for eating but not too big on getting eaten Suddenly in an utter blast of horror Roland realizes what the whitishpink chunks of meat Eddie has been feeding him have been He cannot speak revulsion robs him of what little voice he has managed to get back But Eddie sees everything he wants to say on his face What did you think I was doing he nearly snarls Calling Red Lobster for takeout Theyre poison Roland whispers Thats whyD Yeah thats why youre hors de combat What Im trying to keep from you being Roland my friend is hors doeuvres as well As far as poison goes rattlesnakes are poison but people eat them Rattlesnake tastes real good Like chicken I read that somewhere They looked like lobsters to me so I decided to take a chance What else were we gonna eat Dirt I shot one of the fuckers and cooked the living Christ out of it There wasnt anything else And actually they taste pretty good I been shooting one a night just after the sun starts to go down Theyre not real lively until it gets completely dark I never saw you turning the stuff down Eddie smiles I like to think maybe I got one of the ones that ate Jack I like to think Im eating that dink It like eases my mind you know One of them ate part of me too the gunslinger husks out Two fingers one toe Thats also cool Eddie keeps smiling His face is pallid sharklike  but some of that ill look has gone now and the smell of shit and death which has hung around him like a shroud seems to be going away Fuck yourself the gunslinger husks Roland shows a flash of spirit Eddie cries Maybe you aint gonna die after all Dahling I think thats mahvellous Live Roland says The husk has become a whisper again The fishhooks are returning to his throat Yeah Eddie looks at him then nods and answers his own question Yeah I think you mean to Once I thought you were going and once I thought you were gone Now it looks like youre going to get better The antibiotics are helping I guess but mostly I think youre hauling yourself up What for Why the fuck do you keep trying so hard to keep alive on this scuzzy beach Tower he mouths because now he cant even manage a husk You and your fucking Tower Eddie says starts to turn away and then turns back surprised as Rolands hand clamps on his arm like a manacle They look into each others eyes and Eddie says All right All right North the gunslinger mouths North I told you Has he told him that He thinks so but its lost Lost in the shuffle How do you know Eddie screams at him in sudden frustration He raises his fists as if to strike Roland then lowers them I just knowDso why do you waste my time and energy asking me foolish questions he wants to reply but before he can the cards shuffle being dragged along bounced and bumped his head lolling helplessly from one side to the other bound to some kind of a weird travois by his own gunbelts and he can hear Eddie Dean singing a song which is so weirdly familiar he at first believes this must be a delirium dream Heyy Jude dont make it bad take a saaad song and make it better  Where did you hear that he wants to ask Did you hear mesinging it Eddie And where are we But before he can ask anything shuffle Cort would bash the kids head in if he saw that contraption Roland thinks looking at the travois upon which he has spent the day and laughs It isnt much of a laugh It sounds like one of those waves dropping its load of stones on the beach He doesnt know how far they have come but its far enough for Eddie to be totally bushed Hes sitting on a rock in the lengthening light with one of the gunslingers revolvers in his lap and a halffull waterskin to one side Theres a small bulge in his shirt pocket These are the bullets from the back of the gunbeltsDthe diminishing supply of good bullets Eddie has tied these up in a piece of his own shirt The main reason the supply of good bullets is diminishing so fast is because one of every four or five has also turned out to be a dud Eddie who has been nearly dozing now looks up What are you laughing about he asks The gunslinger waves a dismissive hand and shakes his head Because hes wrong he realizes Cort wouldnt bash Eddie for the travois even though it was an odd lamelooking thing Roland thinks it might even be possible that Cort might grunt some word of complimentDsuch a rarity that the boy to whom it happened hardly ever knew how to respond he was left gaping like a fish just pulled from a cooks barrel The main supports were two cottonwood branches of approximately the same length and thickness A blowdown the gunslinger presumed He had used smaller branches as supports attaching them to the support poles with a crazy conglomeration of stuff gunbelts the gluestring that had held the devilpowder to his chest even the rawhide thong from the gunslingers hat and his Eddies own sneaker laces He had laid the gunslingers bedroll over the supports Cort would not have struck him because sick as he was Eddie had at least done more than squat on his hunkers and bewail his fate He had made something Had tried And Cort might have offered one of his abrupt almost grudging compliments because crazy as the thing looked it worked The long tracks stretching back down the beach to a point where they seemed to come together at the rim of perspective proved that You see any of them Eddie asks The sun is going down beating an orange path across the water and so the gunslinger reckons he has been out better than six hours this time He feels stronger He sits up and looks down to the water Neither the beach nor the land sweeping to the western slope of the mountains have changed much he can see small variations of landscape and detritus a dead seagull for instance lying in a little heap of blowing feathers on the sand about twenty yards to the left and thirty or so closer to the water but these aside they might as well be right where they started No the gunslinger says Then Yes Theres one He points Eddie squints then nods As the sun sinks lower and the orange track begins to look more and more like blood the first of the lobstrosities come tumbling out of the waves and begin crawling up the beach Two of them race clumsily toward the dead gull The winner pounces on it rips it open and begins to stuff the rotting remains into its maw Didachick it asks Dumachum responds the loser DodaD KABLAM Rolands gun puts an end to the second creatures questions Eddie walks down to it and grabs it by the back keeping a wary eye on its fellow as he does so The other offers no trouble however it is busy with the gull Eddie brings his kill back It is still twitching raising and lowering its claws but soon enough it stops moving The tail arches one final time then simply drops instead of flexing downward The boxers claws hang limp Dinnah will soon be served mawster Eddie says You have your choice filet of creepycrawler or filet of creepycrawler Which strikes your fancy mawster I dont understand you the gunslinger said Sure you do Eddie said You just dont have any sense of humor What happened to it Shot off in one war or another I guess Eddie smiles at that You look and sound a little more alive tonight Roland I am I think Well maybe you could even walk for awhile tomorrow Ill tell you very frankly my friend dragging you is the pits and the shits Ill try You do that You look a little better too Roland ventures His voice cracks on the last two words like the voice of a young boy IfIdont stop talking soon he thought I wont be able to talk atall again I guess Ill live He looks at Roland expressionlessly Youll never know how close it was a couple of times though Once I took one of your guns and put it against my head Cocked it held it there for awhile and then took it away Eased the hammer down and shoved it back in your holster Another night I had a convulsion I think that was the second night but Im not sure He shakes his head and says something the gunslinger both does and doesnt understand  Michigan seems like a dream to me now Although his voice is down to that husky murmur again and he knows he shouldnt be talking at all the gunslinger has to know one thing What stopped you from pulling the trigger Well this is the only pair of pants Ive got Eddie says At the last second I thought that if I pulled the trigger and it was one of those dud shells Id never get up the guts to do it again  and once you shit your pants you gotta wash em right away or live with the stink forever Henry told me that He said he learned it in Nam  And since it was nighttime and Lester the Lobster was out not to mention all his friendsD But the gunslinger is laughing laughing hard although only an occasional cracked sound actually escapes his lips Smiling a little himself Eddie says I think maybe you only got your sense of humor shot off up to the elbow in that war He gets up meaning to go up the slope to where there will be fuel for a fire Roland supposes Wait he whispers and Eddie looks at him Why really I guess because you needed me If Id killed myself you would have died Later on after youre really on your feet again I may like reexamine my options He looks around and sighs deeply There may be a Disney land or Cony Island somewhere in your world Roland but what Ive seen of it so far really doesnt interest me much He starts away pauses and looks back again at Roland His face is somber although some of the sickly pallor has left it The shakes have become no more than occasional tremors Sometimes you really dont understand me do you No the gunslinger whispers Sometimes I dont Then Ill elucidate There are people who need people to need them The reason you dont understand is because youre not one of those people Youd use me and then toss me away like a paper bag if thats what it came down to God fucked you my friend Youre just smart enough so it would hurt you to do that and just hard enough so youd go ahead and do it anyway You wouldnt be able to help yourself If I was lying on the beach there and screaming for help youd walk over me if I was between you and your goddam Tower Isnt that pretty close to the truth Roland says nothing only watches Eddie But not everyone is like that There are people who need people to need them Like the Barbara Streisand song Corny but true Its just another way of being hooked through the bag Eddie gazes at him But when it comes to that youre clean arent you Roland watches him Except for your Tower Eddie utters a short laugh Youre a Tower junkie Roland Which war was it Roland whispers What The one where you got your sense of nobility and purpose shot off Eddie recoils as if Roland has reached out and slapped him Im gonna go get some water he says shortly Keep an eye on the creepy crawlers We came a long way today but I still dont know if they talk to each other or not He turns away then but not before Roland has seen the last red rays of sunset reflected on his wet cheeks Roland turns back to the beach and watches The lobstrosities crawl and question question and crawl but both activities seem aimless they have some intelligence but not enough to pass on information to others of their kind God doesnt always dish it in your face Roland thinks Most times but not always Eddie returns with wood Well he asks What do you think Were all right the gunslinger croaks and Eddie starts to say something but the gunslinger is tired now and lies back and looks at the first stars peeking through the canopy of violet sky and shuffle in the three days that followed the gunslinger progressed steadily back to health The red lines creeping up his arms first reversed their direction then faded then disappeared On the next day he sometimes walked and sometimes let Eddie drag him On the day following he didnt need to be dragged at all every hour or two they simply sat for a period of time until the watery feeling went out of his legs It was during these rests and in those times after dinner had been eaten but before the fire had burned all the way down and they went to sleep that the gunslinger heard about Henry and Eddie He remembered wondering what had happened to make their brothering so difficult but after Eddie had begun haltingly and with that sort of resentful anger that proceeds from deep pain the gunslinger could have stopped him could have told him Dontbother Eddie I understand everything Except that wouldnt have helped Eddie Eddie wasnt talking to help Henry because Henry was dead He was talking to bury Henry for good And to remind himself that although Henry was dead he Eddie wasnt So the gunslinger listened and said nothing The gist was simple Eddie believed he had stolen his brothers life Henry also believed this Henry might have believed it on his own or he might have believed it because he so frequently heard their mother lecturing Eddie on how much both she and Henry had sacrificed for him so Eddie could be as safe as anyone could be in this jungle of a city so he could be happy as happy as anyone could be in this jungle of a city so he wouldnt end up like his poor sister that he didnt even hardly remember but she had been so beautiful God love her She was with the angels and that was undoubtedly a wonderful place to be but she didnt want Eddie to be with the angels just yet run over in the road by some crazy drunken driver like his sister or cut up by some crazy junkie kid for the twentyfive cents in his pocket and left with his guts running out all over the sidewalk and because she didnt think Eddie wanted to be with the angels yet he just better listen to what his big brother said and do what his big brother said to do and always remember that Henry was making a lovesacrifice Eddie told the gunslinger he doubted if his mother knew some of the things they had doneDfilching comic books from the candy store on Rincon Avenue or smoking cigarettes behind the Bonded Electroplate Factory on Cohoes Street  Once they saw a Chevrolet with the keys in it and although Henry barely knew how to driveDhe was sixteen then Eddie eightDhe had crammed his brother into the car and said they were going to New York City  Eddie was scared crying Henry scared too and mad at Eddie telling him to shut up telling him to stop being such a fuckin baby he had ten bucks and Eddie had three or four they could go to the movies all fuckin day and then catch a Pelham train and be back before their mother had time to put supper on the table and wonder where they were But Eddie kept crying and near the Queensboro Bridge they saw a police car on a side street and although Eddie was pretty sure the cop in it hadnt even been looking their way he said Yeah when Henry asked him in a harsh quavering voice if Eddie thought that bull had seen them Henry turned white and pulled over so fast that he had almost amputated a fire hydrant He was running down the block while Eddie now in a panic himself was still struggling with the unfamiliar doorhandle Henry stopped came back and hauled Eddie out of the car He also slapped him twice Then they had walkedDwell actually they slunkD all the way back to Brooklyn  It took them most of the day and when their mother asked them why they looked so hot and sweaty and tired out Henry said it was because hed spent most of the day teaching Eddie how to go oneonone on the basketball court at the playground around the block Then some big kids came and they had to run Their mother kissed Henry and beamed at Eddie She asked him if he didnt have the bestest big brother in the world Eddie agreed with her This was honest agreement too He thought he did He was as scared as I was that day Eddie told Roland as they sat and watched the last of the day dwindle from the water where soon the only light would be that reflected from the stars Scareder really because he thought that cop saw us and I knew he didnt Thats why he ran But he came back Thats the important part He came back Roland said nothing You see that dont you Eddie was looking at Roland with harsh questioning eyes I see He was always scared but he always came back Roland thought it would have been better for Eddie maybe better for both of them in the long run if Henry had just kept showing his heels that day  or on one of the others But people like Henry never did People like Henry always came back because people like Henry knew how to use trust It was the only thing people like Henry did know how to use First they changed trust into need then they changed need into a drug and once that was done theyDwhat was Eddies word for itDpush Yes They pushed it I think Ill turn in the gunslinger said The next day Eddie went on but Roland already knew it all Henry hadnt played sports in high school because Henry couldnt stay after for practice Henry had to take care of Eddie The fact that Henry was scrawny and uncoordinated and didnt much care for sports in the first place had nothing to do with it of course Henry would have made a wonderful baseball pitcher or one of those basketball jumpers their mother assured them both time and again Henrys grades were bad and he needed to repeat a number of subjectsDbut that wasnt because Henry was stupid Eddie and Mrs Dean both knew Henry was just as smart as licketysplit But Henry had to spend the time he should have spent studying or doing homework taking care of Eddie the fact that this usually took place in the Dean living room with both boys sprawled on the sofa watching TV or wrestling around on the floor somehow seemed not to matter The bad grades meant Henry hadnt been able to be accepted into anything but NYU and they couldnt afford it because the bad grades precluded any scholarships and then Henry got drafted and then it was Viet Nam where Henry got most of his knee blown off and the pain was bad and the drug they gave him for it had a heavy morphine base and when he was better they weaned him from the drug only they didnt do such a good job because when Henry got back to New York there was still a monkey on his back a hungry monkey waiting to be fed and after a month or two he had gone out to see a man and it had been about four months later less than a month after their mother died when Eddie first saw his brother snorting some white powder off a mirror Eddie assumed it was coke Turned out it was heroin And if you traced it all the way back whose fault was it Roland said nothing but heard the voice of Cort in his mind Fault always lies in the same place my fine babies withhim weak enough to lay blame When he discovered the truth Eddie had been shocked then angry Henry had responded not by promising to quit snorting but by telling Eddie he didnt blame him for being mad he knew Nam had turned him into a worthless shitbag he was weak he would leave that was the best thing Eddie was right the last thing he needed was a filthy junkie around messing up the place He just hoped Eddie wouldnt blame him too much He had gotten weak he admitted it something in Nam had made him weak had rotted him out the same way the moisture rotted the laces of your sneakers and the elastic of your underwear There was also something in Nam that apparently rotted out your heart Henry told him tearily He just hoped that Eddie would remember all the years he had tried to be strong For Eddie For Mom So Henry tried to leave And Eddie of course couldnt let him Eddie was consumed with guilt Eddie had seen the scarred horror that had once been an unmarked leg a leg that was now more Teflon than bone They had a screaming match in the hall Henry standing there in an old pair of khakis with his packed duffle bag in one hand and purple rings under his eyes Eddie wearing nothing but a pair of yellowing jockey shorts Henry saying you dont need me around Eddie Im poison to you and I know it and Eddie yelling back You aint going nowhere get your ass back inside and thats how it went until Mrs McGursky came out of her place and yelled Go orstay its nothing to me but you better decide one way or the other pretty quick or Im calling the police Mrs McGursky seemed about to add a few more admonishments but just then she saw that Eddie was wearing nothing but a pair of skivvies She added And youre not decent Eddie Dean before popping back inside It was like watching a Jackinthebox in reverse Eddie looked at Henry Henry looked at Eddie Looklike AngelBaby done put on a few pounds Henry said in a low voice and then they were howling with laughter holding onto each other and pounding each other and Henry came back inside and about two weeks later Eddie was snorting the stuff too and he couldnt understand why the hell he had made such a big deal out of it after all it was only snorting shit it got you off and as Henry who Eddie would eventually come to think of as the great sage and eminent junkie said in a world that was clearly going to hell headfirst what was so low about getting high Time passed Eddie didnt say how much The gunslinger didnt ask He guessed that Eddie knew there were a thousand excuses for getting high but no reasons and that he had kept his habit pretty well under control And that Henry had also managed to keep his under control Not as well as Eddie but enough to keep from coming completely unravelled Because whether or not Eddie understood the truth down deep Roland believed Eddie did Henry must have their positions had reversed themselves Now Eddie held Henrys hand crossing streets The day came when Eddie caught Henry not snorting but skinpopping There had been another hysterical argument an almost exact repeat of the first one except it had been in Henrys bedroom It ended in almost exactly the same way with Henry weeping and offering that implacable inarguable defense that was utter surrender utter admission Eddie was right he wasnt fit to live not fit to eat garbage from the gutter He would go Eddie would never have to see him again He just hoped he would remember all the  It faded into a drone that wasnt much different from the rocky sound of the breaking waves as they trudged up the beach Roland knew the story and said nothing It was Eddie who didnt know the story an Eddie who was really clearheaded for the first time in maybe ten years or more Eddie wasnt telling the story to Roland Eddie was finally telling the story to himself That was all right So far as the gunslinger could see time was something they had a lot of Talk was one way to fill it Eddie said he was haunted by Henrys knee the twisted scar tissue up and down his leg of course that was all healed now Henry barely even limped  except when he and Eddie were quarrelling then the limp always seemed to get worse he was haunted by all the things Henry had given up for him and haunted by something much more pragmatic Henry wouldnt last out on the streets He would be like a rabbit let loose in a jungle filled with tigers On his own Henry would wind up in jail or Bellevue before a week was out So he begged and Henry finally did him the favor of consenting to stick around and six months after that Eddie also had a golden arm From that moment things had begun to move in the steady and inevitable downward spiral which had ended with Eddies trip to the Bahamas and Rolands sudden intervention in his life Another man less pragmatic and more introspective than Roland might have asked to himself if not right out loud Why this one Why this man to start Why a man who seems topromise weakness or strangeness or even outright doom Not only did the gunslinger never ask the question it never even formulated itself in his mind Cuthbert would have asked Cuthbert had questioned everything had been poisoned with questions had died with one in his mouth Now they were gone all gone Corts last gunslingers the thirteen survivors of a beginning class that had numbered fiftysix were all dead All dead but Roland He was the last gunslinger going steadily on in a world that had grown stale and sterile and empty Thirteen he remembered Cort saying on the day before the Presentation Ceremonies This is an evil number And on the following day for the first time in thirty years Cort had not been present at the Ceremonies His final crop of pupils had gone to his cottage to first kneel at his feet presenting defenseless necks then to rise and receive his congratulatory kiss and to allow him to load their guns for the first time Nine weeks later Cort was dead Of poison some said Two years after his death the final bloody civil war had begun The red slaughter had reached the last bastion of civilization light and sanity and had taken away what all of them had assumed was so strong with the casual ease of a wave taking a childs castle of sand So he was the last and perhaps he had survived because the dark romance in his nature was overset by his practicality and simplicity He understood that only three things mattered mortality ka and the Tower Those were enough things to think about Eddie finished his tale around four oclock on the third day of their northward journey up the featureless beach The beach itself never seemed to change If a sign of progress was wanted it could only be obtained by looking left to the east There the jagged peaks of the mountains had begun to soften and slump a bit It was possible that if they went north far enough the mountains would become rolling hills With his story told Eddie lapsed into silence and they walked without speaking for a half an hour or longer Eddie kept stealing little glances at him Roland knew Eddie wasnt aware that he was picking these glances up he was still too much in himself Roland also knew what Eddie was waiting for a response Some kind of response Any kind Twice Eddie opened his mouth only to close it again Finally he asked what the gunslinger had known he would ask So What do you think I think youre here Eddie stopped fisted hands planted on his hips Thats all Thats it Thats all I know the gunslinger replied His missing fingers and toe throbbed and itched He wished for some of the astin from Eddies world You dont have any opinion on what the hell it all means The gunslinger might have held up his subtracted right hand and said Think about what this means you silly idiot but it no more crossed his mind to say this than it had to ask why it was Eddie out of all the people in all the universes that might exist Its ka he said facing Eddie patiently Whats ka Eddies voice was truculent I never heard of it Except if you say it twice you come out with the baby word for shit I dont know about that the gunslinger said Here it means duty or destiny or in the vulgate a place you must go Eddie managed to look dismayed disgusted and amused all at the same time Then say it twice Roland because words like that sound like shit to this kid The gunslinger shrugged I dont discuss philosophy I dont study history All I know is whats past is past and whats ahead is ahead The second is ka and takes care of itself Yeah Eddie looked northward Well all I see ahead is about nine billion miles of this same fucking beach If thats whats ahead ka and kaka are the same thing We might have enough good shells to pop five or six more of those lobster dudes but then were going to be down to chucking rocks at them So where are we going Roland did wonder briefly if this was a question Eddie had ever thought to ask his brother but to ask such a question would only be an invitation to a lot of meaningless argument So he only cocked a thumb northward and said There To begin with Eddie looked and saw nothing but the same reach of shell  and rockstudded gray shingle He looked back at Roland about to scoff saw the serene certainty on his face and looked again He squinted He shielded the right side of his face from the westering sun with his right hand He wanted desperately to see something anything shit even a mirage would do but there was nothing Crap on me all you want to Eddie said slowly but I say its a goddam mean trick I put my life on the line for you at Balazars I know you did The gunslinger smiledDa rarity that lit his face like a momentary flash of sunlight on a dismal luring day Thats why Ive done nothing but squaredeal you Eddie Its there I saw it an hour ago At first I thought it was only a mirage or wishful thinking but its there all right Eddie looked again looked until water ran from the corners of his eyes At last he said I dont see anything up ahead but more beach And I got twentytwenty vision I dont know what that means It means if there was something there to see Id see it But Eddie wondered Wondered how much further than his own the gunslingers blue bullshooters eyes could see Maybe a little Maybe a lot Youll see it the gunslinger said See what We wont get there today but if you see as well as you say youll see it before the sun hits the water Unless you just want to stand here chinjawing that is Ka Eddie said in a musing voice Roland nodded Ka Kaka Eddie said and laughed Come on Roland Lets take a hike And if I dont see anything by the time the sun hits the water you owe me a chicken dinner Or a Big Mac Or anything that isnt lobster Come on They started walking again and it was at least a full hour before the suns lower arc touched the horizon when Eddie Dean began to see the shape in the distanceDvague shimmering indefinable but definitely something Something new Okay he said I see it You must have eyes like Superman Who Never mind Youve got a really incredible case of culture lag you know it What Eddie laughed Never mind What is it Youll see The gunslinger started walking again before Eddie could ask anything else Twenty minutes later Eddie thought he did see Fifteen minutes after that he was sure The object on the beach was still two maybe three miles away but he knew what it was A door of course Another door Neither of them slept well that night and they were up and walking an hour before the sun cleared the eroding shapes of the mountains They reached the door just as the morning suns first rays so sublime and so still broke over them Those rays lighted their stubbly cheeks like lamps They made the gunslinger forty again and Eddie no older than Roland had been when he went out to fight Cort with his hawk David as his weapon This door was exactly like the first except for what was writ upon it THE LADY OF SHADOWS  So Eddie said softly looking at the door which simply stood here with its hinges grounded in some unknown jamb between one world and another one universe and another It stood with its graven message real as rock and strange as starlight So the gunslinger agreed Ka Ka Here is where you draw the second of your three It seems so The gunslinger knew what was in Eddies mind before Eddie knew it himself He saw Eddie make his move before Eddie knew he was moving He could have turned and broken Eddies arm in two places before Eddie knew it was happening but he made no move He let Eddie snake the revolver from his right holster It was the first time in his life he had allowed one of his weapons to be taken from him without an offer of that weapon having first been made Yet he made no move to stop it He turned and looked at Eddie equably even mildly Eddies face was livid strained His eyes showed starey whites all the way around the irises He held the heavy revolver in both hands and still the muzzle rambled from side to side centering moving off centering again and then moving off again Open it he said Youre being foolish the gunslinger said in the same mild voice Neither of us has any idea where that door goes It neednt open on your universe let alone upon your world For all either of us know the Lady of Shadows might have eight eyes and nine arms like Suvia Even if it does open on your world it might be on a time long before you were born or long after you would have died Eddie smiled tightly Tell you what Monty Im more than willing to trade the rubber chicken and the shitty seaside vacation for whats behind Door  I dont understand yD I know you dont It doesnt matter Just open the fucker The gunslinger shook his head They stood in the dawn the door casting its slanted shadow toward the ebbing sea Open it Eddie cried Im going with you Dont you get it Im going with you That doesnt mean I wont come back Maybe I will I mean probably I will I guess I owe you that much You been squareJohn with me down the line dont think Im not aware of the fact But while you get whoever this ShadowBabe is Im gonna find the nearest Chicken Delight and pick me up some takeout I think the ThirtyPiece Family Pak should do for starters You stay here You think I dont mean it Eddie was shrill now close to the edge The gunslinger could almost see him looking down into the drifty depths of his own damnation Eddie thumbed back the revolvers ancient hammer The wind had fallen with the break of the day and the ebb of the tide and the click of the hammer as Eddie brought it to full cock was very clear You just try me I think I will the gunslinger said Illshoot you Eddie screamed Ka the gunslinger replied stolidly and turned to the door He was reaching for the knob but his heart was waiting waiting to see if he would live or die Ka Stripped of jargon what Adler said was this the perfect schizophrenicDif there was such a personDwould be a man or woman not only unaware of his other personae but one unaware that anything at all was amiss in his or her life Adler should have met Detta Walker and Odetta Holmes Dlast gunslinger Andrew said He had been talking for quite awhile but Andrew always talked and Odetta usually just let it flow over her mind the way you let warm water flow over your hair and face in the shower But this did more than catch her attention it snagged it as if on a thorn I beg pardon Oh it was just some column in the paper Andrew said I dunno who wrote it I didnt notice One of those political fellas Probly youd know Miz Holmes I loved him and I cried the night he was electedD She smiled touched in spite of herself Andrew said his ceaseless chatter was something he couldnt stop wasnt responsible for that it was just the Irish in him coming out and most of it was nothingDcluckings and chirrupings about relatives and friends she would never meet halfbaked political opinions weird scientific commentary gleaned from any number of weird sources among other things Andrew was a firm believer in flying saucers which he called youfoesD but this touched her because she had also cried the night he was elected But I didnt cry when that son of a bitchDpardon my French Miz HolmesDwhen that son of a bitch Oswald shot him and I hadnt cried since and its beenDwhat two months Three months and two days she thought Something like that I guess Andrew nodded Then I read this columnDin The DailyNews it mighta beenDyesterday about how Johnsons probably gonna do a pretty good job but it wont be the same The guy said America had seen the passage of the worlds last gunslinger I dont think John Kennedy was that at all Odetta said and if her voice was sharper than the one Andrew was accustomed to hearing which it must have been because she saw his eyes give a startled blink in the rearview mirror a blink that was more like a wince it was because she felt herself touched by this too It was absurd but it was also a fact There was something about that phraseDAmerica has seen the passage of the worlds last gunslingerD that rang deeply in her mind It was ugly it was untrueDJohn Kennedy had been a peacemaker not a leatherslapping Billy the Kid type that was more in the Goldwater lineDbut it had also for some reason given her goosebumps Well the guy said there would be no shortage of shooters in the world Andrew went on regarding her nervously in the rearview mirror He mentioned Jack Ruby for one and Castro and this fellow in HaitiD Duvalier she said Poppa Doc Yeah him and DiemD The Diem brothers are dead Well he said Jack Kennedy was different thats all He said he would draw but only if someone weaker needed him to draw and only if there was nothing else to do He said Kennedy was savvy enough to know that sometimes talking dont do no good He said Kennedy knew if its foaming at the mouth you have to shoot it His eyes continued to regard her apprehensively Besides it was just some column I read The limo was gliding up Fifth Avenue now headed toward Central Park West the Cadillac emblem on the end of the hood cutting the frigid February air Yes Odetta said mildly and Andrews eyes relaxed a trifle I understand I dont agree but I understand You are a liar a voice spoke up in her mind This was a voice she heard quite often She had even named it It was the voice of The Goad You understand perfectly and agree completely Lie to Andrew if you feel it necessary but for Gods sake dont lie to yourself woman Yet part of her protested horrified In a world which had become a nuclear powder keg upon which nearly a billion people now sat it was a mistakeDperhaps one of suicidal proportionsDto believe there was a difference between good shooters and bad shooters There were too many shaky hands holding lighters near too many fuses This was no world for gunslingers If there had ever been a time for them it had passed Hadnt it She closed her eyes briefly and rubbed at her temples She could feel one of her headaches coming on Sometimes they threatened like an ominous buildup of thunderheads on a hot summer afternoon and then blew away  as those ugly summer brews sometimes simply slipped away in one direction or another to stomp their thunders and lightnings into the ground of some other place She thought however that this time the storm was going to happen It would come complete with thunder lightning and hail the size of golfballs The streetlights marching up Fifth Avenue seemed much too bright So how was Oxford  Miz Holmes Andrew asked tentatively Humid February or not it was very humid She paused telling herself she wouldnt say the words that were crowding up her throat like bile that she would swallow them back down To say them would be needlessly brutal Andrews talk of the worlds last gunslinger had been just more of the mans endless prattling But on top of everything else it was just a bit too much and it came out anyway what she had no business saying Her voice sounded as calm and as resolute as ever she supposed but she was not fooled she knew a blurt when she heard one The bail bondsman came very promptly of course he had been notified in advance They held onto us as long as they could nevertheless and I held on as long as I could but I guess they won that one because I ended up wetting myself She saw Andrews eyes wince away again and she wanted to stop and couldnt stop Its what they want to teach you you see Partly because it frightens you I suppose and a frightened person may not come down to their precious Southland and bother them again But I think most of themDeven the dumb ones and they are by all means not all dumbDknow the change will come in the end no matter what they do and so they take the chance to degrade you while they still can To teach you you can be degraded You can swear before God Christ and the whole company of Saints that you will not will not will not soil yourself but if they hold onto you long enough of course you do The lesson is that youre just an animal in a cage no more than that no better than that Just an animal in a cage So I wet myself I can still smell dried urine and that damned holding cell They think we are descended from the monkeys you know And thats exactly what I smell like to myself right now A monkey She saw Andrews eyes in the rearview mirror and was sorry for the way his eyes looked Sometimes your urine wasnt the only thing you couldnt hold Im sorry Miz Holmes No she said rubbing at her temples again I am the one who is sorry Its been a trying three days Andrew I should think so he said in a shocked oldmaidish voice that made her laugh in spite of herself But most of her wasnt laughing She thought she had known what she was getting into that she had fully anticipated how bad it could get She had been wrong A trying three days Well that was one way to put it Another might be that her three days in Oxford  Mississippi had been a short season in hell But there were some things you couldnt say Some things you would die before saying  unless you were called upon to testify to them before the Throne of God the Father Almighty where she supposed even the truths that caused the hellish thunderstorms in that strange gray jelly between your ears the scientists said that gray jelly was nerveless and if that wasnt a hoot and a half she didnt know what was must be admitted I just want to get home and bathe bathe bathe and sleep sleep sleep Then I reckon I will be as right as rain Why sure Thats just what youre going to be Andrew wanted to apologize for something and this was as close as he could come And beyond this he didnt want to risk further conversation So the two of them rode in unaccustomed silence to the gray Victorian block of apartments on the corner of Fifth and Central Park South a very exclusive gray Victorian block of apartments and she supposed that made her a blockbuster and she knew there were people in those poshyposhy flats who would not speak to her unless they absolutely had to and she didnt really care Besides she was above them and they knew she was above them It had occurred to her on more than one occasion that it must have galled some of them mightily knowing there was a nigger living in the penthouse apartment of this fine staid old building where once the only black hands allowed had been clad in white gloves or perhaps the thin black leather ones of a chauffeur She hoped it did gall them mightily and scolded herself for being mean for being unchristian but she did wish it she hadnt been able to stop the piss pouring into the crotch of her fine silk imported underwear and she didnt seem to be able to stop this other flood of piss either It was mean it was unchristian and almost as badDno worse at least as far as the Movement was concerned it was counterproductive They were going to win the rights they needed to win and probably this year Johnson mindful of the legacy which had been left him by the slain President and perhaps hoping to put another nail in the coffin of Barry Goldwater would do more than oversee the passage of the Civil Rights Act if necessary he would ram it into law So it was important to minimize the scarring and the hurt There was more work to be done Hate would not help do that work Hate would in fact hinder it But sometimes you went on hating just the same Oxford Town had taught her that too  Detta Walker had absolutely no interest in the Movement and much more modest digs She lived in the loft of a peeling Greenwich Village apartment building Odetta didnt know about the loft and Detta didnt know about the penthouse and the only one left who suspected something was not quite right was Andrew Feeny the chauffeur He had begun working for Odettas father when Odetta was fourteen and Detta Walker hardly existed at all Sometimes Odetta disappeared These disappearances might be a matter of hours or of days Last summer she had disappeared for three weeks and Andrew had been ready to call the police when Odetta called him one evening and asked him to bring the car around at ten the next dayDshe planned to do some shopping she said It trembled on his lips to cry out Miz Holmes Where haveyou been But he had asked this before and had received only puzzled staresDtruly puzzled stares he was sureDin return Right here she would say Why right here AndrewDyouve been driving me two or three places every day havent you You arent starting to go a little mushy in the head are you Then she would laugh and if she was feeling especially good as she often seemed to feel after her disappearances she would pinch his cheek Very good Miz Holmes he had said Ten it is That scary time she had been gone for three weeks Andrew had put down the phone closed his eyes and said a quick prayer to the Blessed Virgin for Miz Holmess safe return Then he had rung Howard the doorman at her building What time did she come in Just about twenty minutes ago Howard said Who brought her Dunno You know how it is Different car every time Sometimes they park around the block and I dont see em at all dont even know shes back until I hear the buzzer and look out and see its her Howard paused then added Shes got one hell of a bruise on her cheek Howard had been right It sure had been one hell of a bruise and now it was getting better Andrew didnt like to think what it might have looked like when it was fresh Miz Holmes appeared promptly at ten the next morning wearing a silk sundress with spaghettithin straps this had been late July and by then the bruise had started to yellow She had made only a perfunctory effort to cover it with makeup as if knowing that too much effort to cover it would only draw further attention to it How did you get that Miz Holmes he asked She laughed merrily You know me AndrewDclumsy as ever My hand slipped on the grabhandle while I was getting out of the tub yesterdayDI was in a hurry to catch the national news I fell and banged the side of my face She gauged his face Youre getting ready to start blithering about doctors and examinations arent you Dont bother answering after all these years I can read you like a book I wont go so you neednt bother asking Im just as fine as paint Onward Andrew I intend to buy half of Saks all of Gimbels and eat everything at Four Seasons in between Yes Miz Holmes he had said and smiled It was a forced smile and forcing it was not easy That bruise wasnt a day old it was a week old at least  and he knew better anyway didnt he He had called her every night at seven oclock for the last week because if there was one time when you could catch Miz Holmes in her place it was when the HuntleyBrinkley Report came on A regular junkie for her news was Miz Holmes He had done it every night that was except last night Then he had gone over and wheedled the passkey from Howard A conviction had been growing on him steadily that she had had just the sort of accident she had described  only instead of getting a bruise or a broken bone she had died died alone and was lying up there dead right now He had let himself in heart thumping feeling like a cat in a dark room crisscrossed with piano wires Only there had been nothing to be nervous about There was a butterdish on the kitchen counter and although the butter had been covered it had been out long enough to be growing a good crop of mould He got there at ten minutes of seven and had left by five after In the course of his quick examination of the apartment he had glanced into the bathroom The tub had been dry the towels neatlyDeven austerelyDarrayed the rooms many grabhandles polished to a bright steel gleam that was unspotted with water He knew the accident she had described had not happened But Andrew had not believed she was lying either She had believed what she had told him He looked in the rearview mirror again and saw her rubbing her temples lightly with the tips of her fingers He didnt like it He had seen her do that too many times before one of her disappearances  Andrew left the motor running so she could have the benefit of the heater then went around to the trunk He looked at her two suitcases with another wince They looked as if petulant men with small minds and large bodies had kicked them relentlessly back and forth damaging the bags in a way they did not quite dare damage Miz Holmes herselfDthe way they might have damaged him for instance if he had been there It wasnt just that she was a woman she was a nigger an uppity northern nigger messing where she had no business messing and they probably figured a woman like that deserved just what she got Thing was she was also a rich nigger Thing was she was almost as wellknown to the American public as Medgar Evers or Martin Luther King Thing was shed gotten her rich nigger face on the cover of Time magazine and it was a little harder to get away with sticking someone like that in the toolies and then saying What No sir boss we sho dint see nobody looked like that down here did we boys Thing was it was a little harder to work yourself up to hurting a woman who was the only heir to Holmes Dental Industries when there were twelve Holmes plants in the sunny South one of them just one county over from Oxford Town Oxford Town So theyd done to her suitcases what they didnt dare do to her He looked at these mute indications of her stay in Oxford Town with shame and fury and love emotions as mute as the scars on the luggage that had gone away looking smart and had come back looking dumb and thumped He looked temporarily unable to move and his breath puffed out on the frosty air Howard was coming out to help but Andrew paused a moment longer before grasping the handles of the cases Whoare you Miz Holmes Who are you really Where do you go sometimes and what do you do that seems so bad that you have to make up a false history of the missing hours or days even to yourself And he thought something else in the moment before Howard arrived something weirdly apt Wheres the rest of you You want to quit thinking like that If anyone around here was going to do any thinking like that it would be Miz Holmes but she doesnt and so you dont need to either Andrew lifted the bags out of the trunk and handed them to Howard who asked in a low voice Is she all right I think so Andrew replied also pitching his voice low Just tired is all Tired all the way down to her roots Howard nodded took the battered suitcases and started back inside He paused only long enough to tip his cap to Odetta HolmesDwho was almost invisible behind the smoked glass windowsDin a soft and respectful salute When he was gone Andrew took out the collapsed stainless steel scaffolding at the bottom of the trunk and began to unfold it It was a wheelchair Since August th   some five and a half years before the part of Odetta Holmes from the knees down had been as missing as those blank hours and days  Before the subway incident Detta Walker had had only been conscious a few timesDthose were like coral islands which look isolated to one above them but are in fact only nodes in the spine of a long archipelago which is mostly underwater Odetta suspected Detta not at all and Detta had no idea that there was such a person as Odetta  but Detta at least had a clear understanding that something was wrong that someone was fucking with her life Odettas imagination novelized all sorts of things which had happened when Detta was in charge of her body Detta was not so clever She thought she remembered things some things at least but a lot of the time she didnt Detta was at least partially aware of the blanks She could remember the china plate She could remember that She could remember slipping it into the pocket of her dress looking over her shoulder all the while to make sure the Blue Woman wasnt there peeking She had to make sure because the china plate belonged to the Blue Woman The china plate was Detta understood in some vague way a forspecial Detta took it for that why Detta remembered taking it to a place she knew although she didnt know how she knew as The Drawers a smoking trashlittered hole in the earth where she had once seen a burning baby with plastic skin She remembered putting the plate carefully down on the gravelly ground and then starting to step on it and stopping remembered taking off her plain cotton panties and putting them into the pocket where the plate had been and then carefully slipping the first finger of her left hand carefully against the cut in her at the place where Old Stupid God had joined her and all other girls and women imperfectly but something about that place must be right because she remembered the jolt remembered wanting to press remembered not pressing remembered how delicious her vagina had been naked without the cotton panties in the way of it and the world and she had not pressed not until her shoe pressed her black patent leather shoe not until her shoe pressed down on the plate then she pressed on the cut with her finger the way she was pressing on the Blue Womans forspecial china plate with her foot she remembered the way the black patent leather shoe covered the delicate blue webbing on the edge of the plate she remembered the press yes she remembered pressing in The Drawers pressing with finger and foot remembered the delicious promise of finger and cut remembered that when the plate snapped with a bitter brittle snap a similar brittle pleasure had skewered upward from that cut into her guts like an arrow she remembered the cry which had broken from her lips an unpleasant cawing like the sound of a crow scared up from a cornpatch she could remember staring dully at the fragments of the plate and then taking the plain white cotton panties slowly out of her dress pocket and putting them on again stepins so she had heard them called in some time unhoused in memory and drifting loose like turves on a floodtide stepins good because first you stepped out to do your business and then you stepped back in first one shiny patent leather shoe and then the other good panties were good she could remember drawing them up her legs so clearly drawing them past her knees a scab on the left one almost ready to fall off and leave clean pink new babyskin yes she could remember so clearly it might not have been a week ago or yesterday but only one single moment ago she could remember how the waistband had reached the hem of her party dress the clear contrast of white cotton against brown skin like cream yes like that cream from a pitcher caught suspended over coffee the texture the panties disappearing under the hem of the dress except then the dress was burnt orange and the panties were not going up but down but they were still white but not cotton they were nylon cheap seethrough nylon panties cheap in more ways than one and she remembered stepping out of them she remembered how they glimmered on the floormat of the  Dodge DeSoto yes how white they were how cheap they were not anything dignified like underwear but cheap panties the girl was cheap and it was good to be cheap good to be on sale to be on the block not even like a whore but like a good breedsow she remembered no round china plate but the round white face of a boy some surprised drunk fraternity boy he was no china plate but his face was as round as the Blue Womans china plate had been and there was webbing on his cheeks and this webbing looked as blue as the webbing on the Blue Womans forspecial china plate had been but that was only because the neon was red the neon was garish in the dark the neon from the roadhouse sign made the spreading blood from the places on his cheeks where she had clawed him look blue and he had said Why did youwhy did you why did you do and then he unrolled the window so he could get his face outside to puke and she remembered hearing Dodie Stevens on the jukebox singing about tan shoes with pink shoelaces and a big Panama with a purple hatband she remembered the sound of his puking was like gravel in a cement mixer and his penis which moments before had been a livid exclamation point rising from the tufted tangle of his pubic hair was collapsing into a weak white question mark she remembered the hoarse gravel sounds of his vomiting stopped and then started again and she thought Well I guess he aint made enough to lay this foundation yet and laughing and pressing her finger which now came equipped with a long shaped nail against her vagina which was bare but no longer bare because it was overgrown with its own coarse briared tangle and there had been the same brittle breaking snap inside her and it was still as much pain as it was pleasure but better far better than nothing at all and then he was grabbing blindly for her and saying in a hurt breaking tone Oh you goddamned nigger cunt and she went on laughing just the same dodging him easily and snatching up her panties and opening the door on her side of the car feeling the last blind thud of his fingers on the back of her blouse as she ran into a May night that was redolent of early honeysuckle redpink neon light stuttering off the gravel of some postwar parking lot stuffing her panties her cheap slick nylon panties not into the pocket of her dress but into a purse jumbled with a teenagers cheerful conglomeration of cosmetics she was running the light was stuttering and then she was twentythree and it was not panties but a rayon scarf and she was casually slipping it into her purse as she walked along a counter in the Nice Notions section of MacysDa scarf which sold at that time for  Cheap Cheap like the white nylon panties Cheap Like her The body she inhabited was that of a woman who had inherited millions but that was not known and didnt matterDthe scarf was white the edging blue and there was that same little breaking sense of pleasure as she sat in the back seat of the taxi and oblivious of the driver held the scarf in one hand looking at it fixedly while her other hand crept up under her tweed skirt and beneath the legband of her white panties and that one long dark finger took care of the business that needed to be taken care of in a single merciless stroke So sometimes she wondered in a distracted sort of way where she was when she wasnt here but mostly her needs were too sudden and pressing for any extended contemplation and she simply fulfilled what needed to be fulfilled did what needed to be done Roland would have understood  Odetta could have taken a limo everywhere even in Dalthough her father was still alive and she was not as fabulously rich as she would become when he died in  the money held in trust for her had become hers on her twentyfifth birthday and she could do pretty much as she liked But she cared very little for a phrase one of the conservative columnists had coined a year or two beforeDthe phrase was limosine liberal and she was young enough not to want to be seen as one even if she really was one Not young enough or stupid enough to believe that a few pairs of faded jeans and the khaki shirts she habitually wore in any real way changed her essential status or riding the bus or the subway when she could have used the car but she had been selfinvolved enough not to see Andrews hurt and deep puzzlement he liked her and thought it must be some sort of personal rejection but young enough to still believe that gesture could sometimes overcome or at least overset truth On the night of August th   she paid for the gesture with half her legs  and half her mind  Odetta had been first tugged then pulled and finally caught up in the swell which would eventually turn into a tidal wave In  when she became involved the thing which eventually became known as the Movement had no name She knew some of the background knew the struggle for equality had gone on not since the Emancipation Proclamation but almost since the first boatload of slaves had been brought to America to Georgia in fact the colony the British founded to get rid of their criminals and debtors but for Odetta it always seemed to begin in the same place with the same three words Im not movin The place had been a city bus in Montgomery Alabama and the words had been spoken by a black woman named Rosa Lee Parks and the place from which Rosa Lee Parks was not movin was from the front of the city bus to the back of the city bus which was of course the Jim Crow part of the city bus Much later Odetta would sing We Shall Not Be Moved with the rest of them and it always made her think of Rosa Lee Parks and she never sang it without a sense of shame It was so easy to sing we with your arms linked to the arms of a whole crowd that was easy even for a woman with no legs So easy to sing we so easy to be we There had been no we on that bus that bus that must have stank of ancient leather and years of cigar and cigarette smoke that bus with the curved ad cards saying things like LUCKY STRIKE LSMFT and ATTEND THE CHURCH OF YOUR CHOICE FOR HEAVENS SAKE and DRINK OVALTINE YOULL SEE WHAT WE MEAN and CHESTERFIELD  TWENTYONE GREAT TOBACCOS MAKE TWENTY WONDERFUL SMOKES no we under the disbelieving gazes of the motorman the white passengers among whom she sat the equally disbelieving stares of the blacks at the back No we No marching thousands Only Rosa Lee Parks starting a tidal wave with three words Im not movin Odetta would think If I could do something like thatDif I could be that brave  I think I could be happy for the rest of my life But that sort of courage is not in me She had read of the Parks incident but with little interest at first That came little by little It was hard to say exactly when or how her imagination had been caught and fired by that at first almost soundless racequake which had begun to shake the south A year or so later a young man she was dating more or less regularly began taking her down to the Village where some of the young and mostly white folksingers who performed there had added some new and startling songs to their repetoireDsuddenly in addition to all those old wheezes about how John Henry had taken his hammer and outraced the new steamhammer killing himself in the process lawd lawd and how Barbry Allen had cruelly rejected her lovesick young suitor and ended up dying of shame lawd lawd there were songs about how it felt to be down and out and ignored in the city how it felt to be turned away from a job you could do because your skin was the wrong color how it felt to be taken into a jail cell and whipped by Mr Charlie because your skin was dark and you had dared lawd lawd to sit in the white folks section of the lunchcounter at an FW Woolworths in Montgomery Alabama Absurdly or not it was only then that she had become curious about her own parents and their parents and their parents before them She would never read RootsD she was in another world and time long before that book was written perhaps even thought of by Alex Haley but it was at this absurdly late time in her life when it first dawned upon her that not so many generations back her progenitors had been taken in chains by white men Surely the fact had occurred to her before but only as a piece of information with no real temperature gradient like an equation never as something which bore intimately upon her own life Odetta totted up what she knew and was appalled by the smallness of the sum She knew her mother had been born in Odetta  Arkansas  the town for which she the only child had been named She knew her father had been a smalltown dentist who had invented and patented a capping process which had lain dormant and unremarked for ten years and which had then suddenly made him a moderately wealthy man She knew that he had developed a number of other dental processes during the ten years before and the four years after the influx of wealth most of them either orthodontic or cosmetic in nature and that shortly after moving to New York with his wife and daughter who had been born four years after the original patent had been secured he had founded a company called Holmes Dental Industries which was now to teeth what Squibb was to antibiotics But when she asked him what life had been like during all the years betweenDthe years when she hadnt been there and the years when she had her father wouldnt tell her He would say all sorts of things but he wouldnt tell her anything He closed that part of himself off to her Once her ma AliceDhe called her ma or sometimes Allie if hed had a few or was feeling goodDsaid Tell her about the time those men shot at you when you drove the Ford through the covered bridge Dan and he gave Odettas ma such a gray and forbidding look that her ma always something of a sparrow had shrunk back in her seat and said no more Odetta had tried her mother once or twice alone after that night but to no avail If she had tried before she might have gotten something but because he wouldnt speak she wouldnt speak eitherDand to him she realized the pastDthose relatives those red dirt roads those stores those dirt floor cabins with glassless windows ungraced by a single simple curtsey of a curtain those incidents of hurt and harassment those neighbor children who went dressed in smocks which had begun life as flour sacksDall of that was for him buried away like dead teeth beneath perfect blinding white caps He would not speak perhaps could not had perhaps willingly afflicted himself with a selective amnesia the capped teeth was their life in the Greymarl Apartments on Central Park South All else was hidden beneath that impervious outer cover His past was so wellprotected that there had been no gap to slide through no way past that perfect capped barrier and into the throat of revelation Detta knew things but Detta didnt know Odetta and Odetta didnt know Detta and so the teeth lay as smooth and closed as a redan gate there also She had some of her mothers shyness in her as well as her fathers unblinking if unspoken toughness and the only time she had dared pursue him further on the subject to suggest that what he was denying her was a deserved trust fund never promised and apparenily never to mature had been one night in his library He had shaken his Wall Street Journal carefully closed it folded it and laid it aside on the deal table beside the standing lamp He had removed his rimless steel spectacles and had laid them on top of the paper Then he had looked at her a thin black man thin almost to the point of emaciation tightly kinked gray hair now drawing rapidly away from the deepening hollows of his temples where tender clocksprings of veins pulsed steadily and he had said only Idont talk about that part of my life Odetta or think about it It would be pointless The world had moved on since then Roland would have understood  When Roland opened the door with the words THE LADY OF THE SHADOWS written upon it he saw things he did not understand at allDbut he understood they didnt matter It was Eddie Deans world but beyond that it was only a confusion of lights people and objectsDmore objects than he had ever seen in his life Ladythings from the look of them and apparently for sale Some under glass some arranged in tempting piles and displays None it mattered any more than the movement as that world flowed past the edges of the doorway before them The doorway was the Ladys eyes He was looking through them just as he had looked through Eddies eyes when Eddie had moved up the aisle of the skycarriage Eddie on the other hand was thunderstruck The revolver in his hand trembled and dropped a little The gunslinger could have taken it from him easily but did not He only stood quietly It was a trick he had learned a long time ago Now the view through the doorway made one of those turns the gunslinger found so dizzyingDbut Eddie found this same abrupt swoop oddly comforting Roland had never seen a movie Eddie had seen thousands and what he was looking at was like one of those moving pointofview shots they did in ones like Halloween and The Shining He even knew what they called the gadget they did it with SteadiCam That was it Star Wars too he muttered Death Star That fuckin crack remember Roland looked at him and said nothing HandsDdark brown handsDentered what Roland saw as a doorway and what Eddie was already starting to think of as some sort of magic movie screen  a movie screen which under the right circumstances you might be able to walk into the way that guy had just walked out of the screen and into the real world in The Purple Rose of Cairo Bitchin movie Eddie hadnt realized how bitchin until just now Except that movie hadnt been made yet on the other side of the door he was looking through It was New York okayDsomehow the very sound of the taxicab horns as mute and faint as they wereDproclaimed thatDand it was some New York department store he had been in at one time or another but it was  was  Its older he muttered Before your when the gunslinger asked Eddie looked at him and laughed shortly Yeah If you want to put it that way yeah Hello Miss Walker  a tentative voice said The view in the doorway rose so suddenly that even Eddie was a bit dizzied and he saw a saleswoman who obviously knew the owner of the black handsDknew her and either didnt like her or feared her Or both Help you today This one The owner of the black hands held up a white scarf with a bright blue edge Dont bother to wrap it up babe just stick it in a bag Cash or chD Cash its always cash isnt it Yes thats fine Miss Walker Im so glad you approve dear There was a little grimace on the salesgirls faceDEddie just caught it as she turned away Maybe it was something as simple as being talked to that way by a woman the salesgirl considered an uppity nigger again it was more his experience in movie theaters than any knowledge of history or even life on the streets as he had lived it that caused this thought because this was like watching a movie either set or made in the s something like that one with Sidney Steiger and Rod Poitier In the Heat of the Night  but it could also be something even simpler Rolands Lady of the Shadows was black or white one rude bitch And it didnt really matter did it None of it made a damned bit of difference He cared about one thing and one thing only and that was getting the fuck out That was New York  he could almost smell New York  And New York meant smack He could almost smell that too Except there was a hitch wasnt there One big motherfucker of a hitch  Roland watched Eddie carefully and although he could have killed him six times over at almost any time he wanted he had elected to remain still and silent and let Eddie work the situation out for himself Eddie was a lot of things and a lot of them were not nice as a fellow who had consciously let a child drop to his death the gunslinger knew the difference between nice and not quite well but one thing Eddie wasnt was stupid He was a smart kid He would figure it out So he did He looked back at Roland smiled without showing his teeth twirled the gunslingers revolver once on his finger clumsily burlesquing a showshooters fancy coda and then he held it out to Roland butt first This thing might as well be a piece of shit for all the good it can do me isnt that right You can talk bright when you want to Roland thought Why do you so often choose to talk stupid Eddie Is it because you think thats the way they talked in the place where your brother went with his guns Isnt that right Eddie repeated Roland nodded If I had plugged you what would have happened to that door I dont know I suppose the only way to find out would be to try it and see Well what do you think would happen I think it would disappear Eddie nodded That was what he thought too Poof Gone like magic Now ya see it my friends now ya dont It was really no different than what would happen if the projectionist in a movietheater were to draw a sixshooter and plug the projector was it If you shot the projector the movie stopped Eddie didnt want the picture to stop Eddie wanted his moneys worth You can go through by yourself Eddie said slowly Yes Sort of Yes You wind up in her head Like you wound up in mine Yes So you can hitchhike into my world but thats all Roland said nothing Hitchhike was one of the words Eddie sometimes used that he didnt exactly understand  but he caught the drift But you could go through in your body Like at Balazars He was talking out loud but really talking to himself Except youd need me for that wouldnt you Yes Then take me with you The gunslinger opened his mouth but Eddie was already rushing on Not now I dont mean now he said I know it would cause a riot or some goddam thing if we just  popped out over there He laughed rather wildly Like a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat except without any hat sure I did Well wait until shes alone andD No Ill come back with you Eddie said I swear it Roland I mean I know you got a job to do and I know Im a part of it I know you saved my ass at Customs but I think I saved yours at BalazarsDnow what do you think I think you did Roland said He remembered the way Eddie had risen up from behind the desk regardless of the risk and felt an instant of doubt But only an instant So Peter pays Paul One hand washes the other All I want to do is go back for a few hours Grab some takeout chicken maybe a box of Dunkin Donuts Eddie nodded toward the doorway where things had begun to move again So what do you say No the gunslinger said but for a moment he was hardly thinking about Eddie That movement up the aisleDthe Lady whoever she was wasnt moving the way an ordinary person movedDwasnt moving for instance the way Eddie had moved when Roland looked through his eyes or now that he stopped to think of it which he never had before any more than he had ever stopped and really noticed the constant presence of his own nose in the lower range of his peripheral vision the way he moved himself When one walked vision became a mild pendulum left leg right leg left leg right leg the world rocking back and forth so mildly and gently that after awhileDshortly after you began to walk he supposedDyou simply ignored it There was none of that pendulum movement in the Ladys walkDshe simply moved smoothly up the aisle as if riding along tracks Ironically Eddie had had this same perception  only to Eddie it had looked like a SteadiCam shot He had found this perception comforting because it was familiar To Roland it was alien  but then Eddie was breaking in his voice shrill Well why not Just why the fuck not Because you dont want chicken the gunslinger said I know what you call the things you want Eddie You want to fix You want to score  So what Eddie criedDalmost shrieked So what if I do I said Id come back with you You got my promise I mean you got my fuckin PROMISE What else do you want You want me to swear on my mothers name Okay I swear on my mothers name You want me to swear on my brother Henrys name All right I swear I swear I SWEAR Enrico Balazar would have told him but the gunslinger didnt need the likes of Balazar to tell him this one fact of life Never trust a junkie Roland nodded toward the door Until after the Tower at least that part of your life is done After that I dont care After that youre free to go to hell in your own way Until then I need you Oh you fuckin shitass liar Eddie said softly There was no audible emotion in his voice but the gunslinger saw the glisten of tears in his eyes Roland said nothing You know there aint gonna be no after not for me not for her or whoever the Christ this third guy is Probably not for you eitherDyou look as fuckin wasted as Henry did at his worst If we dont die on the way to your Tower well sure as shit die when we get there so why are you lying to me The gunslinger felt a dull species of shame but only repeated At least for now that part of your life is done Yeah Eddie said Well I got some news for you Roland I know whats gonna happen to your real body when you go through there and inside of her I know because I saw it before I dont need your guns I got you by that fabled place where the short hairs grow my friend You can even turn her head the way you turned mine and watch what I do to the rest of you while youre nothing but your goddam ka Id like to wait until nightfall and drag you down by the water Then you could watch the lobsters chow up on the rest of you But you might be in too much of a hurry for that Eddie paused The graty breaking of the waves and the steady hollow conch of the wind both seemed very loud So I think Ill just use your knife to cut your throat And close that door forever You say that part of my life is done You dont just mean smack either You mean New York  America  my time everything If thats how it is I want this part done too The scenery sucks and the company stinks There are times Roland when you make Jimmy Swaggart look almost sane There are great wonders ahead Roland said Great adventures More than that there is a quest to course upon and a chance to redeem your honor Theres something else too You could be a gunslinger I neednt be the last after all Its in you Eddie I see it I feel it Eddie laughed although now the tears were coursing down his cheeks Oh wonderful Wonderful Just what I need My brother Henry He was a gunslinger In a place called Viet Nam  that was It was great for him You should have seen him when he was on a serious nod Roland He couldnt find his way to the fuckin bathroom without help If there wasnt any help handy he just sat there and watched Big Time Wrestling and did it in his fuckin pants Its great to be a gunslinger I can see that My brother was a doper and youre out of your fucking gourd Perhaps your brother was a man with no clear idea of honor Maybe not We didnt always get a real clear picture of what that was in the Projects It was just a word you used after Your if you happened to get caught smoking reefer or lifting the spinners off some guys TBird and got hoed up in court for it Eddie was crying harder now but he was laughing too Your friends now This guy you talk about in your sleep for instance this dude CuthbertD The gunslinger started in spite of himself Not all his long years of training could stay that start Did they get this stuff youre talking about like a goddam Marine recruiting sergeant Adventure quests honor They understood honor yes Roland said slowly thinking of all the vanished others Did it get them any further than gunslinging got my brother The gunslinger said nothing I know you Eddie said I seen lots of guys like you Youre just another kook singing Onward Christian Soldiers with a flag in one hand and a gun in the other I dont want no honor I just want a chicken dinner and fix In that order So Im telling you go on through You can But the minute youre gone Im gonna kill the rest of you The gunslinger said nothing Eddie smiled crookedly and brushed the tears from his cheeks with the backs of his hands You want to know what we call this back home What A Mexican standoff For a moment they only looked at each other and then Roland looked sharply into the doorway They had both been partially awareDRoland rather more than EddieDthat there had been another of those swerves this time to the left Here was an array of sparkling jewelry Some was under protective glass but because most wasnt the gunslinger supposed it was trumpery stuff  what Eddie would have called costume jewelry The dark brown hands examined a few things in what seemed an only cursory manner and then another salesgirl appeared There had been some conversation which neither of them really noticed and the Lady some Lady Eddie thought asked to see something else The salesgirl went away and that was when Rolands eyes swung sharply back The brown hands reappeared only now they held a purse It opened And suddenly the hands were scooping thingsDseemingly almost certainly at randomDinto the purse Well youre collecting quite a crew Roland Eddie said bitterly amused First you got your basic white junkie and then you got your basic black shoplifD But Roland was already moving toward the doorway between the worlds moving swiftly not looking at Eddie at all I mean it Eddie screamed You go through and Ill cut your throat Ill cut your fucking thrD Before he could finish the gunslinger was gone All that was left of him was his limp breathing body lying upon the beach For a moment Eddie only stood there unable to believe that Roland had done it had really gone ahead and done this idiotic thing in spite of his promiseDhis sincere fucking guarantee as far as that wentDof what the consequences would be He stood for a moment eyes rolling like the eyes of a frightened horse at the onset of a thunderstorm  except of course there was no thunderstorm except for the one in the head All right All right goddammit There might only be a moment That was all the gunslinger might give him and Eddie damned well knew it He glanced at the door and saw the black hands freeze with a gold necklace half in and half out of a purse that already glittered like a pirates cache of treasure Although he could not hear it Eddie sensed that Roland was speaking to the owner of the black hands He pulled the knife from the gunslingers purse and then rolled over the limp breathing body which lay before the doorway The eyes were open but blank rolled up to the whites Watch Roland Eddie screamed That monotonous idiotic neverending wind blew in his ears Christ it was enough to drive anyone bugshit Watch very closely I want to complete your fucking education I want to show you what happens when you fuck over the Dean brothers He brought the knife down to the gunslingers throat August  When the intern came outside half an hour later he found Julio leaning against the ambulance which was still parked in the emergency bay of Sisters of Mercy Hospital on rd Street  The heel of one of Julios pointytoed boots was hooked over the front fender He had changed to a pair of glaring pink pants and a blue shirt with his name written in gold stitches over the left pocket his bowling league outfit George checked his watch and saw that Julios teamDThe Spics of SupremacyDwould already be rolling Thought youd be gone George Shavers said He was an intern at Sisters of Mercy Howre your guys gonna win without the Wonder Hook They got Miguel Basale to take my place He aint steady but he gets hot sometimes Theyll be okay Julio paused I was curious about how it came out He was the driver a Cubano with a sense of humor George wasnt even sure Julio knew he had He looked around Neither of the paramedics who rode with them were in sight Where are they George asked Who The fuckin Bobbsey Twins Where do you think they are Chasin Minnesota poontang down in the Village Any idea if shell pull through Dont know He tried to sound sage and knowing about the unknown but the fact was that first the resident on duty and then a pair of surgeons had taken the black woman away from him almost faster than you could say hail Mary fulla grace which had actually been on his lips to sayDthe black lady really hadnt looked as if she was going to last very long She lost a hell of a lot of blood No shit George was one of sixteen interns at Sisters of Mercy and one of eight assigned to a new program called Emergency Ride The theory was that an intern riding with a couple of paramedics could sometimes make the difference between life and death in an emergency situation George knew that most drivers and paras thought that wetbehindtheears interns were as likely to kill redblankets as save them but George thought maybe it worked Sometimes Either way it made great PR for the hospital and although the interns in the program liked to bitch about the extra eight hours without pay it entailed each week George Shavers sort of thought most of them felt the way he did himselfDproud tough able to take whatever they threw his way Then had come the night the TWA TriStar crashed at Idlewild Sixtyfive people on board sixty of them what Julio Estevez referred to as DRTDDead Right ThereDand three of the remaining five looking like the sort of thing you might scrape out of the bottom of a coalfurnace  except what you scraped out of the bottom of a coal furnace didnt moan and shriek and beg for someone to give them morphine or kill them did they Ifyou can take this he thought afterward remembering the severed limbs lying amid the remains of aluminum flaps and seatcushions and a ragged chunk of tail with the numbers  and a big red letter T and part of a W on it remembering the eyeball he had seen resting on top of a charred Samsonite suitcase remembering a childs teddybear with staring shoebutton eyes lying beside a small red sneaker with a childs foot still in it if you can take this baby you can take anything And he had been taking it just fine He went right on taking it just fine all the way home He went on taking it just fine through a late supper that consisted of a Swansons turkey TV dinner He went to sleep with no problem at all which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was taking it just fine Then in some dead dark hour of the morning he had awakened from a hellish nightmare in which the thing resting on top of the charred Samsonite suitcase had not been a teddybear but his mothers head and her eyes had opened and they had been charred they were the staring expressionless shoebutton eyes of the teddybear and her mouth had opened revealing the broken fangs which had been her dentures up until the TWA TriStar was struck by lightning on its final approach and she had whispered You couldnt save me George we scrimped for you we saved for you we went without for you your dad fixed up the scrape you got into with that girl and you STILL COULDNT SAVE ME GOD DAMN YOU and he had awakened screaming and he was vaguely aware of someone pounding on the wall but by then he was already pelting into the bathroom and he barely made it to the kneeling penitential position before the porcelain altar before dinner came up the express elevator It came special delivery hot and steaming and still smelling like processed turkey He knelt there and looked into the bowl at the chunks of halfdigested turkey and the carrots which had lost none of their original flourescent brightness and this word flashed across his mind in large red letters ENOUGH Correct It was ENOUGH He was going to get out of the sawbones business He was going to get out because ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH He was going to get out because Popeyes motto was Thats all I can stands and I cant stand nummore and Popeye was as right as rain He had flushed the toilet and gone back to bed and fell asleep almost instantly and awoke to discover he still wanted to be a doctor and that was a goddam good thing to know for sure maybe worth the whole program whether you called it Emergency Ride or Bucket of Blood or Name That Tune He still wanted to be a doctor He knew a lady who did needlework He paid her ten dollars he couldnt afford to make him a small oldfashionedlooking sampler It said IF YOU CAN TAKE THIS YOU CAN TAKE ANYTHING Yes Correct The messy business in the subway happened four weeks later  That lady was some fuckin weird you know it Julio said George breathed an interior sigh of relief If Julio hadnt opened the subject George supposed he wouldnt have had the sack He was an intern and someday he was going to be a fullfledged doc he really believed that now but Julio was a vet and you didnt want to say something stupid in front of a vet He would only laugh and say Hell I seen that shit a thousand times kid Get yselfa towel and wipe off whatever it is behind your ears cause its wet and drippin down the sides of your face But apparently Julio hadnt seen it a thousand times and that was good because George wanted to talk about it She was weird all right It was like she was two people He was amazed to see that now Julio was the one who looked relieved and he was struck with sudden shame Julio Estavez who was going to do no more than pilot a limo with a couple of pulsing red lights on top for the rest of his life had just shown more courage than he had been able to show You got it doc Hunnert per cent He pulled out a pack of Chesterfields and stuck one in the corner of his mouth Those things are gonna kill you my man George said Julio nodded and offered the pack They smoked in silence for awhile The paras were maybe chasing tail like Julio had said  or maybe theyd just had enough George had been scared all right no joke about that But he also knew he had been the one who saved the woman not the paras and he knew Julio knew it too Maybe that was really why Julio had waited The old black woman had helped and the white kid who had dialed the cops while everyone else except the old black woman had just stood around watching like it was some goddam movie or TV show or something part of a Peter Gunn episode maybe but in the end it had all come down to George Shavers one scared cat doing his duty the best way he could The woman had been waiting for the train Duke Ellington held in such high regardDthat fabled Atrain Just been a pretty young black woman in jeans and a khaki shirt waiting for the fabled ATrain so she could go uptown someplace Someone had pushed her George Shavers didnt have the slightest idea if the police had caught the slug who had done it  that wasnt his business His business was the woman who had tumbled screaming into the tube of the tunnel in front of that fabled Atrain It had been a miracle that she had missed the third rail the fabled third rail that would have done to her what the State of New York did to the bad guys up at SingSing who got a free ride on that fabled Atrain the cons called Old Sparky Oboy the miracles of electricity She tried to crawl out of the way but there hadnt been quite enough time and that fabled Atrain had come into the station screeching and squalling and puking up sparks because the motorman had seen her but it was too late too late for him and too late for her The steel wheels of that fabled Atrain had cut the living legs off her from just above the knees down And while everyone else except for the white kid who had dialed the cops had only stood there pulling their puds or pushing their pudenda George supposed the elderly black woman had jumped down dislocating one hip in the process she would later be given a Medal of Bravery by the Mayor and had used the doorag on her head to cinch a tourniquet around one of the young womans squirting thighs The young white guy was screaming for an ambulance on one side of the station and the old black chick was screaming for someone to give her a help to give her a tieoff for Gods sake anything anything at all and finally some elderly white business type had reluctantly surrendered his belt and the elderly black chick looked up at him and spoke the words which became the headline of the New York Daily News the next day the words which made her an authentic American applepie heroine Thank you bro Then she had noosed the belt around the young womans left leg halfway between the young womans crotch and where her left knee had been until that fabled Atrain had come along George had heard someone say to someone else that the young black womans last words before passing out had been WHO WAS THAT MAHFAH I GONE HUNT HIM DOWN AND KILL HIS ASS There was no way to punch holes far enough up for the elderly black woman to notch the belt so she simply held on like grim old death until Julio George and the paras arrived George remembered the yellow line how his mother had told him he must never never never go past the yellow line while he was waiting for a train fabled or otherwise the stench of oil and electricity when he hopped down onto the cinders remembered how hot it had been The heat seemed to be baking off him off the elderly black woman off the young black woman off the train the tunnel the unseen sky above and hell itself beneath He remembered thinking incoherently If they put a bloodpressure cuff on me now Id go off the dial and then he went cool and yelled for his bag and when one of the paras tried to jump down with it he told the para to fuck off and the para had looked startled as if he was really seeing George Shavers for the first time and he had fucked off George tied off as many veins and arteries as he could tie off and when her heart started to bebop he had shot her full of Digitalin Whole blood arrived Cops brought it Want to bring her up doc one of them had asked and George had told him not yet and he got out the needle and stuck the juice to her like she was a junkie in dire need of a fix Then he let them take her up Then they had taken her back On the way she had awakened Then the weirdness started  George gave her a shot of Demerol when the paras loaded her into the ambulanceDshe had begun to stir and cry out weakly He gave her a boost hefty enough for him to be confident she would remain quiet until they got to Sisters of Mercy He was ninety per cent sure she would still be with them when they got there and that was one for the good guys Her eyes began to flutter while they were still six blocks from the hospital however She uttered a thick moan We can shoot her up again doc one of the paras said George was hardly aware this was the first time a paramedic had deigned to call him anything other than George or worse Georgie Are you nuts Id just as soon not confuse DOA and OD if its all the same to you The paramedic drew back George looked back at the young black woman and saw the eyes returning his gaze were awake and aware What has happened to me she asked George remembered the man who had told another man about what the woman had supposedly said how she was going to hunt the motherfucker down and kill his ass etc etc That man had been white George decided now it had been pure invention inspired either by that odd human urge to make naturally dramatic situations even more dramatic or just race prejudice This was a cultured intelligent woman Youve had an accident he said You wereD Her eyes slipped shut and he thought she was going to sleep again Good Let someone else tell her she had lost her legs Someone who made more than  a year He had shifted a little to the left wanting to check her bp again when she opened her eyes once more When she did George Shavers was looking at a different woman Fuckah cut off mah laigs I felt em go Dis damblance YYYes George said Suddenly he needed something to drink Not necessarily alcohol Just something wet His voice was dry This was like watching Spencer Tracy in Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde only for real Dey get dat honkey mahfah No George said thinking The guy got it right goddam the guy did actually get it right He was vaguely aware that the paramedics who had been hovering perhaps hoping he would do something wrong were now backing off Good Honky fuzz jus be lettin him off anyway I be gittin him I be cuttin his cock off Sumbitch I tell you what I goan do tdat sumbitch I tell you one thing you sumbitch honky I goan tell you  tell  Her eyes fluttered again and George had thought Yes go to sleep please go to sleep I dont get paid for this I dont understand this they told us about shock but nobody mentioned schizophrenia as one of the  The eyes opened The first woman was there What sort of accident was it she asked I remember coming out of the I   Eye he said stupidly She smiled a little It was a painful smile The Hungry I Its a coffee house Oh Yeah Right The other one hurt or not had made him feel dirty and a little ill This one made him feel like a knight in an Arthurian tale a knight who has successfully rescued the Lady Fair from the jaws of the dragon I remember walking down the stairs to the platform and after thatD Someone pushed you It sounded stupid but what was wrong with that It was stupid Pushed me in front of the train Yes Have I lost my legs George tried to swallow and couldnt There seemed to be nothing in his throat to grease the machinery Not all of them he said inanely and her eyes closed Let it be a faint he thought then please let it be a fD They opened blazing One hand came up and slashed five slits through the air within an inch of his face  any closer and he would have been in the ER getting his cheek stitched up instead of smoking Chesties with Julio Estavez YOU AINT NUTHIN BUT A BUNCH A HONKY SONSA BITCHES she screamed Her face was monstrous her eyes full of hells own light It wasnt even the face of a human being GOAN KILL EVERY MAHFAHIN HONKY I SEE GOAN GELD EM FUST GOAN CUT OFF THEIR BALLS AND SPIT EM IN THEY FACES GOAND It was crazy She talked like a cartoon black woman Butterfly McQueen gone Loony Tunes SheDor itDalso seemed superhuman This screaming writhing thing could not have just undergone impromptu surgery by subway train half an hour ago She bit She clawed out at him again and again Snot spat from her nose Spit flew from her lips Filth poured from her mouth Shoot her up doc one of the paras yelled His face was pale Fa crissakes shoot her up The para reached toward the supply case George shoved his hand aside Fuck off chickenshit George looked back at his patient and saw the calm cultured eyes of the other one looking at him Will I live she asked in a conversational tearoom voice He thought She is unaware of her lapses Totally unaware And after a moment So is the other one for that matter ID He gulped rubbed at his galloping heart through his tunic and then ordered himself to get control of this He had saved her life Her mental problems were not his concern Are you all right she asked him and the genuine concern in her voice made him smile a littleDher asking him Yes maam To which question are you responding For a moment he didnt understand then did Both he said and took her hand She squeezed it and he looked into her shining lucent eyes and thought A man could fall in love and that was when her hand turned into a claw and she was telling him he was a honky mahfah and she wadnt just goan take his balls she was goan chew on those mahfahs He pulled away looking to see if his hand was bleeding thinking incoherently that if it was he would have to do something about it because she was poison the woman was poison and being bitten by her would be about the same as being bitten by a copperhead or rattler There was no blood And when he looked again it was the other womanDthe first woman Please she said I dont want to die PlD Then she went out for good and that was good For all of them  So whatchoo tink Julio asked About whos gonna be in the Series George squashed the butt under the heel of his loafer White Sox I got em in the pool Whatchoo tink about that lady I think she might be schizophrenic George said slowly Yeah I know that I mean whass gonna happen to her I dont know She needs help man Who gonna give it Well I already gave her one George said but his face felt hot as if he were blushing Julio looked at him If you already gave her all the help you can give her you shoulda let her die doc George looked at Julio for a moment but found he couldnt stand what he saw in Julios eyesDnot accusation but sadness So he walked away He had places to go  The Time of the Drawing In the time since the accident it was for the most part still Odetta Holmes who was in control but Detta Walker had come forward more and more the thing Detta liked to do best was steal It didnt matter that her booty was always little more than junk no more than it mattered that she often threw it away later The taking was what mattered When the gunslinger entered her head in Macys Detta screamed in a combination of fury and horror and terror her hands freezing on the junk jewelry she was scooping into her purse She screamed because when Roland came into her mind when he came forward she for a moment sensed the other as if a door had been swung open inside of her head And she screamed because the invading raping presence was a honky She could not see but nonetheless sensed his whiteness People looked around A floorwalker saw the screaming woman in the wheelchair with her purse open saw one hand frozen in the act of stuffing costume jewelry into a purse that looked even from a distance of thirty feet worth three times the stuff she was stealing The floorwalker yelled Hey Jimmy and Jimmy Halvorsen one of Macys house detectives looked around and saw what was happening He started toward the black woman in the wheelchair on a dead run He couldnt help runningDhe had been a city cop for eighteen years and it was built into his systemDbut he was already thinking it was gonna be a shit bust Little kids cripples nuns they were always a shit bust Busting them was like kicking a drunk They cried a little in front of the judge and then took a walk It was hard to convince judges that cripples could also be slime But he ran just the same  Roland was momentarily horrified by the snakepit of hate and revulsion in which he found himself  and then he heard the woman screaming saw the big man with the potatosack belly running toward herhim saw people looking and took control Suddenly he was the woman with the dusky hands He sensed some strange duality inside her but couldnt think about it now He turned the chair and began to shove it forward The aisle rolled past himher People dived away to either side The purse was lost spilling Dettas credentials and stolen treasure in a wide trail along the floor The man with the heavy gut skidded on bogus gold chains and lipstick tubes and then fell on his ass  Shit Halvorsen thought furiously and for a moment one hand clawed under his sportcoat where there was a  in a clamshell holster Then sanity reasserted itself This was no drug bust or armed robbery this was a crippled black lady in a wheelchair She was rolling it like it was some punks dragracer but a crippled black lady was all she was just the same What was he going to do shoot her That would be great wouldnt it And where was she going to go There was nothing at the end of the aisle but two dressing rooms He picked himself up massaging his aching ass and began after her again limping a little now The wheelchair flashed into one of the dressing rooms The door slammed just clearing the pushhandles on the back Got you now bitch Jimmy thought And Im going to give you one hell of a scare I dont care if you got five orphan children and only a year to live Im not gonna hurt you but oh babe Im gonna shake your dice He beat the floorwalker to the dressing room slammed the door open with his left shoulder and it was empty No black woman No wheelchair No nothing He looked at the floorwalker stareyeyed Other one the floorwalker yelled Other one Before Jimmy could move the floorwalker had busted open the door of the other dressing room A woman in a linen skirt and a Playtex Living Bra screamed piercingly and crossed her arms over her chest She was very white and very definitely not crippled Pardon me the floorwalker said feeling hot crimson flood his face Get out of here you pervert the woman in the linen skirt and the bra cried Yes maam the floorwalker said and closed the door At Macys the customer was always right He looked at Halvorsen Halvorsen looked back What is this shit Halvorsen asked Did she go in there or not Yeah she did So where is she The floorwalker could only shake his head Lets go back and pick up the mess You pick up the mess Jimmy Halvorsen said I feel like I just broke my ass in nine pieces He paused To tell you the truth me fine bucko I also feel extremely confused  The moment the gunslinger heard the dressing room door bang shut behind him he rammed the wheelchair around in a half turn looking for the doorway If Eddie had done what he had promised it would be gone But the door was open Roland wheeled the Lady of Shadows through it Not long after Roland would think Any other woman crippled or otherwise suddenly shoved all the way down the aisle of the mart in which she was doing business  monkeybusiness you may call it if you like  by a stranger inside her head shoved into a little room while some man behind her yelled for her to stop then suddenly turned shoved again where there was by rights no room in which to shove then finding herself suddenly in an entirely different world I think any other woman under those circumstances would have most certainly have asked Where am I before all else Instead Odetta Holmes asked almost pleasantly What exactly are you planning to do with that knife young man  Roland looked up at Eddie who was crouched with his knife held less than a quarter of an inch over the skin Even with his uncanny speed there was no way the gunslinger could move fast enough to evade the blade if Eddie decided to use it Yes Roland said What are you planning to do with it I dont know Eddie said sounding completely disgusted with himself Cut bait I guess Sure doesnt look like I came here to fish does it He threw the knife toward the Ladys chair but well to the right It stuck quivering in the sand to its hilt Then the Lady turned her head and began I wonder if you could please explain where youve taken mD She stopped She had said Iwonder if you before her head had gotten around far enough to see there was no one behind her but the gunslinger observed with some real interest that she went on speaking for a moment anyway because the fact of her condition made certain things elementary truths of her life  if she had moved for instance someone must have moved her But there was no one behind her No one at all She looked back at Eddie and the gunslinger her dark eyes troubled confused and alarmed and now she asked Where am I Who pushed me How can I be here How can I be dressed for that matter when I was home watching the twelve oclock news in my robe Who am I Where is this Who are you Who am I she asked the gunslinger thought The dam broke and there was a flood of questions that was to be expected But that one questionDWho am IDeven now I dont think she knows she asked it Or when Because she had asked before Even before she had asked who they were she had asked who she was  Eddie looked from the lovely youngold face of the black woman in the wheelchair to Rolands face How come she doesnt know I cant say Shock I suppose Shock took her all the way back to her living room before she left for Macys You telling me the last thing she remembers is sitting in her bathrobe and listening to some blowdried dude talk about how they found that gonzo down in the Florida Keys with Christa McAuliffs left hand mounted on his den wall next to his prize marlin Roland didnt answer More dazed than ever the Lady said Who is Christa McAuliff Is she one of the missing Freedom Riders Now it was Eddies turn not to answer Freedom Riders What the hell were they The gunslinger glanced at him and Eddie was able to read his eyes easily enough Cant you see shes in shock Iknow what you mean Roland old buddy but it only washes up to a point I felt a little shock myself when you came busting into my head like Walter Payton on crack but it didnt wipe out my memory banks Speaking of shock hed gotten another pretty good jolt when she came through He had been kneeling over Rolands inert body the knife just above the vulnerable skin of the throat  but the truth was Eddie couldnt have used the knife anywayDnot then anyway He was staring into the doorway hypnotized as an aisle of Macys rushed forwardDhe was reminded again of The Shining where you saw what the little boy was seeing as he rode his trike through the hallways of that haunted hotel He remembered the little boy had seen this creepy pair of dead twins in one of those hallways The end of this aisle was much more mundane a white door The words ONLY TWO GARMENTS AT ONE TIME PLEASE were printed on it in discreet lettering Yeah it was Macys all right Macys for sure One black hand flew out and slammed the door open while the male voice a cop voice if Eddie had ever heard one and he had heard many in his time behind yelled for her to quit it that was no way out she was only making things a helluva lot worse for herself and Eddie caught a bare glimpse of the black woman in the wheelchair in the mirror to the left and he remembered thinking Jesus hes got her all right but she sure dont look happy about it Then the view pivoted and Eddie was looking at himself The view rushed toward the viewer and he wanted to put up the hand holding the knife to shield his eyes because all at once the sensation of looking through two sets of eyes was too much too crazy it was going to drive him crazy if he didnt shut it out but it all happened too fast for him to have time The wheelchair came through the door It was a tight fit Eddie heard its hubs squeal on the sides At the same moment he heard another sound a thick tearing sound that made him think of some word placental that he couldnt quite think of because he didnt know he knew it Then the woman was rolling toward him on the hardpacked sand and she no longer looked mad as hellDhardly looked like the woman Eddie had glimpsed in the mirror at all for that matter but he supposed that wasnt surprising when you all at once went from a changingroom at Macys to the seashore of a godforsaken world where some of the lobsters were the size of small Collie dogs it left you feeling a little winded That was a subject on which Eddie Dean felt he could personally give testimony She rolled about four feet before stopping and only went that far because of the slope and the gritty pack of the sand Her hands were no longer pumping the wheels as they must have been doing when you wake up with sore shoulders tomorrow you can blame them on Sir Roland lady Eddie thought sourly Instead they went to the arms of the chair and gripped them as she regarded the two men Behind her the doorway had already disappeared Disappeared That was not quite right It seemed to fold in on itself like a piece of film run backward This began to happen just as the store dick came slamming through the other more mundane doorDthe one between the store and the dressing room He was coming hard expecting the shoplifter would have locked the door and Eddie thought he was going to take one hell of a splat against the far wall but Eddie was never going to see it happen or not happen Before the shrinking space where the door between that world and this disappeared entirely Eddie saw everything on that side freeze solid The movie had become a still photograph All that remained now were the dual tracks of the wheelchair starting in sandy nowhere and running four feet to where it and its occupant now sat Wont somebody please explain where I am and how I got here the woman in the wheelchair askedDalmost pleaded Well Ill tell you one thing Dorothy Eddie said You aint in Kansas anymore The womans eyes brimmed with tears Eddie could see her trying to hold them in but it was no good She began to sob Furious and disgusted with himself as well Eddie turned on the gunslinger who had staggered to his feet Roland moved but not toward the weeping Lady Instead he went to pick up his knife Tell her Eddie shouted You brought her so go on and tell her man And after a moment he added in a lower tone And then tell me how come she doesnt remember herself  Roland did not respond Not at once He bent pinched the hilt of the knife between the two remaining fingers of his right hand transferred it carefully to his left and slipped it into the scabbard at the side of one gunbelt He was still trying to grapple with what he had sensed in the Ladys mind Unlike Eddie she had fought him fought him like a cat from the moment he came forward until they rolled through the door The fight had begun the moment she sensed him There had been no lapse because there had been no surprise He had experienced it but didnt in the least understand it No surprise at the invading stranger in her mind only the instant rage terror and the commencement of a battle to shake him free She hadnt come close to winning that battleDcould not he suspectedDbut that hadnt kept her from trying like hell He had felt a woman insane with fear and anger and hate He had sensed only darkness in herDthis was a mind entombed in a cavein ExceptD Except that in the moment they burst through the doorway and separated he had wishedDwished desperatelyD that he could tarry a moment longer One moment would have told so much Because the woman before them now wasnt the woman in whose mind he had been Being in Eddies mind had been like being in a room with jittery sweating walls Being in the Ladys had been like lying naked in the dark while venomous snakes crawled all over you Until the end She had changed at the end And there had been something else something he believed was vitally important but he either could not understand it or remember it Something like a glance the doorway itself only in her mind Something about you broke the forspecial it was you some sudden burst of understanding As at studies when you finally sawD Oh fuck you Eddie said disgustedly Youre nothing but a goddam machine He strode past Roland went to the woman knelt beside her and when she put her arms around him panictight like the arms of a drowning swimmer he did not draw away but put his own arms around her and hugged her back Its okay he said I mean its not great but its okay Where are we she wept Iwas sitting home watching TV so I could hear if my friends got out ofOxfordalive and now Im here and I DONT EVEN KNOW WHERE HERE IS Well neither do I Eddie said holding her tighter beginning to rock her a little but I guess were in it together Im from where youre from little old New York City  and Ive been through the same thingDwell a little different but same principleDand youre gonna be just fine As an afterthought he added As long as you like lobster She hugged him and wept and Eddie held her and rocked her and Roland thought Eddie will be all right now His brother is dead but he has someone else to take care of so Eddie will be all right now But he felt a pang a deep reproachful hurt in his heart He was capable of shootingDwith his left hand anywayDof killing of going on and on slamming with brutal relentlessness through miles and years even dimensions it seemed in search of the Tower He was capable of survival sometimes even of protectionDhe had saved the boy Jake from a slow death at the way station and from sexual consumption by the Oracle at the foot of the mountainsDbut in the end he had let Jake die Nor had this been by accident he had committed a conscious act of damnation He watched the two of them watched Eddie hug her assure her it was going to be all right He could not have done that and now the rue in his heart was joined by stealthy fear Ifyou have given up your heart for the Tower Roland you have already lost A heartless creature is a loveless creature and a loveless creature is a beast To be a beast is perhaps bearable although the man who has become one will surely pay hells own price in the end but what if you should gain your object What if you should heartless actually storm theDarkTowerand win it If there is naught but darkness in your heart what could you do except degenerate from beast to monster To gain ones object as a beast would only be bitterly comic like giving a magnifying glass to an elephaunt But to gain ones object as a monster  To pay hell is one thing But do you want to own it He thought of Allie and of the girl who had once waited for him at the window thought of the tears he had shed over Cuthberts lifeless corpse Oh then he had loved Yes Then I do want to love he cried but although Eddie was also crying a little now with the woman in the wheelchair the gunslingers eyes remained as dry as the desert he had crossed to reach this sunless sea  He would answer Eddies question later He would do that because he thought Eddie would do well to be on guard The reason she didnt remember was simple She wasnt one woman but two And one of them was dangerous  Eddie told her what he could glossing over the shootout but being truthful about everything else When he was done she remained perfectly silent for some time her hands clasped together on her lap Little streamlets coursed down from the shallowing mountains petering out some miles to the east It was from these that Roland and Eddie had drawn their water as they hiked north At first Eddie had gotten it because Roland was too weak Later they had taken turns always having to go a little further and search a little longer before finding a stream They grew steadily more listless as the mountains slumped but the water hadnt made them sick So far Roland had gone yesterday and although that made today Eddies turn the gunslinger had gone again shouldering the hide waterskins and walking off without a word Eddie found this queerly discreet He didnt want to be touched by the gestureDby anything about Roland for that matterDand found he was a little just the same She listened attentively to Eddie not speaking at all her eyes fixed on his At one moment Eddie would guess she was five years older than he at another he would guess fifteen There was one thing he didnt have to guess about he was falling in love with her When he had finished she sat for a moment without saying anything now not looking at him but beyond him looking at the waves which would at nightfall bring the lobsters and with their alien lawyerly questions He had been particularly careful to describe them Better for her to be a little scared now than a lot scared when they came out to play He supposed she wouldnt want to eat them not after hearing what they had done to Rolands hand and foot not after she got a good close look at them But eventually hunger would win out over didachick and dumachum Her eyes were far and distant Odetta he asked after perhaps five minutes had gone by She had told him her name Odetta Holmes He thought it was a gorgeous name She looked back at him startled out of her revery She smiled a little She said one word No He only looked at her able to think of no suitable reply He thought he had never understood until that moment how illimitable a simple negative could be I dont understand he said finally What are you noing All this Odetta swept an arm she had hed noticed very strong armsDsmooth but very strong indicating the sea the sky the beach the scruffy foothills where the gunslinger was now presumably searching for water or maybe getting eaten alive by some new and interesting monster something Eddie didnt really care to think about Indicating in short this entire world I understand how you feel I had a pretty good case of the unrealities myself at first But had he Looking back it seemed he had simply accepted perhaps because he was sick shaking himself apart in his need for junk You get over it No she said again I believe one of two things has happened and no matter which one it is I am still in Oxford  Mississippi  None of this is real She went on If her voice had been louder or perhaps if he had not been falling in love it would almost have been a lecture As it was it sounded more like lyric than lecture Except he had to keep reminding himself bullshits what it really is and you have to convince her of that For her sake I may have sustained a head injury she said They are notorious swingers of axehandles and billyclubs in Oxford Town  OxfordTown That produced a faint chord of recognition far back in Eddies mind She said the words in a kind of rhythm that he for some reason associated with Henry  Henry and wet diapers Why What Didnt matter now Youre trying to tell me you think this is all some sort of dream youre having while youre unconscious Or in a coma she said And you neednt look at me as though you thought it was preposterous because it isnt Look here She parted her hair carefully on the left and Eddie could see she wore it to one side not just because she liked the style The old wound beneath the fall of her hair was scarred and ugly not brown but a grayishwhite I guess youve had a lot of hard luck in your time he said She shrugged impatiently A lot of hard luck and a lot of soft living she said Maybe it all balances out I only showed you because I was in a coma for three weeks when I was five I dreamed a lot then I cant remember what the dreams were but I remember my mamma said they knew I wasnt going to die just as long as I kept talking and it seemed like I kept talking all the time although she said they couldnt make out one word in a dozen I do remember that the dreams were very vivid She paused looking around As vivid as this place seems to be And you Eddie When she said his name his arms prickled Oh he had it all right Had it bad And him She shivered He seems the most vivid of all We ought to I mean we are real no matter what you think She gave him a kind smile It was utterly without belief How did that happen he asked That thing on your head It doesnt matter Im just making the point that what has happened once might very well happen again No but Im curious I was struck by a brick It was our first trip north We came to the town of Elizabeth  New Jersey  We came in the Jim Crow car Whats that She looked at him unbelievingly almost scornfully Where have you been living Eddie In a bombshelter Im from a different time he said Could I ask how old you are Odetta Old enough to vote and not old enough for Social Security Well I guess that puts me in my place But gently I hope she said and smiled that radiant smile which made his arms prickle Im twentythree he said but I was born in Dthe year you were living in when Roland took you Thats rubbish No I was living in  when he took me Well she said after a moment That certainly adds a great deal to your argument for this as reality Eddie The Jim Crow car  was it where the black people had to stay The Negros she said Calling a Negro a black is a trifle rude dont you think Youll all be calling yourselves that by  or so Eddie said When I was a kid calling a black kid a Negro was apt to get you in a fight It was almost like calling him a nigger She looked at him uncertainly for a moment then shook her head again Tell me about the brick then My mothers youngest sister was going to be married Odetta said Her name was Sophia but my mother always called her Sister Blue because it was the color she always fancied Or at least she fancied to fancy it was how my mother put it So I always called her Aunt Blue even before I met her It was the most lovely wedding There was a reception afterward I remember all the presents She laughed Presents always look so wonderful to a child dont they Eddie He smiled Yeah you got that right You never forget presents Not what you got not what somebody else got either My father had begun to make money by then but all I knew is that we were getting ahead Thats what my mother always called it and once when I told her a little girl I played with had asked if my daddy was rich my mother told me that was what I was supposed to say if any of my other chums ever asked me that question That we were getting ahead So they were able to give Aunt Blue a lovely china set and I remember Her voice faltered One hand rose to her temple and rubbed absently as if a headache were beginning there Remember what Odetta I remember my mother gave her a forspecial What Im sorry Ive got a headache Its got my tongue tangled I dont know why Im bothering to tell you all this anyway Do you mind No I dont mind I meant to say mother gave her a special plate It was white with delicate blue tracework woven all around the rim Odetta smiled a little Eddie didnt think it was an entirely comfortable smile Something about this memory disturbed her and the way its immediacy seemed to have taken precedence over the extremely strange situation she had found herself in a situation which should be claiming all or most of her attention disturbed him I can see that plate as clearly as I can see you now Eddie My mother gave it to Aunt Blue and she cried and cried over it I think shed seen a plate like that once when she and my mother were children only of course their parents could never have afforded such a thing There was none of them who got any thing forspecial as kids After the reception Aunt Blue and her husband left for the Great Smokies on their honeymoon They went on the train She looked at Eddie In the Jim Crow car he said Thats right In the Crow car In those days thats what Negros rode in and where they ate Thats what were trying to change in Oxford Town  She looked at him almost surely expecting him to insist she was here but he was caught in the webwork of his own memory again wet diapers and those words Oxford Town  Only suddenly other words came just a single line but he could remember Henry singing it over and over until his mother asked if he couldnt please stop so she could hear Walter Cronkite Somebody better investigate soon Those were the words Sung over and over by Henry in a nasal monotone He tried for more but couldnt get it and was that any real surprise He could have been no more than three at the time Somebody better investigate soon The words gave him a chill Eddie are you all right Yes Why You shivered He smiled Donald Duck must have walked over my grave She laughed Anyway at least I didnt spoil the wedding It happened when we were walking back to the railway station We stayed the night with a friend of Aunt Blues and in the morning my father called a taxi The taxi came almost right away but when the driver saw we were colored he drove off like his head was on fire and his ass was catching Aunt Blues friend had already gone ahead to the depot with our luggageDthere was a lot of it because we were going to spend a week in New York  I remember my father saying he couldnt wait to see my face light up when the clock in Central Park struck the hour and all the animals danced My father said we might as well walk to the station My mother agreed just as fast as licketysplit saying that was a fine idea it wasnt but a mile and it would be nice to stretch our legs after three days on one train just behind us and half a day on another one just ahead of us My father said yes and it was gorgeous weather besides but I think I knew even at five that he was mad and she was embarrassed and both of them were afraid to call another taxicab because the same thing might happen again So we went walking down the street I was on the inside because my mother was afraid of me getting too close to the traffic I remember wondering if my daddy meant my face would actually start to glow or something when I saw that clock in Central Park and if that might not hurt and that was when the brick came down on my head Everything went dark for a while Then the dreams started Vivid dreams She smiled Like this dream Eddie Did the brick fall or did someone bomb you They never found anyone The police my mother told me this long after when I was sixteen or so found the place where they thought the brick had been but there were other bricks missing and more were loose It was just outside the window of a fourthfloor room in an apartment building that had been condemned But of course there were lots of people staying there just the same Especially at night Sure Eddie said No one saw anyone leaving the building so it went down as an accident My mother said she thought it had been but I think she was lying She didnt even bother trying to tell me what my father thought They were both still smarting over how the cabdriver had taken one look at us and driven off It was that more than anything else that made them believe someone had been up there just looking out and saw us coming and decided to drop a brick on the niggers Will your lobstercreatures come out soon No Eddie said Not until dusk So one of your ideas is that all of this is a comadream like the ones you had when you got bopped by the brick Only this time you think it was a billyclub or something Yes Whats the other one Odettas face and voice were calm enough but her head was filled with an ugly skein of images which all added up to Oxford Town  Oxford Town  How did the song go Two men killed by the light of the moonSomebody better investigate soon Not quite right but it was close Close I may have gone insane she said  The first words which came into Eddies mind were If you think youve gone insane Odetta youre nuts Brief consideration however made this seem an unprofitable line of argument to take Instead he remained silent for a time sitting by her wheelchair his knees drawn up his hands holding his wrists Were you really a heroin addict Am he said Its like being an alcoholic or basing Its not a thing you ever get over I used to hear that and go Yeah yeah right right in my head you know but now I understand I still want it and I guess part of me will always want it but the physical part has passed Whats basing she asked Something that hasnt been invented yet in your when Its something you do with cocaine only its like turning TNT into an Abomb You did it Christ no Heroin was my thing I told you You dont seem like an addict she said Eddie actually was fairly spiffy  if that was one ignored the gamy smell arising from his body and clothes he could rinse himself and did could rinse his clothes and did but lacking soap he could not really wash either His hair had been short when Roland stepped into his life the better to sail through customs my dear and what a great big joke that had turned out to be and was a still a respectable length He shaved every morning using the keen edge of Rolands knife gingerly at first but with increasing confidence Hed been too young for shaving to be part of his life when Henry left for Nam and it hadnt been any big deal to Henry back then either he never grew a beard but sometimes went three or four days before Mom nagged him into mowing the stubble When he came back however Henry was a maniac on the subject as he was on a few othersDfootpowder after showering teeth to be brushed three or four times a day and followed by a chaser of mouthwash clothes always hung up and he turned Eddie into a fanatic as well The stubble was mowed every morning and every evening Now this habit was deep in his grain like the others Henry had taught him Including of course the one you took care of with a needle Too cleancut he asked her grinning Too white she said shortly and then was quiet for a moment looking sternly out at the sea Eddie was quiet too If there was a comeback to something like that he didnt know what it was Im sorry she said That was very unkind very unfair and very unlike me Its all right Its not Its like a white person saying something like Jeez I never would have guessed you were a nigger to someone with a very light skin You like to think of yourself as more fairminded Eddie said What we like to think of ourselves and what we really are rarely have much in common I should think but yesDI like to think of myself as more fairminded So please accept my apology Eddie On one condition Whats that she was smiling a little again That was good He liked it when he was able to make her smile Give this a fair chance Thats the condition Give what a fair chance She sounded slightly amused Eddie might have bristled at that tone in someone elses voice might have felt he was getting boned but with her it was different With her it was all right He supposed with her just about anything would have been That theres a third alternative That this really is happening I mean  Eddie cleared his throat Im not very good at this philosophical shit or you know metamorphosis or whatever the hell you call itD Do you mean metaphysics Maybe I dont know I think so But I know you cant go around disbelieving what your senses tell you Why if your idea about this all being a dream is rightD I didnt say a dreamD Whatever you said thats what it comes down to isnt it A false reality If there had been something faintly condescending in her voice a moment ago it was gone now Philosophy and metaphysics may not be your bag Eddie but you must have been a hell of a debater in school I was never in debate That was for gays and hags and wimps Like chess club What do you mean my bag Whats a bag Just something you like What do you mean gays What are gays He looked at her for a moment then shrugged Homos Fags Never mind We could swap slang all day Its not getting us anyplace What Im trying to say is that if its all a dream it could be mine not yours You could be a figment of my imagination Her smile faltered You  nobody bopped you Nobody bopped you either Now her smile was entirely gone No one that I remember she corrected with some sharpness Me either he said You told me theyre rough in Oxford  Well those Customs guys werent exactly cheery joy when they couldnt find the dope they were after One of them could have headbopped me with the butt of his gun I could be lying in a Bellevue ward right now dreaming you and Roland while they write their reports explaining how while they were interrogating me I became violent and had to be subdued Its not the same Why Because youre this intelligent socially active black lady with no legs and Im just a hype from CoOp City  He said it with a grin meaning it as an amiable jape but she flared at him I wish you would stop calling me black He sighed Okay but its gonna take getting used to You should have been on the debate club anyway Fuck he said and the turn of her eyes made him realize again that the difference between them was much wider than color they were speaking to each other from separate islands The water between was time Never mind The word had gotten her attention I dont want to debate you I want to wake you up to the fact that you are awake thats all I might be able to at least operate provisionally according to the dictates of your third alternative as long as this  this situation  continued to go on except for one thing Theres a fundamental difference between what happened to you and what happened to me So fundamental so large that you havent seen it Then show it to me There is no discontinuity in your consciousness There is a very large one in mine I dont understand I mean you can account for all of your time Odetta said Your story follows from point to point the airplane the incursion by that  that  by himD She nodded toward the foothills with clear distaste The stashing of the drugs the officers who took you into custody all the rest Its a fantastic story it has no missing links As for myself I arrived back from Oxford  was met by Andrew my driver and brought back to my building I bathed and I wanted sleepDI was getting a very bad headache and sleep is the only medicine thats any good for the really bad ones But it was close on midnight  and I thought I would watch the news first Some of us had been released but a good many more were still in the jug when we left I wanted to find out if their cases had been resolved I dried off and put on my robe and went into the living room I turned on the TV news The newscaster started talking about a speech Krushchev had just made about the American advisors in Viet Nam  He said We have a film report fromD and then he was gone and I was rolling down this beach You say you saw me in some sort of magic doorway which is now gone and that I was in Macys and that I was stealing All of this is preposterous enough but even if it was so I could find something better to steal than costume jewelry I dont wear jewelry You better look at your hands again Odetta Eddie said quietly For a very long time she looked from the diamond on her left pinky too large and vulgar to be anything but paste to the large opal on the third finger of her right hand which was too large and vulgar to be anything but real None of this is happening she repeated firmly You sound like a broken record He was genuinely angry for the first time Every time someone pokes a hole in your neat little story you just retreat to that none of this is happening shit You have to wise up Detta Dont call me that I hate that she burst out so shrilly that Eddie recoiled Sorry Jesus I didnt know I went from night to day from undressed to dressed from my living room to this deserted beach And what really happened was that some bigbellied redneck deputy hit me upside the head with a club and that is all But your memories dont stop in Oxford  he said softly WWhat Uncertain again Or maybe seeing and not wanting to Like with the rings If you got whacked in Oxford  how come your memories dont stop there There isnt always a lot of logic to things like this She was rubbing her temples again And now if its all the same to you Eddie Id just as soon end the conversation My headache is back Its quite bad I guess whether or not logic figures in all depends on what you want to believe I saw you in Macys Odetta I saw you stealing You say you dont do things like that but you also told me you dont wear jewelry You told me that even though youd looked down at your hands several times while we were talking Those rings were there then but it was as if you couldnt see them until I called your attention to them and made you see them I dont want to talk about it she shouted My head hurts All right But you know where you lost track of time and it wasnt in Oxford  Leave me alone she said dully Eddie saw the gunslinger toiling his way back with two full waterskins one tied around his waist and the other slung over his shoulders He looked very tired I wish I could help you Eddie said but to do that I guess Id have to be real He stood by her for a moment but her head was bowed the tips of her fingers steadily massaging her temples Eddie went to meet Roland  Sit down Eddie took the bags You look all in I am Im getting sick again Eddie looked at the gunslingers flushed cheeks and brow his cracked lips and nodded I hoped it wouldnt happen but Im not that surprised man You didnt bat for the cycle Balazar didnt have enough Keflex I dont understand you If you dont take a penicillin drug long enough you dont kill the infection You just drive it underground A few days go by and it comes back Well need more but at least theres a door to go to In the meantime youll just have to take it easy But Eddie was thinking unhappily of Odettas missing legs and the longer and longer treks it took to find water He wondered if Roland could have picked a worse time to have a relapse He supposed it was possible he just didnt see how I have to tell you something about Odetta Thats her name Uhhuh Its very lovely the gunslinger said Yeah I thought so too What isnt so lovely is the way she feels about this place She doesnt think shes here I know And she doesnt like me much does she No Eddie thought but that doesnt keep her from thinking youre one booger of a hallucination He didnt say it only nodded The reasons are almost the same the gunslinger said Shes not the woman I brought through you see Not at all Eddie stared then suddenly nodded excited That blurred glimpse in the mirror  that snarling face  the man was right Jesus Christ of course he was That hadnt been Odetta at all Then he remembered the hands which had gone pawing carelessly through the scarves and had just as carelessly gone about the business of stuffing the junk jewelry into her big purseDalmost it had seemed as if she wanted to be caught The rings had been there Same rings But that doesnt necessarily mean the same hands he thought wildly but that would only hold for a second He had studied her hands They were the same longfingered and delicate No the gunslinger continued She is not His blue eyes studied Eddie carefully Her handsD Listen the gunslinger said and listen carefully Our lives may depend on itDmine because Im getting sick again and yours because you have fallen in love with her Eddie said nothing She is two women in the same body She was one woman when I entered her and another when I returned here Now Eddie could say nothing There was something else something strange but either I didnt understand it or I did and its slipped away It seemed important Roland looked past Eddie looked to the beached wheelchair standing alone at the end of its short track from nowhere Then he looked back at Eddie I understand very little of this or how such a thing can be but you must be on your guard Do you understand that Yes Eddies lungs felt as if they had very little wind in them He understoodDor had at least a moviegoers understanding of the sort of thing the gunslinger was speaking ofDbut he didnt have the breath to explain not yet He felt as if Roland had kicked all his breath out of him Good Because the woman I entered on the other side of the door was as deadly as those lobsterthings that come out at night You must be on your guard the gunslinger said and Eddie had agreed but the gunslinger knew Eddie didnt know what he was talking about the whole back half of Eddies mind where survival is or isnt didnt get the message The gunslinger saw this It was a good thing for Eddie he did  In the middle of the night Detta Walkers eyes sprang open They were full of starlight and clear intelligence She remembered everything how she had fought them how they had tied her into her chair how they had taunted her calling her niggerbitch niggerbitch She remembered monsters coming out of the waves and she remembered how one of the menDthe olderDhad killed one of them The younger had built a fire and cooked it and then had offered her smoking monstermeat on a stick grinning She remembered spitting at his face remembered his grin turning into an angry honky scowl He had hit her upside the face and told her Well thats all right youll come around niggerbitch Wait and see if you dont Then he and the Really Bad ManDhad laughed and the Really Bad Man had brought out a haunch of beef which he spitted and slowly cooked over the fire on the beach of this alien place to which they had brought her The smell of the slowly roasting beef had been seductive but she had made no sign Even when the younger one had waved a chunk of it near her face chanting Bite for it niggerbitch go on and bite for it she had sat like stone holding herself in Then she had slept and now she was awake and the ropes they had tied her with were gone She was no longer in her chair but lying on one blanket and under another far above the hightide line where the lobsterthings still wandered and questioned and snatched the odd unfortunate gull out of the air She looked to her left and saw nothing She looked to her right and saw two sleeping men wrapped in two piles of blankets The younger one was closer and the Really Bad Man had taken off his gunbelts and laid them by him The guns were still in them You made a bad mistake mahfah Detta thought and rolled to her right The gritty crunch and squeak of her body on the sand was inaudible under the wind the waves the questioning creatures She crawled slowly along the sand like one of the lobstrosities herself her eyes glittering She reached the gunbelts and pulled one of the guns It was very heavy the grip smooth and somehow independently deadly in her hand The heaviness didnt bother her She had strong arms did Detta Walker She crawled a little further The younger man was no more than a snoring rock but the Really Bad Man stirred a little in his sleep and she froze with a snarl tattooed on her face until he quieted again He be one sneaky sumbitch You check Detta You check be sho She found the worn chamber release tried to shove it forward got nothing and pulled it instead The chamber swung open Loaded Fucker be loaded You goan do this young cockadewalk first and dat Really Bad Man be wakin up and you goan give him one big grinDsmile honeychile so I kin see where you isDand den you goan clean his clock somethin righteous She swung the chamber back started to pull the hammer  and then waited When the wind kicked up a gust she pulled the hammer to full cock Detta pointed Rolands gun at Eddies temple  The gunslinger watched all this from one halfopen eye The fever was back but not bad yet not so bad that he must mistrust himself So he waited that one halfopen eye the finger on the trigger of his body the body which had always been his revolver when there was no revolver at hand She pulled the trigger Click Of course click When he and Eddie had come back with the waterskins from their palaver Odetta Holmes had been deeply asleep in her wheelchair slumped to one side They had made her the best bed they could on the sand and carried her gently from her wheelchair to the spread blankets Eddie had been sure she would awake but Roland knew better He had killed Eddie had built a fire and they had eaten saving a portion aside for Odetta in the morning Then they had talked and Eddie had said something which burst upon Roland like a sudden flare of lightning It was too bright and too brief to be total understanding but he saw much the way one may discern the lay of the land in a single lucky stroke of lightning He could have told Eddie then but did not He understood that he must be Eddies Cort and when one of Corts pupils was left hurt and bleeding by some unexpected blow Corts response had always been the same A child doesnt understand a hammer until hes mashed his finger at a nail Get up and stop whining maggot You have forgotten the face of your father So Eddie had fallen asleep even though Roland had told him he must be on his guard and when Roland was sure they both slept he had waited longer for the Lady who could he thought be sly he had reloaded his guns with spent casings unstrapped them that caused a pang and put them by Eddie Then he waited One hour two three Halfway through the fourth hour as his tired and feverish body tried to drowse he sensed rather than saw the Lady come awake and came fully awake himself He watched her roll over He watched her turn her hands into claws and pull herself along the sand to where his gunbelts lay He watched her take one of them out come closer to Eddie and then pause her head cocking her nostrils swelling and contracting doing more than smelling the air tasting it Yes This was the woman he had brought across When she glanced toward the gunslinger he did more than feign sleep because she would have sensed sham he went to sleep When he sensed her gaze shift away he awoke and opened that single eye again He saw her begin to raise the gunDshe did this with less effort than Eddie had shown the first time Roland saw him do the same thingDand point it toward Eddies head Then she paused her face filled with an inexpressible cunning In that moment she reminded him of Marten She fiddled with the cylinder getting it wrong at first then swinging it open She looked at the heads of the shells Roland tensed waiting first to see if she would know the firing pins had already been struck waiting next to see if she would turn the gun look into the other end of the cylinder and see there was only emptiness there instead of lead he had thought of loading the guns with cartridges which had already misfired but only briefly Cort had taught them that every gun is ultimately ruled by Old Man Splitfoot and a cartridge which misfires once may not do so a second time If she did that he would spring at once But she swung the cylinder back in began to cock the hammer  and then paused again Paused for the wind to mask the single low click He thought Here is another God shes evil this one and shes legless but shes a gunslinger as surely as Eddie is one He waited with her The wind gusted She pulled the hammer to full cock and placed it half an inch from Eddies temple With a grin that was a ghouls grimace she pulled the trigger Click He waited She pulled it again And again And again ClickClickClick MahFAH she screamed and reversed the gun with liquid grace Roland coiled but did not leap A child doesnt understand a hammer until hes mashed his finger at a nail If she kills him she kills you Doesnt matter the voice of Cort answered inexorably Eddie stirred And his reflexes were not bad he moved fast enough to avoid being driven unconscious or killed Instead of coming down on the vulnerable temple the heavy gunbutt cracked the side of his jaw What  Jesus MAHFAH HONKY MAHFUH Detta screamed and Roland saw her raise the gun a second time And even though she was legless and Eddie was rolling away it was as much as he dared If Eddie hadnt learned the lesson now he never would The next time the gunslinger told Eddie to be on his guard Eddie would be and besidesDthe bitch was quick It would not be wise to depend further than this on either Eddies quickness or the Ladys infirmity He uncoiled flying over Eddie and knocking her backward ending up on top of her You want it mahfah she screamed at him simultaneously rolling her crotch against his groin and raising the arm which still held the gun above his head You want it I goan give you what you want sho Eddie he shouted again not just yelling now but commanding For a moment Eddie just went on squalling there eyes wide blood dripping from his jaw it had already begun to swell staring eyes wide Move cant you move he thought or is it that you dont want to His strength was fading now and the next time she brought that heavy gunbutt down she was going to break his arm with it  that was if he got his arm up in time If he didnt she was going to break his head with it Then Eddie moved He caught the gun on the downswing and she shrieked turning toward him biting at him like a vampire cursing him in a gutter patois so darkly southern that even Eddie couldnt understand it to Roland it sounded as if the woman had suddenly begun to speak in a foreign language But Eddie was able to yank the gun out of her hand and with the impending bludgeon gone Roland was able to pin her She did not quit even then but continued to buck and heave and curse sweat standing out all over her dark face Eddie stared mouth opening and closing like the mouth of a fish He touched tentatively at his jaw winced pulled his fingers back examined them and the blood on them She was screaming that she would kill them both they could try and rape her but she would kill them with her cunt they would see that was one bad son of a bitching cave with teeth around the entrance and if they wanted to try and explore it they would find out What in the hellD Eddie said stupidly One of my gunbelts the gunslinger panted harshly at him Get it Im going to roll her over on top of me and youre going to grab her arms and tie her hands behind her You aint NEVAH Detta shrieked and sunfished her legless body with such sudden force that she almost bucked Roland off He felt her trying to bring the remainder of her right thigh up again and again wanting to drive it into his balls I  I  she  Move God curse your fathers face Roland roared and at last Eddie moved  They almost lost control of her twice during the tying and binding But Eddie was at last able to slipknot one of Rolands gunbelts around her wrists when RolandDusing all his forceDfinally brought them together behind her all the time drawing back from her lunging bites like a mongoose from a snake the bites he avoided but before Eddie had finished the gunslinger was drenched with spittle and then Eddie dragged her off holding the short leash of the makeshift slipknot to do it He did not want to hurt this thrashing screaming cursing thing It was uglier than the lobstrosities by far because of the greater intelligence which informed it but he knew it could also be beautiful He did not want to harm the other person the vessel held somewhere inside it like a live dove deep inside one of the secret compartments in a magicians magic box Odetta Holmes was somewhere inside that screaming screeching thing  Although his last mountDa muleDhad died too long ago to remember the gunslinger still had a piece of its tetherrope which in turn had once been a fine gunslingers lariat They used this to bind her in her wheelchair as she had imagined or falsely remembered and in the end they both came to the same thing didnt they they had done already Then they drew away from her If not for the crawling lobsterthings Eddie would have gone down to the water and washed his hands I feel like Im going to vomit he said in a voice that jigjagged up and down the scale like the voice of an adolescent boy Why dont you go on and eat each others COCKS the struggling thing in the chair screeched Why dont you jus go on and do dat if you fraid of a black womans cunny You just go on Sho Suck on yo each ones candles Do it while you got a chance causeDetta Walker goan get outen dis chair and cut dem skinny ole white candles off and feed em to those walkm buzzsaws down there Shes the woman I was in Do you believe me now I believed you before Eddie said I told you that You believed you believed You believed on the top of your mind Do you believe it all the way down now All the way to the bottom Eddie looked at the shrieking convulsing thing in the chair and then looked away white except for the slash on his jaw which was still dripping a little That side of his face was beginning to look a little like a balloon Yes he said God yes This woman is a monster Eddie began to cry The gunslinger wanted to comfort him could not commit such a sacrilege he remembered Jake too well and walked off into the dark with his new fever burning and aching inside him  Much earlier on that night while Odetta still slept Eddie said he thought he might understand what was wrong with her Might The gunslinger asked what he meant She could be a schizophrenic Roland only shook his head Eddie explained what he understood of schizophrenia gleanings from such films as The Three Faces of Eve and various TV programs mostly the soap operas he and Henry had often watched while stoned Roland had nodded Yes The disease Eddie described sounded about right A woman with two faces one light and one dark A face like the one the man in black had shown him on the fifth Tarot card And they dont knowDthese schizophrenesDthat they have another No Eddie said But  He trailed off moodily watching the lobstrosities crawl and question question and crawl But what Im no shrink Eddie said so I dont really knowD Shrink What is a shrink Eddie tapped his temple A headdoctor A doctor for your mind Theyre really called psychiatrists Roland nodded He liked shrink better Because this Ladys mind was too large Twice as large as it needed to be But I think schizos almost always know something is wrong with them Eddie said Because there are blanks Maybe Im wrong but I always got the idea that they were usually two people who thought they had partial amnesia because of the blank spaces in their memories when the other personality was in control She  she says she remembers everything She really thinks she remembers everything I thought you said she didnt believe any of this was happening Yeah Eddie said but forget that for now Im trying to say that no matter what she believes what she remembers goes right from her living room where she was sitting in her bathrobe watching the midnight news to here with no break at all She doesnt have any sense that some other person took over between then and when you grabbed her in Macys Hell that might have been the next day or even weeks later I know it was still winter because most of the shoppers in that store were wearing coatsD The gunslinger nodded Eddies perceptions were sharpening That was good He had missed the boots and scarves the gloves sticking out of coat pockets but it was still a start Dbut otherwise its impossible to tell how long Odetta was that other woman because she doesnt know I think shes in a situation shes never been in before and her way of protecting both sides is this story about getting cracked over the head Roland nodded And the rings Seeing those really shook her up She tried not to show it but it showed all right Roland asked If these two women dont know they exist in the same body and if they dont even suspect that something may be wrong if each has her own separate chain of memories partly real but partly made up to fit the times the other is there what are we to do with her How are we even to live with her Eddie had shrugged Dont ask me Its your problem Youre the one who says you need her Hell you risked your neck to bring her here Eddie thought about this for a minute remembered squatting over Rolands body with Rolands knife held just above the gunslingers throat and laughed abruptly and without humor LITERALLY risked your neck man he thought A silence fell between them Odetta had by then been breathing quietly As the gunslinger was about to reiterate his warning for Eddie to be on guard and announce loud enough for the Lady to hear if she was only shamming that he was going to turn in Eddie said the thing which lighted Rolands mind in a single sudden glare the thing which made him understand at least part of what he needed so badly to know At the end when they came through She had changed at the end And he had seen something some thingD Tell you what Eddie said moodily stirring the remains of the fire with a split claw from this nights kill when you brought her through I felt like I was a schizo Why Eddie thought then shrugged It was too hard to explain or maybe he was just too tired Its not important Why Eddie looked at Roland saw he was asking a serious question for a serious reasonDor thought he wasDand took a minute to think back Its really hard to describe man It was looking in that door Thats what freaked me out When you see someone move in that door its like youre moving with them You know what Im talking about Roland nodded Well I watched it like it was a movieDnever mind its not importantDuntil the very end Then you turned her toward this side of the doorway and for the first time I was looking at myself It was like  He groped and could find nothing I dunno It should have been like looking in a mirror I guess but it wasnt because  because it was like looking at another person It was like being turned inside out Like being in two places at the same time Shit I dont know But the gunslinger was thunderstruck That was what he had sensed as they came through that was what had happened to her no not just her them for a moment Detta and Odetta had looked at each other not the way one would look at her reflection in a mirror but as separate people the mirror became a windowpane and for a moment Odetta had seen Detta and Detta had seen Odetta and had been equally horrorstruck They each know the gunslinger thought grimly They may not have known before but they do now They can try to hide it from themselves but for a moment they saw they knew and that knowing must still be there Roland What Just wanted to make sure you hadnt gone to sleep with your eyes open Because for a minute you looked like you were you know long ago and far away If so Im back now the gunslinger said Im going to turn in Remember what I said Eddie be on your guard Ill watch Eddie said but Roland knew that sick or not he would have to be the one to do the watching tonight Everything else had followed from that  Following the ruckus Eddie and Detta Walker eventually went to sleep again she did not so much fall asleep as drop into an exhausted state of unconsciousness in her chair lolling to one side against the restraining ropes The gunslinger however lay wakeful Iwill have to bring the two of them to battle he thought but he didnt need one of Eddies shrinks to tell him that such a battle might be to the death Ifthe bright one Odetta were to win that battle all might yet be well If the dark one were to win it all would surely be lost with her Yet he sensed that what really needed doing was not killing but joining He had already recognized much that would be of value to himDthemD in Detta Walkers gutter toughness and he wanted herDbut he wanted her under control There was a long way to go Detta thought he and Eddie were monsters of some species she called Honk Mafahs That was only dangerous delusion but there would be real monsters along the wayDthe lobstrosities were not the first nor would they be the last The fightuntilyoudrop woman he had entered and who had come out of hiding again tonight might come in very handy in a fight against such monsters if she could be tempered by Odetta Holmess calm humanityDespecially now with him short two fingers almost out of bullets and growing more fever But that is a step ahead I think if I can make them acknowledge each other that would bring them into confrontation How may it be done He lay awake all that long night thinking and although he felt the fever in him grow he found no answer to his question  Eddie woke up shortly before daybreak saw the gunslinger sitting near the ashes of last nights fire with his blanket wrapped around him Indianfashion and joined him How do you feel Eddie asked in a low voice The Lady still slept in her crisscrossing of ropes although she occasionally jerked and muttered and moaned All right Eddie gave him an appraising glance You dont look all right Thank you Eddie the gunslinger said dryly Youre shivering It will pass The Lady jerked and moaned againDthis time a word that was almost understandable It might have been Oxford God I hate to see her tied up like that Eddie murmured Like a goddam calf in a barn Shell wake soon Mayhap we can unloose her when she does It was the closest either of them came to saying out loud that when the Lady in the chair opened her eyes the calm if slightly puzzled gaze of Odetta Holmes might greet them Fifteen minutes later as the first sunrays struck over the hills those eyes did openDbut what the men saw was not the calm gaze of Odetta Holmes but the mad glare of Detta Walker How many times you done rape me while I was buzzed out she asked My cunt feel all slick an tallowy like somebody done been at it with a couple them little bitty white candles you graymeat mahfahs call cocks Roland sighed Lets get going he said and gained his feet with a grimace I aint goan nowhere wit choo mahfah Detta spat Oh yes you are Eddie said Dreadfully sorry my dear Where you think Im goan Well Eddie said what was behind Door Number One wasnt so hot and what was behind Door Number Two was even worse so now instead of quitting like sane people were going to go right on ahead and check out Door Number Three The way things have been going I think its likely to be something like Godzilla or Ghidra the ThreeHeaded Monster but Im an optimist Im still hoping for the stainless steel cookware I aint goan Youre going all right Eddie said and walked behind her chair She began struggling again but the gunslinger had made these knots and her struggles only drew them tighter Soon enough she saw this and ceased She was full of poison but far from stupid But she looked back over her shoulder at Eddie with a grin which made him recoil a little It seemed to him the most evil expression he had ever seen on a human face Well maybe I be goan on a little way she said but maybe not sfars you think white boy And sureGod not sfasts you think What do you mean That leering overtheshoulder grin again You find out white boy Her eyes mad but cogent shifted briefly to the gunslinger You bofe be findin dat out Eddie wrapped his hands around the bicycle grips at the ends of the pushhandles on the back of her wheelchair and they began north again now leaving not only footprints but the twin tracks of the Ladys chair as they moved up the seemingly endless beach  The day was a nightmare It was hard to calculate distance travelled when you were moving along a landscape which varied so little but Eddie knew their progress had slowed to a crawl And he knew who was responsible Oh yeah You bofe befindin dat out Detta had said and they hadnt been on the move more than half an hour before the finding out began Pushing That was the first thing Pushing the wheelchair up a beach of fine sand would have been as impossible as driving a car through deep unplowed snow This beach with its gritty marly surface made moving the chair possible but far from easy It would roll along smoothly enough for awhile crunching over shells and popping little pebbles to either side of its hard rubber tires  and then it would hit a dip where finer sand had drifted and Eddie would have to shove grunting to get it and its solid unhelpful passenger through it The sand sucked greedily at the wheels You had to simultaneously push and throw your weight against the handles of the chair in a downward direction or it and its bound occupant would tumble over facefirst onto the beach Detta would cackle as he tried to move her without upending her You havin a good time back dere honeychile she asked each time the chair ran into one of these drybogs When the gunslinger moved over to help Eddie motioned him away Youll get your chance he said Well switch offBut I think my turns are going to be a hell of a lot longer than his a voice in his head spoke up The way he looks hes going to have his hands full just keeping himself moving before much longer let alone moving the woman inthis chair No sir Eddie Im afraid this Buds for you Its Gods revenge you know it All those years you spent as a junkie and guess what Youre finally the pusher He uttered a short outofbreath laugh Whats so funny white boy Detta asked and although Eddie thought she meant to sound sarcastic it came out sounding just a tiny bit angry Aint supposed to be any laughs in this for me he thought None at all Not as far as shes concerned You wouldnt understand babe Just let it lie I be lettin you lie before this be all over she said Be lettin you and yo badass buddy there lie in pieces all ovah dis beach Sho Meantime you better save yo breaf to do yo pushin with You already sound like you gettin a little shot winded Well you talk for both of us then Eddie panted You never seem to run out of wind I goan break wind graymeat Goan break it ovah yo dead face Promises promises Eddie shoved the chair out of the sand and onto relatively easier goingDfor awhile at least The sun was not yet fully up but he had already worked up a sweat This is going to be an amusing and informative day he thought I can see that already Stopping That was the next thing They had struck a firm stretch of beach Eddie pushed the chair along faster thinking vaguely that if he could keep this bit of extra speed he might be able to drive right through the next sandtrap he happened to strike on pure impetus All at once the chair stopped Stopped dead The crossbar on the back hit Eddies chest with a thump He grunted Roland looked around but not even the gunslingers catquick reflexes could stop the Ladys chair from going over exactly as it had threatened to do in each of the sandtraps It went and Detta went with it tied and helpless but cackling wildly She still was when Roland and Eddie finally managed to right the chair again Some of the ropes had drawn so tight they must be cutting cruelly into her flesh cutting off the circulation to her extremities her forehead was slashed and blood trickled into her eyebrows She went on cackling just the same The men were both gasping out of breath by the time the chair was on its wheels again The combined weight of it and the woman in it must have totaled two hundred and fifty pounds most of it chair It occurred to Eddie that if the gunslinger had snatched Detta from his own when  the chair might have weighed as much as sixty pounds less Detta giggled snorted blinked blood out of her eyes Looky here you boys done opsot me she said Call your lawyer Eddie muttered Sue us An got yoselfs all tuckered out gittin me back on top agin Must have taken you ten minutes too The gunslinger took a piece of his shirtDenough of it was gone now so the rest didnt much matterDand reached forward with his left hand to mop the blood away from the cut on her forehead She snapped at him and from the savage click those teeth made when they came together Eddie thought that if Roland had been only one instant slower in drawing back Detta Walker would have evened up the number of fingers on his hands for him again She cackled and stared at him with meanly merry eyes but the gunslinger saw fear hidden far back in those eyes She was afraid of him Afraid because he was The Really Bad Man Why was he The Really Bad Man Maybe because on some deeper level she sensed what he knew about her Almos got you graymeat she said Almos got you that time And cackled witchlike Hold her head the gunslinger said evenly She bites like a weasel Eddie held it while the gunslinger carefully wiped the wound clean It wasnt wide and didnt look deep but the gunslinger took no chances he walked slowly down to the water soaked the piece of shirting in the salt water and then came back She began to scream as he approached Doan you be touchin me wid dat thing Doan you be touchin me wid no water from where them poison things come from Git it away Git it away  Hold her head Roland said in the same even voice She was whipping it from side to side I dont want to take any chances Eddie held it  and squeezed it when she tried to shake free She saw he meant business and immediately became still showing no more fear of the damp rag It had been only sham after all She smiled at Roland as he bathed the cut carefully washing out the last clinging particles of grit In fact you look mo than jest tuckered out Detta observed You look sick graymeat I dont think you ready fo no long trip I dont think you ready fo nuthin like dat Eddie examined the chairs rudimentary controls It had an emergency handbrake which locked both wheels Detta had worked her right hand over there had waited patiently until she thought Eddie was going fast enough and then she had yanked the brake purposely spilling herself over Why To slow them down that was all There was no reason to do such a thing but a woman like Detta Eddie thought needed no reasons A woman like Detta was perfectly willing to do such things out of sheer meanness Roland loosened her bonds a bit so the blood could flow more freely then tied her hand firmly away from the brake That be all right Mister Man Detta said offering him a bright smile filled with too many teeth That be all right jest the same There be other ways to slow you boys down All sorts of ways Lets go the gunslinger said tonelessly You all right man Eddie asked The gunslinger looked very pale Yes Lets go They started up the beach again  The gunslinger insisted on pushing for an hour and Eddie gave way to him reluctantly Roland got her through the first sandtrap but Eddie had to pitch in and help get the wheelchair out of the second The gunslinger was gasping for air sweat standing out on his forehead in large beads Eddie let him go on a little further and Roland was quite adept at weaving his way around the places where the sand was loose enough to bog the wheels but the chair finally became mired again and Eddie could bear only a few moments of watching Roland struggle to push it free gasping chest heaving while the witch for so Eddie had come to think of her howled with laughter and actually threw her body backwards in the chair to make the task that much more difficult  and then he shouldered the gunslinger aside and heaved the chair out of the sand with one angry lurching lunge The chair tottered and now he sawsensed her shifting forward as much as the ropes would allow doing this with a weird prescience at the exactly proper moment trying to topple herself again Roland threw his weight on the back of the chair next to Eddies and it settled back Detta looked around and gave them a wink of such obscene conspiracy that Eddie felt his arms crawl up in gooseflesh You almost opsot me agin boys she said You want to look out for me now I aint nuthin but a old crippled lady so you want to have a care for me now She laughed  laughed fit to split Although Eddie cared for the woman that was the other part of her  was near to loving her just on the basis of the brief time he had seen her and spoken with her  he felt his hands itch to close around her windpipe and choke that laugh choke it until she could never laugh again She peered around again saw what he was thinking as if it had been printed on him in red ink and laughed all the harder Her eyes dared him Go on graymeat Go on You want to do it Go on and do it In other words dont just tip the chair tip the woman Eddie thought Tip her over for good Thats what she wants For Detta being killed by a white man may be the only real goal she has in life Come on he said and began pushing again We are gonna tour the seacoast sweet thang like it or not Fuck you she spat Cram it babe Eddie responded pleasantly The gunslinger walked beside him head down  They came to a considerable outcropping of rocks when the sun said it was about eleven and here they stopped for nearly an hour taking the shade as the sun climbed toward the roofpeak of the day Eddie and the gunslinger ate leftovers from the previous nights kill Eddie offered a portion to Detta who again refused telling him she knew what they wanted to do and if they wanted to do it they best to do it with their bare hands and stop trying to poison her That she said was the cowards way Eddies right the gunslinger mused This woman has made her own chain of memories She knows everything that happened to her last night even though she was really fast asleep She believed they had brought her pieces of meat which smelled of death and putrescence had taunted her with it while they themselves ate salted beef and drank some sort of beer from flasks She believed they had every now and then held pieces of their own untainted supper out to her drawing it away at the last moment when she snatched at it with her teeth  and laughing while they did it of course In the world or at least in the mind of Detta Walker Honk Mahfahs only did two things to brown women raped them or laughed at them Or both at the same time It was almost funny Eddie Dean had last seen beef during his ride in the skycarriage and Roland had seen none since the last of his jerky was eaten Gods alone knew how long ago As far as beer  he cast his mind back Tull There had been beer in Tull Beer and beef God it would be good to have a beer His throat ached and it would be so good to have a beer to cool that ache Better even than the astin from Eddies world They drew off a distance from her Aint I good nough cumpny for white boys like you she cawed after them Or did you jes maybe want to have a pull on each other ones little bitty white candle She threw her head back and screamed laughter that frightened the gulls up crying from the rocks where they had been met in convention a quarter of a mile away The gunslinger sat with his hands dangling between his knees thinking Finally he raised his head and told Eddie I can only understand about one word in every ten she says Im way ahead of you Eddie replied Im getting at least two in every three Doesnt matter Most of it comes back to honky mahfah Roland nodded Do many of the darkskinned people talk that way where you come from Her other didnt Eddie shook his head and laughed No And Ill tell you something sort of funny  at least I think its sort of funny but maybe thats just because there isnt all that much to laugh at out here Its not real Its not real and she doesnt even know it Roland looked at him and said nothing Remember when you washed off her forehead how she pretended she was scared of the water Yes You knew she was pretending Not at first but quite soon Eddie nodded That was an act and she knew it was an act But shes a pretty good actress and she fooled both of us for a few seconds The way shes talking is an act too But its not as good Its so stupid so goddam hokey You believe she pretends well only when she knows shes doing it Yes She sounds like a cross between the darkies in this book called Mandingo I read once and Butterfly McQueen in Gone with the Wind I know you dont know those names but what I mean is she talks like a cliche Do you know that word It means what is always said or believed by people who think only a little or not at all Yeah I couldnt have said it half so good Aint you boys done jerkin on dem candles a yours yet  Dettas voice was growing hoarse and cracked Or maybe its just you cant fine em Dat it Come on The gunslinger got slowly to his feet He swayed for a moment saw Eddie looking at him and smiled Ill be all right For how long As long as I have to be the gunslinger answered and the serenity in his voice chilled Eddies heart  That night the gunslinger used his last sure live cartridge to make their kill He would start systematically testing the ones he believed to be duds tomorrow night but he believed it was pretty much as Eddie had said They were down to beating the damned things to death It was like the other nights the fire the cooking the shelling the eating  eating which was now slow and unenthusiastic Were just gassing up Eddie thought They offered food to Detta who screamed and laughed and cursed and asked how long they was goan take her for a fool and then she began throwing her body wildly from one side to the other never minding how her bonds grew steadily tighter only trying to upset the chair to one side or the other so they would have to pick her up again before they could eat Just before she could manage the trick Eddie grabbed her and Roland braced the wheels on either sides with rocks Ill loosen the ropes a bit if youll be still Roland told her Suck shit out my ass mahfah I dont understand if that means yes or no She looked at him eyes narrowed suspecting some buried barb of satire in that calm voice Eddie also wondered but couldnt tell if there was or not and after a moment she said sulkily I be still Too damn hungry to kick up much dickens You boys goan give me some real food or you jes goan starve me to death Dat yo plan You too chickenshit to choke me and I aint nev goan eat no poison so dat must be you plan Starve me out Well we see sho We goan see Sho we are She offered them her bonechilling sickle of a grin again Not long after she fell asleep Eddie touched the side of Rolands face Roland glanced at him but did not pull away from the touch Im all right Yeah youre Jimdandy Well I tell you what Jim we didnt get along very far today I know There was also the matter of having used the last live shell but that was knowledge Eddie could do without at least tonight Eddie wasnt sick but he was exhausted Too exhausted for more bad news No hes not sick not yet but if he goes too long without rest gets tired enough hell get sick In a way Eddie already was both of them were Coldsores had developed at the corners of Eddies mouth and there was scaly patches on his skin The gunslinger could feel his teeth loosening up in their sockets and the flesh between his toes had begun to crack open and bleed as had that between his remaining fingers They were eating but they were eating the same thing day in and day out They could go on that way for a time but in the end they would die as surely as if they had starved What we have is Shipmates Disease on dry land Roland thought Simple as that How funny We need fruit We need greens Eddie nodded toward the Lady Shes going to go right on making it tough Unless the other one inside her comes back That would be nice but we cant count on it Eddie said He took a piece of blackened claw and began to scrawl aimless patterns in the dirt Any idea how far the next door might be Roland shook his head I only ask because if the distance between Number Two and Number Three is the same as the distance between Number One and Number Two we could be in deep shit Were in deep shit right now Neck deep Eddie agreed moodily I just keep wondering how long I can tread water Roland clapped him on the shoulder a gesture of affection so rare it made Eddie blink Theres one thing that Lady doesnt know he said Oh Whats that We Honk Mahfahs can tread water a long time Eddie laughed at that laughed hard smothering his laughter against his arm so he wouldnt wake Detta up Hed had enough of her for one day please and thank you The gunslinger looked at him smiling Im going to turn in he said Be     on my guard Yeah I will  Screaming was next Eddie fell asleep the moment his head touched the bunched bundle of his shirt and it seemed only five minutes later when Detta began screaming He was awake at once ready for anything some King Lobster arisen from the deep to take revenge for its slain children or a horror down from the hills It seemed he was awake at once anyway but the gunslinger was already on his feet a gun in his left hand When she saw they were both awake Detta promptly quit screaming Jes thought Id see if you boys on yo toes she said Might be woofs Looks likely enough country for em Wanted to make sho if I saw me a woof creepin up I could get you on yo feet in time But there was no fear in her eyes they glinted with mean amusement Christ Eddie said groggily The moon was up but barely risen they had been asleep less than two hours The gunslinger holstered his gun Dont do it again he said to the Lady in the wheelchair What you goan do if I do Rape me If we were going to rape you you would be one wellraped woman by now the gunslinger said evenly Dont do it again He lay down again pulling his blanket over him Christ dear Christ Eddie thought what a mess this is what a fucking  and that was as far as the thought went before trailing off into exhausted sleep again and then she was splintering the air with fresh shrieks shrieking like a firebell and Eddie was up again his body flaming with adrenaline hands clenched and then she was laughing her voice hoarse and raspy Eddie glanced up and saw the moon had advanced less than ten degrees since she had awakened them the first time She means to keep on doing it he thought wearily She means to stay awake and watch us and when shes sure were getting down into deep sleep that place where you recharge shes going to open her mouth and start bellowing again Shell do it and do it and do it until she doesnt have any voice left to bellow with Her laughter stopped abruptly Roland was advancing on her a dark shape in the moonlight You jes stay away from me graymeat Detta said but there was a quiver of nerves in her voice You aint goan do nothing to me Roland stood before her and for a moment Eddie was sure completely sure that the gunslinger had reached the end of his patience and would simply swat her like a fly Instead astoundingly he dropped to one knee before her like a suitor about to propose marriage Listen he said and Eddie could scarcely credit the silky quality of Rolands voice He could see much the same deep surprise on Dettas face only there fear was joined to it Listen to me Odetta Who you callin ODetta Dat ain my name Shut up bitch the gunslinger said in a growl and then reverting to that same silken voice If you hear me and if you can control her at all   Why you talkin at me dat way Why you talkin like you was talkin to somebody else You quit dat honky jive You jes quit it now you hear me   keep her shut up I can gag her but I dont want to do that A hard gag is a dangerous business People choke YOU QUIT IT YOU HONKY BULLSHIT VOODOO MAHFAH Odetta His voice was a whisper like the onset of rain She fell silent staring at him with huge eyes Eddie had never in his life seen such hate and fear combined in human eyes I dont think this bitch would care if she did die on a hard gag She wants to die but maybe even more she wants you to die But you havent died not so far and I dont think Detta is brandnew in your life She feels too at home in you so maybe you can hear what Im saying and maybe you can keep some control over her even if you cant come out yet Dont let her wake us up a third time Odetta I dont want to gag her But if I have to I will He got up left without looking back rolled himself into his blanket again and promptly fell asleep She was still staring at him eyes wide nostrils flaring Honky voodoo bullshit she whispered Eddie lay down but this time it was a long time before sleep came to claim him in spite of his deep tiredness He would come to the brink anticipate her screams and snap back Three hours or so later with the moon now going the other way he finally dropped off Detta did no more screaming that night either because Roland had frightened her or because she wanted to conserve her voice for future alarums and excursions or  possibly just possibly  because Odetta had heard and had exercised the control the gunslinger had asked of her Eddie slept at last but awoke sodden and unrefreshed He looked toward the chair hoping against hope that it would be Odetta please God let it be Odetta this morning  Mawnin whitebread Detta said and grinned her sharklike grin at him Thought you was goan sleep till noon  You caint be doin nuthin like dat kin you We got to bus us some miles here aint dat dfac of dmatter Sho An I think you the one goan have to do most of de bustin cause dat other fella one with de voodoo eyes he lookin mo peaky all de time I declare he do Yes I doan think he goan be eatin anythin much longer not even dat fancy smoked meat you whitebread boys keep fo when you done joikin on each other ones little bitty white candles So lets go whitebread Detta doan want to be done keepin you Her lids and her voice both dropped a little her eyes peeked at him slyly from their corners Not fum startin out leastways Dis goan be a day you member whitebread those sly eyes promised Dis goan be a day you member for a long long time Sho  They made three miles that day maybe a shade under Dettas chair upset twice Once she did it herself working her fingers slowly and unobtrusively over to that handbrake again and yanking it The second time Eddie did with no help at all shoving too hard in one of those goddamned sandtraps That was near the end of the day and he simply panicked thinking he just wasnt going to be able to get her out this time just wasnt So he gave that one last titanic heave with his quivering arms and of course it had been much too hard and over she had gone like Humpty Dumpty falling off his wall and he and Roland had to labor to get her upright again They finished the job just in time The rope under her breasts was now pulled taut across her windpipe The gunslingers efficient running slipknot was choking her to death Her face had gone a funny blue color she was on the verge of losing consciousness but still she went on wheezing her nasty laughter Let her be why dont you Eddie nearly said as Roland bent quickly forward to loosen the knot Let her choke I dont know if she wants to do herself like you said but I know she wants to do US so let her go Then he remembered Odetta although their encounter had been so brief and seemed so long ago that memory was growing dim and moved forward to help The gunslinger pushed him impatiently away with one hand Only room for one When the rope was loosened and the Lady gasping harshly for breath which she expelled in gusts of her angry laughter he turned and looked at Eddie critically I think we ought to stop for the night A little further He was almost pleading I can go a little further Sho He be one strong buck He be good fo choppin one mo row cotton and he still have enough lef to give yo little bitty white candle one fine suckinon tnight She still wouldnt eat and her face was becoming all stark lines and angles Her eyes glittered in deepening sockets Roland gave her no notice at all only studied Eddie closely At last he nodded A little way Not far but a little way Twenty minutes later Eddie called it quits himself His arms felt like JellO They sat in the shadows of the rocks listening to the gulls watching the tide come in waiting for the sun to go down and the lobstrosities to come out and begin their cumbersome crossexaminations Roland told Eddie in a voice too low for Detta to hear that he thought they were out of live shells Eddies mouth tightened down a little but that was all Roland was pleased So youll have to brain one of them yourself Roland said Im too weak to handle a rock big enough to do the job  and still be sure Eddie was now the one to do the studying He had no liking for what he saw The gunslinger waved his scrutiny away Never mind he said Never mind Eddie What is is Ka Eddie said The gunslinger nodded and smiled faintly Ka Kaka Eddie said and they looked at each other and both laughed Roland looked startled and perhaps even a little afraid of the rusty sound emerging from his mouth His laughter did not last long When it had stopped he looked distant and melancholy Dat laffin mean you finely managed to joik each other off Detta cried over at them in her hoarse failing voice When you goan get down to de pokin Dats what I want to see Dat pokin  Eddie made the kill Detta refused to eat as before Eddie ate half a piece so she could see then offered her the other half Nossuh she said eyes sparking at him No SUH You done put de poison in tother end One you trine to give me Without saying anything Eddie look the rest of the piece put it in his mouth chewed swallowed Doan mean a thing Detta said sulkily Leave me alone graymeat Eddie wouldnt He brought her another piece You tear it in half Give me whichever you want Ill eat it then you eat the rest Aint fallin fo none o yo honky tricks Mist Chahlie Git away fum me is what I said and git away fum me is what I meant  She did not scream in the night  but she was still there the next morning  That day they made only two miles although Detta made no effort to upset her chair Eddie thought she might be growing too weak for acts of attempted sabotage Or perhaps she had seen there was really no need for them Three fatal factors were drawing inexorably together Eddies weariness the terrain which after endless days of endless days of sameness was finally beginning to change and Rolands deteriorating condition There were less sandtraps but that was cold comfort The ground was becoming grainier more and more like cheap and unprofitable soil and less and less like sand in places bunches of weeds grew looking almost ashamed to be there and there were so many large rocks now jutting from this odd combination of sand and soil that Eddie found himself detouring around them as he had previously tried to detour the Ladys chair around the sandtraps And soon enough he saw there would be no beach left at all The hills brown and cheerless things were drawing steadily closer Eddie could see the ravines which curled between them looking like chops made by an awkward giant wielding a blunt cleaver That night before falling asleep he heard what sounded like a very large cat squalling far up in one of them The beach had seemed endless but he was coming to realize it had an end after all Somewhere up ahead those hills were simply going to squeeze it out of existence The eroded hills would march down to the sea and then into it where they might become first a cape or peninsula of sorts and then a series of archipelagoes That worried him but Rolands condition worried him more This time the gunslinger seemed not so much to be burning as fading losing himself becoming transparent The red lines had appeared again marching relentlessly up the underside of his right arm toward the elbow For the last two days Eddie had looked constantly ahead squinting into the distance hoping to see the door the door the magic door For the last two days he had waited for Odetta to reappear Neither had appeared Before falling asleep that night two terrible thoughts came to him like some joke with a double punchline What if there was no door What if Odetta Holmes was dead  Rise and shine mahfah Detta screeched him out of unconsciousness I think it jes be you and me now honeychile Think yo frien done finally passed on I think yo frien be pokin the devil down in hell Eddie looked at the rolled huddled shape of Roland and for one terrible moment he thought the bitch was right Then the gunslinger stirred moaned furrily and pawed himself into a sitting position Well looky yere Detta had screamed so much that now there were moments when her voice disappeared almost entirely becoming no more than a weird whisper like winter wind under a door I thought you was dead Mister Man Roland was getting slowly to his feet He still looked to Eddie like a man using the rungs of an invisible ladder to make it Eddie felt an angry sort of pity and this was a familiar emotion oddly nostalgic After a moment he understood It was like when he and Henry used to watch the fights on TV and one fighter would hurt the other hurt him terribly again and again and the crowd would be screaming for blood and Henry would be screaming for blood but Eddie only sat there feeling that angry pity that dumb disgust hed sat there sending thoughtwaves at the referee Stop it man are you fucking blind Hes dying out there DYING Stop the fucking fight There was no way to stop this one Roland looked at her from his haunted feverish eyes A lot of people have thought that Detta He looked at Eddie You ready Yeah I guess so Are you Yes Can you Yes They went on Around ten oclock Detta began rubbing her temples with her fingers Stop she said I feel sick Feel like I goan throw up Probably that big meal you ate last night Eddie said and went on pushing You should have skipped dessert I told you that chocolate layer cake was heavy I goan throw up I   Stop Eddie the gunslinger said Eddie stopped The woman in the chair suddenly twisted galvanically as if an electric shock had run through her Her eyes popped wide open glaring at nothing IBROKE YO PLATE YOU STINKIN OLE BLUE LADY she screamed IBROKE IT AND IM FUCKIN GLAD IDD She suddenly slumped forward in her chair If not for the ropes she would have fallen out of it Christ shes dead shes had a stroke and shes dead Eddie thought He started around the chair remembered how sly and tricksy she could be and stopped as suddenly as he had started He looked at Roland Roland looked back at him evenly his eyes giving away not a thing Then she moaned Her eyes opened Her eyes Odettas eyes Dear God Ive fainted again havent I she said Im sorry you had to tie me in My stupid legs I think I could sit up a little if you   That was when Rolands own legs slowly came unhinged and he swooned some thirty miles south of the place where the Western Sea s beach came to an end RESHUFFLE  To Eddie Dean he and the Lady no longer seemed to be trudging or even walking up what remained of the beach They seemed to be flying Odetta Holmes still neither liked nor trusted Roland that was clear But she recognized how desperate his condition had become and responded to that Now instead of pushing a dead clump of steel and rubber to which a human body just happened to be attached Eddie felt almost as if he were pushing a glider Go with her Before I was watching out for you and that was important Now Ill only slow you down He came to realize how right the gunslinger was almost at once Eddie pushed the chair Odetta pumped it One of the gunslingers revolvers was stuck in the waistband of Eddies pants Do you remember when I told you to be on your guard and you werent Yes Im telling you again Be on your guard Every moment If her other comes back dont wait even a second Brain her What if I kill her Then its the end But if she kills you thats the end too And if she comes back shell try Shell try Eddie hadnt wanted to leave him It wasnt just that catscream in the night although he kept thinking about it it was simply that Roland had become his only touchstone in this world He and Odetta didnt belong here Still he realized that the gunslinger had been right Do you want to rest he asked Odetta Theres more food A little Not yet she answered although her voice sounded tired Soon All right but at least stop pumping Youre weak Your  your stomach you know All right She turned her face gleaming with sweat and favored him with a smile that both weakened and strengthened him He could have died for such a smile  and thought he would if circumstances demanded He hoped to Christ circumstances wouldnt but it surely wasnt out of the question Time had become something so crucial it screamed She put her hands in her lap and he went on pushing The tracks the chair left behind were now dimmer the beach had become steadily firmer but it was also littered with rubble that could cause an accident You wouldnt have to help one happen at the speed they were going A really bad accident might hurt Odetta and that would be bad such an accident could also wreck the chair and that would be bad for them and probably worse for the gunslinger who would almost surely die alone And if Roland died they would be trapped in this world forever With Roland too sick and weak to walk Eddie had been forced to face one simple fact there were three people here and two of them were cripples So what hope what chance was there The chair The chair was the hope the whole hope and nothing but the hope So help them God  The gunslinger had regained consciousness shortly after Eddie dragged him into the shade of a rock outcropping His face where it was not ashy was a hectic red His chest rose and fell rapidly His right arm was a network of twisting red lines Feed her he croaked at Eddie You   Never mind me Ill be all right Feed her Shell eat now I think And youll need her strength Roland what if shes just pretending to be   The gunslinger gestured impatiently Shes not pretending to be anything except alone in her body I know it and you do too Its in her face Feed her for the sake of your father and while she eats come back to me Every minute counts now Every second Eddie got up and the gunslinger pulled him back with his left hand Sick or not his strength was still there And say nothing about the other Whatever she tells you however she explains dont contradict her Why I dont know I just know its wrong Now do as I say and dont waste any more time Odetta had been sitting in her chair looking out at the sea with an expression of mild and bemused amazement When Eddie offered her the chunks of lobster left over from the previous night she smiled ruefully I would if I could she said but you know what happens Eddie who had no idea what she was talking about could only shrug and say It wouldnt hurt to try again Odetta You need to eat you know Weve got to go as fast as we can She laughed a little and touched his hand He felt something like an electric charge jump from her to him And it was her Odetta He knew it as well as Roland did I love you Eddie You have tried so hard Been so patient So has he   She nodded toward the place where the gunslinger lay propped against the rocks watching   but he is a hard man to love Yeah Dont I know it Ill try one more time For you She smiled and he felt all the world move for her because of her and he thought Please God I have never had much so please dont take her away from me again Please She took the chunks of lobstermeat wrinkled her nose in a rueful comic expression and looked up at him Must I Just give it a shot he said I never ate scallops again she said Pardon I thought I told you You might have he said and gave a little nervous laugh What the gunslinger had said about not letting her know about the other loomed very large inside his mind just then We had them for dinner one night when I was ten or eleven I hated the way they tasted like little rubber balls and later I vomited them up I never ate them again But  She sighed As you say Ill give it a shot She put a piece in her mouth like a child taking a spoonful of medicine she knows will taste nasty She chewed slowly at first then more rapidly She swallowed Took another piece Chewed swallowed Another Now she was nearly wolfing it Whoa slow down Eddie said It must be another kind Thats it of course it is She looked at Eddie shiningly Weve moved further up the beach and the species has changed Im no longer allergic it seems It doesnt taste nasty like it did before  and I did try to keep it down didnt I She looked at him nakedly I tried very hard Yeah To himself he sounded like a radio broadcasting a very distant signal She thinks shes been eating every day and then upchucking everything She thinks thats why shes so weak Christ Almighty Yeah you tried like hell It tastes   These words were hard to pick up because her mouth was full It tastes so good She laughed The sound was delicate and lovely Its going to stay down Im going to take nourishment I know it I feel it Just dont overdo it he cautioned and gave her one of the waterskins Youre not used to it All that   He swallowed and there was an audible audible to him at least click in his throat All that throwing up Yes Yes I need to talk to Roland for a few minutes All right But before he could go she grasped his hand again Thank you Eddie Thank you for being so patient And thank him She paused gravely Thank him and dont tell him that he scares me I wont Eddie had said and went back to the gunslinger  Even when she wasnt pushing Odetta was a help She navigated with the prescience of a woman who has spent a long time weaving a wheelchair through a world that would not acknowledge handicapped people such as she for years to come Left shed call and Eddie would gee to the left gliding past a rock snarling out of the pasty grit like a decayed fang On his own he might have seen it  or maybe not Right she called and Eddie hawed right barely missing one of the increasingly rare sandtraps They finally stopped and Eddie lay down breathing hard Sleep Odetta said An hour Ill wake you Eddie looked at her Im not lying I observed your friends condition EddieD Hes not exactly my friend you kn     and I know how important time is I wont let you sleep longer than an hour out of a misguided sense of mercy I can tell the sun quite well You wont do that man any good by wearing yourself out will you No he said thinking But you dont understand If I sleep and DettaWalker comes back  Sleep Eddie she said and since Eddie was too weary and too much in love to do other than trust her he did He slept and she woke him when she said she would and she was still Odetta and they went on and now she was pumping again helping They raced up the diminishing beach toward the door Eddie kept frantically looking for and kept not seeing  When he left Odetta eating her first meal in days and went back to the gunslinger Roland seemed a little better Hunker down he said to Eddie Eddie hunkered Leave me the skin thats half full All I need Take her to the door What if I dont   Find it Youll find it The first two were there this one will be too If you get there before sundown tonight wait for dark and then kill double Youll need to leave her food and make sure shes sheltered as well as she can be If you dont reach it tonight kill triple Here He handed over one of his guns Eddie took it with respect surprised as before by how heavy it was I thought the shells were all losers Probably are But Ive loaded with the ones I believe were wetted least  three from the buckle side of the left belt three from the buckle side of the right One may fire Two if youre lucky Dont try them on the crawlies His eyes considered Eddie briefly There may be other things out there You heard it too didnt you If you mean something yowling in the hills yes If you mean the BuggerMan as your eyes say no I heard a wildcat in the brakes thats all maybe with a voice four times the size of its body It may be nothing you cant drive off with a stick But theres her to think about If her other comes back you may have to   I wont kill her if thats what youre thinking You may have to wing her You understand Eddie gave a reluctant nod Goddam shells probably wouldnt fire anyway so there was no sense getting his panties in a bunch about it When you get to the door leave her Shelter her as well as you can and come back to me with the chair And the gun The gunslingers eyes blazed so brightly that Eddie snapped his head back as if Roland had thrust a flaming torch in his face Gods yes Leave her with a loaded gun when her other might come back at any time Are you insane The shells   Fuck the shells the gunslinger cried and a freak drop in the wind allowed the words to carry Odetta turned her head looked at them for a long moment then looked back toward the sea Leave it with her not Eddie kept his voice low in case the wind should drop again What if something comes down from the brakes while Im on my way back here Some kind of cat four times bigger than its voice instead of the other way around Something you cant drive off with a stick Give her a pile of stones the gunslinger said Stones Jesus wept Man you are such a fucking shit I am thinking the gunslinger said Something you seem unable to do I gave you the gun so you could protect her from the sort of danger youre talking about for half of the trip you must make Would it please you if I took the gun back Then perhaps you could die for her Would that please you Very romantic  except then instead of just her all three of us would go down Very logical Youre still a fucking shit however Go or stay Stop calling me names You forgot something Eddie said furiously What was that You forgot to tell me to grow up Thats what Henry always used to say Oh grow up kid  The gunslinger had smiled a weary oddly beautiful smile I think you have grown up Will you go or stay Ill go Eddie said What are you going to eat She scarfed the leftovers The fucking shit will find a way The fucking shit has been finding one for years Eddie looked away I  I guess Im sorry I called you that Roland Its been   He laughed suddenly shrilly Its been a very trying day Roland smiled again Yes he said It has  They made the best time of the entire trek that day but there was still no door in sight when the sun began to spill its gold track across the ocean Although she told him she was perfectly capable of going on for another half an hour he called a halt and helped her out of the chair He carried her to an even patch of ground that looked fairly smooth got the cushions from the back of the chair and the seat and eased them under her Lord it feels so good to stretch out she sighed But  Her brow clouded I keep thinking of that man back there Roland all by himself and I cant really enjoy it Eddie who is he What is he And almost as an afterthought And why does he shout so much Just his nature I guess Eddie said and abruptly went off to gather rocks Roland hardly ever shouted He guessed some of it was this morning  FUCK the shells  but that the rest of it was false memory the time she thought she had been Odetta He killed triple as the gunslinger had instructed and was so intent on the last that he skipped back from a fourth which had been closing in on his right with only an instant to spare He saw the way its claws clicked on the empty place which had been occupied by his foot and leg a moment before and thought of the gunslingers missing fingers He cooked over a dry wood fire  the encroaching hills and increasing vegetation made the search for good fuel quicker and easier that was one thing  while the last of the daylight faded from the western sky Look Eddie she cried pointing up He looked and saw a single star gleaming on the breast of the night Isnt it beautiful Yes he said and suddenly for no reason his eyes filled with tears Just where had he been all of his goddamned life Where had he been what had he been doing who had been with him while he did it and why did he suddenly feel so grimy and abysmally beshitted Her lifted face was terrible in its beauty irrefutable in this light but the beauty was unknown to its possessor who only looked at the star with wide wondering eyes and laughed softly Star light star bright she said and stopped She looked at him Do you know it Eddie Yeah Eddie kept his head down His voice sounded clear enough but if he looked up she would see he was weeping Then help me But you have to look Okay He wiped the tears into the palm of one hand and looked up at the star with her Star light   she looked at him and he joined her Star bright   Her hand reached out groping and he clasped it one the delicious brown of light chocolate the other the delicious white of a doves breast First star I see tonight they spoke solemnly in unison boy and girl for this now not man and woman as they would be later when the dark was full and she called to ask him if he was asleep and he said no and she asked if he would hold her because she was cold Wish I may wish I might   They looked at each other and he saw that tears were streaming down her cheeks His own came again and he let them fall in her sight This was not a shame but an inexpressible relief They smiled at each other Have the wish I wish tonight Eddie said and thought Please always you Have the wish I wish tonight she echoed and thought If I must die in this odd place please let it not be too hard and let this good young man be with me Im sorry I cried she said wiping her eyes I dont usually but its been   A very trying day he finished for her Yes And you need to eat Eddie You do too I just hope it doesnt make me sick again He smiled at her I dont think it will  Later with strange galaxies turning in slow gavotte overhead neither thought the act of love had ever been so sweet so full  They were off with the dawn racing and by nine Eddie was wishing he had asked Roland what he should do if they came to the place where the hills cut off the beach and there was still no door in sight It seemed a question of some importance because the end of the beach was coming no doubt about that The hills marched ever closer running in a diagonal line toward the water The beach itself was no longer a beach at all not really the soil was now firm and quite smooth Something  runoff he supposed or flooding at some rainy season there had been none since he had been in this world not a drop the sky had clouded over a few times but then the clouds had blown away again  had worn most of the jutting rocks away At ninethirty Odetta cried Stop Eddie Stop He stopped so abruptly that she had to grab the arms of the chair to keep from tumbling out He was around to her in a flash Im sorry he said Are you all right Fine He saw he had mistaken excitement for distress She pointed Up there Do you see something He shaded his eyes and saw nothing He squinted For just a moment he thought  no it was surely just heatshimmer rising from the packed ground I dont think so he said and smiled Except maybe your wish I think I do She turned her excited smiling face to him Standing all by itself Near where the beach ends He looked again squinting so hard this time that his eyes watered He thought again for just a moment that he saw something You did he thought and smiled You saw her wish Maybe he said not because he believed it but because she did Lets go Eddie went behind the chair again taking a moment to massage his lower back where a steady ache had settled She looked around What are you waiting for You really think youve got it spotted dont you Yes Well then lets go Eddie started pushing again  Half an hour later he saw it too Jesus he thought her eyes are as good as Rolands Maybe better Neither wanted to stop for lunch but they needed to eat They made a quick meal and then pushed on again The tide was coming in and Eddie looked to the right  west  with rising unease They were still well above the tangled line of kelp and seaweed that marked high water but he thought that by the time they reached the door they would be in an uncomfortably tight angle bounded by the sea on one side and the slanting hills on the other He could see those hills very clearly now There was nothing pleasant about the view They were rocky studded with low trees that curled their roots into the ground like arthritic knuckles keeping a grim grip and thornylooking bushes They werent really steep but too steep for the wheelchair He might be able to carry her up a way might in fact be forced to but he didnt fancy leaving her there For the first time he was hearing insects The sound was a little like crickets but higher pitched than that and with no swing of rhythm  just a steady monotonous riiiiiiii sound like powerlines For the first time he was seeing birds other than gulls Some were biggies that circled inland on stiff wings Hawks he thought He saw them fold their wings from time to time and plummet like stones Hunting Hunting what Well small animals That was all right Yet he kept thinking of that yowl hed heard in the night By midafternoon they could see the third door clearly Like the other two it was an impossibility which nonetheless stood as stark as a post Amazing he heard her say softly How utterly amazing It was exactly where he had begun to surmise it would be in the angle that marked the end of any easy northward progress It stood just above the high tide line and less than nine yards from the place where the hills suddenly leaped out of the ground like a giant hand coated with graygreen brush instead of hair The tide came full as the sun swooned toward the water and at what might have been four oclock  Odetta said so and since she had said she was good at telling the sun and because she was his beloved Eddie believed her  they reached the door  They simply looked at it Odetta in her chair with her hands in her lap Eddie on the seaside In one way they looked at it as they had looked at the evening star the previous night  which is to say as children look at things  but in another they looked differently When they wished on the star they had been children of joy Now they were solemn wondering like children looking at the stark embodiment of a thing which only belonged in a fairy tale Two words were written on this door What does it mean Odetta asked finally I dont know Eddie said but those words had brought a hopeless chill he felt an eclipse stealing across his heart Dont you she asked looking at him more closely No I  He swallowed No She looked at him a moment longer Push me behind it please Id like to see that I know you want to get back to him but would you do that for me He would They started around on the high side of the door Wait she cried Did you see it What Go back Look Watch This time he watched the door instead of what might be ahead to trip them up As they went above it he saw it narrow in perspective saw its hinges hinges which seemed to be buried in nothing at all saw its thickness  Then it was gone The thickness of the door was gone His view of the water should have been interrupted by three perhaps even four inches of solid wood the door looked extraordinarily stout but there was no such interruption The door was gone Its shadow was there but the door was gone He rolled the chair back two feet so he was just south of the place where the door stood and the thickness was there You see it he asked in a ragged voice Yes Its there again He rolled the chair forward a foot The door was still there Another six inches Still there Another two inches Still there Another inch  and it was gone Solid gone Jesus he whispered Jesus Christ Would it open for you she asked Or me He stepped forward slowly and grasped the knob of the door with those two words upon it He tried clockwise he tried anticlockwise The knob moved not an iota All right Her voice was calm resigned Its for him then I think we both knew it Go for him Eddie Now First Ive got to see to you Ill be fine No you wont Youre too close to the high tide line If I leave you here the lobsters are going to come out when it gets dark and youre going to be din   Up in the hills a cats coughing growl suddenly cut across what he was saying like a knife cutting thin cord It was a good distance away but closer than the other had been Her eyes flicked to the gunslingers revolver shoved into the waistband of his pants for just a moment then back to his face He felt a dull heat in his cheeks He told you not to give it to me didnt he she said softly He doesnt want me to have it For some reason he doesnt want me to have it The shells got wet he said awkwardly They probably wouldnt fire anyway I understand Take me a little way up the slope Eddie can you I know how tired your back must be Andrew calls it Wheelchair Crouch but if you take me up a little way Ill be safe from the lobsters I doubt if anything else comes very close to where they are Eddie thought When the tides in shes probably right but what about when it starts to go out again Give me something to eat and some stones she said and her unknowing echo of the gunslinger made Eddie flush again His cheeks and forehead felt like the sides of a brick oven She looked at him smiled faintly and shook her head as if he had spoken out loud Were not going to argue about this I saw how it is with him His time is very very short There is no time for discussion Take me up a little way give me food and some stones then take the chair and go  He got her fixed as quickly as he could then pulled the gunslingers revolver and held it out to her buttfirst But she shook her head Hell be angry with both of us Angry with you for giving angrier at me for taking Crap Eddie yelled What gave you that idea I know she said and her voice was impervious Well suppose thats true Just suppose Ill be angry with you if you dont take it Put it back I dont like guns I dont know how to use them If something came at me in the dark the first thing Id do is wet my pants The second thing Id do is point it the wrong way and shoot myself She paused looking at Eddie solemnly Theres something else and you might as well know it I dont want to touch anything that belongs to him Not anything For me I think his things might have what my Ma used to call a hoodoo I like to think of myself as a modern woman  but I dont want any hoodoo on me when youre gone and the dark lands on top of me He looked from the gun to Odetta and his eyes still questioned Put it back she said stern as a school teacher Eddie burst out laughing and obeyed Why are you laughing Because when you said that you sounded like Miss Hathaway She was my thirdgrade teacher She smiled a little her luminous eyes never leaving his She sang softly sweetly Heavenly shades of night are falling its twilight time  She trailed off and they both looked west but the star they had wished on the previous evening had not yet appeared although their shadows had drawn long Is there anything else Odetta He felt an urge to delay and delay He thought it would pass once he was actually headed back but now the urge to seize any excuse to remain seemed very strong A kiss I could do with that if you dont mind He kissed her long and when their lips no longer touched she caught his wrist and stared at him intently I never made love with a white man before last night she said I dont know if thats important to you or not I dont even know if its important to me But I thought you should know He considered Not to me he said In the dark I think we were both gray I love you Odetta She put a hand over his Youre a sweet young man and perhaps I love you too although its too early for either of us   At that moment as if given a cue a wildcat growled in what the gunslinger had called the brakes It still sounded four or five miles away but that was still four or five miles closer than the last time they heard it and it sounded big They turned their heads toward the sound Eddie felt hackles trying to stand up on his neck They couldnt quite make it Sorry hackles he thought stupidly Iguess my hairs just a little too long now The growl rose to a tortured scream that sounded like a cry of some being suffering a horrid death it might actually have signaled no more than a successful mating It held for a moment almost unbearable and then it wound down sliding through lower and lower registers until it was gone or buried beneath the ceaseless cry of the wind They waited for it to come again but the cry was not repeated As far as Eddie was concerned that didnt matter He pulled the revolver out of his waistband again and held it out to her Take it and dont argue If you should need to use it it wont do shit  thats how stuff like this always works  but take it anyway Do you want an argument Oh you can argue You can argue all you want After a considering look into Eddies almosthazel eyes she smiled a little wearily I wont argue I guess She took the gun Please be as quick as you can I will He kissed her again hurriedly this time and almost told her to be careful  but seriously folks how careful could she be with the situation what it was He picked his way back down the slope through the deepening shadows the lobstrosities werent out yet but they would be putting in their nightly appearance soon and looked at the words written upon the door again The same chill rose in his flesh They were apt those words God they were so apt Then he looked back up the slope For a moment he couldnt see her and then he saw something move The lighter brown of one palm She was waving He waved back then turned the wheelchair and began to run with it tipped up in front of him so the smaller more delicate front wheels would be off the ground He ran south back the way he had come For the first halfhour or so his shadow ran with him the improbable shadow of a scrawny giant tacked to the soles of his sneakers and stretching long yards to the east Then the sun went down his shadow was gone and the lobstrosities began to tumble out of the waves It was ten minutes or so after he heard the first of their buzzing cries when he looked up and saw the evening star glowing calmly against the dark blue velvet of the sky Heavenly shades of night are falling its twilight time  Let her be safe His legs were already aching his breath too hot and heavy in his lungs and there was still a third trip to make this time with the gunslinger as his passenger and although he guessed Roland must outweigh Odetta by a full hundred pounds and knew he should conserve his strength Eddie kept running anyway Let her be safe thats my wish let my beloved be safe And like an ill omen a wildcat screeched somewhere in the tortured ravines that cut through the hills  only this wildcat sounded as big as a lion roaring in an African jungle Eddie ran faster pushing the untenanted gantry of the wheelchair before him Soon the wind began to make a thin ghastly whine through the freely turning spokes of the raised front wheels  The gunslinger heard a reedy wailing sound approaching him tensed for a moment then heard panting breath and relaxed It was Eddie Even without opening his eyes he knew that When the wailing sound faded and the running footsteps slowed Roland opened his eyes Eddie stood panting before him with sweat running down the sides of his face His shirt was plastered against his chest in a single dark blotch Any last vestiges of the collegeboy look Jack Andolini had insisted upon were gone His hair hung over his forehead He had split his pants at the crotch The bluishpurple crescents under his eyes completed the picture Eddie Dean was a mess I made it he said Im here He looked around then back at the gunslinger as if he could not believe it Jesus Christ Im really here You gave her the gun Eddie thought the gunslinger looked bad  as bad as hed looked before the first abbreviated round of Keflex maybe a trifle worse Feverheat seemed to be coming off him in waves and he knew he should have felt sorry for him but for the moment all he could seem to feel was mad as hell I bust my ass getting back here in record time and all you can say is You gave her the gun Thanks man I mean I expected some expression of gratitude but this is just overfucking  whelming  I think I said the only thing that matters Well now that you mention it I did Eddie said putting his hands on his hips and staring truculently down at the gunslinger Now you have your choice You can get in this chair or I can fold it and try to jam it up your ass Which do you prefer mawster Neither Roland was smiling a little the smile of a man who doesnt want to smile but cant help it First youre going to take some sleep Eddie Well see what well see when the time for seeing comes but for now you need sleep Youre done in I want to get back to her I do too But if you dont rest youre going to fall down in the traces Simple as that Bad for you worse for me and worst of all for her Eddie stood for a moment undecided You made good time the gunslinger conceded He squinted at the sun Its four maybe a quarterpast You sleep five maybe seven hours and itll be full dark   Four Four hours All right Until after dark I think thats the important thing Then you eat Then we move You eat too That faint smile again Ill try He looked at Eddie calmly Your life is in my hands now I suppose you know that Yes I kidnapped you Yes Do you want to kill me If you do do it now rather than subject any of us to  His breath whistled out softly Eddie heard his chest rattling and cared very little for the sound  to any further discomfort he finished I dont want to kill you Then   he was interrupted by a sudden harsh burst of coughing   lie down he finished Eddie did Sleep did not drift upon him as it sometimes did but seized him with the rough hands of a lover who is awkward in her eagerness He heard or perhaps this was only a dream Roland saying But you shouldnt have given her the gun and then he was simply in the dark for an unknown time and then Roland was shaking him awake and when he finally sat up all there seemed to be in his body was pain pain and weight His muscles had turned into rusty winches and pullies in a deserted building His first effort to get to his feet didnt work He thumped heavily back to the sand He managed it on the second try but he felt as if it might take him twenty minutes just to perform such a simple act as turning around And it would hurt to do it Rolands eyes were on him questioning Are you ready Eddie nodded Yes Are you Yes Can you Yes So they ate  and then Eddie began his third and last trip along this cursed stretch of beach  They rolled a good stretch that night but Eddie was still dully disappointed when the gunslinger called a halt He offered no disagreement because he was simply too weary to go on without rest but he had hoped to get further The weight That was the big problem Compared to Odetta pushing Roland was like pushing a load of iron bars Eddie slept four more hours before dawn woke with the sun coming over the eroding hills which were all that remained of the mountains and listened to the gunslinger coughing It was a weak cough full of rales the cough of an old man who may be coming down with pneumonia Their eyes met Rolands coughing spasm turned into a laugh Im not done yet Eddie no matter how I sound Are you Eddie thought of Odettas eyes and shook his head Not done but I could use a cheeseburger and a Bud Bud the gunslinger said doubtfully thinking of apple trees and the spring flowers in the Royal Court Gardens  Never mind Hop in my man No four on the floor no Ttop but were going to roll some miles just the same And they did but when sunset came on the second day following his leavetaking of Odetta they were still only drawing near the place of the third door Eddie lay down meaning to crash for another four hours but the screaming cry of one of those cats jerked him out of sleep after only two hours his heart thumping God the thing sounded fucking huge He saw the gunslinger up on one elbow his eyes gleaming in the dark You ready Eddie asked He got slowly to his feet grinning with pain Are you Roland asked again very softly Eddie twisted his back producing a series of pops like a string of tiny firecrackers Yeah But I could really get behind that cheeseburger I thought chicken was what you wanted Eddie groaned Cut me a break man The third door was in plain view by the time the sun cleared the hills Two hours later they reached it All together again Eddie thought ready to drop to the sand But that was apparently not so There was no sign of Odetta Holmes No sign at all  Odetta Eddie screamed and now his voice was broken and hoarse as the voice of Odettas other had been There wasnt even an echo in return something he might at least have mistaken for Odettas voice These low eroded hills would not bounce sound There was only the crash of the waves much louder in this tight arrowhead of land the rhythmic hollow boom of surf crashing to the end of some tunnel it had dug in the friable rock and the steady keening of the wind Odetta This time he screamed so loudly his voice broke and for a moment something sharp like a jag of fishbone tore at his vocal cords His eyes scanned the hills frantically looking for the lighter patch of brown that would be her palm looking for movement as she stood up  looking God forgive him for bright splashes of blood on roancolored rock He found himself wondering what he would do if he saw that last or found the revolver now with deep toothmarks driven into the smooth sandalwood of the grips The sight of something like that might drive him into hysteria might even run him crazy but he looked for it  or something  just the same His eyes saw nothing his ears brought not the faintest returning cry The gunslinger meanwhile had been studying the third door He had expected a single word the word the man in black had used as he turned the sixth Tarot card at the dusty Golgotha where they had held palaver Death Walter had said but not for you gunslinger There was not one word writ upon this door but two  and neither of them was DEATH He read it again lips moving soundlessly THE PUSHER Yet it means death Roland thought and knew it was so What made him look around was the sound of Eddies voice moving away Eddie had begun to climb the first slope still calling Odettas name For a moment Roland considered just letting him go He might find her might even find her alive not too badly hurt and still herself He supposed the two of them might even make a life of sorts for themselves here that Eddies love for Odetta and hers for him might somehow smother the nightshade who called herself Detta Walker Yes between the two of them he supposed it was possible that Detta might simply be squeezed to death He was a romantic in his own harsh way  yet he was also realist enough to know that sometimes love actually did conquer all As for himself Even if he was able to get the drugs from Eddies world which had almost cured him before would they be able to cure him this time or even make a start He was now very sick and he found himself wondering if perhaps things hadnt gone too far His arms and legs ached his head thudded his chest was heavy and full of snot When he coughed there was a painful grating in his left side as if ribs were broken there His left ear flamed Perhaps he thought the time had come to end it to just cry off At this everything in him rose up in protest Eddie he cried and there was no cough now His voice was deep and powerful Eddie turned one foot on raw dirt the other braced on a jutting spar of rock Go on he said and made a curious little sweeping gesture with his hand a gesture that said he wanted to be rid of the gunslinger so he could be about his real business the important business the business of finding Odetta and rescuing her if rescue were necessary Its all right Go on through and get the stuff you need Well both be here when you get back I doubt that I have to find her Eddie looked at Roland and his gaze was very young and completely naked I mean I really have to I understand your love and your need the gunslinger said but I want you to come with me this time Eddie Eddie stared at him for a long time as if trying to credit what he was hearing Come with you he said at last bemused Come with you Holy God now I think I really have heard everything Deedledeedledumpkin everything Last time you were so determined I was gonna stay behind you were willing to take a chance on me cutting your throat This time you want to take a chance on something ripping hers right out That may have already happened Roland said although he knew it hadnt The Lady might be hurt but he knew she wasnt dead Unfortunately Eddie did too A week or ten days without his drug had sharpened his mind remarkably He pointed at the door You know shes not If she was that goddam thing would be gone Unless you were lying when you said it wasnt any good without all three of us Eddie tried to turn back to the slope but Rolands eyes held him nailed All right the gunslinger said His voice was almost as soft as it had been when he spoke past the hateful face and screaming voice of Detta to the woman trapped somewhere behind it Shes alive That being so why does she not answer your calls Well  one of those catsthings may have carried her away But Eddies voice was weak A cat would have killed her eaten what it wanted and left the rest At most it might have dragged her body into the shade so it could come back tonight and eat meat the sun perhaps hadnt yet spoiled But if that was the case the door would be gone Cats arent like some insects who paralyze their prey and carry them off to eat later and you know it That isnt necessarily true Eddie said For a moment he heard Odetta saying You should have been on the debate team Eddie and pushed the thought aside Could be a cat came for her and she tried to shoot it but the first couple of shells in your gun were misfires Hell maybe even the first four or five The cat gets to her mauls her and just before it can kill her  BANG Eddie smacked a fist against his palm seeing all this so vividly that he might have witnessed it The bullet kills the cat or maybe just wounds it or maybe just scares it off What about that Mildly Roland said We would have heard a gunshot For a moment Eddie could only stand mute able to think of no counterargument Of course they would have heard it The first time they had heard one of the cats yowling it had to have been fifteen maybe twenty miles away A pistolshot  He looked at Roland with sudden cunning Maybe you did he said Maybe you heard a gunshot while I was asleep It would have woken you Not as tired as I am man I fall asleep its like   Like being dead the gunslinger said in that same mild voice I know the feeling Then you understand   But its not being dead Last night you were out just like that but when one of those cats screeched you were awake and on your feet in seconds Because of your concern for her There was no gunshot Eddie and you know it You would have heard it Because of your concern for her So maybe she brained it with a rock Eddie shouted How the hell do I know when Im standing here arguing with you instead of checking out the possibilities I mean she could be lying up there someplace hurt man Hurt or bleeding to death Howd you like it if I did come through that door with you and she died while we were on the other side Howd you like to look around once and see that doorway there then look around twice and see it gone just like it never was because she was gone Then youd be trapped in my world instead of the other way around He stood panting and glaring at the gunslinger his hands balled into fists Roland felt a tired exasperation Someone  it might have been Cort but he rather thought it had been his father  had had a saying Might as well try to drink the ocean with a spoon as argue with a lover If any proof of the saying were needed there it stood above him in a posture that was all defiance and defense Go on the set of Eddie Deans body said Go on I can answer any question you throw at me Might not have been a cat that found her he said now This may be your world but I dont think youve ever been to this part of it any more than Ive ever been to Borneo  You dont know what might be running around up in those hills do you Could be an ape grabbed her or something like that Something grabbed her all right the gunslinger said Well thank God getting sick hasnt driven all the sense out of your m   And we both know what it was Detta Walker Thats what grabbed her Detta Walker Eddie opened his mouth but for some little time  only seconds but enough of them so both acknowledged the truth  the gunslingers inexorable face bore all his arguments to silence  It doesnt have to be that way Come a little closer If were going to talk lets talk Every time I have to shout at you over the waves it rips another piece of my throat out Thats how it feels anyway What big eyes you have grandma Eddie said not moving What in hells name are you talking about A fairy tale Eddie did descend a short way back down the slope  four yards no more And fairy tales are what youre thinking about if you believe you can coax me close enough to that wheelchair Close enough for what I dont understand Roland said although he understood perfectly Nearly a hundred and fifty yards above them and perhaps a full quarter of a mile to the east dark eyes  eyes as full of intelligence as they were lacking in human mercy  watched this tableau intently It was impossible to tell what they were saying the wind the waves and the hollow crash of the surf digging its underground channel saw to that but Detta didnt need to hear what they were saying to know what they were talking about She didnt need a telescope to see that the Really Bad Man was now also the Really Sick Man and maybe the Really Bad Man was willing to spend a few days or even a few weeks torturing a legless Negro woman  way things looked around here entertainment was mighty hard to come by  but she thought the Really Sick Man only wanted one thing and that was to get his whitebread ass out of here Just use that magic doorway to haul the fucker out But before he hadnt been hauling no ass Before he hadnt been hauling nothing Before the Really Bad Man hadnt been nowhere but inside her own head She still didnt like to think of how that had been how it had felt how easily he had overridden all her clawing efforts to push him out away to take control of herself again That had been awful Terrible And what made it worse was her lack of understanding What exactly was the real source of her terror That it wasnt the invasion itself was frightening enough She knew she might understand if she examined herself more closely but she didnt want to do that Such examination might lead her to a place like the one sailors had feared in the ancient days a place which was no more or less than the edge of the world a place the cartographers had marked with the legend HERE THERE BE SARPENTS The hideous thing about the Really Bad Mans invasion had been the sense of familiarity that came with it as if this amazing thing had happened before  not once but many times But frightened or not she had denied panic She had observed even as she fought and she remembered looking into that door when the gunslinger used her hands to pivot the wheelchair toward it She remembered seeing the body of the Really Bad Man lying on the sand with Eddie crouched above it a knife in his hand Would that Eddie had plunged that knife into the Really Bad Mans throat Better than a pigslaughtering Better by a country mile He hadnt but she had seen the Really Bad Mans body It had been breathing but body was the right word just the same it had only been a worthless thing like a castoff towsack which some idiot had stuffed full of weeds or cornshucks Dettas mind might have been as ugly as a rats ass but it was even quicker and sharper than Eddies Really Bad Man there used to be full of piss an vinegar Not no mo He know Im up here and doan want to do nothin but git away befo I come down an kill his ass His little buddy though  he still be pretty strong and he aint had his fill of hurting on me just yet Want to come up here and hunt me down no matter how that Really Bad Man be Sho He be thinkin One black bitch widdout laigs no match fo a big ole swingin dick like me I doan wan trun I want to be huntin that black quiff down I give her a poke or two den we kin go like you want That what he be thinkin and that be all right That be jes fine graymeat You think you can take DettaWalker you jes come on up here in these Drawers and give her a try You goan find out when you fuckin with me you fuckin wit the best honeybunch You goan find out  But she was jerked from the ratrun of her thoughts by a sound that came to her clearly in spite of the surf and wind the heavy crack of a pistolshot  I think you understand better than you let on Eddie said A whole hell of a lot better Youd like for me to get in grabbing distance thats what I think He jerked his head toward the door without taking his eyes from Rolands face Unaware that not far away someone was thinking exactly the same thing he added I know youre sick all right but it could be youre pretending to be a lot weaker than you really are Could be youre laying back in the tall grass just a little bit Could be I am Roland said unsmiling and added But Im not He was though  a little A few more steps wouldnt hurt though would it Im not going to be able to shout much longer The last syllable turned into a frogs croak as if to prove his point And I need to make you think about what youre doing  planning to do If I cant persuade you to come with me maybe I can at least put you on your guard  again For your precious Tower Eddie sneered but he did come skidding halfway down the slope of ground he had climbed his tattered tennies kicking up listless clouds of maroon dust For my precious Tower and your precious health the gunslinger said Not to mention your precious life He slipped the remaining revolver from the left holster and looked at it with an expression both sad and strange If you think you can scare me with that   I dont You know I cant shoot you Eddie But I think you do need an object lesson in how things have changed How much things have changed Roland lifted the gun its muzzle pointing not toward Eddie but toward the empty surging ocean and thumbed the hammer Eddie steeled himself against the guns heavy crack No such thing Only a dull click Roland thumbed the hammer back again The cylinder rotated He squeezed the trigger and again there was nothing but a dull click Never mind Eddie said Where I come from the Defense Department would have hired you after the first misfire You might as well qui   But the heavy KABLAM of the revolver cut off the words end as neatly as Roland had cut small branches from trees as a targetshooting exercise when he had been a student Eddie jumped The gunshot momentarily silenced the constant riiiiii of the insects in the hills They only began to tune up again slowly cautiously after Roland had put the gun in his lap What in hell does that prove I suppose that all depends on what youll listen to and what you refuse to hear Roland said a trifle sharply Its supposed to prove that not all the shells are duds Furthermore it suggests  strongly suggests  that some maybe even all of the shells in the gun you gave Odetta may be live Bullshit Eddie paused Why Because I loaded the gun I just fired with shells from the backs of my gunbelts  with shells that took the worst wetting in other words I did it just to pass the time while you were gone Not that it takes much time to load a gun even shy a pair of fingers you understand Roland laughed a little and the laugh turned into a cough he muzzled with an abridged fist When the cough had subsided he went on But after youve tried to fire wets you have to break the machine and clean the machine Break the machine clean the machine you maggots  it was the first thing Cort our teacher drummed into us I didnt know how long it would take me to break down my gun clean it and put it back together with only a hand and a half but I thought that if I intended to go on living  and I do Eddie I do  Id better find out Find out and then learn to do it faster dont you think so Come a little closer Eddie Come a little closer for your fathers sake All the better to see you with my child Eddie said but did take a couple of steps closer to Roland Only a couple When the first slug I pulled the trigger on fired I almost filled my pants the gunslinger said He laughed again Shocked Eddie realized the gunslinger had reached the edge of delirium The first slug but believe me when I say it was the last thing I had expected Eddie tried to decide if the gunslinger was lying lying about the gun and lying about his condition as well Cat was sick yeah But was he really this sick Eddie didnt know If Roland was acting he was doing a great job as for guns Eddie had no way of telling because he had no experience with them He had shot a pistol maybe three times in his life before suddenly finding himself in a firefight at Balazars place Henry might have known but Henry was dead  a thought which had a way of constantly surprising Eddie into grief None of the others fired the gunslinger said so I cleaned the machine reloaded and fired around the chamber again This time I used shells a little further toward the belt buckles Ones which would have taken even less of a wetting The loads we used to kill our food the dry loads were the ones closest to the buckles He paused to cough dryly into his hand then went on Second time around I hit two live rounds I broke my gun down again cleaned it again then loaded a third time You just watched me drop the trigger on the first three chambers of that third loading He smiled faintly You know after the first two clicks I thought it would be my damned luck to have filled the cylinder with nothing but wets That wouldnt have been very convincing would it Can you come a little closer Eddie Not very convincing at all Eddie said and I think Im just as close to you as Im going to come thanks What lesson am I supposed to take from all this Roland Roland looked at him as one might look at an imbecile I didnt send you out here to die you know I didnt send either of you out here to die Great gods Eddie where are your brains Shes packing live iron His eyes regarded Eddie closely Shes someplace up in those hills Maybe you think you can track her but youre not going to have any luck if the ground is as stony as it looks from here Shes lying up there Eddie not Odetta but Detta lying up there with live iron in her hand If I leave you and you go after her shell blow your guts out of your asshole Another spasm of coughing set in Eddie stared at the coughing man in the wheelchair and the waves pounded and the wind blew its steady idiots note At last he heard his voice say You could have held back one shell you knew was live I wouldnt put it past you And with that said he knew it to be true he wouldnt put that or anything else past Roland His Tower His goddamned Tower And the slyness of putting the saved shell in the third cylinder It provided just the right touch of reality didnt it Made it hard not to believe Weve got a saying in my world Eddie said  That guy could sell Frigidaires to the Eskimos Thats the saying What does it mean It means go pound sand The gunslinger looked at him for a long time and then nodded You mean to stay All right As Detta shes safer from  from whatever wildlife there may be around here  than she would have been as Odetta and youd be safer away from her  at least for the time being  but I can see how it is I dont like it but Ive no time to argue with a fool Does that mean Eddie asked politely that no one ever tried to argue with you about this Dark Tower youre so set on getting to Roland smiled tiredly A great many did as a matter of fact I suppose thats why I recognize youll not be moved One fool knows another At any rate Im too weak to catch you youre obviously too wary to let me coax you close enough to grab you and times grown too short to argue All I can do is go and hope for the best Im going to tell you one last time before I do go and hear me Eddie Be on your guard Then Roland did something that made Eddie ashamed of all his doubts although no less solidly set in his own decision he flicked open the cylinder of the revolver with a practiced flick of his wrist dumped all the loads and replaced them with fresh loads from the loops closest to the buckles He snapped the cylinder back into place with another flick of his wrist No time to clean the machine now he said but twont matter I reckon Now catch and catch clean  dont dirty the machine any more than it is already There arent many machines left in my world that work anymore He threw the gun across the space between them In his anxiety Eddie almost did drop it Then he had it safely tucked into his waistband The gunslinger got out of the wheelchair almost fell when it slid backward under his pushing hands then tottered to the door He grasped its knob in his hand it turned easily Eddie could not see the scene the door opened upon but he heard the muffled sound of traffic Roland looked back at Eddie his blue bullshooters eyes gleaming out of a face which was ghastly pale  Detta watched all of this from her hiding place with hungrily gleaming eyes  Remember Eddie he said in a hoarse voice and then stepped forward His body collapsed at the edge of the doorway as if it had struck a stone wall instead of empty space Eddie felt an almost insatiable urge to go to the doorway to look through and see where  and to what when  it led Instead he turned and scanned the hills again his hand on the gunbutt Im going to tell you one last time Suddenly scanning the empty brown hills Eddie was scared Be on your guard Nothing up there was moving Nothing he could see at least He sensed her all the same Not Odetta the gunslinger was right about that It was Detta he sensed He swallowed and heard a click in his throat On your guard Yes But never in his life had he felt such a deadly need for sleep It would take him soon enough if he didnt give in willingly sleep would rape him And while he slept Detta would come Detta Eddie fought the weariness looked at the unmoving hills with eyes which felt swollen and heavy and wondered how long it might be before Roland came back with the third  The Pusher whoever he or she was Odetta he called without much hope Only silence answered and for Eddie the time of waiting began When the gunslinger entered Eddie Eddie had experienced a moment of nausea and he had had a sense of being watched this Roland hadnt felt Eddie had told him later Hed had in other words some vague sense of the gunslingers presence With Detta Roland had been forced to come forward immediately like it or not She hadnt just sensed him in a queer way it seemed that she had been waiting for him  him or another more frequent visitor Either way she had been totally aware of his presence from the first moment he had been in her Jack Mort didnt feel a thing He was too intent on the boy He had been watching the boy for the last two weeks Today he was going to push him  Even with the back to the eyes from which the gunslinger now looked Roland recognized the boy It was the boy he had met at the way station in the desert the boy he had rescued from the Oracle in the Mountains the boy whose life he had sacrificed when the choice between saving him or finally catching up with the man in black finally came the boy who had said Go then  there are other worlds than these before plunging into the abyss And sure enough the boy had been right The boy was Jake He was holding a plain brown paper bag in one hand and a blue canvas bag by its drawstring top in the other From the angles poking against the sides of the canvas the gunslinger thought it must contain books Traffic flooded the street the boy was waiting to cross  a street in the same city from which he had taken the Prisoner and the Lady he realized but for the moment none of that mattered Nothing mattered but what was going to happen or not happen in the next few seconds Jake had not been brought into the gunslingers world through any magic door he had come through a cruder more understandable portal he had been born into Rolands world by dying in his own He had been murdered More specifically he had been pushed Pushed into the street run over by a car while on his way to school his lunchsack in one hand and his books in the other Pushed by the man in black Hes going to do it Hes going to do it right now Thats to be my punishment for murdering him in my world  to see him murdered in this one before I can stop it But the rejection of brutish destiny had been the gunslingers work all his life  it had been his ka if you pleased  and so he came forward without even thinking acting with reflexes so deep they had nearly become instincts And as he did a thought both horrible and ironic flashed into his mind What if the body he had entered was itself that of the man in black What if as he rushed forward to save the boy he saw his own hands reach out and push What if this sense of control was only an illusion and Walters final gleeful joke that Roland himself should murder the boy  For one single moment Jack Mort lost the thin strong arrow of his concentration On the edge of leaping forward and shoving the kid into the traffic he felt something which his mind mistranslated just as the body may refer pain from one part of itself to another When the gunslinger came forward Jack thought some sort of bug had landed on the back of his neck Not a wasp or a bee nothing that actually stung but something that bit and itched Mosquito maybe It was on this that he blamed his lapse in concentration at the crucial moment He slapped at it and returned to the boy He thought all this happened in a bare wink actually seven seconds passed He sensed neither the gunslingers swift advance nor his equally swift retreat and none of the people around him goingtowork people most from the subway station on the next block their faces still puffy with sleep their halfdreaming eyes turned inward noticed Jacks eyes turn from their usual deep blue to a lighter blue behind the prim goldrimmed glasses he wore No one noticed those eyes darken to their normal cobalt color either but when it happened and he refocused on the boy he saw with frustrated fury as sharp as a thorn that his chance was gone The light had changed He watched the boy crossing with the rest of the sheep and then Jack himself turned back the way he had come and began shoving himself upstream against the tidal flow of pedestrians Hey mister Watch ou   Some curdfaced teenaged girl he barely saw Jack shoved her aside hard not looking back at her caw of anger as her own armload of schoolbooks went flying He went walking on down Fifth Avenue and away from FortyThird where he had meant for the boy to die today His head was bent his lips pressed together so tightly he seemed to have no mouth at all but only the scar of a longhealed wound above his chin Once clear of the bottleneck at the corner he did not slow down but strode even more rapidly along crossing FortySecond FortyFirst Fortieth Somewhere in the middle of the next block he passed the building where the boy lived He gave it barely a glance although he had followed the boy from it every schoolmorning for the last three weeks followed him from the building to the corner three and a half blocks further up Fifth the corner he thought of simply as the Pushing Place The girl he bumped was screaming after him but Jack Mort didnt notice An amateur lepidopterist would have taken no more notice of a common butterfly Jack was in his way much like an amateur lepidopterist By profession he was a successful CPA Pushing was only his hobby  The gunslinger returned to the back of the mans mind and fainted there If there was relief it was simply that this man was not the man in black was not Walter All the rest was utter horror  and utter realization Divorced of his body his mind  his ka  was as healthy and acute as ever but the sudden knowing struck him like a chiselblow to the temple The knowing didnt come when he went forward but when he was sure the boy was safe and slipped back again He saw the connection between this man and Odetta too fantastic and yet too hideously apt to be coincidental and understood what the real drawing of the three might be and who they might be The third was not this man this Pusher the third named by Walter had been Death Death but not for you That was what Walter clever as Satan even at the end had said A lawyers answer  so close to the truth that the truth was able to hide in its shadow Death was not for him death was become him The Prisoner the Lady Death was the third He was suddenly filled with the certainty that he himself was the third  Roland came forward as nothing but a projectile a brainless missile programmed to launch the body he was in at the man in black the instant he saw him Thoughts of what might happen if he stopped the man in black from murdering Jake did not come until later  the possible paradox the fistula in time and dimension which might cancel out everything that had happened after he had arrived at the way station  for surely if he saved Jake in this world there would have been no Jake for him to meet there and everything which had happened thereafter would change What changes Impossible even to speculate on them That one might have been the end of his quest never entered the gunslingers mind And surely such afterthefact speculations were moot if he had seen the man in black no consequence paradox or ordained course of destiny could have stopped him from simply lowering the head of this body he inhabited and pounding it straight through Walters chest Roland would have been as helpless to do otherwise as a gun is helpless to refuse the finger that squeezes the trigger and flings the bullet on its flight If it sent all to hell the hell with it He scanned the people clustered on the corner quickly seeing each face he scanned the women as closely as the men making sure there wasnt one only pretending to be a woman Walter wasnt there Gradually he relaxed as a finger curled around a trigger may relax at the last instant No Walter was nowhere around the boy and the gunslinger somehow felt sure that this wasnt the right when Not quite That when was close  two weeks away a week maybe even a single day  but it was not quite yet So he went back On the way he saw    and fell senseless with shock this man into whose mind the third door opened had once sat waiting just inside the window of a deserted tenement room in a building full of abandoned rooms  abandoned that was except for the winos and crazies who often spent their nights here You knew about the winos because you could smell their desperate sweat and angry piss You knew about the crazies because you could smell the stink of their deranged thoughts The only furniture in this room was two chairs Jack Mort was using both one to sit in one as a prop to keep the door opening on the hallway closed He expected no sudden interruptions but it was best not to take chances He was close enough to the window to look out but far enough behind the slanted shadowline to be safe from any casual viewer He had a crumbly red brick in his hand He had pried it from just outside the window where a good many were loose It was old eroded at the corners but heavy Chunks of ancient mortar clung to it like barnacles The man meant to drop the brick on someone He didnt care who when it came to murder Jack Mort was an equalopportunity employer After a bit a family of three came along the sidewalk below man woman little girl The girl had been walking on the inside presumably to keep her safely away from the traffic There was quite a lot of it this close to the railway station but Jack Mort didnt care about the auto traffic What he cared about was the lack of buildings directly opposite him these had already been demolished leaving a jumbled wasteland of splintered board broken brick glinting glass He would only lean out for a few seconds and he was wearing sunglasses over his eyes and an outofseason knit cap over his blonde hair It was like the chair under the doorknob Even when you were safe from expected risks there was no harm in reducing those unexpected ones which remained He was also wearing a sweatshirt much too big for him  one that came almost down to midthigh This bag of a garment would help confuse the actual size and shape of his body he was quite thin should he be observed It served another purpose as well whenever he depthcharged someone for that was how he always thought of it as depthcharging he came in his pants The baggy sweatshirt also covered the wet spot which invariably formed on his jeans Now they were closer Dont jump the gun wait just wait  He shivered at the edge of the window brought the brick forward drew it back to his stomach brought it forward again withdrew it again but this time only halfway and then leaned out totally cool now He always was at the penultimate moment He dropped the brick and watched it fall It went down swapping one end for the other Jack saw the clinging barnacles of mortar clearly in the sun At these moments as at no others everything was clear everything stood out with exact and geometrically perfect substance here was a thing which he had pushed into reality as a sculptor swings a hammer against a chisel to change stone and create some new substance from the brute caldera here was the worlds most remarkable thing logic which was also ecstasy Sometimes he missed or struck aslant as the sculptor may carve badly or in vain but this was a perfect shot The brick struck the girl in the bright gingham dress squarely on the head He saw blood  it was brighter than the brick but would eventually dry to the same maroon color  splash up He heard the start of the mothers scream Then he was moving Jack crossed the room and threw the chair which had been under the knob into a far corner hed kicked the other  the one hed sat in while waiting  aside as he crossed the room He yanked up the sweatshirt and pulled a bandanna from his back pocket He used it to turn the knob No fingerprints allowed Only Dont Bees left fingerprints He stuffed the bandanna into his back pocket again even as the door was swinging open As he walked down the hall he assumed a faintly drunken gait He didnt look around Looking around was also only for Dont Bees Do Bees knew that trying to see if someone was noticing you was a sure way to accomplish just that Looking around was the sort of thing a witness might remember after an accident Then some smartass cop might decide it was a suspicious accident and there would be an investigation All because of one nervous glance around Jack didnt believe anyone could connect him with the crime even if someone decided the accident was suspicious and there was an investigation but  Take only acceptable risks Minimize those which remain In other words always prop a chair under the doorknob So he walked down the powdery corridor where patches of lathing showed through the plastered walls he walked with his head down mumbling to himself like the vags you saw on the street He could still hear the woman  the mother of the little girl he supposed  screaming but that sound was coming from the front of the building it was faint and unimportant All of the things which happened after  the cries the confusion the wails of the wounded if the wounded were still capable of wailing were not things which mattered to Jack What mattered was the thing which pushed change into the ordinary course of things and sculpted new lines in the flow of lives  and perhaps the destinies not only of those struck but of a widening circle around them like ripples from a stone tossed into a still pond Who was to say that he had not sculpted the cosmos today or might not at some future time God no wonder he creamed his jeans He met no one as he went down the two flights of stairs but he kept up the act swaying a little as he went but never reeling A swayer would not be remembered An ostentatious reeler might be He muttered but didnt actually say anything a person might understand Not acting at all would be better than hamming it up He let himself out the broken rear door into an alley filled with refuse and broken bottles which twinkled galaxies of sunstars He had planned his escape in advance as he planned everything in advance take only acceptable risks minimize those which remain be a Do Bee in all things such planning was why he had been marked by his colleagues as a man who would go far and he did intend to go far but one of the places he did not intend to go was to jail or the electric chair A few people were running along the street into which the alley debouched but they were on their way to see what the screaming was about and none of them looked at Jack Mort who had removed the outofseason knit cap but not the sunglasses which on such a bright morning did not seem out of place He turned into another alley Came out on another street Now he sauntered down an alley not so filthy as the first two  almost in fact a lane This fed into another street and a block up there was a bus stop Less than a minute after he got there a bus arrived which was also part of the schedule Jack entered when the doors accordioned open and dropped his fifteen cents into the slot of the coin receptacle The driver did not so much as glance at him That was good but even if he had he would have seen nothing but a nondescript man in jeans a man who might be out of work  the sweatshirt he was wearing looked like something out of a Salvation Army grabbag Be ready be prepared be a DoBee Jack Morts secret for success both at work and at play Nine blocks away there was a parking lot Jack got off the bus entered the lot unlocked his car an unremarkable midfifties Chevrolet which was still in fine shape and drove back to New York City  He was free and clear  The gunslinger saw all of this in a mere moment Before his shocked mind could shut out the other images by simply shutting down he saw more Not all but enough Enough  He saw Mort cutting a piece from page four of The New York Daily Mirror with an Exacto knife being fussily sure to stay exactly upon the lines of the column NEGRO GIRL COMATOSE FOLLOWING TRAGIC ACCIDENT the headline read He saw Mort apply glue to the back of the clipping with the brush attached to the cover of his pastepot Saw Mort position it at the center of a blank page of a scrapbook which from the bumpy swelled look of the foregoing pages contained many other clippings He saw the opening lines of the piece Fiveyearold Odetta Holmes who came to Elizabethtown  NJ  to celebrate a joyous occasion is now the victim of a cruel freak accident Following the wedding of an aunt two days ago the girl and her family were walking toward the railway station when a brick tumbled  But that wasnt the only time hed had dealings with her was it No Gods no In the years between that morning and the night when Odetta had lost her legs Jack Mort had dropped a great many things and pushed a great many people Then there had been Odetta again The first time he had pushed something on her The second time he had pushed her in front of something What sort of man is this that I am supposed to use What sort of man  But then he thought of Jake thought of the push which had sent Jake into this world and he thought he heard the laughter of the man in black and that finished him Roland fainted  When he came to he was looking at neat rows of figures marching down a sheet of green paper The paper had been ruled both ways so that each single figure looked like a prisoner in a cell He thought Something else Not just Walters laughter Something  a plan No Gods no  nothing as complex or hopeful as that But an idea at least A tickle How long have I been out he thought with sudden alarm It was maybe nine o the clock when I came through the door maybe a little earlier How long   He came forward Jack Mort  who was now only a human doll controlled by the gunslinger  looked up a little and saw the hands of the expensive quartz clock on his desk stood at quarter past one Gods as late as that As late as that But Eddie  he was so tired he can never have stayed awake for so I  The gunslinger turned Jacks head The door was still there but what he saw through it was far worse than he would have imagined Standing to one side of the door were two shadows one that of the wheelchair the other that of a human being  but the human being was incomplete supporting itself on its arms because its lower legs had been snatched away with the same quick brutality as Rolands fingers and toe The shadow moved Roland whipped Jack Morts head away at once moving with the whiplash speed of a striking snake She mustnt look in Not until I am ready Until then she sees nothing but the back of this mans head Detta Walker would not see Jack Mort in any case because the person who looked through the open door saw only what the host saw She could only see Morts face if he looked into a mirror although that might lead to its own awful consequences of paradox and repetition but even then it would mean nothing to either Lady for that matter the Ladys face would not mean anything to Jack Mort Although they had twice been on terms of deadly intimacy they had never seen each other What the gunslinger didnt want was for the Lady to see the Lady Not yet at least The spark of intuition grew closer to a plan But it was late over there  the light had suggested to him that it must be three in the afternoon perhaps even four How long until sunset brought the lobstrosities and the end of Eddies life Three hours Two He could go back and try to save Eddie  but that was exactly what Detta wanted She had laid a trap just as villagers who fear a deadly wolf may stake out a sacrificial lamb to draw it into bowshot He would go back into his diseased body  but not for long The reason he had seen only her shadow was because she was lying beside the door with one of his revolvers curled in her fist The moment his Rolandbody moved she would shoot it and end his life His ending because she feared him would at least be merciful Eddies would be a screaming horror He seemed to hear Detta Walkers nasty giggling voice You want to go at me graymeat Sho you want to go at me You aint afraid of no lil ole cripple black woman are you Only one way Jacks mouth muttered Only one The door of the office opened and a bald man with lenses over his eyes looked in How are you doing on that Dorfman account the bald man asked I feel ill I think it was my lunch I think I might leave The bald man looked worried Its probably a bug I heard theres a nasty one going around Probably Well  as long as you get the Dorfman stuff finished by five tomorrow afternoon  Yes Because you know what a dong he can be   Yes The bald man now looking a little uneasy nodded Yes go home You dont seem like your usual self at all Im not The bald man went out the door in a hurry He sensed me the gunslinger thought That was part of it Part but not all Theyre afraid of him They dont know why but theyre afraid of him And theyre right to be afraid Jack Morts body got up found the briefcase the man had been carrying when the gunslinger entered him and swept all the papers on the surface of the desk into it He felt an urge to sneak a look back at the door and resisted it He would not look again until he was ready to risk everything and come back In the meantime time was short and there were things which had to be done Detta laid up in a deeply shadowed cleft formed by rocks which leaned together like old men who had been turned to stone while sharing some weird secret She watched Eddie range up and down the rubblestrewn slopes of the hills yelling himself hoarse The duckfuzz on his cheeks was finally becoming a beard and you might have taken him for a growed man except for the three or four times he passed close to her once he had come close enough for her to have snaked a hand out and grabbed his ankle When he got close you saw he wasnt nothing but a kid still and one who was dog tired to boot Odetta would have felt pity Detta felt only the still coiled readiness of the natural predator When she first crawled in here she had felt things crackling under her hands like old autumn leaves in a woods holler As her eyes adjusted she saw they werent leaves but the tiny bones of small animals Some predator long gone if these ancient yellow bones told the truth had once denned here something like a weasel or a ferret It had perhaps gone out at night following its nose further up into The Drawers to where the trees and undergrowth were thicker  following its nose to prey It had killed eaten and brought the remains back here to snack on the following day as it laid up waiting for night to bring the time of hunting on again Now there was a bigger predator here and at first Detta thought shed do pretty much what the previous tenant had done wait until Eddie fell asleep as he was almost certain to do then kill him and drag his body up here Then with both guns in her possession she could drag herself back down by the doorway and wait for the Really Bad Man to come back Her first thought had been to kill the Really Bad Mans body as soon as she had taken care of Eddie but that was no good was it If the Really Bad Man had no body to come back to there would be no way Detta could get out of here and back to her own world Could she make that Really Bad Man take her back Maybe not But maybe so If he knew Eddie was still alive maybe so And that led to a much better idea  She was deeply sly She would have laughed harshly at anyone daring to suggest it but she was also deeply insecure Because of the latter she attributed the former to anyone she met whose intellect seemed to approach her own This was how she felt about the gunslinger She had heard a shot and when she looked shed seen smoke drifting from the muzzle of his remaining gun He had reloaded and tossed this gun to Eddie just before going through the door She knew what it was supposed to mean to Eddie all the shells werent wet after all the gun would protect him She also knew what it was supposed to mean to her for of course the Really Bad Man had known she was watching even if she had been sleeping when the two of them started chinning the shot would have awakened her Stay away from him Hes packing iron But devils could be subtle If that little show had been put on for her benefit might not that Really Bad Man have had another purpose in mind as well one neither she nor Eddie was supposed to see Might that Really Bad Man not have been thinking if she sees this one fires good shells why shell think the one she took from Eddie does too But suppose he had guessed that Eddie would doze off Wouldnt he know she would be waiting for just that waiting to filch the gun and creep slowly away up the slopes to safety Yes that Really Bad Man might have foreseen all that He was smart for a honky Smart enough anyway to see that Detta was bound to get the best of that little white boy So just maybe that Really Bad Man had purposely loaded this gun with bad shells He had fooled her once why not again This time she had been careful to check that the chambers were loaded with more than empty casings and yes they appeared to be real bullets but that didnt mean they were He didnt even have to take the chance that one of them might be dry enough to fire now did he He could have fixed them somehow After all guns were the Really Bad Mans business Why would he do that Why to trick her into showing herself of course Then Eddie could cover her with the gun that really did work and he would not make the same mistake twice tired or not He would in fact be especially careful not to make the same mistake twice because he was tired Nice try honky Detta thought in her shadowy den this tight but somehow comforting dark place whose floor was carpeted with the softened and decaying bones of small animals Nice try but I aint goin fo dat shit She didnt need to shoot Eddie after all she only needed to wait  Her one fear was that the gunslinger would return before Eddie fell asleep but he was still gone The limp body at the base of the door did not stir Maybe he was having some trouble getting the medicine he needed  some other kind of trouble for all she knew Men like him seemed to find trouble easy as a bitch in heat finds a randy hound Two hours passed while Eddie hunted for the woman he called Odetta oh how she hated the sound of that name ranging up and down the low hills and yelling until he had no voice left to yell with At last Eddie did what she had been waiting for he went back down to the little angle of beach and sat by the wheelchair looking around disconsolately He touched one of the chairs wheels and the touch was almost a caress Then his hand dropped away and he fetched him a deep sigh This sight brought a steely ache to Dettas throat pain bolted across her head from one side to the other like summer lightning and she seemed to hear a voice calling calling or demanding No you dont she thought having no idea who she was thinking about or speaking to No you dont not this time not now Not now may be not ever again That bolt of pain ripped through her head again and she curled her hands into fists Her face made its own fist twisting itself into a sneer of concentration  an expression remarkable and arresting in its mixture of ugliness and almost beatific determination That bolt of pain did not come again Neither did the voice which sometimes seemed to speak through such pains She waited Eddie propped his chin on his fists propping his head up Soon it began to droop anyway the fists sliding up his cheeks Detta waited black eyes gleaming Eddies head jerked up He struggled to his feet walked down to the water and splashed his face with it Dats right white boy Crine shame there aint any NoDoz in this worl or you be takin dat too aint dat right Eddie sat down in the wheelchair this time but evidently found that just a little too comfortable So after a long look through the open door what you seem in dere white boy Detta give a twentydollar bill to knowdat  he plopped his ass down on the sand again Propped his head with his hands again Soon his head began to slip down again This time there was no stopping it His chin lay on his chest and even over the surf she could hear him snoring Pretty soon he fell over on his side and curled up She was surprised disgusted and frightened to feel a sudden stab of pity for the white boy down there He looked like nothing so much as a little squirt who had tried to stay up until midnight on New Years Eve and lost the race Then she remembered the way he and the Really Bad Man had tried to get her to eat poison food and teased her with their own always snatching away at the last second  at least until they got scared she might die Ifthey were scared you might die whyd they try to get you to eat poison in the first place The question scared her the way that momentary feeling of pity had scared her She wasnt used to questioning herself and furthermore the questioning voice in her mind didnt seem like her voice at all Wadnt meanin to kill me wid dat poison food Jes wanted to make me sick Set there and laugh while I puked an moaned I speck She waited twenty minutes and then started down toward the beach pulling herself with her hands and strong arms weaving like a snake eyes never leaving Eddie She would have preferred to have waited another hour even another half it would be better to have the little mahfah ten miles asleep instead of one or two But waiting was a luxury she simply could not afford That Really Bad Man might come back anytime As she drew near the place where Eddie lay he was still snoring sounded like a buzzsaw in a sawmill about to go tits up she picked up a chunk of rock that was satisfyingly smooth on one side and satisfyingly jagged on the other She closed her palm over the smooth side and continued her snakecrawl to where he lay the flat sheen of murder in her eyes  What Detta planned to do was brutally simple smash Eddie with the jagged side of the rock until he was as dead as the rock itself Then shed take the gun and wait for Roland to come back When his body sat up she would give him a choice take her back to her world or refuse and be killed You goan be quits wid me either way toots she would say and wit yo boyfrien dead aint nothin more you can do like you said you wanted to If the gun the Really Bad Man had given Eddie didnt work  it was possible she had never met a man she hated and feared as much as Roland and she put no depth of slyness past him  she would do him just the same She would do him with the rock or with her bare hands He was sick and shy two fingers to boot She could take him But as she approached Eddie a disquieting thought came to her It was another question and again it seemed to be another voice that asked it What if he knows What if he knows what you did the second you kill Eddie He aint goan know nuthin He be too busy gittin his medicine Gittin hisself laid too for all I know The alien voice did not respond but the seed of doubt had been planted She had heard them talking when they thought she was asleep The Really Bad Man needed to do something She didnt know what it was Had something to do with a tower was all Detta knew Could be the Really Bad Man thought this tower was full of gold or jewels or something like that He said he needed her and Eddie and some other one to get there and Detta guessed maybe he did Why else would these doors be here If it was magic and she killed Eddie he might know If she killed his way to the tower she thought she might be killing the only thing graymeat mahfah was living for And if he knew he had nothing to live for mahfah might do anything because the mahfah wouldnt give a bugturd for nothin no more The idea of what might happen if the Really Bad Man came back like that made Detta shiver But if she couldnt kill Eddie what was she going to do She could take the gun while Eddie was asleep but when the Really Bad Man came back could she handle both of them She just didnt know Her eyes touched on the wheelchair started to move away then moved back again fast There was a deep pocket in the leather backrest Poking out of this was a curl of the rope they had used to tie her into the chair Looking at it she understood how she could do everything Detta changed course and began to crawl toward the gunslingers inert body She meant to take what she needed from the knapsack he called his purse then get the rope fast as she could  but for a moment she was held frozen by the door Like Eddie she interpreted what she was seeing in terms of the movies  only this looked more like some TV crime show The setting was a drugstore She was seeing a druggist who looked scared silly and Detta didnt blame him There was a gun pointing straight into the druggists face The druggist was saying something but his voice was distant distorted as if heard through soundbaffles She couldnt tell what it was She couldnt see who was holding the gun either but then she didnt really need to see the stickup man did she She knew who it was sho It was the Really Bad Man Might not look like him over there might look like some tubby little sack of shit might even look like a brother but inside it be him sho Didnt take him long to find another gun did it I bet it never does You get movin Detta Walker She opened Rolands purse and the faint nostalgic aroma of tobacco long hoarded but now long gone drifted out In one way it was very much like a ladys purse filled with what looked like so much random rickrack at first glance  but a closer look showed you the travelling gear of a man prepared for almost any contingency She had an idea the Really Bad Man had been on the road to his Tower a good long time If that was so just the amount of stuff still left in here poor as some of it was was cause for amazement You get movin Detta Walker She got what she needed and worked her silent snakelike way back to the wheelchair When she got there she propped herself on one arm and pulled the rope out of the pocket like a fisherwoman reeling in line She glanced over at Eddie every now and then just to make sure he was asleep He never stirred until Detta threw the noose around his neck and pulled it taut  He was dragged backward at first thinking he was still asleep and this was some horrible nightmare of being buried alive or perhaps smothered Then he felt the pain of the noose sinking into his throat felt warm spit running down his chin as he gagged This was no dream He clawed at the rope and tried for his feet She yanked him hard with her strong arms Eddie tell on his back with a thud His face was turning purple Quit on it Detta hissed from behind him I aint goan kill you if you quit on it but if you dont Im goan choke you dead Eddie lowered his hands and tried to be still The running slipknot Odetta had tossed over his neck loosened enough for him to draw a thin burning breath All you could say for it was that it was better than not breathing at all When the panicked beating of his heart had slowed a little he tried to look around The noose immediately drew tight again  Nev  mind You jes go on an take in dat ocean view graymeat Dats all you want to be lookin at right now He looked back at the ocean and the knot loosened enough to allow him those miserly burning breaths again His left hand crept surreptitiously down to the waistband of his pants but she saw the movement and although he didnt know it she was grinning There was nothing there She had taken the gun She crept up on you while you were asleep Eddie It was the gunslingers voice of course It doesnt do any good to say I told you so now but I told you so This is what romance gets you  a noose around your neck and a crazy woman with two guns somewhere behind you But if she was going to kill me she already would have done it She would have done it while I was asleep And what is it you think shes going to do Eddie Hand you an allexpensespaid trip for two to Disney World Listen he said Odetta   The word was barely out of his mouth before the noose pulled savagely tight again You doan want to be callin me dat Nex time you be callin me dat be de las time you be callin anyone anythin My names Detta Walker and if you want to keep drawin breaf into yo lungs you little piece of whitewashed shit you better member it Eddie made choking gagging noises and clawed at the noose Big black spots of nothing began to explode in front of his eyes like evil flowers At last the choking band around his throat eased again Got dat honky Yes he said but it was only a hoarse choke of sound Den say it Say my name Detta Say my whole name Dangerous hysteria wavered in her voice and at that moment Eddie was glad he couldnt see her Detta Walker Good The noose eased a little more Now you lissen to me whitebread and you do it good if you want to live til sundown You dont want to be trine to be cute like I seen you jus trine tsnake down an git dat gun I took offn you while you was asleep You dont want to cause Detta she got the sight See what you goan try befo you try it Sho You dont want to try nuthin cute cause I aint got no legs either I have learned to do a lot of things since I lost em and now I got both o dat honky mahfahs guns and dat ought to go for somethin You think so Yeah Eddie croaked Im not feeling cute Well good Dats real good She cackled I been one busy bitch while you been sleepin Got dis bidness all figured out Heres what I want you to do whitebread put yo hands behin you and feel aroun until you find a loop jus like done I got roun yo neck There be three of em I been braidin while you been sleepin lazybones She cackled again When you feel dat loop you goan put yo wrists right one against tother an slip em through it Den you goan feel my hand pullin that runnin knot tight and when you feel dat you goan say Dis my chance to toin it aroun on disyere nigger bitch Right here while she aint got her good hold on dat jerkrope But   Here Dettas voice became muffled as well as a Southern darkie caricature   you better take a look aroun befo you go doin anythin rash Eddie did Detta looked more witchlike than ever a dirty matted thing that would have struck tear into hearts much stouter than his own The dress she had been wearing in Macys when the gunslinger snatched her was now filthy and torn Shed used the knife she had taken from the gunslingers purse  the one he and Roland had used to cut the masking tape away  to slash her dress in two other places creating makeshift holsters just above the swell of her hips The worn butts of the gunslingers revolvers protruded from them Her voice was muffled because the end of the rope was clenched in her teeth A freshly cut end protruded from one side of her grin the rest of the line the part which led to the noose around his neck protruded from the other side There was something so predatory and barbaric about this image  the rope caught in the grin  that he was frozen staring at her with a horror that only made her grin widen You try to be cute while I be takin care of yo hans she said in her muffled voice I goan joik yo winpipe shut wif my teef graymeat And dat time I not be lettin up agin You understan He didnt trust himself to speak He only nodded Good Maybe you be livin a little bit longer after all If I dont Eddie croaked youre never going to have the pleasure of shoplifting in Macys again Detta Because hell know and then itll be everybody out of the pool Hush up Detta said  almost crooned You jes hush up Leave the thinkin to the folks dat kin do it All you got to do is be feelin aroun fo dat next loop  Ibeen braidin while you been sleepin she had said and with disgust and mounting alarm Eddie discovered she meant exactly what she said The rope had become a series of three running slipknots The first she had noosed around his neck as he slept The second secured his hands behind his back Then she pushed him roughly over on his side and told him to bring his feet up until his heels touched his butt He saw where this was leading and balked She pulled one of Rolands revolvers from the slit in her dress cocked it and pressed the muzzle against Eddies temple You do it or I do it graymeat she said in that crooning voice Only if I do it you goan be dead when I do I jes kick some san over de brains dat squoit out dother side yo haid cover de hole wit yo hair He think you be sleepin She cackled again Eddie brought his feet up and she quickly secured the third running slipknot around his ankles There Trussed up just as neat as a calf at a rodayo That described it as well as anything Eddie thought If he tried to bring his feet down from a position which was already growing uncomfortable he would tighten the slipknot holding his ankles even more That would tighten the length of rope between his ankles and his wrists which would in turn tighten that slipknot and the rope between his wrists and the noose shed put around his neck and  She was dragging him somehow dragging him down the beach Hey What   He tried to pull back and felt everything tighten  including his ability to draw breath He let himself go as limp as possible and keep those feet up dont forget that asshole because if you lower your feet enough youre going to strangle and let her drag him along the rough ground A jag of rock peeled skin away from his cheek and he felt warm blood begin to flow She was panting harshly The sound of the waves and the boom of surf ramming into the rock tunnel were louder Drown me Sweet Christ is that what she means to do No of course not He thought he knew what she meant to do even before his face plowed through the twisted kelp which marked the high tide line dead saltstinking stuff as cold as the fingers of drowned sailors He remembered Henry saying once Sometimes theyd shoot one of our guys An American I mean  they knew an ARVN was no good because wasnt any of us thatd go after a gook in the bush Not unless he was some fresh fish just over from the States Theyd guthole him leave him screaming then pick off the guys that tried to save him Theyd keep doing that until the guy died You know what they called a guy like that Eddie Eddie had shaken his head cold with the vision of it They called him a honeypot Henry had said Something sweet Something to draw flies Or maybe even a bear Thats what Detta was doing using him as a honeypot She left him some seven feet below the high tide line left him without a word left him facing the ocean It was not the tide coming in to drown him that the gunslinger looking through the door was supposed to see because the tide was on the ebb and wouldnt get up this far again for another six hours And long before then  Eddie rolled his eyes up a little and saw the sun striking a long gold track across the ocean What was it Four oclock  About that Sunset would come around seven It would be dark long before he had to worry about the tide And when dark came the lobstrosities would come rolling out of the waves they would crawl their questioning way up the beach to where he lay helplessly trussed and then they would tear him apart  That time stretched out interminably for Eddie Dean The idea of time itself became a joke Even his horror of what was going to happen to him when it got dark faded as his legs began to throb with a discomfort which worked its way up the scale of feeling to pain and finally to shrieking agony He would relax his muscles all the knots would pull tight and when he was on the verge of strangling he would manage somehow to pull his ankles up again releasing the pressure allowing some breath to return He was no longer sure he could make it to dark There might come a time when he would simply be unable to bring his legs back up Now Jack Mort knew the gunslinger was here If he had been another person  an Eddie Dean or an Odetta Walker for instance  Roland would have held palaver with the man if only to ease his natural panic and confusion at suddenly finding ones self shoved rudely into the passenger seat of the body ones brain had driven ones whole life But because Mort was a monster  worse than Detta Walker ever had been or could be  he made no effort to explain or speak at all He could hear the mans clamorings  Who are you Whats happening to me  but disregarded them The gunslinger concentrated on his short list of necessities using the mans mind with no compunction at all The clamorings became screams of terror The gunslinger went right on disregarding them The only way he could remain in the wormpit which was this mans mind was to regard him as no more than a combination atlas and encyclopedia Mort had all the information Roland needed The plan he made was rough but rough was often better than smooth When it came to planning there were no creatures in the universe more different than Roland and Jack Mort When you planned rough you allowed room for improvisation And improvisation at short notice had always been one of Rolands strong points  A fat man with lenses over his eyes like the bald man who had poked his head into Morts office five minutes earlier it seemed that in Eddies world many people wore these which his Mortcypedia identified as glasses got into the elevator with him He looked at the briefcase in the hand of the man who he believed to be Jack Mort and then at Mort himself Going to see Dorfman Jack The gunslinger said nothing If you think you can talk him out of subleasing I can tell you its a waste of time the fat man said then blinked as his colleague took a quick step backward The doors of the little box closed and suddenly they were falling He clawed at Morts mind ignoring the screams and found this was all right The fall was controlled If I spoke out of turn Im sorry the fat man said The gunslinger thought This one is afraid too Youve handled the jerk better than anyone else in the firm thats what I think The gunslinger said nothing He waited only to be out of this falling coffin I say so too the fat man continued eagerly Why just yesterday I was at lunch with   Jack Morts head turned and behind Jack Morts goldrimmed glasses eyes that seemed a somehow different shade of blue than Jacks eyes had ever been before stared at the fat man Shut up the gunslinger said tonelessly Color fell from the fat mans face and he took two quick steps backward His flabby buttocks smacked the fake wood panels at the back of the little moving coffin which suddenly stopped The doors opened and the gunslinger wearing Jack Morts body like a tightfitting set of clothes stepped out with no look back The fat man held his finger on the DOOR OPEN button of the elevator and waited inside until Mort was out of sight Always did have a screw loose the fat man thought but this could be serious This could be a breakdown The fat man found that the idea of Jack Mort tucked safely away in a sanitarium somewhere was very comforting The gunslinger wouldnt have been surprised  Somewhere between the echoing room which his Mortcypedia identified as a lobby to wit a place of entry and exit from the offices which filled this skytower and the bright sunshine of street his Mortcypedia identified this street as both th Avenue and Avenue of the Americas the screaming of Rolands host stopped Mort had not died of fright the gunslinger felt with a deep instinct which was the same as knowing that if Mort died their kas would be expelled forever into that void of possibility which lay beyond all physical worlds Not dead  fainted Fainted at the overload of terror and strangeness as Roland himself had done upon entering the mans mind and discovering its secrets and the crossing of destinies too great to be coincidence He was glad Mort had fainted As long as the mans unconsciousness hadnt affected Rolands access to the mans knowledge and memories  and it hadnt  he was glad to have him out of the way The yellow cars were public conveyences called TackSees or Cabs or Hax The tribes which drove them the Mortcypedia told him were two Spix and Mockies To make one stop you held your hand up like a pupil in a classroom Roland did this and after several TackSees which were obviously empty save for their drivers had gone by him he saw that these had signs which read OffDuty Since these were Great Letters the gunslinger didnt need Morts help He waited then put his hand up again This time the TackSee pulled over The gunslinger got into the back seat He smelled old smoke old sweat old perfume It smelled like a coach in his own world Where to my friend the driver asked  Roland had no idea if he was of the Spix or Mockies tribe and had no intention of asking It might be impolite in this world Im not sure Roland said This aint no encounter group my friend Time is money Tell him to put his flag down the Mortcypedia told him Put your flag down Roland said That aint rolling nothing but time the driver replied Tell him youll tip him five bux the Mortcypedia advised Ill tip you five bucks Roland said Lets see it the cabbie replied Money talks bullshit walks Ask him if he wants the money or if he wants to go fuck himself the Mortcypedia advised instantly Do you want the money or do you want to go fuck yourself Roland asked in a cold dead voice The cabbies eyes glanced apprehensively into the rearview mirror for just a moment and he said no more Roland consulted Jack Morts accumulated store of knowledge more fully this time The cabbie glanced up again quickly during the fifteen seconds his fare spent simply sitting there with his head slightly lowered and his left hand spread across his brow as if he had an Excedrin Headache The cabbie had decided to tell the guy to get out or hed yell for a cop when the fare looked up and said mildly Id like you to take me to Seventh Avenue and FortyNinth street  For this trip I will pay you ten dollars over the fare on your taxi meter no matter what your tribe A weirdo the driver a WASP from Vermont trying to break into showbiz thought but maybe a rich weirdo He dropped the cab into gear Were there buddy he said and pulling into traffic he added mentally And the sooner the better  Improvise That was the word The gunslinger saw the blueandwhite parked down the block when he got out and read Police as Posse without checking Morts store of knowledge Two gunslingers inside drinking something  coffee maybe  from white paper glasses Gunslingers yes  but they looked fat and lax He reached into Jack Morts wallet except it was much too small to be a real wallet a real wallet was almost as big as a purse and could carry all of a mans things if he wasnt travelling too heavy and gave the driver a bill with the number  on it The cabbie drove away fast It was easily the biggest tip hed make that day but the guy was so freaky he felt he had earned every cent of it The gunslinger looked at the sign over the shop CLEMENTS GUNS AND SPORTING GOODS it said AMMO FISHING TACKLE OFFICIAL FACSIMILES He didnt understand all of the words but one look in the window was all it took for him to see Mort had brought him to the right place There were wristbands on display badges of rank  and guns Rifles mostly but pistols as well They were chained but that didnt matter He would know what he needed when  if  he saw it Roland consulted Jack Morts mind  a mind exactly sly enough to suit his purposes  for more than a minute  One of the cops in the blueandwhite elbowed the other Now that he said is a serious comparison shopper His partner laughed Oh God he said in an effeminate voice as the man in the business suit and goldrimmed glasses finished his study of the merchandise on display and went inside I think he jutht dethided on the lavender handcuffths The first cop choked on a mouthful of lukewarm coffee and sprayed it back into the styrofoam cup in a gust of laughter  A clerk came over almost at once and asked if he could be of help I wonder the man in the conservative blue suit replied if you have a paper  He paused appeared to think deeply and then looked up A chart I mean which shows pictures of revolver ammunition You mean a caliber chart the clerk asked The customer paused then said Yes My brother has a revolver I have fired it but its been a good many years I think I will know the bullets if I see them Well you may think so the clerk replied but it can be hard to tell Was it a  A  Or maybe   If you have a chart Ill know Roland said Just a sec The clerk looked at the man in the blue suit doubtfully for a moment then shrugged Fuck the customer was always right even when he was wrong  if he had the dough to pay that was Money talked bullshit walked I got a Shooters Bible Maybe thats what you ought to look at Yes He smiled Shooters Bible It was a noble name for a book The man rummaged under the counter and brought out a wellthumbed volume as thick as any book the gunslinger had ever seen in his life  and yet this man seemed to handle it as if it were no more valuable than a handful of stones He opened it on the counter and turned it around Take a look Although if its been years youre shootin in the dark He looked surprised then smiled Pardon my pun Roland didnt hear He was bent over the book studying pictures which seemed almost as real as the things they represented marvellous pictures the Mortcypedia identified as Fottergraffs He turned the pages slowly No  no  no  He had almost lost hope when he saw it He looked up at the clerk with such blazing excitement that the clerk felt a little afraid There he said There Right there The photograph he was tapping was one of a Winchester  pistol shell It was not exactly the same as his own shells because it hadnt been handthrown or handloaded but he could see without even consulting the figures which would have meant almost nothing to him anyway that it would chamber and fire from his guns Well all right I guess you found it the clerk said but dont cream your jeans fella I mean theyre just bullets You have them Sure How many boxes do you want How many in a box Fifty The clerk began to look at the gunslinger with real suspicion If the guy was planning to buy shells he must know hed have to show a Permit to Carry photoID No PC no ammo not for handguns it was the law in the borough of Manhattan  And if this dude had a handgun permit how come he didnt know how many shells came in a standard box of ammo Fifty Now the guy was staring at him with slackjawed surprise He was off the wall all right The clerk edged a bit to his left a bit nearer the cash register  and not so coincidentally a bit nearer to his own gun a  Mag which he kept fully loaded in a spring clip under the counter Fifty the gunslinger repeated He had expected five ten perhaps as many as a dozen but this  this  How much money do you have he asked the Mortcypedia The Mortcypedia didnt know not exactly but thought there was at least sixty bux in his wallet And how much does a box cost It would be more than sixty dollars he supposed but the man might be persuaded to sell him part of a box or  Seventeenfifty the clerk said But mister   Jack Mort was an accountant and this time there was no waiting translation and answer came simultaneously Three the gunslinger said Three boxes He tapped the Fotergraff of the shells with one finger One hundred and fifty rounds Ye gods What a mad storehouse of riches this world was The clerk wasnt moving You dont have that many the gunslinger said He felt no real surprise It had been too good to be true A dream Oh I got Winchester s I got s up the kazoo The clerk took another step to the left a step closer to the cash register and the gun If the guy was a nut something the clerk expected to find out for sure any second now he was soon going to be a nut with an extremely large hole in his midsection I got  ammo up the old yingyang What I want to know mister is if you got the card Card A handgun permit with a photo I cant sell you handgun ammo unless you can show me one If you want to buy ammo without a PC youre gonna hafta go up to Westchester  The gunslinger stared at the man blankly This was all gabble to him He understood none of it His Mortcypedia had some vague notion of what the man meant but Morts ideas were too vague to be trusted in this case Mort had never owned a gun in his life He did his nasty work in other ways The man sidled another step to the left without taking his eyes from his customers face and the gunslinger thought Hes got a gun He expects me to make trouble  or maybe he wants me to make trouble Wants an excuse to shoot me Improvise He remembered the gunslingers sitting in their blue and white carriage down the street Gunslingers yes peacekeepers men charged with keeping the world from moving on But these had looked  at least on a passing glance  to be nearly as soft and unobservant as everyone else in this world of lotuseaters just two men in uniforms and caps slouched down in the seats of their carriage drinking coffee He might have misjudged He hoped for all their sakes  that he had not Oh I understand the gunslinger said and drew an apologetic smile on Jack Morts face Im sorry I guess I havent kept track of how much the world has moved on  changed  since I last owned a gun No harm done the clerk said relaxing minutely Maybe the guy was all right Or maybe he was pulling a gag I wonder if I could look at that cleaning kit Roland pointed to a shelf behind the clerk Sure The clerk turned to get it and when he did the gunslinger removed the wallet from Morts inside jacket pocket He did this with the flickering speed of a fast draw The clerks back was to him for less than four seconds but when he turned back to Mort the wallet was on the floor Its a beaut the clerk said smiling having decided the guy was okay after all Hell he knew how lousy you felt when you made a horses ass of yourself He had done it in the Marines enough times And you dont need a goddam permit to buy a cleaning kit either Aint freedom wonderful Yes the gunslinger said seriously and pretended to look closely at the cleaning kit although a single glance was enough to show him that it was a shoddy thing in a shoddy box While he looked he carefully pushed Morts wallet under the counter with his foot After a moment he pushed it back with a passable show of regret Im afraid Ill have to pass All right the clerk said losing interest abruptly Since the guy wasnt crazy and was obviously a looker not a buyer their relationship was at an end Bullshit walks Anything else His mouth asked while his eyes told bluesuit to get out No thank you The gunslinger walked out without a look back Morts wallet was deep under the counter Roland had set out his own honeypot  Officers Carl Delevan and George OMearah had finished their coffee and were about to move on when the man in the blue suit came out of Clements  which both cops believed to be a powderhorn police slang for a legal gunshop which sometimes sells guns to independent stickup men with proven credentials and which does business sometimes in bulk to the Mafia and approached their squad car He leaned down and looked in the passenger side window at OMearah OMearah expected the guy to sound like a fruit  probably as fruity as his routine about the lavender handcuffths had suggested but a pouf all the same Guns aside Clements did a lively trade in handcuffs These were legal in Manhattan  and most of the people buying them werent amateur Houdinis the cops didnt like it but when had what the cops thought on any given subject ever changed things The buyers were homos with a little taste for s  m But the man didnt sound like a fag at all His voice was flat and expressionless polite but somehow dead The tradesman in there took my wallet he said Who OMearah straightened up fast They had been itching to bust Justin Clements for a year and a half If it could be done maybe the two of them could finally swap these bluesuits for detectives badges Probably just a pipedream  this was too good to be true  but just the same  The tradesman The   A brief pause The clerk OMearah and Carl Delevan exchanged a glance Black hair Delevan asked On the stocky side Again there was the briefest pause Yes His eyes were brown Small scar under one of them There was something about the guy  OMearah couldnt put his finger on it then but remembered later on when there werent so many other things to think about The chief of which of course was the simple fact that the gold detectives badge didnt matter it turned out that just holding onto the jobs they had would be a pure brassyass miracle But years later there was a brief moment of epiphany when OMearah took his two sons to the Museum of Science in Boston  They had a machine there  a computer  that played tictactoe and unless you put your X in the middle square on your first move the machine fucked you over every time But there was always a pause as it checked its memory for all possible gambits He and his boys had been fascinated But there was something spooky about it  and then he remembered BlueSuit He remembered because BlueSuit had had that some fucking habit Talking to him had been like talking to a robot Delevan had no such feeling but nine years later when he took his own son then eighteen and about to start college to the movies one night Delevan would rise unexpectedly to his feet about thirty minutes into the feature and scream Its him Thats HIM Thats the guy in the fucking blue suit The guy who was at Cle   Somebody would shout Down in front but neednt have bothered Delevan seventy pounds overweight and a heavy smoker would be struck by a fatal heart attack before the complainer even got to the second word The man in the blue suit who approached their cruiser that day and told them about his stolen wallet didnt look like the star of the movie but the dead delivery of words had been the same so had been the somehow relentless yet graceful way he moved The movie of course had been The Terminator  The cops exchanged a glance The man BlueSuit was talking about wasnt Clements but almost as good Fat Johnny Holden Clements brotherinlaw But to have done something as totally dumbass as simply stealing a guys wallet would be   would be right up that ginks alley OMearahs mind finished and he had to put a hand to his mouth to cover a momentary little grin Maybe you better tell us exactly what happened Delevan said You can start with your name Again the mans response struck OMearah as a little wrong a little offbeat In this city where it sometimes seemed that seventy per cent of the population believed Go fuck yourself was American for Have a nice day he would have expected the guy to say something like Hey that SOB took my wallet Are you going to get it back for me or are we going to stand out here playing Twenty Questions But there was the nicely cut suit the manicured fingernails A guy maybe used to dealing with bureaucratic bullshit In truth George OMearah didnt care much The thought of busting Fat Johnny Holden and using him as a lever on Arnold Clements made OMearahs mouth water For one dizzy moment he even allowed himself to imagine using Holden to get Clements and Clements to get one of the really big guys  that wop Balazar for instance or maybe Ginelli That wouldnt be too tacky Not too tacky at all My name is Jack Mort the man said Delevan had taken a buttwarped pad from his back pocket Address That slight pause Like the machine OMearah thought again A moment of silence then an almost audible click   Park Avenue South  Delevan jotted it down Social Security number After another slight pause Mort recited it Want you to understand I gotta ask you these questions for identification purposes If the guy did take your wallet its nice if I can say you told me certain stuff before I take it into my possession You understand Yes Now there was the slightest hint of impatience in the mans voice It made OMearah feel a little better about him somehow Just dont drag it out any more than you have to Time passes and   Things have a way of happening yeah I dig Things have a way of happening the man in the blue suit agreed Yes Do you have a photo in your wallet thats distinctive A pause Then A picture of my mother taken in front of the Empire State Building  On the back is written It was a wonderful day and a wonderful view Love Mom  Delevan jotted furiously then snapped his notebook closed Okay That should do it Only other thingll be to have you write your signature if we get the wallet back and compare it with the sigs on your drivers license credit cards stuff like that Okay Roland nodded although part of him understood that although he could draw on Jack Morts memories and knowledge of this world as much as he needed he hadnt a chance in hell of duplicating Morts signature with Morts consciousness absent as it was now Tell us what happened I went in to buy shells for my brother He has a  Winchester revolver The man asked me if I had a Permit to Carry I said of course He asked to see it Pause I took out my wallet I showed him Only when I turned my wallet around to do that showing he must have seen there were quite a few   slight pause   twenties in there I am a tax accountant I have a client named Dorfman who just won a small tax refund after an extended   pause   litigation The sum was only eight hundred dollars but this man Dorfman is   pause   the biggest prick we handle Pause Pardon my pun OMearah ran the mans last few words back through his head and suddenly got it The biggest prick we handle Not bad He laughed Thoughts of robots and machines that played tictactoe went out of his mind The guy was real enough just upset and trying to hide it by being cool Anyway Dorfman wanted cash He insisted on cash You think Fat Johnny got a look at your clients dough Delevan said He and OMearah got out of the blueandwhite Is that what you call the man in the that shop Oh we call him worse than that on occasion Delevan said What happened after you showed him your PC Mr Mort He asked for a closer look I gave him my wallet but he didnt look at the picture He dropped it on the floor I asked him what he did that for He said that was a stupid question Then I told him to give me back my wallet I was mad I bet you were Although looking at the mans dead face Delevan thought youd never guess this man could get mad He laughed I started to come around the counter and get it That was when he pulled the gun They had been walking toward the shop Now they stopped They looked excited rather than fearful Gun OMearah asked wanting to be sure he had heard right It was under the counter by the cash register the man in the blue suit said Roland remembered the moment when he had almost junked his original plan and gone for the mans weapon Now he told these gunslingers why he hadnt He wanted to use them not get them killed I think it was in a dockers clutch A what OMearah asked A longer pause this time The mans forehead wrinkled I dont know exactly how to say it  a thing you put your gun into No one can grab it but you unless they know how to push   A springclip Delevan said Holy shit Another exchange of glances between the partners Neither wanted to be the first to tell this guy that Fat Johnny had probably harvested the cash from his wallet already shucked his buns out the back door and tossed it over the wall of the alley behind the building  but a gun in a springclip  that was different Robbery was a possible but all at once a concealed weapons charge looked like a sure thing Maybe not as good but a foot in the door What then OMearah asked Then he told me I didnt have a wallet He said   pause   that I got my picket pocked  my pocket picked I mean  on the street and Id better remember it if I wanted to stay healthy I remembered seeing a police car parked up the block and I thought you might still be there So I left Okay Delevan said Me and my partner are going in first and fast Give us about a minute  a full minute  just in case theres some trouble Then come in but stand by the door Do you understand Yes Okay Lets bust this motherfucker The two cops went in Roland waited thirty seconds and then followed them  Fat Johnny Holden was doing more than protesting He was bellowing Guys crazy Guy comes in here doesnt even know what he wants then when he sees it in the Shooters Bible he dont know how many comes in a box how much they cost and what he says about me wantin a closer look at his PC is the biggest pile of shit I ever heard because he dont have no Permit to   Fat Johnny broke off There he is Theres the creep Right there I see you buddy I see your face Next time you see mine youre gonna be fuckin sorry I guarantee you that I fuckin guarantee   You dont have this mans wallet OMearah asked You know I dont have his wallet You mind if we take a look behind this display case Delevan countered Just to be sure JesusfuckinjumpedupChristonapony The case is glass You see any wallets there No not there  I meant here Delevan said moving toward the register His voice was a cats purr At this point a chromesteel reinforcing strip almost two feet wide ran down the shelves of the case Delevan looked back at the man in the blue suit who nodded I want you guys out of here right now Fat Johnny said He had lost some of his color You come back with a warrant thats different But for now I want you the fuck out Still a free fuckin country you kn  hey hey HEY QUIT THAT OMearah was peering over the counter Thats illegal Fat Johnny was howling Thats fuckin illegal the Constitution my fuckin lawyer you get back on your side right now or   I just wanted a closer look at the merchandise OMearah said mildly on account of the glass in your display case is so fucking dirty Thats why I looked over Isnt it Carl True shit buddy Delevan said solemnly And look what I found Roland heard a click and suddenly the gunslinger in the blue uniform was holding an extremely large gun in his hand Fat Johnny who had finally realized he was the only person in the room who would tell a story that differed from the fairy tale just told by the cop who had taken his Mag turned sullen I got a permit he said To carry Delevan asked Yeah To carry concealed Yeah This gun registered OMearah asked It is isnt it Well  I mighta forgot Might be its hot and you forgot that too Fuck you Im calling my lawyer Fat Johnny started to turn away Delevan grabbed him Then theres the question of whether or not you got a permit to conceal a deadly weapon in a springclip device he said in the same soft purring voice Thats an interesting question because so far as I know the City of New York doesnt issue a permit like that The cops were looking at Fat Johnny Fat Johnny was glaring back at them So none of them noticed Roland turn the sign hanging in the door from OPEN to CLOSED Maybe we could start to resolve this matter if we could find the gentlemans wallet OMearah said Satan himself could not have lied with such genial persuasiveness Maybe he just dropped it you know I told you  dont know nothing about the guys wallet Guys out of his mind Roland bent down There it is he remarked I can just see it Hes got his foot on it This was a lie but Delevan whose hand was still on Fat Johnnys shoulder shoved the man back so rapidly that it was impossible to tell if the mans foot had been there or not It had to be now Roland glided silently toward the counter as the two gunslingers bent to peer under the counter Because they were standing side by side this brought their heads close together OMearah still had the gun the clerk had kept under the counter in his right hand Goddam its there Delevan said excitedly I see it Roland snapped a quick glance at the man they had called Fat Johnny wanting to make sure he was not going to make a play But he was only standing against the wall  pushing against it actually as if wishing he could push himself into it  with his hands hanging at his sides and his eyes great wounded Os He looked like a man wondering how come his horoscope hadnt told him to beware this day No problem there Yeah OMearah replied gleefully The two men peered under the counter hands on uniformed knees Now OMearahs left his knee and he reached out to snag the wallet I see it t   Roland took one final step forward He cupped Delevans right cheek in one hand OMearahs left cheek in the other and all of a sudden a day Fat Johnny Holden believed had to have hit rock bottom got a lot worse The spook in the blue suit brought the cops heads together hard enough to make a sound like rocks wrapped in felt colliding with each other The cops fell in a heap The man in the goldrimmed specs stood He was pointing the  Mag at Fat Johnny The muzzle looked big enough to hold a moon rocket Were not going to have any trouble are we the spook asked in his dead voice No sir Fat Johnny said at once not a bit Stand right there If your ass loses contact with that wall you are going to lose contact with life as you have always known it You understand Yes sir Fat Johnny said I sure do Good Roland pushed the two cops apart They were both still alive That was good No matter how slow and unobservant they might be they were gunslingers men who had tried to help a stranger in trouble He had no urge to kill his own But he had done it before hadnt he Yes Had not Alain himself one of his sworn brothers died under Rolands and Cuthberts own smoking guns Without taking his eyes from the clerk he felt under the counter with the toe of Jack Morts Gucci loafer He felt the wallet He kicked it It came spinning out from underneath the counter on the clerks side Fat Johnny jumped and shrieked like a goosey girl who spies a mouse His ass actually did lose contact with the wall for a moment but the gunslinger overlooked it He had no intention of putting a bullet in this man He would throw the gun at him and poleaxe him with it before firing a shot A gun as absurdly big as this would probably bring half the neighborhood Pick it up the gunslinger said Slowly Fat Johnny reached down and as he grasped the wallet he farted loudly and screamed With faint amusement the gunslinger realized he had mistaken the sound of his own fart for a gunshot and his time of dying had come When Fat Johnny stood up he was blushing furiously There was a large wet patch on the front of his pants Put the purse on the counter Wallet I mean Fat Johnny did it Now the shells Winchester s And I want to see your hands every second I have to reach into my pocket For my keys Roland nodded As Fat Johnny first unlocked and then slid open the case with the stacked cartons of bullets inside Roland cogitated Give me four boxes he said at last He could not imagine needing so many shells but the temptation to have them was not to be denied Fat Johnny put the boxes on the counter Roland slid one of them open still hardly able to believe it wasnt a joke or a sham But they were bullets all right clean shining unmarked never fired never reloaded He held one up to the light for a moment then put it back in the box Now take out a pair of those wristbands Wristbands   The gunslinger consulted the Mortcypedia Handcuffs Mister I dunno what you want The cash registers   Do what I say Now Christ this aint never gonna to end Fat Johnnys mind moaned He opened another section of the counter and brought out a pair of cuffs Key Roland asked Fat Johnny put the key to the cuffs on the counter It made a small click One of the unconscious cops made an abrupt snoring sound and Johnny uttered a wee screech Turn around the gunslinger said You aint gonna shoot me are you Say you aint Aint Roland said tonelessly As long as you turn around right now If you dont do that I will Fat Johnny turned around beginning to blubber Of course the guy said he wasnt going to but the smell of mob hit was getting too strong to ignore He hadnt even been skimming that much His blubbers became choked wails Please mister for my mothers sake dont shoot me My mothers old Shes blind Shes   Shes cursed with a yellowgut son the gunslinger said dourly Wrists together Mewling wet pants sticking to his crotch Fat Johnny put them together In a trice the steel bracelets were locked in place He had no idea how the spook had gotten over or around the counter so quickly Nor did he want to know Stand there and look at the wall until I tell you its all right to turn around If you turn around before then Ill kill you Hope lighted Fat Johnnys mind Maybe the guy didnt mean to hit him after all Maybe the guy wasnt crazy just insane I wont Swear to God Swear before all of His saints Swear before all His angels Swear before all His arch   I swear if you dont shut up Ill put a slug through your neck the spook said Fat Johnny shut up It seemed to him that he stood facing the wall for an eternity In truth it was about twenty seconds The gunslinger knelt put the clerks gun on the floor took a quick look to make sure the maggot was being good then rolled the other two onto their backs Both were good and out but not dangerously hurt Roland judged They were both breathing regularly A little blood trickled from the ear of the one called Delevan but that was all He took another quick glance at the clerk then unbuckled the gunslingers gunbelts and stripped them off Then he took off Morts blue suitcoat and buckled the belts on himself They were the wrong guns but it still felt good to be packing iron again Damned good Better than he would have believed Two guns One for Eddie and one for Odetta  when and if Odetta was ready for a gun He put on Jack Morts coat again dropped two boxes of shells into the right pocket and two into the left The coat formerly impeccable now bulged out of shape He picked up the clerks  Mag and put the shells in his pants pocket Then he tossed the gun across the room When it hit the floor Fat Johnny jumped uttered another wee shriek and squirted a little more warm water in his pants The gunslinger stood up and told Fat Johnny to turn around  When Fat Johnny got another look at the geek in the blue suit and the goldrimmed glasses his mouth fell open For a moment he felt an overwhelming certainty that the man who had come in here had become a ghost when Fat Johnnys back was turned It seemed to Fat Johnny that through the man he could see a figure much more real one of those legendary gunfighters they used to make movies and TV shows about when he was a kid Wyatt Earp Doc Holliday Butch Cassidy one of those guys Then his vision cleared and he realized what the crazy nut had done taken the cops guns and strapped them around his waist With the suit and tie the effect should have been ludicrous but somehow it wasnt The key to the wristbands is on the counter When the possemen wake up theyll free you He took the wallet opened it and incredibly laid four twenty dollar bills on the glass before stuffing the wallet back into his pocket For the ammunition Roland said Ive taken the bullets from your own gun I intend to throw them away when I leave your store I think that with an unloaded gun and no wallet they may find it difficult to charge you with a crime Fat Johnny gulped For one of the few times in his life he was speechless Now where is the nearest   Pause   nearest drugstore Fat Johnny suddenly understood  or thought he understood  everything The guy was a junkball of course That was the answer No wonder he was so weird Probably hopped up to the eyeballs Theres one around the corner Half a block down FortyNinth If youre lying Ill come back and put a bullet in your brain Im not lying Fat Johnny cried I swear before God the Father I swear before all the Saints I swear on my mothers   But then the door was swinging shut Fat Johnny stood for a moment in utter silence unable to believe the nut was gone Then he walked as rapidly as he could around the counter and to the door He turned his back to it and fumbled around until he was able to grasp and turn the lock He fumbled some more until he had managed to shoot the bolt as well Only then did he allow himself to slide slowly into a sitting position gasping and moaning and swearing to God and all His saints and angels that he would go to St Anthonys this very afternoon as soon as one of those pigs woke up and let him out of these cuffs as a matter of fact He was going to make confession do an act of contrition and take communion Fat Johnny Holden wanted to get right with God This had just been too fucking close  The setting sun became an arc over the Western Sea  It narrowed to a single bright line which seared Eddies eyes Looking at such a light for long could put a permanent burn on your retinas This was just one of the many interesting facts you learned in school facts that helped you get a fulfilling job like parttime bartender and an interesting hobby like the fulltime search for streetskag and the bucks with which to buy it Eddie didnt stop looking He didnt think it was going to matter much longer if he got eyeburned or not He didnt beg the witchwoman behind him First it wouldnt help Second begging would degrade him He had lived a degrading life he discovered that he had no wish to degrade himself further in the last few minutes of it Minutes were all he had left now Thats all there would be before that bright line disappeared and the time of the lobstrosities came He had ceased hoping that a miraculous change would bring Odetta back at the last moment just as he ceased hoping that Detta would recognize that his death would almost certainly strand her in this world forever He had believed until fifteen minutes ago that she was bluffing now he knew better Well itll be better than strangling an inch at a time he thought but after seeing the loathsome lobsterthings night after night he really didnt believe that was true He hoped he would be able to die without screaming He didnt think this would be possible but he intended to try They be comin fo you honky Detta screeched Be comin any minute now Goan be the best dinner those daddies evah had It wasnt just a bluff Odetta wasnt coming back  and the gunslinger wasnt either This last hurt the most somehow He had been sure he and the gunslinger had become  well partners if not brothers  during their trek up the beach and Roland would at least make an effort to stand by him But Roland wasnt coming Maybe it isnt that he doesnt want to come Maybe he cant come Maybe hes dead killed by a security guard in a drugstore  shit thatd be a laugh the worlds last gunslinger killed by a RentACop  or maybe run over by a taxi Maybe hes dead and the doors gone Maybe thats why shes not running a bluff Maybe theres no bluff to run Goan be any minute now Detta screamed and then Eddie didnt have to worry about his retinas anymore because that last bright slice of light disappeared leaving only afterglow He stared at the waves the bright afterimage slowly fading from his eyes and waited for the first of the lobstrosities to come rolling and tumbling out of the waves  Eddie tried to turn his head to avoid the first one but he was too slow It ripped off a swatch of his face with one claw splattering his left eye to jelly and revealing the bright gleam of bone in the twilight as it asked its questions and the Really Bad Woman laughed Stop it Roland commanded himself Thinking such thoughts is worse than helpless it is a distraction And it need not be There may still be time And there still was  then As Roland strode down FortyNinth street in Jack Morts body arms swinging bullshooters eyes fixed firmly upon the sign which read DRUGS oblivious to the stares he was getting and the way people swerved to avoid him the sun was still up in Rolands world Its lower rim would not touch the place where sea met sky for another fifteen minutes or so If Eddies time of agony was to come it was still ahead The gunslinger did not know this for a fact however he only knew it was later over there than here and while the sun should still be up over there the assumption that time in this world and his own ran at the same speed might be a deadly one  especially for Eddie who would die the death of unimaginable horror that his mind nevertheless kept trying to imagine The urge to look back to see was almost insurmountable Yet he dared not Must not The voice of Cort interrupted the run of his thoughts sternly Control the things you can control maggot Let everything else take a flying fuck at you and if you must go down go down with your guns blazing Yes But it was hard Very hard sometimes He would have seen and understood why people were staring at him and then veering away if he had been a little less savagely fixed on finishing his work in this world as soon as he could and getting the hell out but it would have changed nothing He strode so rapidly toward the blue sign where according to the Mortcypedia he could get the Keflex stuff his body needed that Morts suitcoat flapped out behind him in spite of the heavy lead weighting in each pocket The gunbelts buckled across his hips were clearly revealed He wore them not as their owners had straight and neat but as he wore his own crisscross lowhung on his hips To the shoppers hoppers and hawkers on FortyNinth he looked much as he had looked to Fat Johnny like a desperado Roland reached Katzs Drug Store and went in  The gunslinger had known magicians enchanters and alchemists in his time Some had been clever charlatans some stupid fakes in whom only people more stupid than they were themselves could believe but there had never been a shortage of fools in the world so even the stupid fakes survived in fact most actually thrived and a small few actually able to do those black things of which men whisper  these few could call demons and the dead could kill with a curse or heal with strange potions One of these men had been a creature the gunslinger believed to be a demon himself a creature that pretended to be a man and called itself Flagg He had seen him only briefly and that had been near the end as chaos and the final crash approached his land Hot on his heels had come two young men who looked desperate and yet grim men named Dennis and Thomas These three had crossed only a tiny part of what had been a confused and confusing time in the gunslingers life but he would never forget seeing Flagg change a man who had irritated him into a howling dog He remembered that well enough Then there had been the man in black And there had been Marten Marten who had seduced his mother while his father was away Marten who had tried to author Rolands death but had instead authored his early manhood Marten who he suspected he might meet again before he reached the Tower  or at it This is only to say that his experience of magic and magicians had led him to expect something quite different than what he did find in Katzs Drug Store He had anticipated a dim candlelit room full of bitter fumes jars of unknown powders and liquids and philters many covered with a thick layer of dust or spun about with a centurys cobwebs He had expected a man in a cowl a man who might be dangerous He saw people moving about inside through the transparent plateglass windows as casually as they would in any shop and believed they must be an illusion They werent So for a moment the gunslinger merely stood inside the door first amazed then ironically amused Here he was in a world which struck him dumb with fresh wonders seemingly at every step a world where carriages flew through the air and paper seemed as cheap as sand And the newest wonder was simply that for these people wonder had run out here in a place of miracles he saw only dull faces and plodding bodies There were thousands of bottles there were potions there were philters but the Mortcypedia identified most as quack remedies Here was a salve that was supposed to restore fallen hair but would not there a cream which promised to erase unsightly spots on the hands and arms but lied Here were cures for things that needed no curing things to make your bowels run or stop them up to make your teeth white and your hair black things to make your breath smell better as if you could not do that by chewing alderbark No magic here only trivialities  although there was astin and a few other remedies which sounded as if they might be useful But for the most part Roland was appalled by the place In a place that promised alchemy but dealt more in perfume than potion was it any wonder that wonder had run out But when he consulted the Mortcypedia again he discovered that the truth of this place was not just in the things he was looking at The potions that really worked were kept safely out of sight One could only obtain these if you had a sorcerers fiat In this world such sorcerers were called DOCKTORS and they wrote their magic formulae on sheets of paper which the Mortcypedia called REXES The gunslinger didnt know the word He supposed he could have consulted further on the matter but didnt bother He knew what he needed and a quick look into the Mortcypedia told him where in the store he could get it He strode down one of the aisles toward a high counter with the words PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED over it  The Katz who had opened Katzs Pharmacy and Soda Fountain Sundries and Notions for Misses and Misters on th Street in  was long in his grave and his only son looked ready for his own Although he was only fortysix he looked twenty years older He was balding yellowskinned and frail He knew people said he looked like death on horseback but none of them understood why Take this crotch on the phone now Mrs Rathbun Ranting that she would sue him if he didnt fill her goddamned Valium prescription and right now RIGHT THIS VERY INSTANT What do you think lady Im gonna pour a stream of blue bombers through the phone If he did she would at least do him a favor and shut up She would just tip the receiver up over her mouth and open wide The thought raised a ghostly grin which revealed his sallow dentures You dont understand Mrs Rathbun he interrupted after he had listened to a minute  a full minute timed it with the sweep secondhand of his watch  of her raving He would like just once to be able to say Stop shouting at me you stupid crotch Shout at your DOCTOR Hes the one who hooked you on that shit Right Damn quacks gave it out like it was bubblegum and when they decided to cut off the supply who got hit with the shit The sawbones Oh no He did What do you mean I dont understand The voice in his ear was like an angry wasp buzzing in a jar I understand I do a lot of business at your tacky drugstore I understand Ive been a loyal customer all these years I understand   Youll have to speak to   He glanced at the crotchs Rolodex card through his halfglasses again   Dr Brumhall Mrs Rathbun Your prescription has expired Its a Federal crime to dispense Valium without a prescription And it ought to be one to prescribe it in the first place unless youre going to give the patient youre prescribing it for your unlisted number with it that is he thought It was an oversight the woman screamed Now there was a raw edge of panic in her voice Eddie would have recognized that tone at once it was the call of the wild JunkBird Then call him and ask him to rectify it Katz said He has my number Yes They all had his number That was precisely the trouble He looked like a dying man at fortysix because of the fershlugginer doctors And all I have to do to guarantee that the last thin edge of profit I am somehow holding onto in this place will melt away is tell a few of these junkie bitches to go fuck themselves Thats all I CANT CALL HIM she screamed Her voice drilled painfully into his ear HIM AND HIS FAG BOYFRIEND ARE ON VACATION SOMEPLACE AND NO ONE WILL TELL ME WHERE Katz felt acid seeping into his stomach He had two ulcers one healed the other currently bleeding and women like this bitch were the reason why He closed his eyes Thus he did not see his assistant stare at the man in the blue suit and the goldrimmed glasses approaching the prescription counter nor did he see Ralph the fat old security guard Katz paid the man a pittance but still bitterly resented the expense his father had never needed a security guard but his father God rot him had lived in a time when New York had been a city instead of a toiletbowl suddenly come out of his usual dim daze and reach for the gun on his hip He heard a woman scream but thought it was because she had just discovered all the Revlon was on sale hed been forced to put the Revlon on sale because that putz Dollentz up the street was undercutting him He was thinking of nothing but Dollentz and this bitch on the phone as the gunslinger approached like fated doom thinking of how wonderful the two of them would look naked save for a coating of honey and staked out over anthills in the burning desert sun HIS and HERS anthills wonderful He was thinking this was the worst it could get the absolute worst His father had been so determined that his only son follow in his footsteps that he had refused to pay for anything but a degree in pharmacology and so he had followed in his fathers footsteps and God rot his father for this was surely the lowest moment in a life that had been full of low moments a life which had made him old before his time This was the absolute nadir Or so he thought with his eyes closed If you come by Mrs Rathbun I could give you a dozen five milligram Valium Would that be all right The man sees reason Thank God the man sees reason And she hung up Just like that Not a word of thanks But when she saw the walking rectum that called itself a doctor again she would just about fall down and polish the tips of his Gucci loafers with her nose she would give him a blowjob she would  Mr Katz his assistant said in a voice that sounded strangely winded I think we have a prob   There was another scream It was followed by the crash of a gun startling him so badly he thought for a moment his heart was simply going to utter one monstrous clap in his chest and then stop forever He opened his eyes and stared into the eyes of the gunslinger Katz dropped his gaze and saw the pistol in the mans fist He looked left and saw Ralph the guard nursing one hand and staring at the thief with eyes that seemed to be bugging out of his face Ralphs own gun the  which he had toted dutifully through eighteen years as a police officer and which he had only fired from the line of the rd Precincts basement target range he said he had drawn it twice in the line of duty  but who knew was now a wreck in the corner I want Keflex the man with the bullshooter eyes said expressionlessly I want a lot Now And never mind the REX For a moment Katz could only look at him his mouth open his heart struggling in his chest his stomach a sickly boiling pot of acid Had he thought he had hit rock bottom Had he really  You dont understand Katz managed at last His voice sounded strange to himself and there was really nothing very odd about that since his mouth felt like a flannel shirt and his tongue like a strip of cotton batting There is no cocaine here It is not a drug which is dispensed under any cir   I did not say cocaine the man in the blue suit and the goldrimmed glasses said I said Keflex Thats what I thought you said Katz almost told this crazy momser and then decided that might provoke him He had heard of drug stores getting held up for speed for Bennies for half a dozen other things including Mrs Rathbuns precious Valium but he thought this might be the first penicillin robbery in history The voice of his father God rot the old bastard told him to stop dithering and gawping and do something But he could think of nothing to do The man with the gun supplied him with something Move the man with the gun said Im in a hurry HHow much do you want Katz asked His eyes flicked momentarily over the robbers shoulder and he saw something he could hardly believe Not in this city But it looked like it was happening anyway Good luck Katz actually has some good luck That you could put in The Guinness Book of World Records I dont know the man with the gun said As much as you can put in a bag A big bag And with no warning at all he whirled and the gun in his fist crashed again A man bellowed Plate glass blew onto the sidewalk and the street in a sparkle of shards and splinters Several passing pedestrians were cut but none seriously Inside Katzs drugstore women and not a few men screamed The burglar alarm began its own hoarse bellow The customers panicked and stampeded toward and out the door The man with the gun turned back to Katz and his expression had not changed at all his face wore the same look of frightening but not inexhaustable patience that it had worn from the first Do as I say rapidly Im in a hurry Katz gulped Yes sir he said  The gunslinger had seen and admired the curved mirror in the upper left corner of the shop while he was still halfway to the counter behind which they kept the powerful potions The creation of such a curved mirror was beyond the ability of any craftsman in his own world as things were now although there had been a time when such things  and many of the others he saw in Eddie and Odettas world  might have been made He had seen the remains of some in the tunnel under the mountains and he had seen them in other places as well  relics as ancient and mysterious as the Druit stones that sometimes stood in the places where demons came He also understood the mirrors purpose He had been a bit late seeing the guards move  he was still discovering how disastrously the lenses Mort wore over his eyes restricted his peripheral vision  but hed still time to turn and shoot the gun out of the guards hand It was a shot Roland thought as nothing more than routine although hed needed to hurry a little The guard however had a different opinion Ralph Lennox would swear to the end of his days that the guy had made an impossible shot  except maybe on those old kiddie Western shows like Annie Oakley Thanks to the mirror which had obviously been placed where it was to detect thieves Roland was quicker dealing with the other one He had seen the alchemists eyes flick up and over his shoulder for a moment and the gunslingers own eyes had immediately gone to the mirror In it he saw a man in a leather jacket moving up the center aisle behind him There was a long knife in his hand and no doubt visions of glory in his head The gunslinger turned and fired a single shot dropping the gun to his hip aware that he might miss with the first shot because of his unfamiliarity with this weapon but unwilling to injure any of the customers standing frozen behind the wouldbe hero Better to have to shoot twice from the hip firing slugs that would do the job while travelling on an upward angle that would protect the bystanders than to perhaps kill some lady whose only crime had been picking the wrong day to shop for perfume The gun had been well cared for Its aim was true Remembering the podgy underexercised looks of the gunslingers he had taken these weapons from it seemed that they cared better for the weapons they wore than for the weapons they were It seemed a strange way to behave but of course this was a strange world and Roland could not judge had no time to judge come to that The shot was a good one chopping through the mans knife at the base of the blade leaving him holding nothing but the hilt Roland stared evenly at the man in the leather coat and something in his gaze must have made the wouldbe hero remember a pressing appointment elsewhere for he whirled dropped the remains of the knife and joined the general exodus Roland turned back and gave the alchemist his orders Any more fucking around and blood would flow When the alchemist turned away Roland tapped his bony shoulder blade with the barrel of the pistol The man made a strangled Yeeek sound and turned back at once Not you You stay here Let your prentice do it WWho Him The gunslinger gestured impatiently at the aide What should I do Mr Katz The remains of the aides teenage acne stood out brilliantly on his white face Do what he says you putz Fill the order Keflex The aide went to one of the shelves behind the counter and picked up a bottle Turn it so I may see the words writ upon it the gunslinger said The aide did Roland couldnt read it too many letters were not of his alphabet He consulted the Mortcypedia Keflex it confirmed and Roland realized even checking had been a stupid waste of time He knew he couldnt read everything in this world but these men didnt How many pills in that bottle Well theyre capsules actually the aide said nervously If its a cillin drug in pill form youre interested in   Never mind all that How many doses Oh Uh   The flustered aide looked at the bottle and almost dropped it Two hundred Roland felt much as he had when he discovered how much ammunition could be purchased in this world for a trivial sum There had been nine sample bottles of Keflex in the secret compartment of Enrico Balazars medicine cabinet thirtysix doses in all and he had felt well again If he couldnt kill the infection with two hundred doses it couldnt be killed Give it to me the man in the blue suit said The aide handed it over The gunslinger pushed back the sleeve of his jacket revealing Jack Morts Rolex I have no money but this may serve as adequate compensation I hope so anyway He turned nodded toward the guard who was still sitting on the floor by his overturned stool and staring at the gunslinger with wide eyes and then walked out Simple as that For five seconds there was no sound in the drugstore but the bray of the alarm which was loud enough to blank out even the babble of the people on the street God in heaven Mr Katz what do we do now the aide whispered Katz picked up the watch and hefted it Gold Solid gold He couldnt believe it He had to believe it Some madman walked in off the street shot a gun out of his guards hand and a knife out of anothers all in order to obtain the most unlikely drug he could think of Keflex Maybe sixty dollars worth of Keflex For which he had paid with a  Rolex watch Do Katz asked Do The first thing you do is put that wristwatch under the counter You never saw it He looked at Ralph Neither did you No sir Ralph agreed immediately As long as I get my share when you sell it I never saw that watch at all Theyll shoot him like a dog in the street Katz said with unmistakable satisfaction Keflex And the guy didnt even seem to have the sniffles the aide said wonderingly As the suns bottom arc first touched the Western Sea in Rolands world striking bright golden fire across the water to where Eddie lay trussed like a turkey Officers OMearah and Delevan were coming groggily back to consciousness in the world from which Eddie had been taken Let me out of these cuffs would ya Fat Johnny asked in a humble voice Where is he OMearah asked thickly and groped for his holster Gone Holster belt bullets gun Gun Oh shit He began thinking of the questions that might be asked by the shits in the Department of Internal Affairs guys who had learned all they knew about the streets from Jack Webb on Dragnet and the monetary value of his lost gun suddenly became about as important to him as the population of Ireland or the principal mineral deposits of Peru He looked at Carl and saw Carl had also been stripped of his weapon Oh dear Jesus bring on the clowns OMearah thought miserably and when Fat Johnny asked again if OMearah would use the key on the counter to unlock the handcuffs OMearah said I ought to  He paused because hed been about to say I ought to shoot you in the guts instead but he couldnt very well shoot Fat Johnny could he The guns here were chained down and the geek in the goldrimmed glasses the geek who had seemed so much like a solid citizen had taken his and Carls as easily as OMearah himself might take a popgun from a kid Instead of finishing he got the key and unlocked the cuffs He spotted the  Magnum which Roland had kicked into the corner and picked it up It wouldnt fit in his holster so he stuffed it in his belt Hey thats mine Fat Johnny bleated Yeah You want it back OMearah had to speak slowly His head really ached At that moment all he wanted to do was find Mr GoldRimmed Specs and nail him to a handy wall With dull nails I hear they like fat guys like you up in Attica  Johnny They got a saying The bigger the cushion the better the pushin You sure you want it back Fat Johnny turned away without a word but not before OMearah had seen the tears welling in his eyes and the wet patch on his pants He felt no pity Where is he Carl Delevan asked in a furry buzzing voice He left Fat Johnny said dully Thats all I know He left I thought he was gonna kill me Delevan was getting slowly to his feet He felt tacky wetness on the side of his face and looked at his fingers Blood Fuck He groped for his gun and kept groping groping and hoping long after his fingers had assured him his gun and holster were gone OMearah merely had a headache Delevan felt as if someone had used the inside of his head as a nuclear weapons testing site Guy took my gun he said to OMearah His voice was so slurry the words were almost impossible to make out Join the club He still here Delevan took a step toward OMearah tilted to the left as if he were on the deck of a ship in a heavy sea and then managed to right himself No How long Delevan looked at Fat Johnny who didnt answer perhaps because Fat Johnny whose back was turned thought Delevan was still talking to his partner Delevan not a man noted for even temper and restrained behavior under the best of circumstances roared at the man even though it made his head feel like it was going to crack into a thousand pieces I asked you a question you fat shit How long has that motherfucker been gone Five minutes maybe Fat Johnny said dully Took his shells and your guns He paused Paid for the shells I couldnt believe it Five minutes Delevan thought The guy had come in a cab Sitting in their cruiser and drinking coffee they had seen him get out of it It was getting close to rushhour Cabs were hard to get at this time of day Maybe  Come on he said to George OMearah We still got a chance to collar him Well want a gun from this slut here   OMearah displayed the Magnum At first Delevan saw two of them then the image slowly came together Good Delevan was coming around not all at once but getting there like a prizefighter who has taken a damned hard one on the chin You keep it Ill use the shotgun under the dash He started for the door and this time he did more than reel he staggered and had to claw the wall to keep his feet You gonna be all right OMearah asked If we catch him Delevan said They left Fat Johnny was not as glad about their departure as he had been about that of the spook in the blue suit but almost Almost  Delevan and OMearah didnt even have to discuss which direction the perp might have taken when he left the gunshop All they had to do was listen to the radio dispatcher Code  she said over and over again Robbery in progress shots fired Code  Code  Location is  West th Katzs Drugs perpetrator tall sandyhaired blue suit   Shots fired Delevan thought his head aching worse than ever I wonder if they were fired with Georges gun or mine Or both If that shitbag killed someone were fucked Unless we get him Blast off he said curtly to OMearah who didnt need to be told twice He understood the situation as well as Delevan did He flipped on the lights and the siren and screamed out into traffic It was knotting up already rushhour starting and so OMearah ran the cruiser with two wheels in the gutter and two on the sidewalk scattering pedestrians like quail He clipped the rear fender of a produce truck sliding onto FortyNinth Ahead he could see twinkling glass on the sidewalk They could both hear the strident bray of the alarm Pedestrians were sheltering in doorways and behind piles of garbage but residents of the overhead apartments were staring out eagerly as if this was a particularly good TV show or a movie you didnt have to pay to see The block was devoid of automobile traffic cabs and commuters alike had scatted I just hope hes still there Delevan said and used a key to unlock the short steel bars across the stock and barrel of the pump shotgun under the dashboard He pulled it out of its clips I just hope that rottencrotch son of a bitch is still there What neither understood was that when you were dealing with the gunslinger it was usually better to leave bad enough alone  When Roland stepped out of Katzs Drugs the big bottle of Keflex had joined the cartons of ammo in Jack Morts coat pockets He had Carl Delevans service  in his right hand It felt so damned good to hold a gun in a whole right hand He heard the siren and saw the car roaring down the street Them he thought He began to raise the gun and then remembered they were gunslingers Gunslingers doing their duty He turned and went back into the alchemists shop Hold it motherfucker Delevan screamed Rolands eyes flew to the convex mirror in time to see one of the gunslingers  the one whose ear had bled  leaning out of the window with a scatterrifle As his partner pulled their carriage to a screaming halt that made its rubber wheels smoke on the pavement he jacked a shell into its chamber Roland hit the floor  Katz didnt need any mirror to see what was about to happen First the crazy man now the crazy cops Oy vay Drop he screamed to his assistant and to Ralph the security guard and then fell to his knees behind the counter without waiting to see if they were doing the same or not Then a splitsecond before Delevan triggered the shotgun his assistant dropped on top of him like an eager tackle sacking the quarterback in a football game driving Katzs head against the floor and breaking his jaw in two places Through the sudden pain which went roaring through his head he heard the shotguns blast heard the remaining glass in the windows shatter  along with bottles of aftershave cologne perfume mouthwash cough syrup God knew what else A thousand conflicting smells rose creating one hellstench and before he passed out Katz again called upon God to rot his father for chaining this curse of a drug store to his ankle in the first place  Roland saw bottles and boxes fly back in a hurricane of shot A glass case containing timepieces disintegrated Most of the watches inside also disintegrated The pieces flew backwards in a sparkling cloud They cant know if there are still innocent people in here or not he thought They cant know and yet they used a scatterrifle just the same It was unforgivable He felt anger and suppressed it They were gunslingers Better to believe their brains had been addled by the headknocking theyd taken than to believe theyd done such a thing knowingly without a care for whom they might hurt or kill They would expect him to either run or shoot Instead he crept forward keeping low He lacerated both hands and knees on shards of broken glass The pain brought Jack Mort back to consciousness He was glad Mort was back He would need him As for Morts hands and knees he didnt care He could stand the pain easily and the wounds were being inflicted on the body of a monster who deserved no better He reached the area just under what remained of the plateglass window He was to the right of the door He crouched there body coiled He bolstered the gun which had been in his right hand He would not need it  What are you doing Carl OMearah screamed In his head he suddenly saw a Daily News headline COP KILLS  IN WEST SIDE DRUG STORE SNAFU Delevan ignored him and pumped a fresh shell into the shotgun Lets go get this shit  It happened exactly as the gunslinger had hoped it would Furious at being effortlessly fooled and disarmed by a man who probably looked to them no more dangerous than any of the other lambs on the streets of this seemingly endless city still groggy from the headknocking they rushed in with the idiot who had fired the scatterrifle in the lead They ran slightly bentover like soldiers charging an enemy position but that was the only concession they made to the idea that their adversary might still be inside In their minds he was already out the back and fleeing down an alley So they came crunching over the sidewalk glass and when the gunslinger with the scatterrifle pulled open the glassless door and charged in the gunslinger rose his hands laced together in a single fist and brought it down on the nape of Officer Carl Delevans neck While testifying before the investigating committee Delevan would claim he remembered nothing at all after kneeling down in Clements and seeing the perps wallet under the counter The committee members thought such amnesia was under the circumstances pretty damned convenient and Delevan was lucky to get off with a sixtyday suspension without pay Roland however would have believed and under different circumstances if the fool hadnt discharged a scatterrifle into a store which might have been full of innocent people for instance even sympathized When you got your skull busted twice in half an hour a few scrambled brains were to be expected As Delevan went down suddenly as boneless as a sack of oats Roland took the scatterrifle from his relaxing hands Hold it OMearah screamed his voice a mixture of anger and dismay He was starting to raise Fat Johnnys Magnum but it was as Roland had suspected the gunslingers of this world were pitifully slow He could have shot OMearah three times but there was no need He simply swung the scattergun in a strong climbing arc There was a flat smack as the stock connected with OMearahs left cheek the sound of a baseball bat connecting with a real steamer of a pitch All at once OMearahs entire face from the cheek on down moved two inches to the right It would take three operations and four steel pegs to put him together again He stood there for a moment unbelieving and then his eyes rolled up the whites His knees unhinged and he collapsed Roland stood in the doorway oblivious to the approaching sirens He broke the scatterrifle then worked the pump action ejecting all the fat red cartridges onto Delevans body That done he dropped the gun itself onto Delevan Youre a dangerous fool who should be sent west he told the unconscious man You have forgotten the face of your father He stepped over the body and walked to the gunslingers carriage which was still idling He climbed in the door on the far side and slid behind the driving wheel  Can you drive this carriage he asked the screaming gibbering thing that was Jack Mort He got no coherent answer Mort just went on screaming The gunslinger recognized this as hysteria but one which was not entirely genuine Jack Mort was having hysterics on purpose as a way of avoiding any conversation with this weird kidnapper Listen the gunslinger told him Ionly have time to say this  and everything else  once My time has grown very short If you dont answer my question I am going to put your right thumb into your right eye Ill jam it in as far as it will go and then Ill pull your eyeball right out of your head and wipe it on the seat of this carriage like a booger I can get along with one eye just fine And after all it isnt as if it were mine He could no more have lied to Mort than Mort could have lied to him the nature of their relationship was cold and reluctant on both their parts yet it was much more intimate than the most passionate act of sexual intercourse would have been This was after all not a joining of bodies but the ultimate meeting of minds He meant exactly what he said And Mort knew it The hysterics stopped abruptly Ican drive it Mort said It was the first sensible communication Roland had gotten from Mort since he had arrived inside the mans head Then do it Where do you want me to go Do you know a place called The Village Yes Go there Where in the Village For now just drive Well be able to go faster if I use the siren Fine Turn it on Those flashing lights too For the first time since he had seized control of him Roland pulled back a little and allowed Mort to take over When Morts head turned to inspect the dashboard of Delevans and OMearahs blueandwhite Roland watched it turn but did not initiate the action But if he had been a physical being instead of only his own disembodied ka he would have been standing on the balls of his feet ready to leap forward and take control again at the slightest sign of mutiny There was none though This man had killed and maimed God knew how many innocent people but he had no intention of losing one of his own precious eyes He flicked switches pulled a lever and suddenly they were in motion The siren whined and the gunslinger saw red pulses of light kicking off the front of the carriage Drive fast the gunslinger commanded grimly  In spite of lights and siren and Jack Mort beating steadily on the horn it took them twenty minutes to reach Greenwich Village in rushhour traffic In the gunslingers world Eddie Deans hopes were crumbling like dykes in a downpour Soon they would collapse altogether The sea had eaten half the sun Well Jack Mort said were here He was telling the truth there was no way he could lie although to Roland everything here looked just as it had everywhere else a choke of buildings people and carriages The carriages choked not only the streets but the air itself  with their endless clamor and their noxious fumes It came he supposed from whatever fuel it was they burned It was a wonder these people could live at all or the women give birth to children that were not monsters like the Slow Mutants under the mountains Now where do we go Mort was asking This would be the hard part The gunslinger got ready  as ready as he could at any rate Turn off the siren and the lights Stop by the sidewalk Mort pulled the cruiser up beside a fire hydrant There are underground railways in this city the gunslinger said Iwant you to take me to a station where these trains stop to let passengers on and off Which one Mort asked The thought was tinged with the mental color of panic Mort could hide nothing from Roland and Roland nothing from Mort  not at least for very long Some years ago  I dont know how many  you pushed a young woman in front of a train in one of those underground stations Thats the one I want you to take me to There ensued a short violent struggle The gunslinger won but it was a surprisingly hard go In his way Jack Mort was as divided as Odetta He was not a schizophrenic as she was he knew well enough what he did from time to time But he kept his secret self  the part of him that was The Pusher  as carefully locked away as an embezzler might lock away his secret skim Take me there you bastard the gunslinger repeated He slowly raised the thumb toward Morts right eye again It was less than half an inch away and still moving when he gave in Morts right hand moved the lever by the wheel again and they rolled toward the Christopher Street station where that fabled Atrain had cut off the legs of a woman named Odetta Holmes some three years before  Well looky there foot patrolman Andrew Staunton said to his partner Norris Weaver as Delevans and OMearahs blueandwhite came to a stop halfway down the block There were no parking spaces and the driver made no effort to find one He simply doubleparked and let the clog of traffic behind him inch its laborious way through the loophole remaining like a trickle of blood trying to serve a heart hopelessly clogged with cholesterol Weaver checked the numbers on the side by the right front headlight  Yes that was the number theyd gotten from dispatch all right The flashers were on and everything looked kosher  until the door opened and the driver stepped out He was wearing a blue suit all right but not the kind that came with gold buttons and a silver badge His shoes werent police issue either unless Staunton and Weaver had missed a memo notifying officers that duty footwear would henceforth come from Gucci That didnt seem likely What seemed likely was that this was the creep who had hijacked the cops uptown He got out oblivious to the honkings and cries of protest from the drivers trying to get by him Goddam Andy Staunton breathed Approach with extreme caution the dispatcher had said This man is armed and extremely dangerous Dispatchers usually sounded like the most bored human beings on earth  for all Andy Staunton knew they were  and so the almost awed emphasis this one put on the word extremely had stuck to his consciousness like a burr He drew his weapon for the first time in his four years on the force and glanced at Weaver Weaver had also drawn The two of them were standing outside a deli about thirty feet from the IRT stairway They had known each other long enough to be attuned to each other in a way only cops and professional soldiers can be Without a word between them they stepped back into the doorway of the delicatessen weapons pointing upward Subway Weaver asked Yeah Andy took one quick glance at the entrance Rush hour was in high gear now and the subway stairs were clogged with people heading for their trains Weve got to take him right now before he can get close to the crowd Lets do it They stepped out of the doorway in perfect tandem gunslingers Roland would have recognized at once as adversaries much more dangerous than the first two They were younger for one thing and although he didnt know it some unknown dispatcher had labeled him extremely dangerous and to Andy Staunton and Norris Weaver that made him the equivalent of a rogue tiger Ifhe doesnt stop the second I tell him to hes dead Andy thought Hold it he screamed dropping into a crouch with his gun held out before him in both hands Beside him Weaver had done the same Police Get your hands on your he   That was as far as he got before the guy ran for the IRT stairway He moved with a sudden speed that was uncanny Nevertheless Andy Staunton was wired all his dials turned up to the max He swivelled on his heels feeling a cloak of emotionless coldness drop over him  Roland would have known this too He had felt it many times in similar situations Andy led the running figure slightly then squeezed the trigger of his  He saw the man in the blue suit spin around trying to keep his feet Then he fell to the pavement as commuters who only seconds ago had been concentrating on nothing but surviving another trip home on the subway screamed and scattered like quail They had discovered there was more to survive than the uptown train this afternoon Holy fuck partner Norris Wheaton breathed you blew him away I know Andy said His voice didnt falter The gunslinger would have admired it Lets go see who he was  Im dead Jack Mort was screaming Im dead youve gotten me killed Im dead Im  No the gunslinger responded Through slitted eyes he saw the cops approaching guns still out Younger and faster than the ones who had been parked near the gunshop Faster And at least one of them was a hell of a shot Mort  and Roland along with him  should have been dead dying or seriously wounded Andy Staunton had shot to kill and his bullet had drilled through the left lapel of Morts suitcoat It had likewise punched through the pocket of Morts Arrow shirt  but that was as far as it went The life of both men the one inside and the one outside were saved by Morts lighter Mort didnt smoke but his boss  whose job Mort had confidently expected to have himself by this time next year  did Accordingly Mort had bought a two hundred dollar silver lighter at Dunhills He did not light every cigarette Mr Framingham stuck in his gob when the two of them were together  that would have made him look too much like an asskisser Just once in awhile  and usually when someone even higher up was present someone who could appreciate a Jack Morts quiet courtesy and b Jack Morts good taste DoBees covered all the bases This time covering the bases saved his life and Rolands Stauntons bullet smashed the silver lighter instead of Morts heart which was generic Morts passion for brand names  good brand names  stopped mercifully at the skin He was hurt just the same of course When you were hit by a heavycaliber slug there was no such thing as a free ride The lighter was driven against his chest hard enough to create a hollow It flattened and then smashed apart digging shallow grooves in Morts skin one sliver of shrapnel sliced Morts left nipple almost in two The hot slug also ignited the lighters fluidsoaked batting Nevertheless the gunslinger lay still as they approached The one who had not shot him was telling people to stay back just stay back goddammit Im on fire Mort shrieked Im on fire put it out Put it out PUT IT OWWWWWW  The gunslinger lay still listening to the grit of the gunslingers shoes on the pavement ignoring Morts shrieks trying to ignore the coal suddenly glowing against his chest and the smell of frying flesh A foot slid beneath his ribcage and when it lifted the gunslinger allowed himself to roll bonelessly onto his back Jack Morts eyes were open His face was slack In spite of the shattered burning remains of the lighter there was no sign of the man screaming inside God someone muttered did you shoot him with a tracer man Smoke was rising from the hole in the lapel of Morts coat in a neat little stream It was escaping around the edge of the lapel in more untidy blotches The cops could smell burning flesh as the wadding in the smashed lighter soaked with Ronson lighter fluid really began to blaze Andy Staunton who had performed faultlessly thus far now made his only mistake one for which Cort would have sent him home with a fat ear in spite of his earlier admirable performance telling him one mistake was all it took took to get a man killed most of the time Staunton had been able to shoot the guy  a thing no cop really knows if he can do until hes faced with a situation where he must find out  but the idea that his bullet had somehow set the guy on fire filled him with unreasoning horror So he bent forward to put it out without thinking and the gunslingers feet smashed into his belly before he had time to do more than register the blaze of awareness in eyes he would have sworn were dead Staunton went flailing back into his partner His pistol flew from his hand Wheaton held onto his own but by the time he had gotten clear of Staunton  he heard a shot and his gun was magically gone The hand it had been in felt numb as if it had been struck with a very large hammer The guy in the blue suit got up looked at them for a moment and said Youre good Better than the others So let me advise you Dont follow This is almost over I dont want to have to kill you Then he whirled and ran for the subway stairs  The stairs were choked with people who had reversed their downward course when the yelling and shooting started obsessed with that morbid and somehow unique New Yorkers curiosity to see how bad how many how much blood spilled on the dirty concrete Yet somehow they still found a way to shrink back from the man in the blue suit who came plunging down the stairs It wasnt much wonder He was holding a gun and another was strapped around his waist Also he appeared to be on fire  Roland ignored Morts increasing shrieks of pain as his shirt undershirt and jacket began to burn more briskly as the silver of the lighter began to melt and run down his midsection to his belly in burning tracks He could smell dirty moving air could hear the roar of an oncoming train This was almost the time the moment had almost come around the moment when he would draw the three or lose it all For the second time he seemed to feel worlds tremble and reel about his head He reached the platform level and tossed the  aside He unbuckled Jack Morts pants and pushed them casually down revealing a pair of white underdrawers like a whores panties He had no time to reflect on this oddity If he did not move fast he could stop worrying about burning alive the bullets he had purchased would get hot enough to go off and this body would simply explode The gunslinger stuffed the boxes of bullets into the underdrawers took out the bottle of Keflex and did the same with it Now the underdrawers bulged grotesquely He stripped off the flaming suitjacket but made no effort to take off the flaming shirt He could hear the train roaring toward the platform could see its light He had no way of knowing it was a train which kept the same route as the one which had run over Odetta but all the same he did know In matters of the Tower fate became a thing as merciful as the lighter which had saved his life and as painful as the fire the miracle had ignited Like the wheels of the oncoming train it followed a course both logical and crushingly brutal a course against which only steel and sweetness could stand He hoicked up Morts pants and began to run again barely aware of the people scattering out of his way As more air fed the fire first his shirt collar and then his hair began to burn The heavy boxes in Morts underdrawers slammed against his balls again and again mashing them excruciating pain rose into his gut He jumped the turnstile a man who was becoming a meteor Put me out Mort screamed Put me out before I burn up You ought to burn the gunslinger thought grimly Whats going to happen to you is more merciful than you deserve What do you mean WHAT DO YOU MEAN The gunslinger didnt answer in fact turned him off entirely as he pelted toward the edge of the platform He felt one of the boxes of shells trying to slip out of Morts ridiculous panties and held it with one hand He sent out every bit of his mental force toward the Lady He had no idea if such a telepathic command could be heard or if the hearer could be compelled to obey but he sent it just the same a swift sharp arrow of thought THE DOOR LOOK THROUGH THE DOOR NOW NOW Trainthunder filled the world A woman screamed Oh my God hes going to jump A hand slapped at his shoulder trying to pull him back Then Roland pushed the body of Jack Mort past the yellow warning line and dove over the edge of the platform He fell into the path of the oncoming train with his hands cupping his crotch holding the luggage he would bring back  if that was he was fast enough to get out of Mort at just the right instant As he fell he called her  them  again ODETTA HOLMES DETTAWALKER LOOK NOW As he called as the train bore down upon him its wheels turning with merciless silver speed the gunslinger finally turned his head and looked back through the door And directly into her face Faces Both of them I see both of them at the same time  NOO   Mort shrieked and in the last split second before the train ran him down cutting him in two not above the knees but at the waist Roland lunged at the door  and through it Jack Mort died alone The boxes of ammunition and the bottle of pills appeared beside Rolands physical body His hands clenched spasmodically at them then relaxed The gunslinger forced himself up aware that he was wearing his sick throbbing body again aware that Eddie Dean was screaming aware that Odetta was shrieking in two voices He looked  only for a moment  and saw exactly what he had heard not one woman but two Both were legless both darkskinned both women of great beauty Nonetheless one of them was a hag her interior ugliness not hidden by her outer beauty but enhanced by it Roland stared at these twins who were not really twins at all but negative and positive images of the same woman He stared with a feverish hypnotic intensity Then Eddie screamed again and the gunslinger saw the lobstrosities tumbling out of the waves and strutting toward the place where Detta had left him trussed and helpless The sun was down Darkness had come  Detta saw herself in the doorway saw herself through her eyes saw herself through the gunslingers eyes and her sense of dislocation was as sudden as Eddies but much more violent She was here She was there in the gunslingers eyes She heard the oncoming train Odetta she screamed suddenly understanding everything what she was and when it had happened Detta she screamed suddenly understanding everything what she was and who had done it A brief sensation of being turned inside out  and then a much more agonizing one She was being torn apart  Roland shambled down the short slope to the place where Eddie lay He moved like a man who has lost his bones One of the lobsterthings clawed at Eddies face Eddie screamed The gunslinger booted it away He bent rustily and grabbed Eddies arms He began to drag him backwards but it was too late his strength was too little they were going to get Eddie hell both of them  Eddie screamed again as one of the lobstrosities asked him didachick and then tore a swatch of his pants and a chunk of meat to go along with it Eddie tried another scream but nothing came out but a choked gargle He was strangling in Dettas knots The things were all around them closing in claws clicking eagerly The gunslinger threw the last of his strength into a final yank  and tumbled backwards He heard them coming them with their hellish questions and clicking claws Maybe it wasnt so bad he thought He had staked everything and that was all he had lost The thunder of his own guns filled him with stupid wonder  The two women lay face to face bodies raised like snakes about to strike fingers with identical prints locked around throats marked with identical lines The woman was trying to kill her but the woman was not real no more than the girl had been real she was a dream created by a falling brick but now the dream was real the dream was clawing her throat and trying to kill her as the gunslinger tried to save his friend The dreammadereal was screeching obscenities and raining hot spittle into her face I took the blue plate because that woman landed me in the hospital and besides Ididnt get no forspecial plate an I bust it cause it needed bustin an when I saw a white boy I could bust why I bust him too I hurt the white boys because they needed hurtin I stole from the stores that only sell things that are forspecial to whitefolks while the brothers and sisters go hungry in Harlem and the rats eat their babies Im the one you bitch Im the one I I I Kill her Odetta thought and knew she could not She could no more kill the hag and survive than the hag could kill her and walk away They could choke each other to death while Eddie and the RolandReally Bad Man one who had called them were eaten alive down there by the edge of the water That would finish all of them Or she could lovehate let go Odetta let go of Dettas throat ignored the fierce hands throttling her crushing her windpipe Instead of using her own hands to choke she used them to embrace the other No you bitch Detta screamed but that scream was infinitely complex both hateful and grateful N o you leave me lone you jes leave me   Odetta had no voice with which to reply As Roland kicked the first attacking lobstrosity away and as the second moved in to lunch on a chunk of Eddies arm she could only whisper in the witchwomans ear I love you For a moment the hands tightened into a killing noose  and then loosened Were gone She was being turned inside out again  and then suddenly blessedly she was whole For the first time since a man named Jack Mort had dropped a brick on the head of a child who was only there to be hit because a white taxi driver had taken one look and driven away and had not her father in his pride refused to try again for fear of a second refusal she was whole She was Odetta Holmes but the other   Hurry up bitch Detta yelled  but it was still her own voice she and Detta had merged She had been one she had been two now the gunslinger had drawn a third from her Hurry up or they gonna be dinner She looked at the shells There was no time to use them by the time she had his guns reloaded it would be over She could only hope But is there anything else she asked herself and drew And suddenly her brown hands were full of thunder  Eddie saw one of the lobstrosities loom over his face its rugose eyes dead yet hideously sparkling with hideous life Its claws descended toward his face Doda   it began and then it was smashed backward in chunks and splatters Roland saw one skitter toward his flailing left hand and thought There goes the other hand  and then the lobstrosity was a splatter of shell and green guts flying into the dark air He twisted around and saw a woman whose beauty was heart stopping whose fury was heartfreezing COME ON MAHFAHS she screamed YOU JUST COME ON YOU JUST COME FOR EM IM GONNA BLOW YO EYES RIGHT BACK THROUGH YO FUCKIN ASSHOLES She blasted a third one that was crawling rapidly between Eddies spraddled legs meaning to eat on him and neuter him at the same time It flew like a tiddlywink Roland had suspected they had some rudimentary intelligence now he saw the proof The others were retreating The hammer of one revolver fell on a dud and then she blew one of the retreating monsters into gobbets The others ran back toward the water even faster It seemed they had lost their appetite Meanwhile Eddie was strangling Roland fumbled at the rope digging a deep furrow into his neck He could see Eddies face melting slowly from purple to black Eddies strugglings were weakening Then his hands were pushed away by stronger ones Ill take care of it There was a knife in her hand  his knife Take care of what he thought as his consciousness faded What is it youll take care of now that were both at your mercy Who are you he husked as darkness deeper than night began to take him down I am three women he heard her say and it was as if she were speaking to him from the top of a deep well into which he was falling I who was I who had no right to be but was I am the woman who you have saved I thank you gunslinger She kissed him he knew that but for a long time after Roland knew only darkness FINAL SHUFFLE  For the first time in what seemed like a thousand years the gunslinger was not thinking about the Dark Tower  He thought only about the deer which had come down to the pool in the woodland clearing He sighted over the fallen log with his left hand Meat he thought and fired as saliva squirted warmly into his mouth Missed he thought in the millisecond following the shot Its gone All my skill gone The deer fell dead at the edge of the pool Soon the Tower would fill him again but now he only blessed what gods there were that his aim was still true and thought of meat and meat and meat He reholstered the gun  the only one he wore now  and climbed over the log behind which he had patiently lain as late afternoon drew down to dusk waiting for something big enough to eat to come to the pool Iam getting well he thought with some amazement as he drew his knife Iam really getting well He didnt see the woman standing behind him watching with assessing brown eyes  They had eaten nothing but lobstermeat and had drunk nothing but brackish stream water for six days following the confrontation at the end of the beach Roland remembered very little of that time he had been raving delirious He sometimes called Eddie Alain sometimes Cuthbert and always he called the woman Susan His fever had abated little by little and they began the laborious trek into the hills Eddie pushed the woman in the chair some of the time and sometimes Roland rode in it while Eddie carried her piggyback her arms locked loosely around his neck Most of the time the way made it impossible for either to ride and that made the going slow Roland knew how exhausted Eddie was The woman knew too but Eddie never complained They had food during the days when Roland lay between life and death smoking with fever reeling and railing of times long past and people long dead Eddie and the woman killed again and again and again Bye and bye the lobstrosities began staying away from their part of the beach but by then they had plenty of meat and when they at last got into an area where weeds and slutgrass grew all three of them ate compulsively of it They were starved for greens any greens And little by little the sores on their skins began to fade Some of the grass was bitter some sweet but they ate no matter what the taste  except once The gunslinger had wakened from a tired doze and seen the woman yanking at a handful of grass he recognized all too well No Not that he croaked Never that Mark it and remember it Never that She looked at him for a long moment and put it aside without asking for an explanation The gunslinger lay back cold with the closeness of it Some of the other grasses might kill them but what the woman had pulled would damn her It had been devilweed The Keflex had brought on explosions in his bowels and he knew Eddie had been worried about that but eating the grasses had controlled it Eventually they had reached real woods and the sound of the Western Sea diminished to a dull drone they heard only when the wind was right And now  meat  The gunslinger reached the deer and tried to gut it with the knife held between the third and fourth fingers of his right hand No good His fingers werent strong enough He switched the knife to his stupid hand and managed a clumsy cut from the deers groin to its chest The knife let out the steaming blood before it could congeal in the meat and spoil it  but it was still a bad cut A puking child could have done better You are going to learn to be smart he told his left hand and prepared to cut again deeper Two brown hands closed over his one and took the knife Roland looked around Ill do it Susannah said Have you ever No but youll tell me how All right Meat she said and smiled at him Yes he said and smiled back Meat Whats happening Eddie called I heard a shot Thanksgiving in the making she called back Come help Later they ate like two kings and a queen and as the gunslinger drowsed toward sleep looking up at the stars feeling the clean coolness in this upland air he thought that this was the closest he had come to contentment in too many years to count He slept And dreamed  It was the Tower The Dark Tower  It stood on the horizon of a vast plain the color of blood in the violent setting of a dying sun He couldnt see the stairs which spiraled up and up and up within its brick shell but he could see the windows which spiraled up along that staircases way and saw the ghosts of all the people he had ever known pass through them Up and up they marched and an arid wind brought him the sound of voices calling his name RolandcomeRolandcomecome come I come he whispered and awoke sitting bolt upright sweating and shivering as if the fever still held his flesh Roland Eddie Yes Bad dream Bad Good Dark The Tower Yes They looked toward Susannah but she slept on undisturbed Once there had been a woman named Odetta Susannah Holmes later there had been another named Detta Susannah Walker Now there was a third Susannah Dean Roland loved her because she would fight and never give in he feared for her because he knew he would sacrifice her  Eddie as well  without a question or a look back For the Tower The GodDamned Tower  Time for a pill Eddie said I dont want them anymore Take it and shut up Roland swallowed it with cold streamwater from one of the skins then burped He didnt mind It was a meaty burp Eddie asked Do you know where were going To the Tower Well yeah Eddie said but thats like me being some ignoramus from Texas without a roadmap saying hes going to Achin Asshole Alaska  Where is it Which direction Bring me my purse Eddie did Susannah stirred and Eddie paused his face red planes and black shadows in the dying embers of the campfire When she rested easy again he came back to Roland Roland rummaged in the purse heavy now with shells from that other world It was short enough work to find what he wanted in what remained of his life The jawbone The jawbone of the man in black Well stay here awhile he said and Ill get well Youll know when you are Roland smiled a little The shakes were abating the sweat drying in the cool night breeze But still in his mind he saw those figures those knights and friends and lovers and enemies of old circling up and up seen briefly in those windows and then gone he saw the shadow of the Tower in which they were pent struck black and long across a plain of blood and death and merciless trial I wont he said and nodded at Susannah But she will And then Roland held up the jawbone of Walter This once spoke He looked at Eddie It will speak again Its dangerous Eddies voice was flat Yes Not just to you No I love her man Yes If you hurt her   Ill do what I need to the gunslinger said And we dont matter Is that it I love you both The gunslinger looked at Eddie and Eddie saw that Rolands cheeks glistened red in what remained of the campfires embered dying glow He was weeping That doesnt answer the question Youll go on wont you Yes To the very end Yes To the very end No matter what Eddie looked at him with love and hate and all the aching dearness of one mans dying hopeless helpless reach for another mans mind and will and need The wind made the trees moan You sound like Henry man Eddie had begun to cry himself He didnt want to He hated to cry He had a tower too only it wasnt dark Remember me telling you about Henrys tower We were brothers and I guess we were gunslingers We had this White Tower and he asked me to go after it with him the only way he could ask so I saddled up because he was my brother you dig it We got there too Found the White Tower  But it was poison It killed him It would have killed me You saw me You saved more than my life You saved my fuckin soul Eddie held Roland and kissed his cheek Tasted his tears So what Saddle up again Go on and meet the man again The gunslinger said not a word I mean we havent seen many people but I know theyre up ahead and whenever theres a Tower involved theres a man You wait for the man because you gotta meet the man and in the end money talks and bullshit walks or maybe here its bullets instead of bucks that do the talking So is that it Saddle up Go to meet the man Because if its just a replay of the same old shitstorm you two should have left me for the lobsters Eddie looked at him with darkringed eyes I been dirty man If I found out anything its that I dont want to die dirty Its not the same No You gonna tell me youre not hooked Roland said nothing Whos gonna come through some magic door and save you man Do you know I do No one You drew all you could draw Only thing you can draw from now on is a fucking gun because thats all you got left Just like Balazar Roland said nothing You want to know the only thing my brother ever had to teach me His voice was hitching and thick with tears Yes the gunslinger said He leaned forward his eyes intent upon Eddies eyes He taught me if you kill what you love youre damned I am damned already Roland said calmly But perhaps even the damned may be saved Are you going to get all of us killed Roland said nothing Eddie seized the rags of Rolands shirt Are you going to get her killed We all die in time the gunslinger said Its not just the world that moves on He looked squarely at Eddie his faded blue eyes almost the color of slate in this light But we will be magnificent He paused Theres more than a world to win Eddie I would not risk you and her  I would not have allowed the boy to die  if that was all there was What are you talking about Everything there is the gunslinger said calmly We are going to go Eddie We are going to fight We are going to be hurt And in the end we will stand Now it was Eddie who said nothing He could think of nothing to say Roland gently grasped Eddies arm Even the damned love he said  Eddie eventually slept beside Susannah the third Roland had drawn to make a new three but Roland sat awake and listened to voices in the night while the wind dried the tears on his cheeks Damnation Salvation The Tower He would come to the Dark Tower and there he would sing their names there he would sing their names there he would sing all their names The sun stained the east a dusky rose and at last Roland no longer the last gunslinger but one of the last three slept and dreamed his angry dreams through which there ran only that one soothing blue thread There I will sing all their names  AFTERWORD This completes the second of six or seven books which make up a long tale called TheDarkTower The third The Waste Lands details half of the quest of Roland Eddie and Susannah to reach the Tower the fourth Wizard and Glass tells of an enchantment and a seduction but mostly of those things which befell Roland before his readers first met him upon the trail of the man in black My surprise at the acceptance of the first volume of this work which is not at all like the stories for which I am best known is exceeded only by my gratitude to those who have read it and liked it This work seems to be my own Tower you know these people haunt me Roland most of all Do I really know what that Tower is and what awaits Roland there should he reach it and you must prepare yourself for the very real possibility that he will not be the one to do so Yes  and no All I know is that the tale has called to me again and again over a period of seventeen years This longer second volume still leaves many questions unanswered and the storys climax far in the future but I feel that it is a much more complete volume than the first And the Tower is closer Stephen King December st
